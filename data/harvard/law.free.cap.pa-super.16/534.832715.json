L. 145, was not merely aimed at the carrying on of business by an insolvent bank, but it dealt with specific acts and measured the punishment, in part, by the amount of money obtained by the offender as the result of each specific violation. A banker who under the forbidden conditions, receives deposits from two or more different persons, upon the same day, is guilty of two or more separate and distinct offenses. An indictment charging such unlawful receipt of money from A. would not be supported by proof of such a receipt of money from B. Neither a conviction nor an acquittal, upon such an indictment, charging a deposit to have been made by one person, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution charging a distinct deposit made by another person.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-7\"><em>Practice, Q. 8. </em>\u2014 Pleading\u2014Plea <em>in bar </em>\u2014 Demurrer.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-8\">On demurrer to a plea in bar the court will consider the whole record, and give judgment for the party who, on the whole, appears to be entitled thereto.

That is to say, defendant avers that he was found not guilty of receiving the deposits in said indictment mentioned, notwithstanding the deposits were proved to have been made .on'other different days than that mentioned in the indictment, to wit, March 12, 1898, provided they were made within two years from the finding of said indictment. And the defendant further avers that on the said trial, he, the defendant, admitted that he was a banker for more than two years prior to the finding of said indictment, and that all of the deposits charged in said indictment to have been received by him, were received by him as bank deposits, and that he, the defendant, on the said trial, denied only that within the two years prior to the finding of the said indictment, he or the said bank was at any time insolvent, and also denied that at any time within the two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>prior to the finding of the said indictment, he had knowledge of his insolvency, or of the insolvency of the said bank.

M. Gray, to the case on trial in presence of one of the jurors sitting on said case, the court asked the district attorney to bring the matter before the court by a reference to the same that the court might further caution the jury generally against all outside influences, and in particular instruct any juror or jurors at said hotel to utterly disregard and lay aside anything that may have been said at said hotel aforesaid, if anything was said, about the case in his presence; this Gaution and instruction was given the jury, for which purpose alone the matter was referred to in open court \u2014 no reference being made as to whether the said Wm.

A. Well, I had no knowledge as to whether they had any value at the time of the assignment or not; I know that it was one of the items as to which I made an investigation since the assignment and endeavored to ascertain\u2014 Q. When did you make your investigation ? A. Well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>I can\u2019t give you the date; it is too much to do, to remember in my own head, very well, without the papers, what it was; I am not able to say whether it was before the last account was settled, or not, with certainty, but I inquired of a gentleman whose name appeared on the certificates as the secretary of the company; I found his name was there on the stock, and I went to him to find out about the condition of the company; his name was Elliot Rogers, I think; I am not sure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">Objected to as incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">\u201c Q.

From the information \u2014 he is the only person of whom I made any inquiry I believe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-8\">Objected to as incompetent; that is not the way to prove values.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-9\">The Court: As a result of his investigation did he learn; did he make his investigation as attorney for the assignees ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\">Witness: \u201cYes, sir, I did.

Where does Rogers live ? A. He is a very prominent attorney at Pittsburg, and is city solicitor of Allegheny City; his office is in, you might say, the same building as my own; it is in another part of it. Q.

Yes, sir. Q. And it is also stated here a one-third interest in twenty-five building lots ? A. Well, that is a mistake, it is a one-fifth interest in fourteen building lots, Mr. Hazlett had a one-fifth interest. Q. He owns fourteen outright and the one-fifth interest in fourteen additional, is that correct? A. Yes, sir, that is correct. Q. Mr. Dickson, were you acquainted with the market value of those lots on the 12th of March, or in March, 1898 ? A. Well, only by information which I had received through our agent in Rapid City. Q. State whether or not \u2014 state who had charge of the business here of the company. A. Why, I had charge of it, when the taxes were due, I would get it from the others; I would obtain their proportion of it and send it on to the party at Rapid City, and they would pay the tax and send the receipts, and at that time we would have communications with regard to the property and its value, etc. Q. You had charge of the business here? A. Yes, sir, I had. Q. State whether or not you communicated the information you had to the defendant. A.

They made up a statement of the amount from this and the books of the bank and records, which shows liabilities of the defendant March 12, 1898, the date of the deposit in this case, after eliminating many worthless notes and accounts, as testified to be uncollectible by one of the assignees, which statement and appraisement showed the defendant\u2019s liabilities to be many thousands of dollars in excess of his assets at the date of the closing of the bank.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-10\">[Mr. Parker: I want to call the attention of the court to a matter. I understand the court, in the beginning of its charge, to mention the fact of a statement having been made of the liabilities of the defendant; I think the word \u201c liabilities \u201d probably was used where another word was intended.

White and Little who proposed to purchase the \u201cLinn\u201d and \u201c Taylor \u201d properties and the \u201c Hamilton \u201d farm at the defendant\u2019s own price, paying for the same with the certificates of deposit these purchasers held on the defendant in large amounts, and had collected from some others, at their face value, and the balance in cash or deposit balances, when these certificates of deposit on this closed bank were then, some selling and others offered for sale, at from fifty cents to seventy-five cents on the dollar; and if this is found by you to be the case, then under all the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s testimony as well, their estimates of values are not founded on the proper basis and the values of these three pieces of property would not be greater, in fact, than the value placed thereon by the commonwealth; and all this affects the values placed on the whole of the defendant\u2019s property by himself and son, and all other of his witnesses testifying to values not based on fair market values; and that you should have no trouble in coming to the conclusion that the defendant was insolvent on March 12, 1898.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">[Mr. Bane: I understand your honor to say, in the course of the charge, that it was claimed by the commonwealth that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>those witnesses who testified as to value were friends of the defendant and probably or possibly interested in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">The Court: That is the claim of the commonwealth as to some of them; they are all not to be so considered, gentlemen of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">Mr. Bane: I believe your honor named some of them. We wish to call the attention of the court to the fact that there was no evidence that any of these witnesses were related to the defendant in any way; there was no evidence, as we claim, that they were particular friends of the defendant; some of them were his heaviest depositors, and men who might have been prejudiced against him, and men like Mr. McClane\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">The Court: Our recollection is that some of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, when testifying to values they placed on certain pieces of the defendant\u2019s real estate, on cross-examination admitted they were friends of the defendant; another, perhaps, that he was a depositor when the bank closed, but the defendant paid him in full. Mr. Little and Mr. White were heavy depositors and got no preference, except as they were to take valuable pieces of the defendant\u2019s real estate at his own price under an arrangement with him to pay his price in certificates of deposit and deposit balances, which certificates of deposit they then held were worth, as the commonwealth claims they have shown, were then worth but fifty cents on the dollar. The testimony of Mr. M. W. McClane, to which the defendant calls our attention, was as to the value of the Hamilton farm. He put it at $125 an acre, but he said that is what he thought it worth, he thought it ought to bring that, but he did not say that was its value in the real estate market at a fair open sale, and he did not fix his estimate from the basis of a market value. You, gentlemen of the jury, will recall what this witness said, as well what testimony all the witnesses gave on the question of values, and all other questions in the case, and determine the weight to be given to the testimony of each witness called. That is entirely for you. We have only endeavored to state to you the claims as to it on the one side and the other. Keep in mind that the true test of values always is the market value, and not what any particular witness might think it was worth to him or what he would ask for it, if that opinion is not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>upon the market value where there is shown to be a market value.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">Yerdict of guilty, upon which the court sentenced the defendant to pay the costs of prosecution, a fine of 1777.08, double the amount embezzled, and to undergo imprisonment for a period of one year and six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1, 2) in sustaining demurrer to plea.

D. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The purpose of the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 145, was to protect all depositors, or intended depositors, from imposition by bankers who, knowing the bank to be insolvent, continued to receive deposits. The act made unlawful is to \u201c take and receive money from a depositor with the knowledge that .... the bank is at the time insolvent,\u201d and a part of the punishment prescribed is \u201c a fine in double the amount so received.\u201d This legislation was not merely aimed at the carrying on of business by an insolvent bank, but it dealt with specific acts and measured the punishment, in part, by the amount of money obtained by the offender as the result of each specific violation. A banker, who, under the forbidden conditions, receives deposits from two or more different persons, upon the same day, is guilty of two or more separate and distinct offenses. An indictment charging such unlawful receipt of money from A would not be supported by proof of such a receipt of money from B. Neither a conviction nor an acquittal, upon such an indictment, charging a deposit to have been made by one person, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution charging a distinct deposit made by another person: Commonwealth v. Rockafellow, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 588. The special plea in bar interposed by the appellant at the trial, had subsequently to the former appeal in this case, relied upon the same record which we held, in Commonwealth v. Hazlett, 14 Pa. Superior Ct. 353, not to constitute a bar to the present prosecution. As to the inefficacy of that record to protect the defendant nothing can be profitably added to the opinion of President Judge Rice, who spoke for the court upon the former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">It is contended that a different question is now presented, for the reason that the plea last filed, while still based upon the same record, contains further averments. It has been argued, with great ability, that, the commonwealth having demurred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the plea, the averments in addition to the record are to be taken as true. On demurrer to a plea in bar the court will consider the whole record, and give judgment for the party who, on the whole, appears to be entitled thereto : Murphy v. Richards, 5 W. &amp; S. 279; Heikes v. The Commonwealth, 26 Pa. 513. Whether the former acquittal was for the same offense depends upon the record pleaded, and not on the argument or inference deduced therefrom. The plea averred the offense to have been the same, but the effect of this was to change the record, and the record must stand: Commonwealth v. Trimmer, 84 Pa. 65. Upon the trial of the issue formed by the record pleaded in bar the burden was upon the commonwealth to prove that the defendant had, as a banker, and knowing himself to be insolvent, received a deposit from one J. Clark Allen. A failure to prove a deposit by Allen must have resulted in a determination of the issue adversely to the commonwealth. The evidence necessary to a conviction in the present prosecution would not have been sufficient to convict of the offense charged in the record pleaded in bar. The defendant in the plea now presented seeks to avoid this rule by averring that upon the trial of the former indictment he admitted that he had, as a fact, been a banker, and, as such, received from Allen the deposits charged in the indictment, and that, therefore, the only question of fact passed upon by the jury in that case was the insolvency of the defendant and his knowledge thereof. Here, again, the averments came into collision with the record, which was the cornerstone of the plea in bar. The record showed a plea of not guilty and the general issue, under which the jury must, in some manner, be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Allen had made a deposit in the bank. If the defendant went upon the witness stand and made admissions, those admissions were evidence to be considered by the jury, but they were not conclusive. Allen may have gone upon the stand and testified that he had never made such a deposit. The jury might have been convinced that the defendant was not mentally responsible at the time he testified. It may have been clearly established that, although the deposit was made, it was not received with fraudulent intent and was returned to the depositor, or that the defendant had fully informed Allen as to the condition of the bank. The fact still remained one for the jury to pass upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>under the issue. It cannot be said that the verdict of the jury did not turn upon that very question. The first and second specifications of error are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The motion of the defendant to dismiss the jury and continue the cause on account of occurrences which resulted from' the alleged talking about the case by one Gray, in the presence of a juror, raised a question in disposing of which the court below was vested with discretionary powers. An appellate court will not reverse upon such a question, unless an abuse of discretion be distinctly charged and clearly established. There does not appear to have been any abuse of discretion by the learned judge of the court below. The same principle applies to a refusal to continue a cause upon the ground of the absence of a witness. The third, fourth and fifth assignments of error are not sustained. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The sixth and seventh specifications of error are based upon a slip of the court in stating the evidence. The attention of the court having been called to this matter, the mistake was corrected and the defendant was not thereby injured. If the facts stated in the language of the court which is the subject of the eighth assignment of error were found by the jury, they constitute sufficient evidence to justify a finding that the defendant was insolvent, and this specification is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The ninth specification assigns for error a single sentence, covering two pages of printed matter, contained in the charge of the learned court below. A page and a half of this sentence recites the theory of the commonwealth, and the contention of the counsel for the prosecution as to the force and effect of the evidence of the commonwealth and the weakness and incredibility of the testimony offered by the defendant, and seems to fairly state what had been the contention of such counsel. The difficulty comes in the concluding part of the sentence, where the court instructed the jury as to the effect of the incompetency of the testimony of two witnesses of the defendant upon all the other evidence produced by him. The court had just recited the allegation of the commonwealth as to the testimony of the witnesses White and Little; that those witnesses had based their \u25a0 evidence as to the value of three pieces of real estate not upon the market value, but upon what they proposed to pay for the property in certificates of deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of the defendant bank, which were then selling and being offered for sale at from fifty to seventy-five cents upon the dollar of their face value. In immediate connection with this reference to the testimony of Little and White, the court said: \u201cAnd if this is found by you to be the case, then, under all the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s testimony, the estimates of value are not founded upon the proper basis and the values of these three pieces of property would not be greater, in fact, than the value placed thereon by the commonwealth ; all of this affects the values placed on the whole of the defendant\u2019s property by himself and son, and all other of his witnesses testifying to values not based on fair market values ; and that you should have no trouble in coming to the conclusion that the defendant was insolvent on March 12, 1898.\u201d This was, in effect, saying to the jury that if the testimony of White and Little as to the value of that real estate was based upon what they would have paid for it in depreciative certificates, that fact vitiated the testimony of the defendant, and all the other witnesses of the defendant, not only as to the value of the three specific properties, but.as to that of the whole of the defendant\u2019s property. Even if the testimony of White and Little as to the values was not based upon market value, the jury were not bound to accept the opinions of the witnesses for the commonwealth. It was for the jury to determine what the property was worth, in view of its character, condition and location, and the opinions of those who were supposed to have an expert knowledge upon the subject were offered as evidence to be considered by the jury in arriving at their conclusion. The competency of the witnesses to testify as experts is supposed to have been settled when their testimony was offered. The ninth specification of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In that part of the charge embraced by the tenth assignment of error we find this language : \u201c The testimony of Mr. M. W. McClane, to which the defendant calls our attention, was as to the value of the Hamilton farm. He put it at $125 an acre, but he said that is what he thought it worth. He thought it ought to bring that, but he did not say that was its value in the real estate market at a fair open sale, and he didn\u2019t fix his estimate from the basis of a market value.\u201d A careful reading of the testimony of the witness in question leads us to a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>sion different from that at which the learned court below arrived. The witness did say that he was acquainted with the market value of farm land in that community in March, 1898. He was asked what was the fair market value of that particular farm, at that time; he was permitted to answer the question without objection. His answer was: <em>\u201c </em>I should think it worth $125 per acre.\u201d Yet the learned judge of -the court below said to the jury that this witness did not fix his estimate from the basis of a market value. The jury had already been told, in that part of the charge considered under the ninth specification of error, that such evidence not founded upon market value was not upon the proper basis, and, practically, that the jury were to disregard it. Considering these instructions, in the light of each other, the jury must have concluded that the court intended to say to them that the testimony of McClane was not worthy of consideration. \u201c The value of an expert\u2019s opinion may be fortified on the one hand or reduced on the other by an examination as to his general experience, his means of knowledge in the particular case, and the facts and reasons on which he bases his conclusion. It is a matter of opinion at best, and the lowest grade of evidence that comes into a court of justice. It is permissible only because, bad as it is, there is nothing better.attainable. Opinions as to the value of real estate are apt to differ, and their value is not always in proportion to the confidence with which they are advanced: \u201d Dawson v. Pittsburg, 159 Pa. 317. The only competent evidence as to the value of the farm in question, which had been introduced upon either side, consisted of the opinions of witnesses, as to the market value of the land, based upon the selling price of land of like character in the vicinity; that is, what the witnesses, respectively, thought the land would bring in the market. This was, in every case, a mere matter of opinion, and the value of the opinion was for the jury. A witness who has no knowledge upon the subject of market value, derived from the prices at which lands are held and sold in the vicinity, is not competent to testify as an expert on such a question. The tenth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The eleventh assignment of error is without merit. A banker whose business is managed by others may be deceived as to the true condition of his affairs, and be insolvent without knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>it. His knowledge of his insolvency is an essential element in the offense with which this defendant was charged. It was proper to permit the witness, R. S. Winters, who had been one of the appraisers of the insolvent estate, when confronted with the appraisement which he had made, to make an explanation as to the manner in which they had arrived at the values of the property appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In the ruling which is complained of in the thirteenth specification, we are convinced that the learned judge of the court below fell into error. The witness was called for the purpose of proving the value of certain stock, and candidly admitted that he knew nothing about the value of the stock at the time of the assignment. He said that he had made an investigation subsequently to the assignment. It would clearly have been competent to permit this witness to state to the jury what properties were owned by the corporation, and, if he knew, the value thereof; the liabilities of the company, and, if he had personal knowledge thereof, the condition of its affairs. The witness did not pretend to any expert knowledge which made him more competent than any member of the jury to form an intelligent opinion upon the facts. The witness was permitted to testify, under objection, that he had had an interview with Elliott Rogers, Esq., who was the secretary of the mining company,.and from that interview he had arrived at the conclusion that the stock was worthless. There was no evidence that Mr. Rogers had any knowledge of the properties owned by the company, or of the value thereof. The secretary of a corporation does not, necessarily, know the value of its properties. This stock was not one dealt in on the open market. Mr. Rogers would not have been permitted to testify, as to the value of the stock, without first showing that he had personal knowledge of the condition of the affairs of the corporation. The evidence shows that Mr. Rogers was within the reach of the subpoena of the court. If his knowledge was to be made available for the prosecution in this case, the defendant was entitled to cross-examine him as to the extent of his knowledge, before he could have been permitted to give an opinion as to the value of the stock. Yet the learned court below permitted the witness called to give an opinion founded upon the opinion of another person not called, without any attempt whatever to show that either the witness or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>his informant had any knowledge which rendered either of them competent to testify as to their opinion of the value of the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The evidence which is the subject of the fourteenth specification was properly admitted. The witness was permitted to testify to the facts which he himself had communicated to the defendant prior to the alleged commission of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The fifteenth specification is equally without merit. When a witness has been permitted to testify as an expert as to the values of real estate, a reasonable latitude is allowed for cross-examination, in order that the jury may be fully informed as to the facts upon which the opinion of the expert is based and the processes of reasoning by which he arrives at the conclusion given.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
