The case came on and testimony was taken on February 4, 1899, and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>quently argued by counsel of the respective parties, and it is now to be determined on both answer and proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">FACTS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">The court finds the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">1. That on or about November 3, 1894, T. S. Bailey, A. G. Hoovler and W. A. Egbert petitioned the burgess and town council of Sandy Lake borough to grant them permission to lay pipes through and along the streets and alleys of Sandy Lake borough for the purpose of supplying natural gas to the inhabitants of said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">[2. That at a regular meeting of the town council of said borough at which were present John E. Giebner, burgess, I. G. Harrison, chairman, S. F. Newkirk, J. C. Feathers, Geo. E. Patton and A. G. Hoovler, council, held at the regular place of meeting, on November 3, 1894, permission and authority were granted to said petitioners, Bailey, Hoovler and Egbert, and their assigns, to lay pipes through the streets of said borough, as prayed for, and was embodied in a resolution which was unanimously adopted, and of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-9\">\u201c Resolved to grant Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert, their heirs and assigns, the privilege of laying pipe through, along or across such streets and alleys of Sandy Lake borough as they may desire to do for the purpose of supplying patrons with natural gas; also the privilege of repairing or making connections, provided they cover the pipe at all streets and crossings for the protection of their pipes and the traveling public; also that they hold themselves liable for any accident that may occur through their neglect, and furnish natural gas for twenty street lights free while gas is furnished patrons; said lights to be ordinary jets burned under glass and are to be turned out each morning, and such jets as are ordinarily used for street lights and not to be burned in the daytime; said lights are to be placed at such points in Sandy Lake borough as the burgess and council may designate and on such streets as pipe is laid. It is further provided that said Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert, their heirs and assigns, shall not charge consumers of gas in Sandy Lake borough a price in excess of $3.00 net per month for what are known as mixers, and $2.50 per month for what are known as mixers. Also that Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to commence laying pipe for the purpose of supplying patrons with natural gas in Sandy Lake borough within three months and prosecute the same with due diligence, or this resolution is to be null and void and of no effect whatever.\u201d] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">3. That after the said resolution was adopted as aforesaid the said Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert accepted the terms of the same and at their request the time to begin and lay pipes in accordance with the terms of said resolution was extended from time to time, and they did begin, within the time limited by the last extension, to lay their gas pipes and mains in the streets and alleys of said borough, under the terms and authority of said resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">4. That prior to February 28,1896, the said Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert had laid their gas mains along the principal streets of said borough and had connected at least six street lamps with their \u2019said gas mains, and were furnishing gas for said street lamps of said borough free of charge, under the terms of said resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\">[5. That in February, 1896, the said A. G. Hoovler, T. S. Bailey and W. A. Egbert, having associated with them M. L. Kelly and I. M. Patterson, entered into articles of association to obtain a charter for their company under the name and style of the Sandy Lake and Stoneboro Gas Company, under and in pursuance of the act of assembly of May 29, 1886, providing for the incorporation of natural gas companies, and on February 28, 1896, applied to the governor of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to grant them letters patent and incorporate them and their successors under the name and style aforesaid, which letters patent were granted March 2, 1896.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">[6. That after letters patent had been granted incorporating the said parties and their successors as aforesaid, the corporation connected thirteen more street lamps in the said borough with its street mains and began to furnish gas to said borough for said street lamps free of charge, and continued to furnish gas to the street lamps that had been connected up prior to the date of said incorporation and those connected by it after that date, in all nineteen street lamps, down to the date of August 55 1898, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said resolution of the town council of November 3,1894, free of charge, excepting a specific bill of $10.00 presented by said corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to the town council during the year 1897, for gas burned in the street lamps in daytime, which bill the town council paid.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">7. That the lamps, posts, pipes, stopcocks and saddles connecting the street lamps with the gas mains of the said corporation were paid for by and were the property of the borough of Sandy Lake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">[8. That the said borozzglz of Sandy Lake has- never in any way rescinded or repudiated the resolution of the town council passed on November 3, 1894, under the authority of which the gas mains were laid in the streets of the said borough, and has always complied with the terms of the said resolution so far as the said borough was bound to observe and comply with the same, except the occasional burning of gas in the street lamps in daylight through inadvertence or oversight or by unwarranted interference of outsiders.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">9. That on August 5, 1898, the said corporation by its officers and employees turned the gas off from the street lamps in said borough, and refused to furnish any more gas to the said borough under the terms of the said resolution; that the borough, acting through its proper officers, turned the gas on, and that thereupon the said corporation by its officers and employees, against the positive direction of the borough authorities, disconnected the pipes of the borough leading from the gas mains to the street lamps, and since then have refused to furnish gas under the terms of said resolution to the said borough for their street lamps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">10. That the defendant corporation is ready and willing and has offered to furnish gas to the borough on condition that the borough will pay for the gas consumed by said street lamps at the usual rates for gas furnished to their consumers, but refuses to furnish it free of cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">11. That A. Gr. Hoovler, one of the persons named in the said resolution whereby permission was granted to Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert, and their assigns, to lay pipes through the streets of said borough, was, at the time of the passage of said resolution, a member of the council of said boz\u2019ough and was present at the meeting of said council and voted for said resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-10\">12.

That the aforesaid resolution referred to in the second finding of fact was not signed by the burgess nor attested by the secretary, nor was any notice by advertisement either in a newspaper or by handbills given of the same, but the minutes of the council of November 3, 1894, shows that the said resolution was copied in full in the said minutes, and that the said minutes were signed by the secretary.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The court entered a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\"><em>jErrors assigned </em>were (1-5) above findings of fact, quoting them; (11) in holding that plaintiffs were entitled to decree prayed for in the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-7\"><em>W.

Jackson Farm Gas Co., 186 Pa. 443.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Avn\">W. D. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The defendant did not, by the pleadings, raise the question of the regularity of the incorporation of the plaintiff borough, and it was proper for the learned court below to take judicial notice of the existence of the municipal and quasi-municipal corporations into which the county within its jurisdiction was, for purposes of local government, subdivided: Pearce v. Lang-fit, 101 Pa. 507. The borough had power to lay gas pipes under its streets for the purpose of supplying gas for lighting the streets, and for the use of citizens, and it was competent for it to exercise that power in favor of private citizens, by granting a license to do the same thing: Wood v. McGrath, 150 Pa. 451. In case the borough granted such a license and imposed conditions and duties upon the right to exercise the same, an acceptance of the grant by the licensees constitutes a contract that, while they operated under the license, the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tions would be observed and the duties performed: Allegheny v. People\u2019s Natural Gas and Pipeage Company, 172 Pa. 632. Where such licensees enter under the grant and continue to enjoy the fruits thereof, they cannot set up as a defense to the performance of the conditions, that the contract was ultra vires. The law never sustains the defense of ultra vires out of regard for the defendant, but only when an imperative rule of public policy requires it: Wright v. The Antwerp Pipe Line Company, 101 Pa. 204. \u201c A man who has enjoyed a privilege has no right to say that, because he ought not to have enjoyed it, he will not pay for it:\u201d Northampton County\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 305. Those who succeed to the rights of the original grantees of the license and continue to exercise such rights are equally bound to perform the conditions: Northampton County\u2019s Appeal, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">It may be conceded that the resolution of the borough council granting to the original licensees the right to lay gas pipes in the streets, was defective and not binding upon the borough, for the reason that it was not approved by the burgess. The borough authorities, or any owner of property abutting upon the street, might have caused the licensees to be restrained from exercising the rights supposed to have been conferred by the defective resolution. The licensees were at liberty to decline to proceed to the performance of any act, or the expenditure of any money, upon the faith of the invalid resolution, but they could not proceed to exercise all the rights which would have been theirs had the resolution been valid, and, under a pretended acceptance of the grant, subject to the conditions, take possession of the borough streets, and, having complied with all the conditions during the time they were piping the streets and for a considerable period thereafter, decline to perform the conditions, while still insisting upon enjoying the fruits of the defective grant: Northampton County\u2019s Appeal, supra. The learned judge of the court below, upon sufficient evidence, found the following facts : \u201cThat after the said resolution was adopted, as aforesaid, the said Hoovler, Bailey and Egbert accepted the terms of the same, and at their request, the time to begin laying pipes in accordance with the terms of said resolution was extended, from time to time, and they did begin, within the time limited by the last extension, to lay their gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>pipes and mains in the streets and. alleys of said borough, under the terms and authority of said resolution. That prior to February 28, 1896, they liad laid their gas mains along the principal street of said borough, and had connected at least six street lamps with their said gas mains and were furnishing gas for said street lamps of said borough free of charge, under the terms of said resolution. That in February, 1896, the said Iioovler, Bailey and Egbert, having associated with them M. L. Kerr and I.\u2019 M. Patterson, entered into articles of association to obtain a charter for their company, under the name and style of the Sandy Lake &amp; Stoneboro Gas Company, under and in pursuance of the act of assembly of May 29, 1885, providing for the incorporation of natural gas companies, and on February 28,1896, applied to the governor of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to grant them letters patent and incorporate them and their successors under the name and style aforesaid,' which letters patent were granted March 4, 1896. That after letters patent had been granted incorporating the said parties and their successors, as aforesaid, the corporation connected thirteen more street lamps in the said borough with its street mains, and began to furnish gas to said borough for said street lamps free of charge, and continued to furnish gas to the street lamps that had been connected up prior to the date of said incorporation, and those connected with it after their incorporation, in all nineteen street lamps, down to August 5, 1898, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said resolution of the town council of November 3, 1894, free of charge, excepting a specific bill of $10.00 presented by said corporation to the town council during the year 1897, for gas burned in the street lamps in daytime, which bill the town council paid.\u201d When the private citizens who had been the original licensees thus formed a corporation, that corporation merely succeeded to the rights and property of the licensees, and took the same burdened with all the conditions and duties to which they were subject. The defendant corporation recognized this fact and connected its gas lines with the street lamps, and for a considerable period furnished gas to the street lamps, in accordance with the terms of the defective resolution, under a pretended acceptance of which their predecessors under the license had obtained possession of the streets. Having thus obtained possession of the streets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the borough under circumstances which plainly indicated to the parties and all the citizens of the borough that they recognized their obligation to maintain the street lamps, they now propose to retain possession of said streets without discharging the duties which they pretended to assume. They are at liberty to abandon the streets at any time, but while they insist upon enjoying the fruits of the defective ordinance, they cannot he permitted to set up their own wrong in order to retain the privilege, while refusing to perform the accompanying duty: Wright v. Pipe Line Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Apart from these considerations, however, we must hold the defendant hound to perform the acts commanded by the decree of the learned court below, upon another ground: The borough clearly had authority to enter into the contract which is here sought to be enforced, and, having that authority, it had power by a subsequent ratification to make valid the contract based upon the defective resolution by which the license was originally granted: City of Phila. v. Hays, 93 Pa. 72; Silsby Mfg. Co. v. Allentown, 153 Pa. 319. It is not necessary that such ratification should be by a formal ordinance; the acceptance of the fruits of the contract, and the formal assertion in a judicial proceeding of a claim founded upon it are sufficient: Amberson Avenue, 179 Pa. 634; Shiloh Street, 165 Pa. 386. That the borough has ratified the contract is evident from the fact that it is now here endeavoring to enforce this claim: Harrisburg v. Shepler, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at costs of the appellant, without prejudice to the right of the defendant to withdraw its pipe lines from the streets of the borough at any time.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b273-7\">William W. Porter,</author>\n<p id=\"A56\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s bill is founded upon a piece of borough legislation, in form a resolution. The resolution grants to certain private persons the .right to lay pipes upon the public streets to supply patrons with natural gas. The consideration for the right attempted to be conferred is the requirement that gas for twenty street lights, for public lighting, shall be furnished free, at designated points within the borough. Such legislation, if validly enacted and accepted, would create a contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the parties. But nothing short of legislation enacted in compliance with the requirements of the law would suffice, since the act attempted is legislative, not ministerial. While legislation by borough councils may be by ordinance or resolution, yet the requirements which are essential to the validity of an ordinance must be observed in the passage, approval, recording and publication of resolutions where the action of councils is legislative: Howard v. Borough of Olyphant, 181 Pa. 198. Herein the resolution before us fails, in that it was not advertised, nor was it signed by the burgess, as required by the act of 1851. See Commonwealth v. Diamond National Bank, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 118. The borough now files a bill praying for a decree of specific performance. It asks that the defendants be compelled to furnish the free lights stipulated for in the resolution. If the resolution be regarded as covering only ministerial action by the borough, then no foundation can be found in it to sustain the bill, for no contract was thereby created. If it be held to be the basis of a contractual relation, whereby both the borough and the grantees of the right are bound to the performance of obligation, then was th.e action legislative and void, because not fulfilling the requirements of law in its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The record shows the passage -of no legislation by the borough subsequent to the original resolution, ratifying the latter or accepting the benefits or assuming the obligations covered by it. The filing of the bill by the law officer of the municipality does not appear to have been directed by borough ordinance. Without the aid of such a direction, his act could not remedy the defects in the passage of the original resolution or give it the effect of a legally enacted ordinance. The acts of the parties do not help out the transaction by ratification. True, there was ah entry upon the streets and the free lighting was for some time furnished and accepted. This was not such an adoption by the borough of the provisions of the resolution as converted the privilege in the hands of the original parties (and the defendant company, their successors) into a right to continue the exercise of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">There is nothing in the course taken to prevent the borough from requiring the defendants to vacate the streets at any time. To invoke the provisions of the resolution as an estoppel would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>be useless. It would be answered that municipalities can incur liability only by proceeding in accordance with law; that those dealing with them are charged with the duty of seeing that the law is observed; and that the resolution was void. Here, if the borough is entitled to the relief prayed for, a contract must be shown. A contract involves reciprocal obligation. As the resolution fails to confer upon the defendants a right to use the streets, it also fails to confer upon the borough the right to insist upon the furnishing of free lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It is to be observed that the original resolution attempted to give to certain individuals the right to lay pipes upon the borough streets, and that the defendant company was, a considerable time thereafter, erected by the individuals named and certain other persons. The evidence is that the formation of the corporation was not in contemplation when the resolution was passed. The company, however, did succeed to the property, privileges and burdens of the original holders, whatever they were. The only authority of the company to be upon the streets is to be found in the defective resolution of November 3, 1894. This, therefore, is not the case of a corporation organized under the act of May 29, 1885, with right of eminent domain, procuring in first instance, the \u201c assent\u201d of the borough to the laying of pipes. It is not determined by cases decided under that act. The company is here only as successors to such right as the resolution of November 3, 1894, conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">My opinion is that no contractual relation is exhibited by the bill and proofs, upon which a decree for specific performance can be rested. Doubtless the borough has the right to protection against the use of her streets by the defendant company. A forum in which such protection may be had is not wanting. It is not, however, a court of chancery. I would reverse the decree and dismiss the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
