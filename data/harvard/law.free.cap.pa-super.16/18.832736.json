Another by-law gave the managers the power to change any by-law so long as their action was not repugnant to the charter. Plaintiff owned jjersonal property which he had insured in the mutual company. He removed this property to another township and placed it in a mill which was insured by its owner. The insurance on the mill and its contents amounted in the aggregate to more than $6,000. When the goods were removed, plaintiff submitted his policy to one of the managers, who was also the general agent of the defendant company, who had knowledge of the facts, and returned the policy to him, with an indorsement, showing knowledge on the part of the company of the removal of the property attested by the secretary.

Before Swartz, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">At the trial a verdict of $295.05 was rendered in favor of plaintiff subject to the question of the law reserved, whether under all the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover. On a motion for judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, Swartz, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">George Kremer had his mill buildings insured in the defendant company. The mill was destroyed December 20, 1898. At the time of the fire Mr. Kremer\u2019s insurance was $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">The plaintiff, George H. Shoemaker, was the owner of some personal goods and insured them in the defendant company. At the time his policy was issued, the property was located in Upper Salford township. In 1887 the plaintiff became the tenant of the Kremer mill, -which was located in Perkiomen township. The plaintiff placed his personal property in the Kremer mill. He handed the policy to Abraham G. Schwenk, a director or manager of the defendant company, for the purpose of having the removal approved. Mr. Schwenk took the policy to the secretary of the company for its assent to the removal of the goods. The secretary indorsed on the policy as follows: \u201c Property removed to Perkiomen township, Montg. Co., Pa. Attest: William H. Price, Sec\u2019y.\u201d This approval was noted on the policy in 1887. The plaintiff\u2019s insurance at the time of the fire in 1898 was $3,620. Of this sum $3,000 apparently covered the plaintiff\u2019s contents of the mill, so that the mill building and the contents were insured in the defendant company for $7,000 at the time of the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ2\">The plaintiff paid his assessments for fire losses from 1887, the time the property was placed in the mill, to 1899. The assessments were computed on the full insurance of $3,620.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\">The fire loss on the mill building was appraised at $3,600, and the same committee appraised the plaintiff\u2019s loss on contents at $2,678.61. When the report was brought \u201c before the board it was passedbut afterwards the company refused to pay the plaintiff more than $2,400, because it claimed that the liability for building and contents could not exceed $6,000. Mr. Kremer was paid his $3,600 in full; and this, with the $2,400 paid the plaintiff, aggregates $6,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-9\">The company relies on article 3 of the by-laws for refus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ing to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u2014 the full $2,678.61. This bylaw reads as follows: \u201cBuildings and. other property located in Bucks and Montgomery counties, not excluded by the charter nor by this article of the by-laws, may be insured for their actual cash value. But this company shall not be liable for a greater amount on any one building and the contents thereof than 16,000, whether such contents were in such building at the time of the insurance or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">We instructed the jury that if the defendant company had no knowledge, at the time the removal of the goods was approved, that the property was placed in the Kremer mill building, it was not liable beyond the $6,000; but if it had such notice, and accepted the plaintiff\u2019s assessment for twelve years on $3,620, the policy was valid for that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">Whether the company had such knowledge was the only question submitted to the jury. We so informed counsel before we began the charge, and he did not see fit to address the jury. In fact, there was no reason for any other action on his part. The evidence was explicit and uncontradicted that the company, through its authorized agent had such notice. It is true the notice was given to Mr. Schwenk, a manager, and ordinarily this would not be sufficient: Hook v. Mutual Insurance Co. of Berks County, 160 Pa. 229. Mr. Schwenk was more than a director \u2014 he was a general agent of the company. Mr. Price, the secretary, testified: \u201c Mr. Schwenk was an officer of the company from November 2, 1881. He looked after insurance in the towns of Upper Salford, Lower Salford, Perkiomen, or anywhere else in the district.\u201d In this case the application for the original policy was in Mr. Schwenk\u2019s handwriting, and he was intrusted with the policy for the purpose of having the removal approved. As the representative of the company he undertook the work, with the full knowledge that the property was located in the Kremer mill. He obtained the approval, and handed it back to the plaintiff. There was nothing to indicate to the plaintiff that his insurance was not as good and valid as it had been when his property was located in Upper Salford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">Article 6 of the by-laws empowers the managers to take insurance. It provides as follows: \u201c Any member of the board of managers of the Line Lexington Mutual Fire Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Company of Bucks and Montgomery counties is authorized to effect insurance and give a receipt for the insurance fees. And all insurance so made shall be effectual, and the manager or managers effecting such insurance shall be indemnified in accordance with article 7 of the by-laws.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-6\">Under the charter and by-laws the powers of an individual manager are very extensive, and apparently they are the only persons who can effect insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">Counsel for defendant contends that a contract to pay more than $6,000 is not binding, even if made by the full board of managers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-8\">Article 3 of the by-laws is evidently intended to limit insurance to $6,000 for a building and contents. True, it does not say that a policy shall not exceed $6,000; but it cannot mean that the company may insure for $10,000, collect the premium for years, and then upon a loss of $10,000 pay but $6,000. What is meant is that risks shall not exceed $6,000; and we were informed at the trial that this is the interpretation placed upon the hy-law by the company. . Policies are not issued on a single risk for more than $6,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-9\">Shall the company with full knowledge take a risk for more than $6,000, accept the premiums on the larger sum for many years, and then when the day of reckoning comes be allowed to set up its own by-law to defeat the insured who paid his money in good faith ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-10\">The charter does not in any way limit the amount of a single risk. By article 8 the managers may change any by-law so long as their action is not repugnant to the charter of the company. If they can strike down a by-law altogether, why may they not waive its condition in a particular case if they see fit to do so, and deem it to the interest of the company ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-11\">The liability on the plaintiff\u2019s policy after the removal of the property was knowingly assumed by the defendant company; it received the benefit of the contract for twelve years. The money so received was applied to the needs of the company. We must assume that the contract so made was deemed by the managers beneficial to the company, and it should not now be heard when it attempts to repudiate its undertaking; especially so when no individual policy holder appears to dispute the authority of the managers to make the agreement-: Manhattan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Hardware Co. v. Phalen, 128 Pa. 110. We cannot distinguish this by-law from that considered in Cumberland Valley Mutual Protection Co. v. Schell, 29 Pa. 31, where a by-law prohibiting insurance in excess of two thirds of the estimated value was treated as a direction of the discretion of the company\u2019s officers in making a contract. It was not a condition of the contract, it was not of the substance, was not essential but merely directory. Moore v. Susquehanna Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 196 Pa. 30, is to the same effect. The company, through its duly authorized agents, having made the contract and reaped its benefits, should be bound by its conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">And now, September 3, 1900, the reasons for a new trial are dismissed, a new trial is refused, the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto is overruled, and judgment will now be entered on the verdict of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment on verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-7\"><em>J.

The facts in the case are fully and fairly stated in the opinion accompanying the order for judgment and need not be here repeated. The jury found, as a matter of fact, that the defendant company had notice of the removal of the plaintiff\u2019s personal property from one locality to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Little can profitably be added to the discussion by the court below as to the proper construction of article 3 of the bylaws of the defendant company, which seems to have been the principal point of controversy. By the terms of this article of the by-laws, the company seeks to limit its liability upon \u201c airy one building and the contents thereof \u201d to $6,000. The court below held that this was to be treated as a direction to the officers of the company in making insurance rather than as constituting a binding limitation upon parties insured. In Moore v. Susquehanna Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 196 Pa. 30, Mr. Justice Fell said: \u201c The by-law in relation to excessive insurance was a regulation of the company for the management of its business, and the mere fact that property was insured for more than two thirds of its value did not affect the validity of the policy, unless the over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>insurance was procured by means of some wrongful act on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d Article 3 of the by-laws was undoubtedly intended to limit the power of the board of managers and to govern them in taking insurance and issuing policies for a greater amount than therein stated. Here was a case, however, not of original insurance but altogether exceptional. A building in one locality and the contents of one in another already insured were brought together, the aggregate of the insurance on both exceeding the maximum amount allowed under the limitation in this article.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The plaintiff, as a member of the company, was bound by its constitution, by-laws, rules and regulations, as he stipulated in his policy. The constitution and by-laws are not fully printed but, as appears by \u201c article 8, the board of managers are hereby authorized and empowered to make and amend such by-laws, rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the objects of the company, if not repugnant to the charter of the company. \u201d It does not appear affirmatively that the plaintiff had any notice of insurance upon the building, and the offer to show that he had no knowledge of the insurance of Kremer in the defendant\u2019s company was objected to and ruled out. Even if he had such knowledge, however, he would have been justified in concluding, when his policy was returned with the indorsement as* to the removal of his personal property to Kremer\u2019s building, that the conditions of article 3 had been waived by the board of managers, for the power to make and amend the by-laws, as might be necessary to carry out the objects of the company, surely conferred the power to waive as to a particular case. It will not be denied that, under the general power contained in article 8, the board of managers could have changed the limit of insurance provided for in article 3. If they could do so generally, surely in this exceptional case the limitation could be waived. The indorsement upon the policy must be held to relate not only to the mere fact of removal but to every other purpose, including the amount of insurance allowed, for which it was necessary. It is argued, however, that the indorsement is the individual act of the secretary who had no authority to waive any of the provisions of the by-laws, but the character of the indorsement itself indicates otherwise. It is not signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the secretary as his act but attested by him, which indicates the act of the corporation acting in its corporate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It is contended by the appellant that it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to inquire of the owner of the building as to the companies in which he was insured and the amount of the insurance. There was no such duty resting upon him. He submitted his policy to one of the managers, who was also the general agent of the defendant company, who had knowledge of the facts and returned the policy to him, with an indorsement, showing knowledge on the part of the company of the removal of the property, attested by the secretary. The company had the record of its policies in its office. If it was intended-to limit the plaintiff\u2019s policy to the difference between the insurance held by the owner of the property and $6,000, the facts should have been so stated at the time of the indorsement of the removal. The. company, however, recognized the policy as in full force and, even after the fire, levied an assessment upon the full amount of the premium note, which was paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">If the limitation in the by-law above referred to was to govern as between the 'company and the insured, it is somewhat difficult to understand why the full amount of the loss of the owner of the building was paid and the difference between the actual loss upon the property, real and personal, and the limit of $6,000, was made to fall entirely upon the plaintiff. In the absence of any allegation of fraud or negligence on the part of the plaintiff and with the fact found by the jury that there was actual notice to the defendant of the removal of the property, we cannot see how the court could have done otherwise than enter judgment for the plaintiff upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
