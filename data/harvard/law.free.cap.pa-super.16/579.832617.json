The land taken for said road as laid by the viewers has already been appropriated for a public use, under the right of eminent domain, by the said Uniondale Water Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, under lease to the Consolidated Water Supply Company, a corporation of Pennsyvania, and has been appropriated for the purpose of a reservoir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-15\">9.

J., found from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>evidence that proper notice had been given of the view; that the necessity for the road was a question solely for the viewers; that the question of damages was not a subject for exceptions, and that the presumption was that the viewers performed their duty and ran the road according to the true meridian. On the eighth exception the court found as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-3\">This alleges that the proposed road is laid over land appropriated by a water company for the purposes of a reservoir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-4\">The depositions taken by exceptant show that the Uniondale Water Company has been duly incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania; that, in 1896, Roswell H. Patterson purchased a tract of land over which this proposed road has been laid, for the use of the Uniondale Water Company. The land was paid for by said water company, and Roswell H. Patterson conveyed the same to said water company by deed dated May 1, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">February 28, 1899, the Consolidated Water Supply Company was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, for the purpose of \u2022 supplying water in the district composed of the counties of Lackawanna and Susquehanna. The Uniondale Water Company was chartered for the purpose of supplying water to the borough of Uniondale in Susquehanna county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">This land was leased to the Consolidated Water Supply Company by the Uniondale Water Company, by lease dated August 9, 1899. (The depositions refer to this lease by date and place of record, but no copy was attached to depositions.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">The Consolidated Water Supply Company, on March 2, 1899, passed and recorded upon its minutes, a resolution as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ari\">\u201c Resolved, by the Consolidated Water Company, that this company take, and appropriate, for the purposes authorized by its charter, all the waters of the Lackawanna river from the county line between Lackawanna and Susquehanna counties, at Forest City, and its several sources, by the various branches, thereof, and all the waters in the basin and watershed drained by said river; and all ponds, lakes, reservoirs, natural and artificial, pools, springs and rivulets within the said watershed, the same being necessary for the carrying out of the purposes of this incorporation, all being within the counties of Susquehanna and Wayne, in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and so much of the land of said tract as shall be required for the purposes of this incorporation, to be designated by the president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>of this company, and the engineers, acting on his directions by marking on the ground, and to be reported to this board as soon as practicable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\">It appears from the depositions and records, that, for many years, there was a public road near where the report of viewers have laid a road, but nearer the swamp and on lower ground; and that this old road, upon proceedings in the quarter.sessions, was vacated in 1897. There had been opposition to the vacation of the old road, by the property owners along the road, and also by the citizens of Ararat township, but the opposition to the vacation of the old road was withdrawn, under an understanding with the parties who were active in obtaining a vacation of the road, that there would be no objection made to the laying out and opening of a road between the same termini, on higher ground up nearer the railroad. Mr. S. E. Dunn was active in opposing the vacation of the old road. R. E. Patterson was the president of the Uniondale Water Company. The legal title to the land, which is now owned by the Union-dale Water Company, was then in said Patterson, who now claims that he purchased this land originally for the Uniondale Water Company. That Mr. R. H. Patterson was then active in obtaining the vacation of the old road, and a party to the understanding that there would be no opposition to the laying of a new one on better ground, appears from the following letter, written by him to S. E. Dunn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">Copy of letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">\u201cJuly 8, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">\u201c Mr. S.

I note what you say about meeting the supervisors and arranging to have the old road vacated, and am pleased that you have brought about this arrangement. With regard to signing the petition for a new road, as I have already written you, we will make no protest against having the road built along the right of way of the railroad on the high ground, yet I could not truthfully represent to the court that we labored under great inconvenience for want of such road and I think it would be much better under the circumstances not to be a party to this proceeding. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>expect to carry out our arrangement fully and just as we stated it in the letter which you have.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-3\">\u201cYours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">(Signed) \u201c R. H. Patterson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">The acceptants claim that the purchase of this land by R. H. Patterson for the Uniondale Water Company was an appropriation of the same by said corporation for the purpose of a reservoir, it having been purchased for that purpose; that the subsequent resolution of the Consolidated Water Supply Company to appropriate the watershed of the Lackawanna river in' the counties of Wayne and Susquehanna followed by the leasing of this land from the Uniondale Water Company and a subsequent survey of the proposed reservoir was such an appropriation of the land over which this road is laid by the corporations as prevents a subsequent appropriation of any portion of it for road purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">In support of this proposition they cite: In re Petition of Cleveland &amp; Pittsburg R. R. Co., 2 Pittsb. 348; Del. &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v. Scranton &amp; Forest City R. R. Co., 1 Lack. Jurist, 97. In the ease of petition of Cleveland and Pittsburg R. R. Co., the point decided was that the legislature has no power to authorize one railroad company to appropriate any premises of another railroad company which are necessary to the proper conduct of the business of the latter; but if one railroad company own land or right of way not necessary for the proper conduct of its business, such property may be taken for the use of another company just as the property of any one on the line of the proposed road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">The case of the Del. &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v. Scranton &amp; Forest City R. R. Co. decided that an actual survey and permanent location upon the ground of a railroad possessing the power of eminent domain is a legal appropriation of the site which will prevent a subsequent appropriation of it by another corporation for a like purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">Neither of these cases are similar to the case at bar. In this case the Uniondale Water Company purchased this land, across which a public road had been in existence many years previous to the incorporation of the company. In proceedings instituted to vacate this old road an amicable understanding was reached by all parties interested, including this water company, that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>opposition should be made to laying out a road between the same termini upon higher ground.\u2019 This arrangement was for the benefit of this water company, as if carried out it removed the old road from the site of a natural reservoir which had previously been flowed to the depth of ten or twelve feet, and placed it upon higher ground, which necessarily increased the area of land which could be flowed without touching or interfering with the road. Having procured the abandonment of all opposition to the vacating of the old road by this understanding with its corresponding benefits, they cannot now set up their appropriation of this land as a reservoir for the purpose of defeating an arrangement made by them not to oppose the laying of a road upon higher ground. The Uniondale Water Company was incorporated in 1893. It purchased this land in 1896. It never made any appropriation for use as a reservoir by survey and marks upon the ground. The Consolidated Water Supply Company did not lease this land of the Uniondale Water Company until after the viewers had laid this road and subsequently surveyed it so far as appears for the purpose of obtaining information to enable their engineer to testify as to how the road as laid would interfere with a reservoir made by erecting a twenty-foot dam. It does not appear that there is anj*- well defined intention on the part of the Consolidated Water Supply Company to build a reservoir at this place at any definite fixed time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">Whatever title these water companies have acquired in this land was originally subject to the easement of a public road. The arrangement regarding the vacation of the road was, in equity, merely a change in the location of this easement, which is being carried out according to the understanding of the parties. Upon the argument of the exceptions, it was claimed on the part of the water company, that the road should have been laid still nearer the right of way of the railroad company, but they have made no move to have it so laid. Their exception goes to the right to lay any road. If they had wished the road laid on higher ground, they could have proceeded, by re-view, to accomplish that purpose. If the appropriation of land by a water company, under their right of eminent domain, or by purchase, carried with it, as claimed by exceptant, the right to prohibit the appropriation, by the public, of any portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>same for a road, we think, under the circumstances of the case, the exceptants are estopped from exercising such right of prohibition. The cases cited by the learned counsel for exceptants do not establish the proposition claimed, and a careful examination by counsel has failed to furnish any citation in point. To follow exceptant\u2019s claim to its logical conclusion, their appropriation of all the streams, ponds, pools, lakes and rivulets and reservoirs, natural and artificial, \u201c within the watershed of the Lackawanna river, in the counties of Susquehanna and Wayne,\u201d would practically prevent the building of any public road upon desirable ground in the southeastern portion of the county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-3\">The exceptions are dismissed, and the report of viewers confirmed finally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to report of viewers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-5\"><em>William A.

These questions were decided by the court below on the evidence produced by the parties; and as that evidence is not part of the record, we are without power to determine its sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Question three, \u201c Whether land appropriated by a water company for a reservoir can be taken from the company for conflicting highway purposes,\u201d requires little discussion. It is well settled that a corporate franchise is a form of private property, and, like other private property, may be taken for public use, under the conditions fixed by law: In re Melon Street, 192 Pa. 331; Phila. &amp; Gray\u2019s Ferry Pass. Railway Company\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 123. Whether, in the case before us, these conditions existed; whether a water company had been duly incorporated, and its charter recorded \u201cin the county where its chief operations are to be carried on,\u201d making it \u201cfrom thenceforth a corporation for the purposes and upon the terms named in its charter; \u201d whether such a corporation had appropriated for public use the land on which the road complained of was laid, at a time when it could lawfully do so; and whether such use would be materially impaired or abridged by the opening of the road, are questions of fact which it was the province of the court below to determine. The matters which they embrace are involved in the eighth exception below, the overruling of which is the subject of the fifth specification; the exception asserting, as ma!!or of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that the land taken for the road \u201c has already been appropriated for a public use, under the right of eminent domain, by the Uniondale Water Company, for the purpose of a reservoir.\u201d This cannot be determined as a question of law; nor can we review the conclusions of fact, in the premises, reached by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">Question four, arising from the ninth specification, is based on the supplemental exception below, that the report of the viewers \u201cfails to show that the survey and location of the road was according to the true meridian, as required by the act of assembly.\u201d The statutory provision on this point is that contained in section 3 of the act of June 13, 1836; this directs that when viewers make a report laying out a road they \u201c shall also annex and return to the court a plot or draft thereof, stating the courses and distances, and noting briefly the improvements through which it may pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACnY\">In the present case, the report describes the first course as \u201c south 44 degrees west as the needle now points (the magnetic variation being now about 8 degrees).\u201d No surveyor would be at a loss to locate the course from this description. After the Act of April 26, 1860, P. L. 696, had stood on the statute book for thirty-five years, Mr. Justice Clark, in discussing the essentials of a report, said: \u201cIt is required that the viewers\u2019 report shall state particularly, \u2018first, who of them were present at the view; second, whether they were severally sworn or affirmed; third, whether the road desired be necessary for a public or private road;\u2019 also, that the viewers shall \u2018annex and return to the court a plot or draft thereof, stating the courses and distances, and noting briefly the improvements through which it may pass.\u2019 These are the requisites of a report, as defined by the act of 1836, and they do not differ materially under the act of 1845:\u201d Road in South Abington Twp., 109 Pa. 118. In the case before us, the report contains all these requisites, and contains matter to rebut the presumption that in establishing the course of the road the viewers did their duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The record, in this case, shows a petition, an appointment of viewers, an order to view, a report by the viewers, laying out a road, with a draft attached, and an order of confirmation; all of which are in due form. These are all that we can consider. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Allegations of errors, omissions and irregularities, not appearing therein, but resting on extrinsic evidence, present questions of fact for the consideration of the court below. Their determination below is final, and cannot be reviewed by this court, since the evidence on which it is based is no part of the record and is therefore not brought before us by the appeal. This has been so often held that it ought not to be necessary for us to repeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The record being free from error, the order of final confirmation is affirmed, at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
