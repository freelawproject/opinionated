Montante, Jr.\u2019s January 20, 2009, denial of Parmar\u2019s motion to reopen and rescind his <em>in absentia </em>removal order. <em>In re Vivek A. Parmar, </em>No. A098 927 831 (B.I.A. May 24, 2010); <em>aff'g </em>No. A098 927 831 (Immig.Ct.Buffalo, NY, Jan. 20, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). An <em>in absentia </em>order of removal may be rescinded only \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (b)(5)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">As an initial matter, Parmar\u2019s contention that he did in fact appear at his individual hearing is unavailing for several reasons. First, his January 2008 motion requesting that he \u201cbe allowed to appear telephonically for all master calendars\u201d and \u201conly appear in person on the individual hearing date,\u201d did not waive his duty to appear in person for his November 13, 2008, hearing because it was an individual hearing, not a master calendar. <em>See </em>Immigration Court Practice Manual \u00a7 4.8(m)(iii)(A) (providing that \u201c[a] waiver of a representative\u2019s appearance at a master calendar hearing does not constitute a waiver of the respondent\u2019s appearance\u201d). Moreover, Parmar\u2019s October 2008 motion requesting \u201ceither a written decision or for [Parmar] and counsel to appear telephonically for the oral decision,\u201d referred only to the IJ\u2019s expected decision on his motion to suppress evidence and terminate his proceedings, on which the IJ issued a written decision. Notably, Parmar prepared and mailed the motion one day prior to the IJ\u2019s issuance of the notice for his November 13, 2008, individual hearing, and therefore the motion could not have requested permission to appear telephonically at a hearing that had not yet been scheduled. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.8(n)(v) (permission to appear telephonically \u201cdoes not constitute permission ... to appear by telephone at any future hearing\u201d). In any event, the IJ denied the motion. That the denial order was not mailed until November 13, 2008, the date of Parmar\u2019s hearing, does not excuse his failure to appear in person. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.8(n)(iii)(B) (the \u201cmere filing\u201d of a motion to appear by telephone does not excuse appearance, and \u201crespondent must appear in person unless the motion has been granted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Parmar also asserts that, even if the IJ did not grant his motion to appear telephonically, two paralegals from his attorney\u2019s office called the immigration court and spoke to anonymous individuals who informed them that both he and his attorney could appear telephonically. However, as the IJ noted in his decision, the court clerk with whom Parmar allegedly spoke stated that \u201cshe never spoke with anybody from counsel\u2019s office relative to a telephonic hearing,\u201d and that she \u201calso asked the entire court staff and they responded that they had never advised counsel\u2019s office that the Immigration Judge granted a telephonic [hearing].\u201d Therefore, the IJ, in considering Parmar\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion to reopen, was confronted with two contradictory stories and chose to credit one over the other. The record does not compel a different result. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (agency\u2019s findings of fact are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d); <em>see also Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 171 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cWe do not ourselves attempt to resolve conflicts in record evidence, a task largely within the discretion of the agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Parmar also failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appear. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (b)(5)(C)(i). In this context, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d are those \u201cbeyond the control of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1229a (e)(1). These include \u201cbattery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not ... less compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Parmar\u2019s situation does not constitute \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under the statutory definition of that term. Parmar\u2019s reliance on <em>Aris v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 595 (2d Cir.2008), is also unavailing, because <em>Aris </em>concerned a motion to reopen filed with the BIA alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Par-mar has not raised an ineffective assistance claim either here or before the agency. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, although ineffective assistance of counsel \u201ccan constitute exceptional circumstances excusing the alien\u2019s failure to appear at a deportation hearing,\u201d <em>Aris, </em>517 F.3d at 599, there is no ineffective assistance claim before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
