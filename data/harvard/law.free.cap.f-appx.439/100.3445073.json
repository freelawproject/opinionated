For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">Torres is presently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort D ix, New Jersey. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to various crimes relating to the distribution of cocaine in the Southern District of Florida and was sentenced to 108 months\u2019 incarceration. His direct appeal to the Eleventh Circuit was dismissed as untimely, and his subsequent motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, was denied on its merits. In 2008, Torres filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District of New Jersey, where he is confined. That petition, which attacked his conviction and sentence, was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Torres v. Grondolsky, </em>No. 1:08-cv-4811 (D.N.J. 2008). Torres did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">In September 2010, Torres initiated this case by filing another \u00a7 2241 petition. In it he averred that he is actually innocent because, under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision, <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1486, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to inform him that a guilty plea carries a risk of deportation. The District Court construed his petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971). Torres appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-25\">A motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the primary means to collaterally challenge a federal conviction or sentence. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). A federal prisoner can seek relief from an unconstitutional sentence or conviction under \u00a7 2241 if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). We have held that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective where an intervening change in substantive law has potentially made the conduct for which the petitioner was convicted non-criminal. <em>Dorsainvil, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>119 F.3d at 248. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that <em>Padilla </em>is retroactively applicable on collateral review, that case does not represent a change in <em>substantive </em>law. The conduct for which Torres was convicted remains criminal and his claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d is otherwise unsubstantiated. His claims should therefore have been raised via a \u00a7 2255 motion in the Southern District of Florida, his court of conviction, and not in the District of New Jersey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Galante, </em>437 F.2d at 1165; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over Torres\u2019 petition, and correctly dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Torres\u2019 appeal presents no substantial question, and will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 <em>&amp; </em>I.O.P. 10.6. The petition for a certificate of appealability is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-19\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. Our review of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions is plenary. <em>See Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-15\">. Of course, because Torres has already brought a \u00a7 2255 action, he cannot now file another without leave from the Eleventh Circuit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). We concur with the District Court that construing Torres\u2019 petition as one for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and transferring it to that Court would not be in the interest of justice. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
