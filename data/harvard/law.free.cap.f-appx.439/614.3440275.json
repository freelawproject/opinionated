We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Khudaverdyan\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed more than three years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Khudaverdyan failed to establish changed circumstances in Armenia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limitation, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see also Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996 (9th Cir.2008) (evidence must demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief in order to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions); <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (possibility of future harm too speculative).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-20\">Contrary to Khudaverdyan\u2019s contention, the BIA adequately considered the evidence presented with the motion to reopen. <em>See Najmabadi, </em>597 F.3d at 990-91. Khudaverdyan\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider his claim independently from his father\u2019s is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
