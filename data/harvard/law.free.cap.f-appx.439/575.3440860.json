We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1070 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">Diep did not testify to having experienced any physical harm in Vietnam. After release from prison, his father, a former officer in the South Vietnamese army, remained in Vietnam for eight years without incident. Neither his brother nor his mother experienced any harm during their visits to Vietnam. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT protection because Diep failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>if he returns to Vietnam. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 747-48 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
