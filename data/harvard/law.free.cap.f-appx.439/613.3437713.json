We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent that deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">We reject Paz-Discua\u2019s claim that he is eligible for asylum based on his political opinion or membership in a particular social group. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 746-47 (9th Cir.2008) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s contention that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion based on his refusal to join a gang); <em>Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 860-62 (9th Cir.2009) (rejecting as a particular social group \u201cyoung Honduran men who have been recruited by [a gang], but who refuse to join.\u201d); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Paz-Discua\u2019s arguments to distinguish his case from <em>Santos-Lemus </em>and <em>Ramos-Lopez </em>are unavailing. Accordingly, because Paz-Discua failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted or faces persecution on account of a protected ground, we deny the petition. <em>See Ramos-Lopez, </em>563 F.3d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
