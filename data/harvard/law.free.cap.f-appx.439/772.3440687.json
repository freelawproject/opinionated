Brown also appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the government leave to amend its counterclaim. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0c\">A. Brown\u2019s Tax Liabilities</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">Beginning in 1995, Brown was the president, only officer, and only director of Safe-Deposit, Inc., a security guard company in Ocala, Florida. Brown, who was the only authorized signatory on Safe-Deposit\u2019s bank accounts, signed payroll checks on the company\u2019s behalf. Brown was responsible for collecting and paying employment taxes for Safe-Deposit\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">Safe-Deposit failed to turn over to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) payroll taxes withheld from its employees\u2019 wages for the tax periods ending June 30, 1999; September 30, 1999; December 31, 1999; March 31, 2000; June 30, 2000; December 31, 2000; and March 31, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>To recover those taxes, the IRS assessed trust fund recovery penalties<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Brown personally pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672, as a responsible person of Safe-Deposit who willfully failed to pay over the withheld taxes. The total amount of trust fund recovery penalties assessed against Brown was approximately $44,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brown made some payments toward her tax liabilities for the tax periods ending June 80, 1999 through June 30, 2000. Brown entered into an installment agreement in 2005 and made some, but not all, of the payments due. When Brown overpaid her personal income taxes, the IRS credited those amounts toward the outstanding balance on the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">B. Brown\u2019s Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On March 13, 2008, Brown filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against the United States, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and various unknown government employees. Brown raised a number of constitutional and state-law tort claims, but the gravamen of her complaint was that the government \u201cillegally assessed and collected\u201d the trust fund recovery penalties \u201cfrom ... Brown instead of [Safe-Deposit].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On May 19, 2008, the government filed a counterclaim \u201cto reduce to judgment [Brown\u2019s] outstanding federal tax liabilities.\u201d The counterclaim alleged that Brown failed to pay over employee payroll taxes for the tax periods ending June 30, 2000; December 31, 2000; and March 31, 2001. The counterclaim alleged that the total amount due for those tax periods, as of May 19, 2008, was $45,118.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">C. Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">The government moved to dismiss Brown\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion, except that it found that Brown may be able to assert a tax refund claim against the government as to the tax period ending June 30, 2000. The district court permitted Brown to file an amended complaint asserting that tax refund claim only, which Brown did.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">D. Government\u2019s Motion to Amend Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Following discovery, the government moved to amend its counterclaim \u201cto clarify that the assessment for the tax periods ending June 30, 2000 includes the tax periods ending June 30, 1999 through June 30, 2000.\u201d The government alleged Brown would not be prejudiced by the amendment because (1) discovery included the June 30, 1999 through June 30, 2000 tax periods, and (2) the amendment would not change the balance alleged to be due but would merely clarify the tax periods eov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ered. The district court granted leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">E. Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The government moved for summary-judgment. Brown requested a continuance, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), to take the deposition of Richard Hanauer, the IRS revenue agent assigned to her case. The district court granted Brown\u2019s request for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">After Hanauer\u2019s deposition, the government renewed its summary judgment motion. Brown opposed the motion, requested mediation, and again argued she should be granted leave to conduct additional discovery. The district court denied Brown\u2019s request for additional discovery and granted summary judgment to the government on both Brown\u2019s one tax refund claim and the government\u2019s amended counterclaim. Brown appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aev\">A. Leave to Amend Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Brown contends the district court erred in granting the government leave to amend its counterclaim to include the tax periods in 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides that before trial a district court \u201cshould freely give leave\u201d to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). However, the district court need not permit an amendment \u201c(1) where there has been undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed; (2) where allowing amendment would cause undue prejudice to the opposing party; or (3) where amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">Brown\u2019s only contention of error is her bare assertion, without legal or evidentiary support, that she was prejudiced by the government\u2019s amendment because the statute of limitations had run on the tax assessment for the year 1999. Even assuming Brown adequately preserved and raised this issue, it lacks merit. The counterclaim amendment did not assert a new claim for relief. The uncontroverted evidence shows that the April 16, 2001 assessment against Brown for $30,924.16 \u2014 one of the three assessments referenced in the original counterclaim as showing the penalties the government was seeking to reduce to judgment \u2014 was for trust fund recovery penalties for the tax periods ending June 30, 1999; September 30, 1999; December 31, 1999; and June 30, 2000. Thus, the government was counterclaiming for the 1999 penalties all along, though the original counterclaim failed to point it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">As the district court correctly found, Brown was not prejudiced by the counterclaim amendment because (1) it did not affect the amount due or include any new assessments or penalties, and (2) discovery had already included all the periods covered by the clarifying amendment. Moreover, because the penalties for the 1999 tax periods were included in the April 16, 2001 assessment, there was no statute of limitations violation in any event. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a) (stating that \u201cthe amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the government leave to amend its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Brown argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government on its amended counterclaim and her refund claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672, \u201cthe officers or employees of the employer responsible for effectuating the collection and payment of trust-fund taxes who willfully fail to do so are made personally liable [for] a \u2018penalty\u2019 equal to the amount of the delinquent taxes.\u201d <em>Slodov, </em>436 U.S. at 244-45, 98 S.Ct. at 1784.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The test for liability under \u00a7 6672(a) has two elements: \u201c(1) a responsible person (2) who has willfully failed to perform a duty to collect, account for, or pay over federal employment taxes.\u201d <em>Thosteson v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">A \u201cresponsible person\u201d is \u201can officer or employee of a corporation who is under a duty to collect, account for, or pay over the withheld tax.\u201d <em>Thibodeau v. United States, </em>828 F.2d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir.1987). There is no dispute that Brown is a \u201cresponsible person\u201d under \u00a7 6672.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The willfulness requirement is satisfied \u201cif the responsible person has knowledge of payments to other creditors after [s]he becomes aware of the failure to remit the withheld taxes.\u201d <em>Thosteson, </em>331 F.3d at 1300. There is no requirement that willfulness of the responsible person include a fraudulent or other bad motive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Brown denies she meets the willfulness requirement, but she has repeatedly conceded, both in the district court and again in her brief on appeal, that she deliberately paid Safe-Deposit\u2019s employees\u2019 wages and other creditors <em>before </em>she paid the trust fund taxes to the government. Brown\u2019s conduct satisfies the willfulness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Brown argues she is not liable under \u00a7 6672 because she had \u201creasonable cause\u201d for not paying the trust fund taxes \u2014 namely, her own and her family\u2019s health problems and an alleged pattern of tortious interference against Safe-Deposit by the Ocala Police Department. This Court has never decided whether there is a \u201creasonable cause\u201d defense to a finding of willfulness under \u00a7 6672. <em>See Thosteson, </em>331 F.3d at 1301. But even if there were, it would not apply to Brown because \u201c[n]o such defense may be asserted by a responsible person who knew that the withholding taxes were due, but who made a conscious decision to use corporate funds to pay creditors other than the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Whatever the cause of Safe-Deposit\u2019s financial woes, Brown by her own admission \u201cused the corporate income to pay payroll and business expenses rather than to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>fully the taxes due first.\u201d Therefore, she is liable for a penalty equal to the amount of unpaid taxes pursuant to \u00a7 6672<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court correctly granted summary judgment to the government on its counterclaim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Because the district court correctly held that Brown is liable for the trust fund recovery penalties under \u00a7 6672, it likewise correctly determined that Brown was not entitled to a refund of the amounts she has already paid. The government is entitled to summary judgment on Brown\u2019s tax refund claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-20\">.

On April 16, 2001, the IRS assessed against Brown a trust fund recovery penalty of $30,924.16 for the tax periods ending June 30, 1999 through June 30, 2000. On April 21, 2003, the IRS assessed against Brown two trust fund recovery penalties, one for $6,322.79 for the tax period ending December 31, 2000, and the other for $6,889.61 for the tax period ending March 31, 2001. The amounts assessed represented the trust fund portion of the unpaid federal payroll taxes of Safe-Deposit's employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\">. We review a district court's decision to grant leave to amend a pleading for abuse of discretion. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1276 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Shuford v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). In doing so, \"[w]e apply the same legal standards that bound the district court and view all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the district court's denial of a Rule 56(d) motion for leave to conduct additional discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. A district court's decision whether to order mediation is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., </em>91 F.3d 1445, 1448 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b798-13\">. Section 6672 provides that \"any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall ... be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b799-23\">. Brown challenges the amount of the judgment entered by the district court. She contends that the government conceded that Brown has already paid in full the penalties for the tax period ending June 30, 2000 listed in the April 16, 2001 assessment. Brown misconstrues the government\u2019s concession, which was only that subject matter jurisdiction existed for a refund claim based on the penalties as to the June 30, 2000 tax period because Brown had paid the amount of tax withheld <em>for a single Safe-Deposit employee </em>for the June 30, 2000 period. In fact, the undisputed facts show that Brown did not pay the full amount of the penalties deriving from the June 30, 2000 tax period, but only a portion of them. Brown has shown no error in the amount of the judgment against her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">. For the first time on appeal, Brown contends there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the government sent her the proper notices of her tax liabilities. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(b)(1) (requiring the government to notify a taxpayer against which it is seeking to impose a trust fund penalty in writing by mail sent to his or her last known address). Because this issue was not raised in the district court, it is waived. <em>See Norelus v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1296 (11th Cir.2010) (noting \"our well-established rule ... [that] issues not raised in the district court should not be considered on appeal\u201d). In any event, the documents attached to Brown\u2019s brief on appeal suggest that the government sent, and she received, proper notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\">. Brown argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without permitting additional discovery or ordering mediation. We find no abuse of discretion. Brown admitted each element necessary to prove liability under \u00a7 6672 and has made no showing that the witnesses she wished to depose would provide information that might alter that fact. Moreover, she already was afforded one opportunity for additional discovery. And a district court is obviously under no obligation to order mediation in the face of a valid motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
