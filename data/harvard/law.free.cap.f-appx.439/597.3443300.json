Petitioner appeals the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) April 29, 2008, affirmation of Immigration Judge Anthony Atenaide\u2019s February 24, 2006, decision holding that Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings was untimely. Petitioner contends that during the removal proceedings, Judge Atenaide gave him incorrect legal advice that warranted the equitable tolling of the ninety-day deadline to file his motion and, alternatively, denied him his due process right to judicial review because it rendered invalid his appeal waiver. The court dismisses Petitioner\u2019s equitable tolling claim, but grants the petition in part with respect to Petitioner\u2019s due process claim and remands for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b620-24\">BIA denials of motions to reopen are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003)). The BIA\u2019s decision should only be disturbed upon finding that it acted \u201carbitrarily, irrationally, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000). Reviews of purely legal questions, such as due process claims, however, are carried out <em>de novo. Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 894. In employing the <em>de novo </em>standard, this court must perform an independent review of the entirety of the record unless the BIA has reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>in which case, the court is limited to reviewing solely the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">This court has found that failure to raise the issue of equitable tolling in an appeal to the BIA \u201cconstitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d <em>Vargas v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Immigration and Naturalization, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987). Petitioner argues that \u201cwhile [he] did not use the term \u2018equitable tolling\u2019 in his brief, he did set forth facts in his brief that established his entitlement to equitable relief.\u201d Even given this court\u2019s holding in <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir.2001), Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdefective advice\u201d equitable tolling argument in support of the current petition was not sufficiently raised before the BIA. Therefore, because Petitioner failed to fully exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his equitable tolling argument, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Individuals subject to a removal proceeding are guaranteed the Fifth Amendment \u201cguarantee of due process.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>367 F.3d at 1186. \u201cA waiver of the right to appeal a removal order must be \u2018considered and intelligent\u2019 or it constitutes a deprivation of the right to appeal and thus of the right to a meaningful opportunity for judicial review.\u201d <em>Biwot v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). Immigration Judge Atenaide\u2019s advice, taken as a whole, creates a question as to whether such advice was sufficiently misleading to invalidate Petitioner\u2019s appeal waiver. The BIA must acknowledge and decide whether Petitioner\u2019s appeal was \u201cconsidered and intelligent\u201d in light of Judge Atenaide\u2019s advice. If the BIA finds that the waiver was invalid, Petitioner\u2019s appeal to the BIA must be heard on the merits. Therefore, the petition is granted with respect to the waiver issue as to whether Petitioner\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Petitioner\u2019s equitable tolling argument fails and is dismissed. Petitioner\u2019s due process claim regarding the validity of his appeal waiver is remanded. Petition is DISMISSED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART, and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
