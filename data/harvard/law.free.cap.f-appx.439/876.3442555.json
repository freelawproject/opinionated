The BIA denied Mendoza\u2019s motion as untimely pursuant after concluding the evidence put forward did not establish changed country conditions. Mendoza argues the BIA abused its discretion by failing to compare the evidence of new conditions in Venezuela with those at the time of his removal hearing and by relying on a prior adverse credibility finding. After review, we deny Mendoza\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">An alien generally may file one motion to reopen proceedings within 90 days of the date of the final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The time and numerical limits do not apply, however, if the alien can demonstrate \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Mendoza has failed to satisfy his heavy burden to establish changed country conditions. Mendoza\u2019s submissions only show continued country conditions and do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>not demonstrate that country conditions based upon political persecution have worsened. Moreover, the BIA appropriately questioned the reliability of the submissions and concluded Mendoza failed to show why some of the information submitted was not obtained and presented at his removal hearing. Finally, although an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the BIA\u2019s duty to consider other evidence, <em>see Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005), the BIA did not solely rely on the credibility determination as the basis for its decision. The BIA also weighed the reliability of the newly submitted evidence and concluded the submissions failed to show, if removed, Mendoza would face a materially greater risk of harm. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Mendoza\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">.
