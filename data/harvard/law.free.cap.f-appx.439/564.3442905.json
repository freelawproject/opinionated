Talbott is serving a 264-month sentence imposed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana after a jury found him guilty of being a felon in possession of ammunition, \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He argued in his habeas petition that he should not have been sentenced as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because his prior convictions for Class C felony battery, <em>see </em>Ind.Code \u00a7 35^2-2-1.1(a)(3), did not qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Following careful de novo review, we affirm the denial of relief and the dismissal of Talbott\u2019s petition because he did not establish that a remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court would be inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Hill v. Morrison, </em>349 F.3d 1089, 1091 (8th Cir.2003) (noting that a collateral challenge to a federal conviction or sentence must generally be raised in the sentencing court under \u00a7 2255 and not in a \u00a7 2241 petition filed in the court of incarceration); <em>United States v. Lurie, </em>207 F.3d 1075, 1077 (8th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because a prisoner cannot file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion). Talbott\u2019s motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-17\">. The Honorable Patrick J.
