Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Our review of the record reveals no support for Serratos-Quiroz\u2019s contention that the IJ prejudged his cancellation claim or displayed any bias or animosity toward him. <em>See Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 925-26 (9th Cir.2007) (acknowledging the agency\u2019s standard for recusal set forth in <em>Matter of Exame, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Serratos-Quiroz failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his U.S. citizen children. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 979 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">Finally, Serratos-Quiroz\u2019s contention-that his removal would result in the deprivation of his children\u2019s right to remain with their father \u2014 does not raise a constitutional claim. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that agency necessarily considers effect of parent\u2019s removal on the interests of the child, and does not act in a manner contrary to Congress\u2019 intent, when evaluating and denying cancellation claim); <em>Salvador-Calleros v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 959, 963 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that hardship standard does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
