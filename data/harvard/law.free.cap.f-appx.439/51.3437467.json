Briefly, Curns and Zukaitis (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are former District Managers for Shoes and Jewelry at Wal-Mart. During a restructuring of its management positions, Wal-Mart eliminated the positions of District Manager for Shoes and Jewelry and folded them into a newly created District Fashion Merchandiser position. Plaintiffs interviewed for the new District Fashion Merchandiser position and for other store management positions but were not selected. Both sued Wal-Mart, alleging, inter alia, violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the New York State Human Rights Law. The case proceeded to jury trial. Before it was submitted to the jury, the district court partially granted WalMart\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), dismissing all claims for economic damages. The jury found for Wal-Mart on all remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">I. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">A. <em>Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">We review evidentiary rulings under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Boyce v. Soundview Tech. Grp., Inc., </em>464 F.3d 376, 385 (2d Cir.2006). Even if a district court erroneously excludes evidence it should have admitted, we will not reverse that decision if the error was harmless. <em>See Henry v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., </em>616 F.3d 134, 151 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">With respect to the evidentiary challenges, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Based on the manner in which they were offered, Wal-Mart\u2019s statements to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) were properly excluded. Each time Plaintiffs sought to admit the statements as party admissions under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), the district court reminded Plaintiffs of his \u201cpretrial admonition ... that a foundation had to be laid for the admissibility of the position statement,\u201d and ruled that there was no proper foundation. Commenting on the matter, the district judge explained \u201c[njever once did I tell you that that statement was inadmissible. What I told you was you needed to lay a foundation.... Had you laid it ... I would have allowed the statement in evidence.\u201d As a corporation, Wal-Mart itself cannot \u201cadmit\u201d anything \u2014 it can only speak through its agents. Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to introduce the EEOC position statements into evidence implicate Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), which requires the proponent of the evidence to \u201clay a sufficient foundation by establishing (1) the existence of the agency relationship, (2) that the statement was made during the course of the relationship, and (3) that it relates to a matter within the scope of the agency.\u201d <em>Marcic v. Reinauer Transp. Cos., </em>397 F.3d 120, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Despite the district court\u2019s repeated warnings, Plaintiffs failed to produce a witness with sufficient personal knowledge to establish the foundation required by Rule 801(d)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The exclusion of the \u201cBenefits Strategy Memorandum\u201d was also proper. Plaintiffs never moved to have the memorandum admitted in evidence. To the extent they argue the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings <em>implicitly </em>excluded the Benefits Strategy Memorandum, they made no offer of proof and therefore cannot challenge the evidentiary ruling on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2); <em>Henry, </em>616 F.3d at 152 (Rule 103(a)(2) requires an offer where \u201cas here, the significance of the excluded evidence is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>obvious\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Curns also objects to the exclusion of evidence that an employee of Wal-Mart, whose recommendation was sought for the position to be filled, said that he understood Curns was intending to retire. We need not rule on whether the employee\u2019s statement could be received as an admission of the company, <em>cf. United States v. Rioux, </em>97 F.3d 648, 661 (2d Cir.1996), because, even assuming that it qualified as a statement of the company, its exclusion was at worst harmless error, as the evidence had little or no bearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">B. <em>Judgment as a Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Finding that Plaintiffs had failed to submit any evidence of economic harm, the district court partially granted Wal-Mart\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) motion and dismissed all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for economic damages. The challenge to that determination is mooted by the jury\u2019s subsequent finding, by special verdict, that Plaintiffs did not prove liability. <em>See Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>368 F.3d 709, 720 (7th Cir.2004). Without liability, damages are not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
