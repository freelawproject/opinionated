We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Leiva-Molina failed to demonstrate the harm she suffered at the hands of her boyfriend and gang members rises to the level of past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (harm was \u201cdisturbing and regrettable\u201d but not severe enough to constitute persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Leiva-Molina does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution because she failed to show that the government of El Salvador was unwilling or unable to help her, <em>see Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005), and that she cannot relocate within El Salvador to avoid harm, <em>see Kaiser v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 653, 659 (9th Cir.2004) (in the absence of a presumption of a well-founded future fear, the petitioner has the burden of proving that relocation is unreasonable). Accordingly, Leiva-Molina\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Because Leiva-Molina failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that she has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Finally, we reject Leiva-Molina\u2019s contention that holding her merits hearing by video conference violated her due process rights because a video conference is a proper means for holding a merits hearing, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii), and LeivaMolina has not identified any \u201cindiscernible\u201d portion of her testimony that bears on her eligibility for asylum, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must show error and prejudice to establish a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b594-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
