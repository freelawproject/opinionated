We have reviewed Davydzenka\u2019s claims in this regard and find that we do not have jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8) (2006); <em>Lizama v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 440, 444-46 (4th Cir.2011); <em>Gomis v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 353, 358-59 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1048, 175 L.Ed.2d 881 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">Next, Davydzenka challenges the Board\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). We have reviewed the record and Davydzenka\u2019s contentions and conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding below that Davydzenka did not meet her burden to qualify for this relief. Finally, we uphold the agency determination that Davydzenka failed to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
