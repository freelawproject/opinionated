We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, and we review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. Wakk<em>ary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Sutanto claims he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Chinese ethnicity and Christian religion. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the incidents of harassment and violence experienced by Sutanto do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (harassment, threats, and one beating did not compel finding of past persecution). In addition, the record does not compel the conclusion that, even as a member of a disfavored group, Sutanto has shown sufficient individualized risk to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (noting that \u201c[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to petitioners\u2019 asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">Because Sutanto has not met the standard for asylum, he necessarily cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Finally, Sutanto does not raise any substantive challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
