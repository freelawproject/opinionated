We will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not discuss the facts or procedural history of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In their Third Amended Complaint, the Dutkevitches allege that Defendants discriminated against Vincent on the basis of his disability by failing to make reasonable modifications to their enrollment policies in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\u201cRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq </em>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Dutkevitches seek damages in excess of $75,000 for \u201cthe loss of Vincent\u2019s vocational technical education ... [that] would have increased Vincent\u2019s strengths, preferences and interests in the computer field,\u201d and their \u201cpresent financial hardship\u201d for the cost of Vincent\u2019s post-secondary program at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. App. at 44^45.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The RA and ADA have parallel requirements. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. <em>See also, e.g., Helen L. v. DiDario, </em>46 F.3d 325, 330 n. 7 (3d Cir.1995). The parties do not dispute that Vincent is a qualified individual with a disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the dispute centers on whether Defendants denied Vincent a vocational education because of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">The District Court correctly concluded that the Dutkevitches failed to state a claim for disability discrimination because \u201cneither [Pittston] nor [West Side] owed any legal obligation to Vincent during any relevant time of this case.\u201d <em>Dutkevitch v. PA Cyber Charter Sch., et al., </em>No. 3:CV-07-1672, slip op. at 18 (M.D.Pa. Apr. 8, 2009). Vincent was enrolled with the Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, which operated as Vincent\u2019s Local Education Agency (\u201cLEA\u201d) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq. </em>Therefore, the Charter School was tasked with providing Vincent with a free appropriate public education and Defendants were not permitted to intervene. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1412(b), 1414(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">The Dutkevitches argue that \u201cboth the [RA] and the ADA impose an affirmative duty not to discriminate that is distinct from any duties a school district may owe to a student under the IDEA.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20. We disagree. The lack of a duty to Vincent under the IDEA on the part of Pittston and West Side bears directly on whether Defendants violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>their obligations not to discriminate against Vincent.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Pittston\u2019s failure to recommend that Vincent attend a vocational-technical school had nothing to do with Vincent\u2019s disability. Rather, Pittston withheld recommendation because it \u201cwas not Vincent\u2019s LEA\u201d and thus \u201cwas not required to make sure Vincent received ... computer training.\u201d <em>Dutkevitch, </em>No. 3:CV-07-1672, slip op. at 18. Likewise, West Side\u2019s refusal to give Vincent\u2019s mother an application to the school had nothing to do with Vincent\u2019s disability. Rather, West Side\u2019s decision was based on West Side\u2019s admissions policies that are consistent with federal law, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j), and apply equally to all students who, like Vincent, seek to enroll in a vocational school outside then-district of residence, <em>see </em>24 P.S. \u00a7 18-1847. In other words, as the District Court concluded, \u201cthere are insufficient allegations that Defendants withheld from Vincent any educational services or benefits they owed to him because of his disabilities and that they excluded Vincent from any school programs or activities available to other students.\u201d <em>Dutkevitch, </em>No. 3:CV-07-1672, slip op. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We further conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Dutkevitches\u2019 request for leave to amend the complaint a fourth time on the grounds that amendment on the exhaustion of remedies issue would be futile and would cause undue delay and prejudice the Defendants. <em>See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dammann &amp; Co., </em>594 F.3d 238, 243 n. 3 (3d Cir.2010) (setting forth abuse-of-discretion standard of review of an order denying leave to amend); <em>Shane v. Fauver, </em>213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir.2000) (setting forth justifications for denial of leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the District Court dismissing the Dutkevitches\u2019 Third Amended Complaint with respect to claims for money damages under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim for injunctive relief under the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367, and this court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636(c)(3) and 1291. This court exercises plenary review over a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In so doing, we \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, </em>578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir.2009) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-16\">. The court thanks pro bono counsel, Dechert LLP, for their able representation of the Dutkevitches in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-17\">. The Dutkevitches did not specifically assert a claim under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AZd\">. Neither do the parties dispute that Defendants receive federal financial assistance, which is also necessary to establish a violation of the RA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
