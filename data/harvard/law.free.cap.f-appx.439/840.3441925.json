Dawson, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b862-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">Appellants, plaintiffs before the district court, are a group of foreign investors that invested in two funds organized under the laws of the Bahamas. All of the appellants\u2019 transactions were conducted with companies organized under the laws of foreign countries. The two Bahamian investment funds, however, invested their assets with Bernard L. Madoff. Madoff, of course, did not run a legitimate investment company but instead operated a ponzi scheme. When that scheme unravelled, the Bahamian funds went bankrupt, and the appellants\u2019 investments were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">The procedural history of this case is set forth in detail in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion. For our purposes, it is sufficient to say that the proceedings were eventually consolidated into a Multi-District Litigation, which was held in the Southern District of Florida. Following extensive briefing, the district court concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over six defendants, and further that the entire case was due to be dismissed under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>Appellants appeal these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">This Court \u201cmay only reverse a district court\u2019s dismissal based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>if it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc., </em>578 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Membreno v. Costa Crociere S.p.A., </em>425 F.3d 932, 935-36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>(11th Cir.2005)). It is well settled that abuse of discretion review is \u201cextremely limited\u201d and \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When this Court employs the abuse of discretion standard, it \u201cmust affirm unless [it] find[s] that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Upon a thorough review of the briefs and the district court\u2019s opinion, and with the benefit of oral argument, we hold that the appellants have not carried their heavy burden to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds. Rather, the court committed no errors of judgment, clear or otherwise, nor did it apply the wrong legal standard. <em>See Aldana, </em>578 F.3d at 1288. We thus share the district court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat Ireland is an adequate alternative forum and that the relevant private and public factors weigh strongly in favor of <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal in favor of Ireland,\u201d and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. Because we may affirm on any ground supported in the record, we do not reach the district court's conclusions regarding personal jurisdiction. <em>See Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharms., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
