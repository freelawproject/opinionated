We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1130-31 (9th Cir.2007), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because Lin filed it over three years after the BIA issued its final removal order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Lin failed to demonstrate changed country conditions, including a change in laws or the enforcement of family planning laws, to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 988-989 (9th Cir.2009); <em>He, </em>501 F.3d at 1132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">We reject Lin\u2019s contention that the BIA erred in its evaluation of the evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). We also reject Lin\u2019s contention that the BIA did not adequately examine her evidence because she has not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
