Flores was sentenced within the Guidelines to 57 months of imprisonment, and Lozano was sentenced below the Guidelines to 36 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-19\">According to their stipulated factual resumes, Flores and Lozano conspired to export firearms and ammunition from the United States to Mexico. Specifically, both Flores and Lozano stipulated that Lozano received, through Flores\u2019s arrangements, six Colt carbine rifles, a Colt .38 super pistol, 200 pistol magazines, and 25 AR-15 magazines. Both Flores and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Lozano further admitted that the weapons were designated as prohibited items on the United States Munitions List (USML).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The appellants now argue that the district court erred in including firearm magazines in determining their base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(l) because magazines are not included on the USML. They contend that, as a result, less than ten, non-fully automatic weapons were involved in the offense, thereby making them eligible for a reduced base offense level under \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(2). In addition, Flores argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider his medical condition when determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Ordinarily, we review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 362 (5th Cir.2010). However, if a defendant does not preserve an issue for review in the district court, review of the issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 286-87 (5th Cir.2008). To preserve error, an objection must be sufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature of the alleged error and to provide an opportunity for correction. <em>United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Neither Flores nor Lozano argued in the district court, as they do now, that the magazines should not have been included in determining the base offense level under \u00a7 2M5.2, because magazines are not listed on the USML. Thus, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See id. </em>To prevail on plain-error review, the appellants must show that an error occurred, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected their substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">We note that there is no clear authority in this circuit on whether empty firearm magazines are components for purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2M.5.2. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Galvan-Revuelta, </em>958 F.2d 66, 69 (5th Cir.1992) (discussing application of \u00a7 2M5.2 to offenses involving only ammunition); <em>United States v. Nissen, </em>928 F.2d 690, 695 (5th Cir.1991) (finding no error in district court\u2019s determining that the exportation of a heater designed for the F-4 Phantom aircraft warranted the application of a higher base offense level under \u00a7 2M5.2, because although not \u201csophisticated weaponry,\u201d the heater was designed for \u201csophisticated weaponry\u201d). Thus, because there is no clear authority in this circuit, any error by the district court in including the magazines and applying the base offense level provided by \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(l), was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Potts, </em>644 F.3d 233, 236-38 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, Flores and Lozano cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2M5.2 was plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">As for Flores\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable, Flores did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court. Thus, as he recognizes, review is for plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 1428-29; <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">To rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence, Flores must show that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Flores has failed to do so. The record reflects that in determining Flores\u2019s sentence, the district court considered, among other things, Flores\u2019s sentencing memorandum and Flores\u2019s testimony regarding his physical impairments. Flores\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed and with the district court\u2019s implicit weighing of the sentencing factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
