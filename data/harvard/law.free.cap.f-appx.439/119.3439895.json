Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Barkley, at all times relevant to his complaint, was incarcerated in the Management Control Unit (\u201cMCP\u201d), a close custody unit, at the New Jersey State Prison (\u201cNJSP\u201d) in Trenton, New Jersey. In March 2007, Barkley was determined to be a threat to other inmates and placed on \u201cnon-eongregate\u201d status. Inmates on non-congregate status are considered high-risk inmates, and, therefore, are not allowed to recreate with other inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On June 14, 2007, Barkley commenced an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 against several prison employees (the \u201cNJSP Defendants\u201d) alleging that he was not being given adequate outdoor recreation time. Barkley noted that section 10A:5-2.21(a) of the New Jersey Administrative Code provides for a minimum of two hours per week of exercise and recreation for inmates housed in the MCU, and also states that \u201cevery effort shall be made to provide at least five hours per week unless compelling security, safety or weather reasons dictate otherwise.\u201d <em>See </em>N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 10A:5-2.21(a). Barkley claimed that he was not receiving the minimum two hours per week, and that the prison\u2019s failure to comply with the regulations amounted to deliberate indifference to his health and safety in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment. Several months later, Barkley filed an amended complaint notifying the court that the NJSP Defendants had issued a new recreation schedule. Barkley maintained, however, that the new schedule remained insufficient under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In December 2007, the NJSP Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment arguing, among other things, that the prison\u2019s restrictions on exercise did not violate Barkley\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights because the prison\u2019s efforts to provide additional exercise to the non-congregate MCU inmates demonstrated that the prison had not been deliberately indifferent to their need for exercise. The following month, in January 2008, the NJSP Defendants supplemented their motion with evidence that the prison had again increased recreation periods for noncongregate inmates so that Barkley now had more than the minimum amount of exercise set forth under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In February 2008, Barkley filed a third amended complaint, bringing a retaliation claim against the NJSP and several new defendants. Barkley alleged that, since filing his original complaint, prison officials had searched his cell and reassessed his status in retaliation for his having filed suit against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In March 2008, the District Court granted the NJSP Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Court did not rule on Barkley\u2019s retaliation claim, however. The NJSP Defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment on Barkley\u2019s retaliation claim and, in a February 2011 decision, the District Court granted their motion. The Court concluded that Barkley had not demonstrated that he exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing suit. Barkley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and may summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court if the appeal presents <em>no </em>substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s order of summary judgment. <em>See Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We agree with the District Court that summary judgment was appropriate as to Barkley\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. An inmate making a Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim must show that the alleged violation deprived him of the most minimal level of life\u2019s necessities, and that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference to his health or safety. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 304-05, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The District Court determined that Barkley failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the limitations were the product of deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (1994) (requiring a successful Eighth Amendment claim based on inhumane conditions of confinement to include a showing that prison officials knew of a substantial risk of serious harm and failed to take reasonable measures to avoid the harm). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">As the District Court explained, the NJSP Defendants submitted evidence demonstrating that they reevaluated and readjusted the recreation schedule for non-congregate MSU inmates on two separate occasions after Barkley filed his complaint. Indeed, as of January 2008, the prison had increased the exercise schedule for non-congregate MSU inmates like Barkley so that he was receiving more than the minimum amount of exercise set forth under the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Wishon v. Gammon, </em>978 F.2d 446, 449 (8th Cir.1992) (forty-five minutes of exercise per week not constitutionally infirm); <em>Knight v. Armontrout, </em>878 F.2d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir.1989) (holding that denial of outdoor recreation for thirteen days not cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">We also agree with the District Court that summary judgment was appropriate as to Barkley\u2019s retaliation claim. Barkley alleged that after he filed his original complaint, prison officials searched his cell, reassessed his status, and confiscated his mail in retaliation for his having filed his lawsuit. During an October 2007 search, officials found a pen that they believed had been modified for use as a weapon. Barkley was served with an administrative charge, but the charge was dropped because of a delay in serving him.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The District Court properly found that Wilson failed to exhaust this claim administratively before filing his complaint. Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) prisoners must first properly exhaust their administrative remedies before filing an action under section 1983. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 83, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">In order to comply with the PLRA, an inmate must exhaust all available administrative remedies, including intermediate or final administrative review of a prison\u2019s decision. <em>Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Barkley filed several Inmate Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>quest Forms (\u201cIRFs\u201d) relating to his claim of retaliation, but he failed to appeal their rejections. Barkley does not dispute that he did not comply with the administrative appeals process, but argues on appeal that he effectively completed the process when NJSP Defendants Ricci and Hayman \u201cexamined and ruled\u201d on his claims. However, Barkley has not provided any evidence demonstrating that those Defendants ever reviewed, let alone ruled on, his grievance. Under these circumstances, we agree with the District Court that Barkley failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10. 6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. We have held that the denial of exercise or recreation may result in a constitutional violation. <em>See Peterkin v. Jeffes, 855 </em>F.2d 1021, 1031 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-15\">. The District Court also properly denied as moot Barkley\u2019s claim for injunctive relief given that Barkley was already receiving the amount of exercise time that he sought in his complaint. <em>See In re Surrick, </em>338 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
