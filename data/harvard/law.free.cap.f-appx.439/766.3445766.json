GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">In 2007 an Oklahoma state court sentenced Harry Miller, Jr., to prison for making a lewd or indecent proposal to a child. In 2010, he filed an application for state post-conviction relief and, when that failed, a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In the latter petition Mr. Miller acknowledged his filing was untimely, given the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), but he argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling because he had limited access to a prison law library and required more time to learn how to type and prepare his petition. The district court held that Mr. Miller\u2019s circumstances did not warrant equitable tolling, dismissed the petition as untimely, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Now in this court, Mr. Miller renews his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-21\">When the district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition on procedural grounds we may issue a COA only if \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). That standard is not met here. Equitable tolling is available only \u201cin rare and exceptional circumstances\u201d such as \u201cwhen an adversary\u2019s conduct ... prevents a prisoner from timely filing.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSimple excusable neglect\u201d \u2014 including neglect based on \u201ca claim of insufficient access to relevant law\u201d \u2014 \u201cis not sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the district court recognized, however, that is all Mr. Miller alleged in the district court. Before us, Mr. Miller also argues for the first time that he has psychiatric conditions that made timely filing impossible \u2014 but there are no facts in the record supporting this claim and we cannot say that the district court erred in failing to consider this ground for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Mr. Miller\u2019s application for a COA is denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-16\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
