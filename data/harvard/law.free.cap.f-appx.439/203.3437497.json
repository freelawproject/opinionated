The district court calculated Wilkins\u2019 Guidelines range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) at 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment, departed upward pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n,19(A)), and 4A1.3(a)(l), p.s., and sentenced Wilkins to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Wilkins challenges the factual basis supporting her guilty plea and the departure sentence imposed by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Because Wilkins did not move in the district court to withdraw her guilty plea, the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Rule 11(b)(3) provides that, \u201c[b]efore entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). As we have explained, \u201c[t]he rule is intended to ensure that the court make clear exactly what a defendant admits to, and whether those admissions are factually sufficient to constitute the alleged crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Mastrapa, </em>509 F.3d 652, 659-60 (4th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In making a Rule 11(b)(3) determination, the district court has broad discretion and need not conduct a trial; moreover, the district court is not constrained to rely only on the plea colloquy, but may conclude that a factual basis exists from anything that appears on the record. <em>United States v. Ketchum, </em>550 F.3d 363, 366-67 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991) (noting that Rule 11 does not require the district court to establish through its colloquy that a factual basis exists for the guilty plea). The district court \u201cneed only be subjectively satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>fied that there is a sufficient factual basis for a conclusion that the defendant committed all of the elements of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude there was ample evidentiary support for the district court\u2019s factual basis determination. First and foremost, in her plea agreement, Wilkins stipulated to entering into an agreement with others to \u201cknowingly use the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud\u201d and to \u201cknowingly execute a scheme to defraud a financial institution and to obtain moneys under the custody and control of a financial institution by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.\u201d (J.A. 45). At no point in the proceedings did Wilkins challenge this stipulation. Moreover, Wilkins\u2019 presentence report (PSR) detailed her knowledge of, and participation in, the charged conspiracy, and Wilkins did not object to that portion of the PSR. Further, Wilkins testimony at the Rule 11 hearing squarely belies her contention that there was insufficient evidentiary support for the district court\u2019s finding that she participated in the charged conspiracy. Accordingly, we hold the district court properly determined there was a factual basis for the guilty plea. <em>DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate review of a sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">A district court may depart upward from the Guidelines range under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), p.s., when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), p.s.; <em>United States v. Whorley, </em>550 F.3d 326, 341 (4th Cir.2008) (noting that an under-representative criminal history category is an encouraged basis for departure). In determining whether a departure sentence is appropriate in such circumstances, the Guidelines state that a district court may consider prior sentences not used in the criminal history calculation, prior sentences of \u201csubstantially more than one year\u201d for independent crimes committed at different times, prior similar misconduct resolved by civil or administrative adjudication, charges pending at the time of the offense, or prior similar conduct that did not result in a conviction. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The Guidelines also permit an upward departure where the fraud offense level substantially understates the seriousness of the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n,19(A)). One of the factors to consider in this determination is whether the \u201coffense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm,\u201d including \u201ca substantial invasion of privacy interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.19 (A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In this case, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Wilkins\u2019 criminal history category failed to reflect adequately the seriousness of her criminal history and the likelihood of her recidivism. Wilkins had over ten unscored convictions not included in her criminal history category, a lengthy criminal history replete with recidivism, and numerous convictions involving fraud. Moreover, the record supports the conclusion that Wilkins\u2019 offense level understated the seriousness of the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Wilkins created over 250 fraudulent bank accounts and used over 115 legitimate social security numbers to set up those accounts. We agree with the district court that the potential financial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to the affected individuals is \u201cimmeasurable.\u201d (J.A.73). Thus, the district court did not err when it decided to depart upward from Wilkins\u2019 advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">When reviewing the reasonableness of an upward departure sentence, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cEven if we would have reached a different sentencing result on our own, this fact alone is \u2018insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 474 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. The district court should impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense, and the need to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence, to protect the public from further crimes, and to provide the defendant with adequate rehabilitation or medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that, in imposing the upward departure sentence, the district court provided an adequate individualized assessment of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in relation to Wilkins and her criminal conduct. The district court took into consideration Wilkins\u2019 prior criminal conduct, which demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, the serious nature of her offense, and the need for the sentence to deter Wilkins and protect the public. Moreover, in departing upward three criminal history categories, the district court followed the correct incremental approach, which requires the district court to refer first to the next higher category and explain why it fails to reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s record before considering a higher category. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 884 (4th Cir.1992). Finally, considering the potential harm in play, the district court\u2019s modest two-level increase under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.l9(A)), was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For these reasons, we affirm Wilkins\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
