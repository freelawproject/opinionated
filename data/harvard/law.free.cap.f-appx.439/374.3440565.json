Ye has abandoned any challenge to the denial of relief under the CAT by failing to adequately argue the issue in his petition for review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Ye sought immigration relief based on his alleged persecution or fear of persecution on account of his violation of China\u2019s family planning policy and his support of Falun Gong. The IJ denied relief after finding that Ye was not a credible witness, and the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, holding that Ye had failed to meet his burden of proving eligibility for any relief sought. Ye challenges those negative credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">This court reviews an immigration court\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c \u2018[A]n IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (quoting <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008)). This court will \u201cdefer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ty of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Ye\u2019s testimony was in some respects internally inconsistent, that the testimony conflicted in some respects with Ye\u2019s prior statements, and that Ye had failed to mention in prior statements his 12-hour detention and beating as a result of his support of Falun Gong. To the extent that Ye argues that his corroborating evidence was not properly considered, the BIA observed that the IJ properly considered the corroborating documents Ye submitted but observed that his submissions did not ameliorate Ye\u2019s failure to present \u201c \u2018otherwise credible testimony.\u2019 \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(i)(B)(ii). The IJ found the corroborating evidence insufficient to meet Ye\u2019s burden given that his testimony was \u201cincredible, unreliable, and he rapidly changes it from one question and answer to the next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We will not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537. Substantial evidence supports the determination of the IJ and BIA denying Ye\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 536-37. In light of the inconsistencies and omissions in Ye\u2019s testimony and statements, the evidence is not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Ye argues that the IJ was hostile and failed to act as a neutral and impartial adjudicator. The Due Process Clause entitles aliens to due process in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 292, 302 (5th Cir.2002). Although the absence of a neutral arbiter can be the basis for a due process claim, <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 540, Ye has not demonstrated such a violation. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination \u201ccannot be disturbed simply because [Ye] believes the IJ was unfriendly or even hostile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
