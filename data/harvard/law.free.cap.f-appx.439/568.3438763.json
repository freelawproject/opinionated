We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">The agency did not abuse its discretion by denying Sosa Rivas y Perez\u2019s motion to reconsider where he failed to establish any error of fact or law in the IJ\u2019s previous decision denying his motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(2); <em>Sembiring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir.2007) (in a motion to reopen based on lack of notice, a petitioner must \u201cproduce[ ] sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of effective service by regular mail\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-21\">To the extent Sosa Rivas y Perez\u2019s motion to reconsider was based on newly submitted evidence, the agency did not abuse its discretion by construing the motion as a second motion to reopen and by denying it as numerically barred. <em>See Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 793 (BIA may construe motions based on their underlying purpose); <em>Vega v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.2010) (purpose of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>reconsider is not to submit new evidence); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (only one motion to reopen in absentia removal proceedings is permitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Sosa Rivas y Perez\u2019s contention that the BIA erred by failing to remand to the IJ fails because he did not request a remand in connection with his BIA appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Sosa Rivas y Perez\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
