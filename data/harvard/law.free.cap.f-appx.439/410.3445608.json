He argues that the district court erred in upwardly departing from the advisory guideline range of 33-41 months based on the inadequacy of his criminal history category. He also maintains that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We review the sentence for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Reasonableness review, in the context of a guideline departure, requires this court to evaluate, for abuse of discretion, both the decision to depart upward and the extent of the departure. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure is not an abuse of discretion if the reasons advance the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) and are justified by the particular facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Given Valdez Villegas\u2019s extensive criminal record and the lack of deterrent effect from prior sentences, combined with the large number of recorded deportations that did not involve convictions for illegal reentry, the court did not abuse its discretion by departing based on its finding that Valdez Villegas\u2019s criminal history category underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood of recidivism. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Contrary to Valdez Ville-gas\u2019s assertions, the district court did not treat the guidelines as mandatory and did not ignore his assertion that he was entitled to a lower sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although he claims the district court failed to consider the sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(6), Valdez Villegas has failed to present evidence showing that his sentence differs from those received by such defendants. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Valdez Villegas has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable or that the district court abused its discretion in determining the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 154-55 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48. Additionally, his challenges to the constitutionality of the guideline regime and his sentence are unavailing. <em>See United States v. Jasso, </em>634 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3004, 180 L.Ed.2d 837 (2011); <em>United States. v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 255 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
