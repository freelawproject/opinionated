On remand, the district court entered a modified injunction in conformity with our directive. The union in response sought such a determination from the Board. At the Board\u2019s request, both sides submitted position papers to the Board. The union argued in its position paper that the Board lacks jurisdiction over its dispute with the airlines. That argument triggered a motion by the airlines that the district court vacate the modified injunction, on the ground that in challenging the Board\u2019s jurisdiction the union was acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-21\">In an order of July 29, 2011, the district court rejected the airlines\u2019 motion. The court acted properly. Should the Board decide that it lacks jurisdiction, thereby returning the dispute between the parties to the limbo that led us to modify the injunction, the airlines can seek relief in the district court. The appeal is thus premature. It should not have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-22\">Judge Adelman sensibly added: \u201cif the National Mediation Board construes the union\u2019s position as a request for voluntary dismissal of the application and dismisses the application without resolving either the jurisdictional question or the merits and the union does not object to the Board\u2019s action, then I might have to reconsider whether the union has violated the injunction\u2019s condition.\u201d This was a proper warning to the union. No more is necessary at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
