In these decisions and orders, dated December 9, 2005, December 27, 2005, June 18, 2007, May 9, 2008, and September 21, 2009, and in its October 13, 2009 final judgment, the District Court granted summary judgment to defendants-appellees the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Social Security Administration (jointly, \u201cdefendants\u201d) with respect to Robert\u2019s FOIA claims and enjoined him from filing further complaints raising FOIA claims without leave of the court. This appeal raises two principal issues: (1) whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing Robert\u2019s various FOIA claims; and (2) whether the District Court abused its discretion in enjoining Robert from filing future FOIA actions without prior leave of the court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under FOIA. <em>Nat\u2019l Council of La Raza v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>411 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cIn order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA case, the defending agency has the burden of showing that its search was adequate....\u201d <em>Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>19 F.3d 807, 812 (2d Cir.1994). \u201cAffidavits or declarations supplying facts indicating that the agency has conducted a thorough search ... are sufficient to sustain the agency\u2019s burden,\u201d and we accord such affidavits a \u201c \u2018presumption of good faith.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n, </em>926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C.Cir.1991)). This presumption \u201c \u2018cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other documents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grand Cent. P\u2019ship, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>166 F.3d 473, 489 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>SafeCard, </em>926 F.2d at 1200).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">Having conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the District Court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment with respect to each of Robert\u2019s FOIA claims, for substantially the same reasons stated by the District Court in its careful and well-reasoned memoranda of December 12, 2005, May 9, 2008, and September 22, 2009. <em>See </em>Mem. <em>&amp; </em>Order, <em>Robert v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>No. 05-CV-2543 (NGG), 2005 WL 3371480 (E.D.N.Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Dec.12, 2005), ECF No. 16; Mem. &amp; Order, <em>id., </em>2008 WL 2039433 (E.D.N.Y. May 9, 2008), ECF No. 74; Mem. &amp; Order, <em>id. </em>(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2009), ECF No. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">With respect to Robert\u2019s arguments that the case should be remanded to allow the District Court to reconsider its ruling in light of purportedly new standards for handling FOIA requests, Robert has not explained how these standards would undermine, or even apply to, the District Court\u2019s decisions. Though the \u201cMarch 19, 2009 FOIA Guidelines\u201d issued by the Attorney General support a presumption in favor of disclosure, they did not change the existing law applied by the District Court. <em>See Nat\u2019l Council of La Raza, </em>411 F.3d at 355 (noting FOIA\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of disclosure\u201d). Similarly, Executive Order 13526, which purportedly established a new internal review procedure regarding the release of classified documents, does not apply to this case because none of the documents sought by Robert in the consolidated proceedings below were withheld based on a FOIA exemption related to classified information. Finally, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re City of New York </em>is inapposite, as that case involved application of the law-enforcement privilege to documents sought by a party during discovery, which is not at issue here. <em>See </em>607 F.3d 923, 928 (2d Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">With respect to Robert\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in finding that the DOJ had exercised due diligence in searching for documents responsive to his requests for \u201cIMC Investigation Final Report\u201d documents, the <em>\u201cBarrett </em>nonacquiescence policy\u201d documents, and the <em>\u201cChristensen </em>nonacquiescence policy\u201d documents, we again agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that the DOJ demonstrated through its supplemental declarations that it had conducted searches that were reasonably calculated to locate the requested documents (assuming any exist), and that Robert offered only conelusory allegations that were insufficient to rebut the DOJ\u2019s showing. <em>See </em>Mem. &amp; Order at 2-5, <em>Robert, </em>No. 05-CV-2543, (E.D.N.Y. Sept.22, 2009), ECF No. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">II. Filing Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u201cA district court may, in its discretion, impose sanctions against litigants who abuse the judicial process.\u201d <em>Shafii v. British Airways, PLC, </em>83 F.3d 566, 571 (2d Cir.1996); <em>see also In re Martin-Trigona, </em>737 F.2d 1254, 1261 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201cFederal courts have both the inherent power and the constitutional obligation to protect their jurisdiction from conduct which impairs their ability to carry out Article III functions.\u201d). However, a district court \u201cmay not impose a filing injunction on a litigant ... without providing the litigant with notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Iwachiw v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>396 F.3d 525, 529 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Moates v. Barkley, </em>147 F.3d 207, 208 (2d Cir.1998)). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to impose a filing injunction, or \u201cleave-to-file\u201d sanctions, under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. <em>See United States v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>266 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir.2001) (injunction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>All Writs Act reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Gollomp v. Spitzer, </em>568 F.3d 355, 368 (2d Cir.2009) (imposition of sanctions reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d); <em>of. Sims v. Blot, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining term of art \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Here, the District Court did not err or abuse its discretion in enjoining Robert from filing further complaints raising FOIA claims without leave of the court, given Robert\u2019s history of filing vexatious, burdensome, and meritless FOIA complaints. <em>See Safir v. United States Lines, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 19, 24 (2d Cir.1986) (describing the factors district courts should consider in determining whether to restrict a litigant\u2019s future access to the courts). To the extent that Robert argues that he did not receive sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard, his argument is belied by the record. Robert was explicitly placed on notice of the possibility of a filing injunction during a pre-motion conference, was served the defendants\u2019 motion to impose a filing injunction, and responded to the defendants\u2019 motion. There is no support for Robert\u2019s argument that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">However, we appreciate Robert\u2019s concern that the December 2005 non-final \u201cjudgment\u201d entered by the Clerk of Court subsequent to the District Court\u2019s filing injunction could be construed as inconsistent with that injunction. Although the District Court\u2019s opinion of December 12, 2005, ordered that \u201c[a]ny future FOIA <em>complaint(s) </em>by Robert ... must be submitted to my attention as a Motion for Leave to File,\u201d <em>Robert, </em>2005 WL 3371480, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.12, 2005), ECF No. 16 (emphasis added), the subsequent order entered by the Clerk of Court granted defendants\u2019 motion \u201cto enjoin plaintiff from further FOIA <em>request </em>[sic] without prior leave of the Court,\u201d Clerk\u2019s Judgment, <em>id. </em>(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2005), ECF No. 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">It is clear that the District Court intended only to enjoin Robert from filing further FOIA <em>complaints </em>without leave of the court and not to enjoin Robert from filing FOIA <em>requests </em>with appropriate government agencies or officials. Therefore, we exercise our authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 to modify the District Court\u2019s final judgment, dated October 13, 2009, to clarify that the filing injunction entered on December 15, 2005, applies only to <em>complaints </em>raising FOIA claims filed in district court, and not to FOIA <em>requests </em>directed to a government agency or official. In doing so, we do not address, much less preclude or comment upon, any requests that may be made in the future, upon an appropriate record, to broaden the reach of the District Court\u2019s injunction to include matters other than FOIA complaints (including, <em>inter alia, </em>FOIA <em>requests </em>directed to government agencies or officials).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">We have considered Robert\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby MODIFIED, and, as modified, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. We note that the District Court did apply FOIA exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(5), in granting summary judgment with respect to two of Robert's requests, which sought DOJ \"casefile notes\u201d relating to <em>Ruppert v. Bowen, </em>871 F.2d 1172 (2d Cir.1989), a case Robert filed as a practicing attorney, and <em>Robert v. Holz, </em>No. 85-CV-4205 (LDW) (E.D.N.Y.), an earlier FOIA action filed by Robert. We agree with the District Court that the withheld pages constituted attorney work product and were properly withheld under FOIA exemption 5. <em>See Robert, </em>2008 WL 2039433, at *4-5 (E.D.N.Y. May 9, 2008), ECF No. 74; <em>id., </em>2005 WL 3371480, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.12, 2005), ECF No. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
