Phelan, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his complaint asserting claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal, and repeat them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>This Court reviews a district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint de novo. <em>See McEachin v. McGuinnis, </em>357 F.3d 197, 200 (2d Cir.2004). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although all allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A claim will have \u201cfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, plaintiffs proceed pro se, courts must construe their complaints liberally, reading them with \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d and interpreting them to raise the \u201cstrongest [claims] that they <em>suggest.\u201d Triestman v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Title II of the ADA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. \u201cTo prove a violation of Title II, a party must therefore establish: (1) that he is a \u2018qualified individual\u2019 with a disability; (2) that he was excluded from participation in a public entity\u2019s sendees, programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public entity; and (3) that such exclusion or discrimination was due to his disability.\u201d <em>Hargrave v. Vermont, </em>340 F.3d 27, 34-35 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The district court concluded that Phelan, who is currently incarcerated, failed to satisfy these requirements at the pleading stage because his \u201cconclusory allegations that he was discriminated against <em>because of </em>his disability [were] insufficient to state a plausible claim for discrimination under the ADA.\u201d The court therefore dismissed Phelan\u2019s complaint sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Having conducted an independent review of the record and relevant case law, we conclude that the district court erred. Phelan alleges in his complaint that the defendants \u2014 various prison employees\u2014 failed to \u201cmake alterations to accommodate [his] disability,\u201d retaliated against him, denied him his \u201cright to receive mental health care and to see a psychiatrist,\u201d and harassed him, all because of his disability. <em>See </em>Compl. 1-6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleges that he has \u201cbeen diagnosed with having Attention Deficet [sic] Disorder, and a Traumatic Brain Injury,\u201d that he has \u201ca nerological impairment [sic],\u201d and that he \u201cwas on SSD + SSI my whole adult life, and was receiving services from VESID\u201d (presumably a reference to Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities). <em>Id. </em>at 5. Thus, Phelan has pled sufficient facts about his disabilities to establish, at least at the pleading stage, that he is an ADA-qualified individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">In addition, Phelan has alleged that he was denied access to public services at the prison, that he suffered retaliation when he complained, and that his alleged mistreatment was due to his disability. He alleges, for example, that a prison psychologist \u201cflatly denie[d] [him] treatment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 19, that another doctor told him to \u201cget out, we don\u2019t treat retards,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21, and that a correction officer refused his request to file a grievance, allegedly telling Phelan: \u201cOh, you\u2019re that fucking retard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>that wants treatment. We don\u2019t allow fucking inmates to file grievances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Other correction officers allegedly told Phelan that \u201cthey don\u2019t allow retards to file grievances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 9-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Taken together, these allegations and others in the complaint satisfy the pleading requirements for an ADA discrimination claim, particularly one brought by a pro se plaintiff. Phelan has alleged specific facts to show that he is an ADA-covered individual; that he was excluded from participation in mental health, library, and other services at the prison, and suffered retaliation when he attempted to complain about his treatment; and that the alleged discriminatory treatment and retaliation were due to his disability. Phelan\u2019s complaint sets out sufficient facts to allow a court \u201cto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. The district court therefore erred in dismissing Phelan\u2019s pro se complaint sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this order. Upon remand, the district court should consolidate this case with Phelan\u2019s parallel 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit, <em>Phelan v. Hersh, </em>10-cv-11 (N.D.N.Y.), and appoint counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\">.
