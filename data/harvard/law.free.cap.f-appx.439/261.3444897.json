The charges stemmed from McLean\u2019s possession of a firearm following the commission of a robbery by two men with whom McLean was riding in a car. On appeal, McLean contends that the district court erred when it applied a four-level sentencing enhancement for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a sentencing enhancement for clear error, and the legal interpretations of the United States Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>601 F.3d 252, 254 (4th Cir.2010). To support an enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the defendant committed another felony offense; and (2) the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that offense. <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 407-11 (4th Cir.2003). A firearm is used or possessed in connection with another felony offense \u201cif it facilitates or has a tendency to facilitate the felony offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 829 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">McLean does not dispute that he possessed the firearm; rather, he argues that the Government presented insufficient evidence at sentencing to show that he committed another felony offense. To the contrary, we hold that the district court did not clearly err when it found by a preponderance of the evidence that McLean possessed a firearm in connection with being an accessory after the fact to robbery with a dangerous weapon, a felony under North Carolina law. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-7, 14-87 (2009). Under North Carolina Law, the offense of accessory after the fact consists of (1) the principal\u2019s commission of the underlying felony; (2) the defendant\u2019s \u201cpersonal assistance to the principal to aid in his escaping detection, arrest, or punishment\u201d; and (3) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the commission of the felony. <em>State v. McGee, </em>197 N.C.App. 366, 676 S.E.2d 662, 667 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">McLean argues that the Government failed to produce sufficient evidence of this third element \u2014 that McLean had knowledge of the robbery. However, the Government offered evidence showing that a robbery took place, that McLean heard a gunshot and saw his friends leave a house with a large quantity of marijuana, and that McLean thereafter attempted to hide the firearm used in the robbery. McLean did not offer any evidence to dispute the Government\u2019s showing. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that McLean possessed the firearm in connection with being an accessory after the fact to robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
