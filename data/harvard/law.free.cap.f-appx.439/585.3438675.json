Employee Health and Welfare Benefit Plan (collectively, \u201cAetna\u201d). The district court concluded that Aetna did not abuse its discretion in denying Letvinuck short-term and long-term disability benefits. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s choice and application of the standard of review to decisions by ERISA fiduciaries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955, 962 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Because the Plan unambiguously provided Aetna with discretion, we review Aetna\u2019s decision to terminate benefits for abuse of discretion. <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 108, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008); <em>Abatie, </em>458 F.3d at 963. We consider Aetna\u2019s structural conflict of interest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> along with other case-specific factors, in determining whether the district court applied the correct level of skepticism to Aetna\u2019s decision to deny benefits. <em>Montour v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>588 F.3d 623, 630-31 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">We remanded this case to the district court to apply Abatie\u2019s \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review and to consider several factors that we believed might contribute to Aetna\u2019s conflict of interest. <em>Letvinuck v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>319 Fed.Appx. 661 (9th Cir.2009). We now hold that those factors are sufficient to enhance the skepticism with which to view Aetna\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">First, Aetna gave no weight to the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) decision that Letvinuck was disabled, nor did it provide an explanation. Although Aetna is not bound by the SSA\u2019s disability determination, \u201cnot distinguishing the SSA\u2019s contrary conclusion may indicate a failure to consider relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Montour, </em>588 F.3d at 635. The SSA award was not mentioned by Aetna or Dr. Burton in initially denying Letvinuck\u2019s benefits. During the appeal process, Aetna, Dr. Anfield, and Dr. Schroeder acknowledged that Letvinuck had received an SSA award, but no further explanation was provided. Only when Letvinuck called after Aetna had denied her appeal did Aetna offer an explanation by trying to distinguish its stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>dard for disability from the SSA\u2019s. In sum, \u201c[e]vidence of a Social Security award of disability benefits is of sufficient significance that failure to address it offers support that the plan administrator\u2019s denial was arbitrary, an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Salomaa v. Honda Long Term Disability Plan, </em>642 F.3d 666, 679 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Second, Aetna failed adequately to tell Letvinuck what \u201cadditional material or information [ ] was necessary for her to perfect the claim, and to do so in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.\u201d <em>Saffon v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Long Term Disability Plan, </em>522 F.3d 863, 870 (9th Cir.2008) (alterations and quotations omitted). Aetna substantially based its denial of benefits on the lack of recent neuropsychological testing that objectively showed Letvinuck\u2019s disability. It also cited Dr. McCleary\u2019s 2004 neuropsychological tests as evidence that Letvinuck was not disabled. However, Aetna did not ask Letvinuck for more recent neuropsychological test results that showed her disability \u201cat a time when [she] had a fair chance to present evidence on this point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871. <em>See also Salomaa, </em>642 F.3d at 679 (\u201c[T]he plan administrator denied the claim largely on account of absence of objective medical evidence, yet failed to tell Salomaa what medical evidence it wanted.\u201d). Aetna\u2019s voice-mail at Dr. Weiner\u2019s office asking for \u201cclinically objective findings demonstrating ... a further decline\u201d in her disability was not communicated to Letvinuek. <em>See Saffon, </em>522 F.3d at 873 (communicating with a doctor rather than the Plan participant is not meaningful dialogue). To the extent that Letvinuck did provide neuropsychological test results, Aetna disregarded them because \u201cthe validity of the observed result was not tested.\u201d But Aetna denied Letvinuck\u2019s benefits without physically examining her. <em>Montour, </em>588 F.3d at 634 (a \u201cpure paper\u201d review of a Plan participant\u2019s claim \u201craises questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination\u201d) (alterations and quotations omitted). Thus, Aetna failed to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Letvinuek and failed clearly to let her know what tests or records it required.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">For both reasons we view Aetna\u2019s decision with a high level of skepticism. Doing so, we conclude that Aetna abused its discretion in denying Letvinuck benefits. Aetna based its denial of benefits on the absence of specific medical evidence\u2014 evidence that Aetna did not tell Letvinuck she should obtain and send to Aetna to perfect her claim. Aetna did not meaningfully explain why it disagreed with the SSA\u2019s award of disability benefits, and only attempted to do so when Letvinuck called Aetna after it had already denied her appeal. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Aetna and remand to the district court with instructions to direct an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
