Renzi. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, and we reverse, vacate the order of dismissal, and direct that Act 2 be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-22\">A violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), codified in part at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), requires proof of four elements: \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (footnote omitted). The district court determined that the indictment failed to adequately allege that Renzi perpetrated his illegal activity \u201cthrough\u201d his insurance agency, Patriot Insurance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-23\">The indictment alleges that Renzi used Patriot Insurance to commit multiple viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>tions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 (engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity). Because \u00a7 1957 violations are predicate racketeering acts as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), this allegation is sufficient to plead a RICO violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>50 F.3d 673, 676 (9th Cir.1995) (Reliance on even \u201ca bare bones information \u2014 that is one employing the statutory language alone \u2014 is quite common and entirely permissible .... \u201d); <em>see Las Vegas Merch. Plumbers Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>210 F.2d 732, 741 (9th Cir.1954); <em>cf. United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1544 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. It is being filed together with a published opinion addressing issues raised on appeal in case No. 10-10088. The relevant facts underlying both appeals are found there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\">. The violations of \u00a7 1957 were based on the Government\u2019s contention that Renzi's extortion and mail fraud violations served as the required \"specified unlawful activity.\u201d This neatly explains the additional sub-predicates found in Racketeering Act 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
