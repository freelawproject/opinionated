He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>seeks a certif\u00edcate of appealability for this court to review his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the discriminatory striking of a juror. The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">On April 25, 2001, Jan Michael Brawner shot and killed four people in Tate County, Mississippi. He was arrested the next day and charged with four counts of capital murder. Brawner pled not guilty and presented an insanity defense. A jury convicted him on all counts and sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Brawner\u2019s convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal by the Mississippi Supreme Court. <em>Brawner v. State, </em>872 So.2d 1 (Miss.2004) <em>[Brawner I</em>]. That court later denied Brawner\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Brawner v. State, </em>947 So.2d 254 (Miss.2006) <em>[Brawner II]. </em>In January 2007, Brawner filed an application under 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. The court denied relief. <em>Brawner v. Epps, </em>No. 2:07-CV-16, 2010 WL 383734 (N.D.Miss. Jan. 27, 2010); <em>see also Brawner v. Epps, </em>No. 2:07-CV-16, 2010 WL 2090327 (N.D.Miss. May 21, 2010) (denial of motion to amend judgment). These opinions contain a full recounting of the facts and proceedings in this case. Consequently, our restatement of the facts will be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The district court declined to issue a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Brawner then timely moved in this court for a COA on two issues: (1) whether his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective in their failure to investigate mitigating evidence, and (2) whether the prosecutor committed constitutional error in using a peremptory strike to remove a pregnant juror. We refuse to grant a COA on either issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Federal habeas review of state convictions is governed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This court must be \u201chighly deferential\u201d to state court rulings. <em>Paredes v. Thaler, </em>617 F.3d 315, 318 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). We analyze whether the final state court\u2019s resolution of each claim was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact and are governed by \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Gregory v. Thaler, </em>601 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). A state court decision is an unreasonable application of the law when it \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, we will not issue a writ solely because we conclude the state court made an erroneous decision. <em>Paredes, </em>617 F.3d at 319. That decision must be \u201cso clearly incorrect that it would not be debatable among reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 809, 813 (5th Cir.2000) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Claims of discriminatory juror selection present pure questions of fact that are reviewed under Section 2254(d)(2). <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. 333, 338, 126 S.Ct. 969, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006). Under this standard, the state court findings of fact are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>presumed to be correct, and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388-39, 126 S.Ct. 969 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)). \u201cDeference does not by definition preclude relief.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">If either part of Section 2254(d) is satisfied, a habeas petitioner must also show that the claimed error resulted in \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d meaning the error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Paredes, </em>617 F.3d at 319 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Before such claims can be considered on the merits, a habeas petitioner must obtain a COA to appeal to this court. <em>Williams v. Thaler, </em>602 F.3d 291, 300 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A petitioner is entitled to a COA when he makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>602 F.3d at 301 (citation and quotation marks omitted). The COA determination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits. We look to the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason. This threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\"><em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. When the petitioner \u201cfaces a sentence of death, we must resolve any doubts as to whether a COA should issue in his favor.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>602 F.3d at 301 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">As to Brawner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we consider whether jurists of reason could debate the district court\u2019s determination that the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s resolution was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. As to Brawner\u2019s claim of discriminatory juror striking, we consider whether jurists of reason could debate the district court\u2019s determination that the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s resolution was not an unreasonable determination of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\n<em>I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">\n<em>A. Background and the Parties\u2019Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">At trial, Brawner was represented by David Walker, Tate County\u2019s part-time public defender. Walker was assisted by a law clerk, Tommy Defer, who at the time had graduated from law school but failed the bar exam. He later passed the exam and was sworn into practice the morning of Brawner\u2019s trial. He was immediately appointed co-counsel for Brawner. Defer cross-examined four witnesses during the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is to be evaluated by examining whether the attorney acted reasonably \u201cconsidering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABiq\">Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-1.1 to 4-8.6 (2d ed. 1980) (\u201cThe Defense Function\u201d), are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides. No particular set of detailed rules for counsel\u2019s conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We will examine similar standards to guide us.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Brawner\u2019s central argument for ineffective assistance is that neither Walker nor his unlicensed law clerk investigated mitigating evidence that could have been presented at the sentencing phase. Brawner alleges that the law clerk had been delegated the responsibility to prepare for the sentencing phase but itemized only 92.5 hours of work on the case, 39 of which were spent in the multi-day trial. The clerk allegedly spent no time investigating mitigating evidence. (Walker did not keep time records.) In addition, Brawner alleges that his trial team did not request or otherwise utilize an investigator or mitigation specialist as recommended by the American Bar Association Guidelines then in effect. <em>See </em>Am. Bar Ass\u2019n Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases \u00a7 11.4.1(D)(7) (1989) (\u201cABA Guidelines\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 8.1 cmt.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">As a result of these failures, Brawner claims he was denied counsel under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), or in the alternative denied effective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Brawner contends that a thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and presentation of such findings to the jury during the sentencing phase could have persuaded a reasonable juror not to impose the death penalty. The district court summarized the mitigating evidence as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(1) a prior diagnosis of depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d); (2) that [Brawner] suffers from a learning disorder; (3) that his family moved frequently due to their financial woes brought on by drug and alcohol abuse; (4) that he was exposed to drug and alcohol abuse; (5) that he and his sister were exposed to physical abuse; (6) that as a child he received beatings to keep him silent when he witnessed his father repeatedly rape his younger sister; (7) that he was admitted to Parkwood Hospital at the age of fourteen for huffing gasoline and was diagnosed with Polysubstance Abuse; (8) that his school records reflect a marked drop in performance during the height of abuse in the home; and (9) ... that he ultimately dropped out of school in the ninth grade and failed to obtain his GED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\"><em>Brawner, </em>2010 WL 383734, at *6 (omitting footnote stating Brawner\u2019s father was convicted of sexually battering Brawner\u2019s sister and served 7.5 years at the Mississippi State Penitentiary). Brawner also claims additional mitigating evidence would be found in \u201cthe circumstances of his marriage and divorce\u201d \u2014 which was finalized the month before the murders \u2014 and the multiple car accidents Brawner had the year before the murders, which may have caused brain damage. <em>Id. </em>at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">In response, the State of Mississippi argues that Brawner at all times was represented by a licensed attorney. The State also contends that Brawner waived his right to a thorough investigation of mitigating evidence by repeatedly requesting the death penalty. Therefore, it argues, Brawner was not prejudiced by any failure to investigate mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The state trial court record reveals that Brawner was questioned carefully on the record several times about issues relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to this appeal. Brawner was asked whether, should the jury return a guilty verdict, he wanted defense counsel to put on a case in mitigation that might cause the jury to sentence him to life without parole. Counsel stated that the witnesses would include Brawner\u2019s mother to discuss his difficult childhood, and a psychiatrist to testify as to her findings. Brawner responded that \u201cI don\u2019t feel I deserve to live.\u201d Additional on-the-record comments from Brawner appear in the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that denied post-conviction relief. <em>Brawner II, </em>947 So.2d at 263-64. Among the more relevant excerpts are comments from his counsel that counsel had never previously failed to put on a case in mitigation and had recommended to Brawner that one be offered for him. Brawner then had explained to him on the record that a capital ease consisted both of a guilt phase and one on sentencing. Brawner agreed with his counsel\u2019s question that he did not \u201cwish to call your mother as a witness [at guilt] because she knows nothing about the facts that I could bring out and your desire is that she not testify before the jury and beg you to get life or life without parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\n<em>B. The State Court\u2019s Resolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The Mississippi Supreme Court denied Brawner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. \u201cTrial counsel did not present mitigating evidence at sentencing, despite the fact that there were at least three witnesses willing to testify.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The attorney\u2019s decision was based on \u201cBrawner\u2019s choice not to have these witnesses testify.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">After reviewing and quoting the trial transcripts, the court found that Brawner had repeatedly sought the death penalty and \u201cmade an informed decision\u201d to waive his attorney\u2019s presentation of mitigating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">Our own law does not require trial counsel to go against the fully informed and voluntary wishes of his client to refrain from presenting mitigating evidence. <em>Burns v. State, </em>879 So.2d 1000, 1006 (Miss.2004). Counsel will not be deemed ineffective for following his client\u2019s wishes, so long as the client made an informed decision. <em>Dowthitt v. Johnson, </em>230 F.3d 733, 748 (5th Cir.2000). A defendant may not block his lawyer\u2019s efforts and later claim the resulting performance was constitutionally deficient. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">Brawner was fully apprised of the consequences of his choice. He made an informed and voluntary decision not to present mitigating evidence. Trial counsel prepared a mitigation case but did not present it based on Brawner\u2019s wishes, despite contrary recommendations. Trial counsel\u2019s recommendations and the prosecution\u2019s recommendation advised Brawner of the gravity of his choice. We cannot now find that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to put on mitigating evidence. To do otherwise, would allow Brawner to create ineffectiveness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 264 (paragraph numbering omitted). The federal district court held the state court\u2019s resolution to be a reasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The Mississippi Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning in rejecting Brawn-er\u2019s argument that delegation of the mitigation issue to a law clerk resulted in a complete denial of counsel. The court said that \u201ccomplete denial of counsel ... for a critical stage\u201d would warrant relief, but found this situation was not present. <em>Id. </em>at 261. The federal district court more thoroughly addressed this argument. It concluded that Walker did not delegate the entire case to his law clerk. Because Walker had \u201cfiled motions, argued mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tions, directed and cross-examined witnesses, delivered opening and closing statements, and objected throughout trial.\u201d <em>Brawner, </em>2010 WL 383734, at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We agree the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law to the issue of a complete denial of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>C. The Role of Waiver in Ineffective Assistance Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims have two components. \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance ... fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cSecond, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This standard applies to capital sentencing procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 686-87, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">As we discussed earlier, we consider the first factor, objective reasonableness, by looking to \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d such as the ABA Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The second factor, prejudice, arises when \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">A thorough investigation of mitigating evidence is necessary for effective representation of death-eligible defendants. <em>See id. </em>at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 521-22, 524-25, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390, 395-99, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). \u201c[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This duty was briefly discussed in the ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of Brawner\u2019s trial, which stated: \u201cCounsel\u2019s duty to investigate is not negated by the expressed desires of a client.\u201d ABA Guidelines \u00a7 11.4.1 cmt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">The Supreme Court has granted habeas relief when post-conviction investigations of mitigating evidence reveal substantially more evidence about the defendant\u2019s family and social history than trial counsel discovered, and the failure to introduce that evidence was prejudicial. <em>See Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 525, 527-28, 123 S.Ct. 2527. If defense counsel chose not to investigate, that decision \u201cmust be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Notwithstanding this well-established duty, defendants may later excuse their attorney\u2019s inadequacies, if any, in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence. <em>See Amos v. Scott, </em>61 F.3d 333, 348 (5th Cir.1995). In <em>Amos, </em>the defendant alleged ineffective assistance for \u201chis counsels\u2019 failure to investigate and prepare mitigating evidence about his background and mental health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. The state habeas court found the defendant had \u201cstrongly opposed having any witnesses testify on his behalf during the punishment phase of his trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The district court held that there was no prejudice from a potential failure to investigate more thoroughly because the defendant \u201cwould not have permitted those witnesses to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>anyway, so what they might have said is academic.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On appeal, Amos argued that despite his desire that members of his family not testify, he had not insisted that no witnesses should be called and no investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence occur. <em>Id. </em>at 348-49. This court disagreed, holding that Amos had made it clear that he wanted no one to testify on his behalf, and therefore the state court\u2019s finding to that effect should be accepted. <em>Id. </em>at 349. Even if interviews of some of the family would have revealed the abuse Amos had suffered as a child, that possibility did not matter because Amos did not want to present mitigation testimony. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Brawner makes a similar argument that although he did not want his mother to \u201cbeg\u201d for his life, his lawyer misinformed him of other available options for mitigation, and Brawner never intended to waive the investigation or presentation of all mitigating evidence. Brawner did allow one witness to testify during mitigation, as compared to Amos\u2019s opposition to \u201chaving any witnesses testify on his behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">To obtain relief on a claim such as this, the petitioner must show both that the attorney was constitutionally ineffective and that the ineffectiveness prejudiced him at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 347. A court may deny relief \u201cbased solely on a petitioner\u2019s failure to meet either prong of the test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348 (citation omitted). As we held in <em>Amos, </em>a defense attorney following his client\u2019s informed and voluntary decision that a mitigation case not be presented does not commit professional error because such conduct is following the client\u2019s informed wish, and is not prejudicial because the evidence would not have been introduced over the defendant\u2019s objection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The Mississippi Supreme Court denied Brawner\u2019s habeas claim in part by relying on one of our decisions in which the state court rejected a similar post-conviction ineffective assistance claim when the petitioner had not wanted any members of his family at the trial. <em>See Dowthitt v. Johnson, </em>230 F.3d 733, 748 (5th Cir.2000). We affirmed the denial of relief. <em>Id. </em>at 749. \u201cCounsel will not be deemed ineffective for following their client\u2019s wishes, so long as the client made an informed decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Autry v. McKaskle, </em>727 F.2d 358, 361 (5th Cir.1984)); <em>see also Sonnier v. Quarterman, </em>476 F.3d 349, 362 &amp; nn. 5-6 (5th Cir.2007) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Brawner argues that the Mississippi Supreme Court did not rule on either <em>Strickland </em>prong, thus permitting <em>de novo </em>review. We disagree. Although that court declined to rule whether counsel was ineffective, that was because Brawner could not establish prejudice after he knowingly directed his attorney not to present mitigating evidence. <em>Brawner II, </em>947 So.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>261; <em>cf. Porter v. McCollum, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 447, 451 n. 6, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009). Regardless of the quality of investigation, there was no prejudice because any relevant evidence would not have been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We agree with the state court\u2019s reasoning with one caveat. A necessary component of our analysis is that Brawner\u2019s decision not to allow a mitigation case to be presented was a voluntary and knowing one. We will address that issue next.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>D. Whether Brawner\u2019s Waiver Was Knowing and Voluntary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The cases we have just discussed lack a consistent standard by which to evaluate the sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s statement about not wishing to proceed with a mitigation case. In <em>Amos, </em>the defendant explained his wishes in a colloquy with the trial judge and \u201cacknowledged that he understood the consequences.\u201d <em>Amos, </em>61 F.3d at 349. In <em>Autry, </em>we found that \u201cnothing in this record reflects any change in the level of Autry\u2019s rationality or in the voluntary and knowing character of his decision, in the three years since trial. And no one, not even his present counsel, offers any evidence that Autry is, or was, incompetent.\u201d <em>Autry, </em>727 F.2d at 362. In yet another case, the district court determined that the defendant was competent and \u201cmade a knowing and intelligent waiver\u201d; the court of appeals wrote that the defendant \u201csteadfastly,\u201d \u201cintelligently,\u201d and \u201ccompetently\u201d waived his rights. <em>Lenhard v. Wolff, </em>443 U.S. 1306, 1311-12, 100 S.Ct. 3, 61 L.Ed.2d 885 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The Supreme Court has declined to establish a standard to evaluate a defendant\u2019s waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence. <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 478-79, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). \u201cWe have never imposed an \u2018informed and knowing\u2019 requirement upon a defendant\u2019s decision not to introduce evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 127 S.Ct. 1933 (citation omitted). In that ease, the Court assumed without deciding that the proper rule was one of informed and knowing waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">We need not establish a standard today either. We will review Brawner\u2019s statements to confirm that he was competent and that his wishes were consistent, knowing, and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Brawner\u2019s principal argument is that his statements waiving the presentation of mitigating evidence were not made knowingly because his attorneys misinformed him about the role and nature of such evidence. He also asserts that his statement at trial that he did not \u201cdeserve to live\u201d is not the same as affirmatively wishing to be sentenced to death. We consider these arguments in our review of the record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">Approximately three months after the murders, Brawner saw his former probation officer Kenneth Fox<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the jail and talked to him. Brawner later said: \u201cI told him that I had done something wrong and I imagined that I would get the death penalty for it. I told him I didn\u2019t know very much about the drugs they used on you when they do lethal injections, but that I knew there was other people out there that needed organs.\u201d Fox told him to put it in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Brawner gave Fox a handwritten letter two days later, which Fox turned over to the police. The letter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-16\">You told me to write down what I\u2019d asked you for earlier. Well, instead of wasting the taxpayers\u2019 money anymore, I am guilty of murder. I was not in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>right mind then but that still doesn\u2019t excuse what I did. I\u2019m sorry for it and wish everyday I could take it back but I can\u2019t. So, here we are. With the current situation I am suffering in this jail. I won\u2019t last much longer so to save us a lot of heartache, how about just go ahead and putting me to death, so to speak. I will explain. I will not live life in prison so I\u2019m asking for the death penalty. I know this is a special request but instead of lethal injection that will mess up my organs, I want to go out of this world in the hospital while I am donating my heart.... Please honor my request.... I make this request of sound mind and body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Approximately five months after the murders, on September 18, 2001, Brawner met with the law clerk, and rejected the suggestion that he plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. According to a memo the law clerk wrote that day, Brawner \u201csaid it was his desire to suffer the death penalty than to spend the rest of his life in prison. He would [choose] death over life. We discussed this in detail, and at the end of our discussions, [Brawner] did not change his mind.\u201d The next day, Walker wrote Brawner to confirm his wishes. On September 20, 2001, Brawner replied, \u201cI did say I <em>do not </em>want to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. I will take what the Jury says [and] nothing less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">On November 15, 2001, Brawner wrote a letter to Walker in which he admitted to the murders and expressed frustration with Walker\u2019s representation. Brawner then wrote, \u201cI am guilty of a crime [and] I need to be put to Death!\u201d Walker responded four days later, stating, \u201cI advised you that you make my job hard because you tell that you do not wish to spend your life in prison. Only the jury can sentence you to death. A judge cannot. You cannot.\u201d Walker concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">I simply need for you to advise me in writing of your response to the following two questions: (1) Do you wish to contest your guilt of any or all of the four counts of capital murder at your trial? (2) Do you wish to contest the death penalty if you are found guilty of any or all of the four counts of capital murder? Your instructions on how you desire me to proceed on these two matters will be honored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The record does not show a response from Brawner.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Some of the correspondence is inconclusive. For example, on December 19, 2001, Brawner wrote Walker and provided a list of five \u201cpersons who can testify on my behalf\u2019 and their contact information. It is not clear whether Brawner suggested that these people testify during the guilt phase \u2014 he had claimed the insanity defense \u2014 or during mitigation. The law clerk spoke with Brawner shortly thereafter, then suggested in a memo to Walker that the five persons could be used to \u201ctestify as to [Brawner\u2019s] mental state before committing the crimes\u201d; the clerk did not suggest using them for mitigation. Brawner\u2019s current attorneys claim that his trial team only contacted one of these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">On March 15, 2002, the trial court held a hearing on Brawner\u2019s motion to suppress inculpatory statements. Brawner during direct examination said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">[Walker]: And you don\u2019t wish life without parole in this case if you get convicted, do you, Mr. Brawner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">[Brawner]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">[Walker]: You either want to be declared mentally insane or you want the death penalty? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">[Brawner]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">[Walker]: Not \u2018life without parole\u2019 or \u2018life\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>[Brawner]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">[Walker]: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Psychologists at the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield also assessed Brawn-er\u2019s mental state before trial. On March 25, 2002, they reported the following: \u201cDuring this evaluation, Mr. Brawner reported that he has had thoughts of killing himself while incarcerated. He also reported intermittently experiencing thoughts of killing two other inmates housed in the same facility.... He reported that he would harm himself or someone else if he felt that doing so would help ensure that he would either receive \u2018help\u2019 or the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">At trial, the State Hospital psychiatrist testified that based on the evaluation, Brawner \u201cdemonstrated clearly\u201d his sanity and understanding of his legal situation, the charges, the penalties, the expectations, the role of witnesses, among other critical facts and processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">After the prosecution rested, Brawner repeatedly and clearly stated his wishes during a colloquy in Chambers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">[Walker]: Mr. Brawner, do you wish for me to try to get you \u2018life\u2019 or \u2018life without parole,\u2019 if you are, in fact, found guilty of any of these counts by the jury? In other words, it\u2019s what the lawyers call \u2018put on a mitigation case,\u2019 call your mother as a witness to tell about your background, call Dr. Marsha LittleHendren to tell what she found. How do you wish me to proceed, is what I need to know from you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">[Brawner]: As far as life, I don\u2019t feel that I deserve life to live.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">This dialogue continued for several pages of the transcript. Brawner asked that his mother testify during the guilt phase, then withdrew that request after Walker\u2019s statement that \u201cshe really doesn\u2019t have anything to add, I don\u2019t think, at this stage whether you\u2019re guilty or not guilty.\u201d Brawner then stated he did not wish for her to testify at mitigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">The trial judge stated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">I think it\u2019s ultimately Mr. Brawner\u2019s decision in consultation with his two lawyers .... I think the State has at this point, at least, got sufficient evidence before the jury that Mr. Brawner is competent to assist counsel. It\u2019s like I told you, Mr. Brawner, you\u2019ve got to make this decision and direct your lawyers which way you want the case to go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avz\">Walker added that in his previous ten capital murder trials, \u201cI\u2019ve never had a capital murder client tell me not to ask for life or life without, not to put on a mitigation case.\u201d Walker turned to Brawner and said, \u201cyou know, you kind of put me in a quandary here, I\u2019m being asked to do something that I haven\u2019t done in ten capital murder trials, but I will respect your opinion.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">One of the prosecutors questioned Walker to make a record. Walker stated that he recommended presenting mitigating evidence and had prepared a mitigation case, but was not going to pursue it per his client\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">Walker then questioned Brawner again. Brawner stated he knew and understood both phases of capital murder trials, understood the possible sentence, and confirmed that he did not want his mother to, as Walker put it, \u201cbeg for you to get life or life without parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-16\">The conference ended and Brawner\u2019s case-in-chief began. Brawner testified, but his insanity defense collapsed quickly on cross-examination. He admitted that he knew right from wrong, agreed that he had planned the murders, knew he had to \u201ccover up\u201d what he was about to do, shot four people, attempted to cover up the crimes, then lied to the police afterward. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>After admitting to all four murders and the underlying felonies, Brawner said he would have murdered a fifth victim if he had to.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The prosecutor concluded by asking Brawner, \u201c[w]hat do you deserve?\u201d Brawner replied, \u201c[d]eath.\u201d The jury returned a guilty verdict on all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Before sentencing, the trial judge held another colloquy in chambers. The judge said he would instruct the jury on mitigating factors. \u201c[E]ven though counsel for the defendant tells me that he has been instructed not to seek any mitigation instructions, I\u2019m doing that against defense counsel\u2019s wishes.\u201d The prosecutor clarified that defense counsel had actually advised the defendant to put on mitigation evidence, \u201cbut the defendant had elected to ask the Court not to give them against counsel\u2019s objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Finally, Brawner\u2019s attorney sought the court\u2019s permission \u201cto get in one more time ... that this is [Brawner\u2019s] last chance to tell me to present [his] mitigation case[ ]. He\u2019s never wavered from that.\u201d Brawner was then questioned by his attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">[Walker]: Mr. Brawner, when the jury gets back from lunch [the prosecutors] are going to ask the jury to impose the death penalty upon you. You have consistently throughout my representation of you, and Mr. Defer, instructed me not to present what\u2019s called a mitigation case. In lay terms that means ask for life or life without parole. Is that still your desire that I not ask for life or life without parole at the sentencing phase of this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">[Brawner]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The prosecutor then asked if Brawner understood what had happened so far, the consequences of his decision, and that \u201cthis is a free and voluntary decision that you\u2019re making against your lawyer\u2019s advice?\u201d Brawner again said: \u201cIt is.\u201d The judge concluded, \u201cI think Mr. Brawner is in full control of his faculties.... I think he\u2019s made a free and voluntary choice, and he\u2019s consistently instructed his lawyer to take this position.... The Court finds that he is competent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">When the parties returned to court for the punishment phase, Brawner\u2019s attorney did in fact present a limited mitigation case. He called Brawner\u2019s former probation officer to testify about the living conditions on Mississippi\u2019s death row.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Walker was apparently attempting to show that life without parole would be a harsher penalty than death. Walker\u2019s closing argument at sentencing confirmed this strategy, with this conclusion: \u201c[I]f you\u2019re a vindictive person, if you\u2019re a vengeful person, you want to put the most hurt on Mr. Brawner that you can, then you decide in your mind is it a two-minute death via lethal injection or is it 50 years in Unit 32 at the Mississippi Department of Corrections?\u201d The jury returned a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">Brawner\u2019s wishes did not change after trial. On August 23, 2003, he wrote the Mississippi Supreme Court, copying the State Attorney General and his attorney, and asked that \u201cafter this one mandatory appeal I wish to forgo any and all further appeals.\u201d Brawner elaborated on his wishes in the version he sent to the Attorney General, which stated, \u201cI do understand the situation I place myself in by waiving any further appeals. I will be put to death. I have had over a year and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>half to think about all of this and my mind is made up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">One year later, during his state habeas proceedings, Brawner reiterated his request in an August 6, 2004 letter to the clerk of the Mississippi Supreme Court. \u201cI request motions, petitions, Appeals, and/or stays of execution of any kind Filed by my counsel and/or persons trying to [represent] me be withdrawn and that a Mandate of affirmance be issued forth with.\u201d He then reiterated this request and described that he no longer wanted legal representation. On the same day, he wrote the trial court a similar letter asking for an execution date \u201cset with out further delay\u201d and <em>\u201cexpedited review of this waiver.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The voluminous record supports that, aside from a relatively weak attempt to be declared legally insane, Brawner consistently sought the death penalty. The trial judge concluded that not only had Brawn-er\u2019s testimony not contradicted any of the elements of capital murder, he had in fact \u201c[bjolstered\u201d the argument for guilt and the penalty of death. Brawner\u2019s wishes remained the same for over three years, throughout pre-trial, trial, direct appeal, and state habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">It is true that Walker\u2019s description of Brawner\u2019s mother\u2019s mitigation testimony as merely \u201cbegging for life\u201d was not an accurate characterization or sound counseling of his client. The depth of Walker and Defer\u2019s mitigation investigation has also been called into question by the substantial evidence accrued during the various habeas proceedings. There is no evidence that Brawner was uncooperative; he did not interrupt or object when his attorney called his one witness during mitigation. <em>E.g., Schriro, </em>550 U.S. at 476-77, 127 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">But it is also true that Brawner was not shown to be incompetent or that his decision to seek the death penalty was not a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent choice. The Mississippi Supreme Court had significant evidence that Brawner was not prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel because he actively and repeatedly sought the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">As a final matter, we note that before reading the jury instructions, the trial judge told Walker, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of the scenario that [Brawner\u2019s] saying I\u2019ve got mental problems, and then for you not to beg for a lesser punishment, the Supreme Court would say well, the lawyer should have overridden his client\u2019s feelings to that extent.\u201d The judge concluded, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a lawyer put in a worse situation than you\u2019re in.\u201d The prosecutor agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Considering the substantial record evidence, we cannot say that the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of Brawner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was objectively unreasonable. Brawner has not made the \u201csubstantial showing\u201d necessary for a COA to issue on this claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">\n<em>II. Discrimination Against a Pregnant Juror</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Brawner\u2019s other argument for a COA is that the prosecutor committed constitutional error when she exercised a peremptory challenge against a pregnant juror on the basis of the pregnancy. Brawner exhausted this claim by raising it during his direct appeal. <em>Brawner I, </em>872 So.2d at 7-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">A defendant must establish unconstitutionally discriminatory jury selection by a three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race. Second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question. Third, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the trial court must deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>mine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 328-29, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (citing <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986)). <em>Batson </em>was later extended to make unconstitutional discrimination in jury selection based on sexual stereotypes. <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 137, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994). The Supreme Court found it essential to end the perpetuation of \u201cprejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 114 S.Ct. 1419. Even one instance of striking a pregnant juror as a convenient pretext for gender discrimination would be unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 142 n. 13, 114 S.Ct. 1419.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\"><em>J.E.B. </em>did not purport to eliminate the use of peremptory challenge, though. \u201cParties still may remove jurors who they feel might be less acceptable than others on the panel; gender simply may not serve as a proxy for bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 114 S.Ct. 1419. \u201cEven strikes based on characteristics that are disproportionately associated with one gender could be appropriate, absent a showing of pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has never ruled on the characteristic of pregnancy, which is obviously associated exclusively with one sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">During voir dire in Brawner\u2019s case, the prosecution struck three women and one man, tendering a proposed jury composed of seven women and five men. <em>Brawner I, </em>872 So.2d at 8. Brawner\u2019s counsel objected on the basis that three out of the four strikes were used against women, citing <em>J.E.B. </em>and <em>Batson. Id. </em>at 8-9. The trial court found that Brawner had failed to meet the threshold showing of bias, \u201cnot with [the prosecution] having accepted seven [women] out of the first twelve,\u201d and then granted the prosecution\u2019s request to state her reasons for the strikes. Brawner\u2019s argument focuses on the striking of Juror Number 38, who was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The prosecutor first stated that she struck the juror on the basis of the pregnancy. Brawner\u2019s attorney responded that \u201cthere\u2019s no proof that this lady\u2019s going to have a baby this week or next week or that she can\u2019t serve physically because she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d The prosecutor replied, \u201clast week in the Tribble case, we had a pregnant juror and she had trouble \u2014 particularly difficulties with the lack of air conditioning in our courtroom.\u201d There was no further argument after that; the judge directed the parties to \u201cmove on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">The Mississippi Supreme Court fully rejected Brawner\u2019s argument that the prosecutor displayed bias based on gender. <em>Id. </em>at 7-12. It included in its opinion a table showing the relevant characteristics of all 36 members of the venire who were considered or struck before a full jury was seated. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The venire was slightly more than 60 percent female, and of the 12 jurors ultimately selected, 75 percent were female. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">The Mississippi Supreme Court accepted the trial judge\u2019s finding that Brawner had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The trial judge was found to have properly allowed the prosecutor to state her reasons for the strikes on the record, but later arguments about the propriety of those reasons did \u201cnot lessen the burden on the defendant to establish the prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11 (citation omitted). Therefore, the court concluded, it was \u201cnot necessary to review each gender neutral reason offered by the State for its strikes,\u201d including the reasons given for the pregnant juror. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">In direct appeals as in habeas proceedings, \u201c[djeference to trial court findings on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the issue of discriminatory intent makes particular sense in this context because, as we noted in <em>Batson, </em>the finding largely will turn on evaluation of credibility.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Even where \u201c[rjeasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor\u2019s credibility\u201d \u2014 which we do not \u2014 \u201con habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\u2019s credibility determination.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>546 U.S. at 341-42, 126 S.Ct. 969. Brawner has not made a substantial showing that he has any clear and convincing evidence that could satisfy AEDPA\u2019s standard of review. <em>See id. </em>at 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We disagree that the Mississippi Supreme Court permitted the trial judge to collapse the second and third steps of the <em>Batson </em>analysis. The trial judge ruled on Brawner\u2019s objection before the prosecutor issued her gender-neutral reason. <em>See Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (holding the first step of <em>Batson </em>was moot when the prosecution stated its reasoning before the trial judge ruled on the objection). This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In addition, even if we assume Brawn-er\u2019s attorney made out a prima facie case, the record shows no evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s reason for using a peremptory strike on the pregnant juror was a pretext for excluding women. The prosecutor identified the previous pregnant juror\u2019s \u201cdifficulties with the lack of air conditioning in our courtroom\u201d in a trial just one week prior to Brawner\u2019s. Pregnancy necessarily will affect only female jurors, but the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason here was health-related and was grounded to a recent event. It was not evidence of unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The state court\u2019s resolution of this claim was not unreasonable. That conclusion is not debatable. A COA will not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
