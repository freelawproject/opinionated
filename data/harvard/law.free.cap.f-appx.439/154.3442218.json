We will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">Badshah is a citizen of Pakistan who entered the United States in 1998 as a nonimmigrant alien in transit and who concedes that he is removable for having overstayed his allowable period. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Following initial proceedings before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and the BIA not relevant here, he applied for asylum, cancellation of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Badshah claims that he was beaten in Pakistan because of his affiliation with the Pakistan Peoples Party (\u201cPPP\u201d). Badshah has been represented by counsel at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-25\">At a hearing on January 23, 2007, Badshah, through counsel, withdrew his appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cation with prejudice in exchange for a grant of voluntary departure. The IJ granted him voluntary departure and entered an alternative order of removal. Badshah later retained new counsel, who filed a motion to reopen with the IJ. Badshah asserted in that motion that (1) he did not understand the proceedings on January 23 because he speaks a \u201cunique dialect of the Urdu language\u201d that the court-provided translator could not translate, and (2) he \u201cfelt pressured\u201d by counsel to accept voluntary departure. (A.R.245.) The IJ granted the motion and reopened proceedings on June 11, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">At the next hearing on May 15, 2008, Badshah testified that, although he had been confused about certain legal points, he in fact understood everything that the translator (who had translated in Pashtun, which Badshah testified is his best language) had translated for him on January 23. (A.R.123, 126, 136, 140-41.) The Government orally moved for an order of removal, but the IJ granted Badshah leave to file an application pursuant to <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), if he wished to seek reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of prior counsel. Badshah, however, later sent the IJ a letter informing him that current counsel had spoken with former counsel, understood his strategy, and that \u201cwe do not find it prudent to move forward with a <em>Lozada </em>claim against him.\u201d (A.R.201.) The letter also asserted that \u201cconditions have worsened\u201d in Pakistan and requested permission to reinstate his application for relief on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The IJ held another hearing on September 10, 2008. At that hearing, Badshah argued that he should be permitted to proceed with his application because conditions in Pakistan had changed since he accepted voluntary departure. He argued that the leader of the PPP, Benazir Bhutto, had been assassinated, and that there had been \u201cthousands\u201d of bombings in Pakistan, \u201csome\u201d of which were directed at members of the PPP. (A.R.172.) Badshah, however, presented no evidence in that regard, and instead reserved the right to file a formal motion to reopen on the basis of changed country conditions (which he never did). (A.R. at 191-92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ rendered an oral decision: (1) construing the Government\u2019s motion for removal as a motion to reconsider the order reopening proceedings; (2) granting it and vacating the order reopening proceedings; (3) declining to reinstate Badshah\u2019s application on the basis of changed country conditions; and (4) entering another order granting Badshah additional time to voluntarily depart or be removed. The IJ later issued a written decision on September 12, 2008, to the same effect. The BIA summarized the IJ\u2019s reasoning and dismissed Badshah\u2019s appeal on June 29, 2010. Badshah petitions for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Badshah challenges the IJ\u2019s refusal to reinstate his application on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>changed country conditions. Badshah\u2019s request that the IJ do so is best understood as a second motion to reopen. Both the IJ and the BIA addressed that request on the merits and concluded that reopening was not warranted because the head of the PPP, Benazir Bhutto\u2019s widower, had been elected prime minister and the situation for members of the PPP was, if anything, better than when Badshah initially filed his application. (BIA Dec. at 2, A.R. 4; IJ Oral Dec. at 3, A.R. 46; IJ Written Dec. at 2-4, A.R. 57-61.) Badshah does not contest that conclusion. Instead, he argues that the IJ committed two legal errors in denying reopening. Both arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">First, Badshah argues that the IJ improperly required him to show a change in the nature of his underlying fear of persecution as opposed to a change in country conditions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). The IJ did refer to the unchanged nature of Badshah\u2019s fear, but he clearly cited and applied the correct standard: \u201cThe salient question is what changes in country conditions have occurred that materially affect the respondent\u2019s individualized eligibility to apply for or to be granted asylum. The respondent failed to describe any such conditions.\u201d (IJ Written Dec. at 4, A.R. 61.) The BIA also properly focused on Badshah\u2019s allegations of changed country conditions. (BIA Dec. at 2, A.R. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Second, Badshah argues that the IJ improperly denied reopening on the ground that conditions in Pakistan \u201care fluid, are constantly changing.\u201d The IJ, however, was responding to Badshah\u2019s own argument that mere fluidity of conditions warranted reopening: \u201c[T]he Court will not accept the invitation extended by counsel for the respondent to review the matters because the conditions in Pakistan are fluid, constantly changing. The Court must make its decision based upon the evidence of record.\u201d (IJ Oral Dec. at 3-4, A.R. 46-47.) Both the IJ and BIA did so, and Badshah has not challenged the substance of their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In addition, Badshah argues that the IJ deprived him of the opportunity to present evidence regarding changed country conditions and abused his discretion in granting the Government\u2019s motion to reconsider its initial order of reopening. Badshah, however, did not exhaust these arguments by raising them before the BIA: (A.R.12-22.) Thus, we lack jurisdiction to address them. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Patel v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>619 F.3d 230, 232 n. 1 (3d Cir.2010). To the extent that Badshah\u2019s BIA brief might be construed to raise these issues, they lack merit. Badshah has neither specified what evidence he wished to offer nor argued that he could not have presented it during the three months between the time he first raised the issue of changed conditions and the final hearing. He also has not challenged the IJ\u2019s finding that he understood the translator at the January 23 hearing, and our review of the record confirms that it is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Finally, Badshah requests that, if we deny his petition for review, we also provide him with additional time to voluntarily depart. The BIA permitted Badshah to voluntarily depart by August 3, 2010, and he filed his petition for review six days before that date. We lack the authority to extend his voluntary departure period because it terminated upon the filing of his petition for review. <em>See Patel, </em>619 F.3d at 233-35 (discussing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(i)). If, however, it is feasible for the IJ to reinstate voluntary departure, we recommend he do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We review the decisions of the IJ and the BIA together because the BIA summarized and adopted his analysis. <em>See Dwumaah v. Att'y Gen., </em>609 F.3d 586, 588-89 (3d Cir.2010). We review decisions regarding reconsideration and reopening for abuse of discretion and may not disturb them unless they are \" 'arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.' \" <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005) (citation omitted). We review the Agency's legal conclusions de novo, but review its assessment of the record for substantial evidence and must uphold it unless \" 'any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.' \" <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
