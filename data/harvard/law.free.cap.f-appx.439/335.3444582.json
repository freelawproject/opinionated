The Immigration Judge (IJ) made an adverse credibility finding, which was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) when it dismissed Ning\u2019s administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">Ning argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence in the record because the alleged inconsistencies between his statements in support of his asylum applications and his hearing testimony were actually additional details or minor inconsistencies that did not go to the heart of his claim. He contends that in the absence of the adverse credibility finding, he showed his eligibility for relief for asylum, for withholding of removal, and under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">This court may review the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions if the BIA adopts them. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). This court reviews an immigration court\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Among the findings of fact that this court reviews for substantial evidence is the conclusion that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">Because Ning\u2019s application was filed pri- or to the May 11, 2005 effective date of the REAL ID Act, its amended standards for assessing credibility did not apply to his application. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537. Under the pre-REAL ID Act standards, if the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by the record and the IJ\u2019s reasons are supported by \u201cspecific cogent reasons,\u201d this court will affirm the decision, even if this court may have reached a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>result. <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Some of the inconsistencies between the testimony and the applications cited by the IJ were not relevant or could have been the result of a translation problem or Ning\u2019s providing more detailed information at the hearing. However, the record supports the IJ\u2019s findings that there were other major inconsistencies that rendered questionable the validity and credibility of Ning\u2019s claims of persecution following his arrest in China. Ning has failed to provide a convincing explanation for these inconsistencies. Ning\u2019s claims were also undermined by his father\u2019s lack of knowledge of his practice of Christianity in China and his failure to obtain a statement of his wife or anyone else confirming his practice of his faith in that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Ning\u2019s asylum, withholding, and CAT claims were all based on alleged persecution for his practice of Christianity in a house church in China. Because the credibility determination of the IJ and the BIA is based on a \u201creasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d the determination must be upheld by the court. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). In light of the BIA\u2019s denial of the petition based on the adverse credibility finding, the court will not consider the IJ\u2019s denial of relief based on the merits or as a matter of discretion. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186-87, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) Accordingly, Ning\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
