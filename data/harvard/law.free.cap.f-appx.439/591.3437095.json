We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2009). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Although the IJ found Jin testified credibly that the Chinese court took his family home away from him in partial satisfaction of a civil judgment against his wife, the IJ found Jin\u2019s claim that he was targeted for collection of a judgment against his wife not credible. Substantial evidence does not support the I J\u2019s disbelief that Jin had become implicated in his wife\u2019s civil matter. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002) (the articulated reasons \u201cmust be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d) (citation omitted). Further, the omission from Jin\u2019s application of visits by court officials to his workplace does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1045 (9th Cir.2005) (failure \u201cto describe all prior incidents of mistreatment and persecution in the early stages of [the] application process\u201d does not support an adverse credibility determination); <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000) (a minor inconsistency in identifying the location of a person\u2019s persecution will not support an adverse credibility determination). Finally, the IJ did not provide Jin with an opportunity to explain the omission or the other perceived inconsistencies. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 618 (9th Cir.2004) (reversing adverse credibility finding, in part because petitioner \u201cwas denied a reasonable opportunity to explain\u201d a perceived inconsistency).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand, on an open record, for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2009); <em>cf. Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>289 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
