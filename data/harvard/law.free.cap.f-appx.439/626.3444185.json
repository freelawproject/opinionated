We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-24\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Sutheno established extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5); <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Sutheno\u2019s experiences in Indonesia, including the bombing of his church, did not rise to the level of past persecution, <em>see Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Sutheno failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution because, even as a member of a disfavored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>group, he did not establish sufficient individualized risk. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Sutheno\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Sutheno failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured upon return to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
