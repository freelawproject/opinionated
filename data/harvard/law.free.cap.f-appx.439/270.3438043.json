He appeals, contending that the district court erred in denying his motion to exclude evidence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">At Morrison\u2019s trial, the Government presented testimony from a number of witnesses regarding Morrison\u2019s involvement in selling powder and crack cocaine. The Government also presented evidence of ion scan results indicating the presence of cocaine on money that law enforcement seized from Morrison\u2019s front pants pocket at the time of his arrest. Morrison challenges the ion scan evidence, contending that the ion scan method was not reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Delfino, </em>510 F.3d 468, 470 (4th Cir.2007). Expert testimony is admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 if it concerns: (1) scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that (2) will aid the jury or other trier of fact to understand or resolve a fact at issue. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). The reasoning and methodology underlying an expert\u2019s proffered opinion must be reliable. <em>See id., </em>at 593-95, 113 S.Ct. 2786. The district court conducted a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, at which the Government\u2019s expert testified on direct and cross examination regarding the reliability of the ion scan results. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the results into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Moreover, we agree with the Government that even if the district court erred by admitting the ion scan evidence, any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 637 (4th Cir.2009) (explaining district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review). The Government presented substantial evidence of Morrison\u2019s involvement in selling powder and crack cocaine during the charged conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cErroneously admitted evidence is harmless if a reviewing court is able to \u2018say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
