SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\"> The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b642-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Plaintiffs Hui Malama I Kohola, the Center for Biological Diversity, and Turtle Island Restoration Network appeal the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. As the parties agree, this appeal is moot in light of the National Marine Fisheries Service\u2019s (NMFS\u2019s) establishment of a take reduction team for the Hawaii pelagic stock of false killer whales and subsequent submission of a draft take reduction plan. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1387(f)(3), (6)(A), &amp; (7)(A)(i); see <em>also Church of Scientology of California v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">No exception to mootness applies. As NMFS has formed a take reduction team, the dispute over whether it should do so is not likely to recur, and so this is not a case that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>See American Rivers v. Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., </em>126 F.3d 1118, 1123-24 (9th Cir.1997). Similarly, the voluntary cessation exception does not apply, because the formation of the team and submission of a draft plan have \u201cmade it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur\u201d and \u201chave completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Porter v. Bowen, </em>496 F.3d 1009, 1017 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Los Angeles County v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979)). There are no collateral continuing legal disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201cWhen a civil case becomes moot pending appellate adjudication, \u2018[t]he established practice ... is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 71-72, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950)). \u201cVacatur expunges an adverse decision that would be reviewable had this case not become moot.\u201d <em>Camreta v. Greene, </em>\u2014 U.S. - n. 10, 131 S.Ct. 2020, 2035 n. 10, 179 L.Ed.2d 1118 n. 10 (citing <em>Arizonans, 520 </em>U.S. at 74, 117 S.Ct. 1055). NMFS alone possesses the authority to establish a take reduction team; the plaintiffs did not cause mootness through voluntary action. <em>See United States v. Payton, </em>593 F.3d 881, 884-85 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P\u2019ship, </em>513 U.S. 18, 24, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994)). We therefore vacate the judgment below, remand, and direct the district court to dismiss this action. <em>See Arizonans, 520 </em>U.S. at 71-72, 117 S.Ct. 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
