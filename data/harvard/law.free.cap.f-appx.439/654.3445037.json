We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The facts and procedural history of this case are known to the parties and will not be repeated here. Hadnot argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the officers knew about the search and seizure condition on his probation before commencing the search of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In order to reverse a district court\u2019s factual findings as clearly erroneous, we must determine that the district court\u2019s findings were illogical, implausible, or without support in the record. <em>United States v. Spangle, </em>626 F.3d 488, 497 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted) (applying this standard to factual findings at sentencing); <em>United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (articulating this standard in the context of a motion for new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">First, Hadnot contends that the validity of the search hinges on the necessary but erroneous factual conclusion that Detective Kouri called Probation Officer Tately to confirm Hadnot\u2019s search and seizure condition before he interviewed Had-not\u2019s girlfriend, Tynisha Ellis. Even if we accept that such a conclusion is necessary, the record does not demonstrate that it is clearly erroneous. It is true that P.O. Tately\u2019s recollection of his conversation with Detective Kouri suggests, contrary to Detective Kouri\u2019s own testimony, that the detective called him after having already interviewed Ellis. Even in light of this inconsistent testimony, however, the district court\u2019s interpretation of the facts remains plausible. <em>See Spangle, </em>626 F.3d at 497. P.O. Tately testified that he frequently received probation inquiries from other detectives and from Detective Kouri specifically, which renders perfectly plausible the inference that he was mistaken about what Detective Kouri said to him or that he recalled the conversation with less than exact precision. Thus, the conclusion that Detective Kouri learned about Had-not\u2019s probation status before the interview with Ellis is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Second, even if the phone conversation between Detective Kouri and P.O. Tately did in fact take place after the detective interviewed Ellis, this does nothing to call into question, let alone render implausible, the amply supported conclusion that, by the time the agents conducted the search, they were aware of Hadnot\u2019s probation status. The district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">Hadnot argues that his prior convictions based on pleas of nolo contendere should not be considered \u201cprior offenses\u201d that increase his sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, because such convictions do not require that the state prove or that a defendant admit that he was guilty of the crime. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>its application of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>States v. Garro, </em>517 F.3d 1163, 1167 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Hadnot\u2019s argument with respect to nolo contendere pleas is foreclosed by the express terms of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l), which define \u201cprior sentence\u201d for purposes of determining a criminal history category as \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). Under California law, a plea of nolo contendere \u201c \u2018is the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>625 F.3d 1219, 1220 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>People v. Whitfield, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 947, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 377 (Cal.Ct.App.1996)). While Hadnot makes several arguments highlighting the practical considerations, unrelated to guilt, that may motivate a plea of nolo contendere, these arguments do not negate such a plea\u2019s clear effect for purposes of sentencing. Therefore, the district court properly considered Hadnot\u2019s prior offenses when determining his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
