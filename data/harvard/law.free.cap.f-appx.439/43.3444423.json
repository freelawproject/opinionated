On January 30, 2009, Baadhio pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of fraud in connection with access devices in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2). On May 29, 2009, the district court sentenced Baadhio principally to a term of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Baadhio contends that (1) his medical conditions and cognitive limitations affected his ability to knowingly, voluntarily, and competently enter into the plea agreement and plead guilty; (2) the district court erred by failing to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte; </em>and (3) the district court erred by omitting from the written judgment its oral recommendation that Baadhio be incarcerated at a federal medical facility. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">We turn first to Baadhio\u2019s challenge to the validity of his guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A criminal defendant may not plead guilty \u201cunless he does so \u2018competently and intelligently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 396, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). The standard for competence to plead guilty is the same as that to stand trial: the defendant must have \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn making a determination of competency, the district court may rely on a number of factors, including medical opinion and the court\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s comportment.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>56 F.3d 403, 411 (2d Cir.1995). \u201cA failure by trial counsel to indicate that the defendant had any difficulty in assisting in preparation or in comprehending the nature of the proceedings \u2018provides substantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s competence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Kirsh, </em>54 F.3d 1062, 1071 (2d Cir.1995). \u201cIt is well-estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>lished that some degree of mental illness cannot be equated with incompetence to stand trial.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>56 F.3d at 412 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">During the plea hearing, Baadhio\u2019s counsel confirmed that he had explained to Baadhio the charges against him and that Baadhio comprehended the consequences of pleading guilty. In addition, Baadhio told the district court that he understood all the provisions of the plea agreement and the proceedings that day. At the time of the plea hearing, the district court had not been advised that Baadhio had been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS-related dementia or that he suffered from cognitive limitations. For these reasons, we see no error in the district court\u2019s implicit conclusion, based on the materials available to it at the time, that Baadhio was competent to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Baadhio also argues, based on medical findings brought to the district court\u2019s attention through his sentencing memorandum and presentence report, that the district court erred by failing to hold a competency hearing <em>sua sponte. </em>Title 18, Section 4241(a) of the United States Code provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">At any time after the commencement of a prosecution for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the defendant, ... [t]he court ... shall order ... a [competency] hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Because the due process right protected by the competency requirement \u201cspans the duration of a criminal proceeding,\u201d \u201c \u2018a trial court <em>must always be alert </em>to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Arenburg, </em>605 F.3d 164, 168-69 (2d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 181, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">The issue of whether there is \u201creasonable cause\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) \u201crests in the discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d As such, a district court may consider \u201cmany factors\u201d when determining whether \u201creasonable cause\u201d to order a competency hearing exists, including (but not limited to) its \u201cobservations of the defendant\u2019s demeanor during the proceeding.\u201d However, where \u201creasonable cause\u201d exists \u201c[a]t any time after the commencement of a prosecution,\u201d a district court has but one option: \u201corder ... a hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 169 (citations omitted) (alterations and ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">After careful review of the record, including Baadhio\u2019s health history, his reported HIV/AIDS dementia, and his claims regarding the effects of the medications that he was taking, we find no merit in Baadhio\u2019s contention that the district court should have convened a competency hearing on its own motion. As an initial matter, the representations of Baadhio\u2019s counsel and Baadhio\u2019s colloquies with the district court fully support the conclusion that Baadhio understood the proceedings against him and was able to assist in his defense. While the medical records available to the court indicated that Baadhio suffered from significant mental impairments, they contained no findings that he was incompetent, and did not recommend that further evaluation be conducted for the purpose of evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>his competency. It is apparent that the court took account of Baadhio\u2019s medical conditions and cognitive limitations: during the sentencing, it elicited information about Baadhio\u2019s \u201cpoor health,\u201d including his diagnosis of HIV/AIDS-related dementia, and the government noted Baadhio\u2019s \u201csevere medical issues.\u201d App. 64, 87. Nonetheless, the court observed that Baadhio \u2014 who holds a Ph.D. in physics and has co-authored books on quantum topology \u2014 \u201cstill maintains his keen intellectual ability,\u201d and concluded that he \u201ccertainly has the ability to think and comprehend and, thus, the ability to know right from wrong, and to be able to control his conduct to comport with the law.\u201d App. 98. Against this background, the record before the district court at sentencing did not evince \u201creasonable cause\u201d such that the district court\u2019s failure to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte </em>was an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Finally, Baadhio contends that the district court erred in omitting from the written judgment its oral recommendation that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) place him in a federal medical facility. The government responds with various arguments that we cannot and should not reach this challenge. It first suggests that, given Baadhio\u2019s release from federal custody, his request that this court remand with instructions for the district court to order the BOP to redetermine Baadhio\u2019s place of incarceration is moot. Because the presence of such an instruction may well have an effect on Baadhio\u2019s supervised release, we, however, believe the challenge is still a live one. The government next argues that we do not have the authority to order the district court to conform its written judgment to its oral pronouncement of Baadhio\u2019s sentence. It contends that a district court\u2019s recommendations regarding a prisoner\u2019s place of confinement are neither \u201cfinal decisions\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, nor \u201cfinal sentence[s]\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and that, as a consequence, this court does not have jurisdiction to review appeals seeking their revision, or, relatedly, to order the lower courts to make such recommendations. For these propositions, it cites <em>United States v. Yousef, </em>327 F.3d 56, 165 (2d Cir.2003), and <em>United States v. Pineyro, </em>112 F.3d 43, 45 (2d Cir.1997). But, regardless of these arguments, our court is free to send the case back to the district court so that it may consider whether, given all the circumstances in this case, it thinks it appropriate to conform its written judgment to its oral pronouncement. We therefore remand this case for the limited purpose of permitting the district court to amend the written judgment of conviction to include its oral recommendation that Baadhio be incarcerated at a federal medical facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We have considered Baadhio\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to amend the written judgment of conviction to reflect its oral recommendation that the BOP place Baadhio in a federal medical facility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\">. Baadhio's plea agreement purports to bar an appeal of his conviction or sentence as long as he is sentenced within the stipulated Guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. \"[A] defendant may have a valid claim that the waiver of appellate rights is unenforceable,\u201d however, \"when the waiver was not made knowingly, voluntarily, and competently.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Perez, </em>215 F.3d 315, 319 (2d Cir.2000). In any event, the government does not contend that the appeal waiver in the plea agreement precludes our consideration of the claims of error addressed in this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
