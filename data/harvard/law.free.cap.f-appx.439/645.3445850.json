We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Jackson contends that the district court procedurally erred in calculating the Sentencing Guidelines range when it assessed criminal history points for a prior offense, rather than counting it as relevant conduct. This contention lacks merit because the district court properly counted Jackson\u2019s Wyoming conviction for possession of child pornography as a prior sentence rather than as relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) and cmt. n. 1; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 9(B); <em>see also United States v. Hahn, </em>960 F.2d 903, 910-911 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Jackson also contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because: (1) the district court failed to consider the government\u2019s delay in bringing the charges, thereby exposing him to increased punishment from the application of a Sentencing Guidelines enhancement due to a subsequent state conviction; and (2) failed to account for the three years he spent in prison on relevant conduct. The district court declined to second-guess the government\u2019s decision with respect to the timing of its charging decision and, as discussed <em>supra, </em>Jackson\u2019s earlier prison sentence did not arise from conduct that is relevant to the instant offense. The sentence at the statutory maximum, which was below the applicable Guidelines range, was not unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
