(\u201cSaitech\u201d), on Title VII and ADEA hostile-work-environment and disparate-treatment claims, and a Title VII retaliation claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Gobert is a black, 48-year-old IT support specialist who worked for Saitech since March 2006. Around July 2008, Saitech sent him to work on-site at the NASA Shared Service Center (\u201cNSSC\u201d) under the supervision of CSC. As part of his duties, he was responsible for ensuring that all secure NSSC documents were processed on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">In October and November 2008, according to CSC\u2019s IT director, Rachel Raines, Gobert failed to monitor the processing of NSSC documents for more than a week, so Gaines demanded in a letter to Saitech that he be immediately removed from NSSC facilities because his actions \u201cindicated a complete unwillingness to comply with legitimate management direction and caused unacceptable disruptions in the flow of documents.\u201d Gaines further explained that Gobert\u2019s actions caused \u201cserious damage\u201d to NSSC\u2019s performance and \u201cresulted in serious client concerns.\u201d She stated in her affidavit that Gobert had been reminded of his document processing duties \u201con multiple occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">Saitech says that because it had no other contracts on which to staff Gobert, it immediately terminated his employment. Gobert alleges that those reasons were pretexts and that he was terminated because of his race and age.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Gobert made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment based on race and age, a plaintiff must produce substantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for a termination is merely a pretext for illegal discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As evidence of pretext, Gobert points to (1) his favorable performance review about a month before the termination, as well as previous positive reviews and an earlier promotion, (2) a white co-worker\u2019s alleged comment to other co-workers that they should \u201cbe careful what you say in front of [Gobert] because [he] is black,\u201d and (3) CSC\u2019s approval of cell phones for some white IT employees but not for Gobert.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">That is not \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence of pretext sufficient to overcome summary judgment. The performance reviews and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the promotion do not speak to Gobert\u2019s actions immediately preceding his termination \u2014 the actions that Saitech says caused his termination. Indeed, Gobert does not point to any evidence disputing that he failed to monitor the processing of documents for over a week. Moreover, the fact that he previously received positive performance reviews by the same supervisors who fired him suggests, if anything, a <em>lack </em>of racial or age-based animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As for the isolated comment by the coworker, Gobert does not in any way connect it to his supervisors, let alone to their actions in terminating him. And he admits that his supervisors did not make inappropriate comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As for the cell phones, there is conflicting evidence about whether they were available only to supervisors \u2014 which Gobert was not \u2014 or also to some lower-ranking employees. But even assuming the latter, Gobert admitted that the employees with company cell phones had different job duties, and he has provided no evidence that they were similarly situated to him. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on the disparate-treatment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">With respect to the hostile-work-environment claims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gobert alleges on appeal only that Raines, embarrassed him a couple of times at meetings (without referencing his race or age) and assigned him a lousy office. Such conduct is neither sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute harassment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor has Gobert provided any evidence that it was based on race or age, <em>see Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">With respect to Gobert\u2019s retaliation claim, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that he engaged in protected activity, he has not provided any evidence of a causal link between that activity and his eventual termination. <em>See Turner, </em>476 F.3d at 348. That claim fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. The district court also granted summary judgment to Computer Sciences Corporation (\"CSC\u201d), the company that supervised Gobert, because it was not his employer.
