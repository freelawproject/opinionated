On appeal, Perez-Sanchez argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 45, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578-79 (4th Cir.2010) (abuse of discretion standard of review applicable when defendant properly preserves a claim of sentencing error in district court \u201c[b]y drawing arguments from [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 [2006] for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed\u201d). We begin by reviewing the sentence for significant procedural error, including such errors as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If there are no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). We presume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">\u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court \u2018must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586). Accordingly, a sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the particular facts presented and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons that support its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s explanation need not be exhaustive; it must be \u201csufficient \u2018to satisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>exercising [its] own legal decicisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We hold that the district court committed neither procedural nor substantive error during sentencing. The district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range and, contrary to Perez-Sanchez\u2019s assertion, sentenced him within that range. Further, it is apparent from the court\u2019s discussion that it considered both parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
