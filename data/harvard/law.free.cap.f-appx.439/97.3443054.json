The District Court sua sponte dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice pursuant to the abstention doctrine of <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). After filing a futile Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion, Lu-sick appealed. While disagreeing with the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Younger, </em>we determined nonetheless that \u201cLusick\u2019s complaint fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Lusick v. Lawrence, </em>378 Fed.Appx. 118, 119-20 (3d Cir.2010). More specifically, we identified numerous faults in Lusick\u2019s complaint, including a failure to actually demonstrate harm \u2014 his misconduct charge was eventually filed \u2014 and an insufficient pleading of his conspiracy allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 120-21. We thus summarily affirmed the judgment of the District Court. <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">On February 1, 2011 \u2014 more than a year after the District Court denied his motion to alter or amend the judgment \u2014 Lusick filed a document entitled \u201cIn Re: Praecipe for Reopening of Case <em>Lusick v. Lawernece </em>[sic ] Based on Newly Discovered Evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), Lusick asked the District Court to \u201ctake judicial notice\u201d that his misconduct complaint had been \u201cdeferred and or administratively closed without opinion.\u201d He enclosed a document that was purportedly served on one Hugh J. Burns on May 15, 2010, although no record of such appears on the District Court\u2019s docket. In the enclosure, Lusick alleged that Vivian Miller, the Clerk of Quarter Sessions, was \u201cforced to resign her office\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>in May 2010,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by dint of her being \u201cincompetent for years\u201d; it also charged this Court with \u201cnot giv[ing] a fair reading to [his] complaint.\u201d Lusick further moved for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The District Court denied both motions, observing that Lusick\u2019s Rule 60(b)(2) motion was not filed within the one-year limit prescribed by Rule 60(c). Lusick appealed. He has requested the appointment of counsel, and has asked that we \u201cdepose Vivian Miller to preserve her testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of denial of relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), with the exception of claims raised under 60(b)(4), is for abuse of discretion. <em>Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, </em>536 F.3d 244, 251 (3d Cir.2008). The same standard applies to our review of a District Court\u2019s decision declining to appoint counsel. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">While an in forma pauperis appellant may proceed without the prepayment of fees, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), we must dismiss the appeal if we determine it to be frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). An appeal is frivolous when it raises no legal issue that is arguable on the merits. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 301 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">To the extent that Lusick properly moved to reopen pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d would have to be evidence of facts in exisfence at the time of his original filing of which he was excusably ignorant. <em>United States v. 27.93 Acres of Land, </em>924 F.2d 506, 516 (3d Cir.1991) (citations omitted). It is unclear whether Lusick could have been aware of the turmoil in the Quarter Sessions office at the time of his original action, but no matter: he failed to seek relief within one year of the District Court\u2019s judgment. \u201cMotions under Rule 60(b)(1)-(3) must be brought within one year of the entry of a final judgment. <em>An appeal does not toll this time period. </em>Therefore, relief under Rules 60(b)(1)-(3) is time barred.\u201d <em>Moolenaar v. Gov\u2019t of V.I., </em>822 F.2d 1342, 1346 n. 5 (3d Cir.1987) (emphasis added). To the extent that Lu-sick\u2019s motion could be construed as sounding under Rule 60(b)(6), which has a less-stringent time limit, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1), he has failed to allege any \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that would otherwise justify reopening his case. <em>See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs., </em>507 U.S. 380, 393, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">As there is no merit to this appeal, we deny Lusick\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir.1993). Lusick\u2019s \u201cMotion to Perpetuate Testimony\u201d is also denied. This appeal will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-14\">. To be precise, Lusick filed <em>two </em>documents on or around that date. <em>See </em>ECF Nos. 17-18. Aside from some slight differences in formatting, they appear to be identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. Lusick says that he came to this information by way of the Philadelphia Daily News, but does not cite (or enclose) any specific article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\">. Nor does he accurately characterize our previous opinion. Then, as now, he had alleged, at best, a \"bureaucratic blunder.\u201d <em>Lu-sick, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 120. Rather than suggest the presence of a conspiracy to violate his rights or a policy of selectively ignoring certain complaints, the \"new evidence\u201d to which he refers implies even more strongly that the failure to process his original complaint was an oversight, rather than \"malfeasance\u201d or <em>\u201cdeliberate </em>indifference.\u201d Further, while Lusick speaks of his complaint as being \"administratively closed without opinion,\u201d he neglects to explain the reasoning behind that decision \u2014 whether, for example, it was deemed meritless or was dismissed for untimely filing \u2014 and hence has again failed to demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
