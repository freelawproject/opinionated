Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Jaimes-Reyes failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his U.S. citizen children. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 979 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">Jaimes-Reyes contends the IJ violated due process by refusing to admit into evidence a psychological evaluation submitted on the day of the hearing. Contrary to Jaimes-Reyes\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting [his] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Jaimes-Reyes failed to demonstrate that the additional evidence would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
