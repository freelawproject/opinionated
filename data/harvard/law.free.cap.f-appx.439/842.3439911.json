On December 4, 2006, Martin was involved in a car accident with Sherry Lynn Harris, a USPS employee acting in the scope of her employment. On December 2, 2008 \u2014 two days before the statute of limitations would bar suit\u2014 Martin sued Harris in state court. Approximately nine months later, Martin filed an administrative claim for relief with the USPS, and, in February 2010, she filed a voluntary notice of dismissal of the state court action. Accordingly, the state court dismissed the suit on March 2, 2010. The USPS constructively denied Martin\u2019s claim for administrative relief in March 2010, which led her to file the instant lawsuit in federal court. The district court dismissed the suit as time-barred. After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">\u201cIn reviewing the district court\u2019s decision to grant the motion to dismiss pursuant to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(1), lack of subject matter jurisdiction, this Court reviews the legal conclusions of the district court <em>de novo.\u201d McElmurray v. Consol. Gov\u2019t of Augusta-Richmond Cnty, </em>501 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">\u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u201d <em>Lane v. Pena, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996). The Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) abrogates the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity and allows the federal government to be held liable to the same extent as a private individual for certain torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment. <em>See Sosa v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number><em>Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 700, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). The FTCA requires a potential plaintiff to submit a claim to the appropriate agency prior to filing suit against the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claim must be filed \u201cwithin two years after [it] accrues. ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Only after agency denial \u2014 explicitly or after six months of non-action \u2014 is a judicial remedy available. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2675(a). Before administrative exhaustion, a district court lacks jurisdiction to hear an FTCA claim. <em>See Burchfield v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1252, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In limited circumstances, an FTCA claim that is not filed with the appropriate administrative agency within the two-year limitations period may nonetheless be timely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(5). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">Whenever an action or proceeding in which the United States is substituted as the party defendant under this subsection is dismissed for failure first to present a claim pursuant to [the administrative exhaustion requirement], such a claim shall be deemed to be timely presented ... if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">(A) the claim would have been timely had it been filed on the date the underlying civil action was commenced, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">(B) the claim is presented to the appropriate Federal agency within 60 days after dismissal of the civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">\u00a7 2679(d)(5). Therefore, in limited circumstances, FTCA claims that did not originally satisfy the time constraints for filing an administrative claim will not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Martin concedes that her suit is timely only if she satisfies \u00a7 2679(d)(5). She argues that her situation is the exact circumstance that the provision exists to rectify. Specifically, she filed a timely suit in state court \u2014 prior to exhausting administrative remedies \u2014 and chose to dismiss it to pursue her administrative remedies. Martin believes that the government erred by failing to substitute the United States as the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 2679(c) and (d)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before her voluntary dismissal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>She repeatedly emphasizes that the failure of USPS counsel to notify the Attorney General of the claim left her without recourse. We disagree and determine that the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The relevant provision unquestionably includes a threshold condition, namely that there is \u201can action or proceeding in which the United States is substituted as the party defendant\u201d that \u201cis dismissed for failure first to present a claim\u201d to the proper administrative agency. \u00a7 2679(d)(5). Here, Martin quite clearly fails to meet that condition. The United States was never substituted as the defendant in the state court action. Instead, Martin voluntarily dismissed that suit while Harris remained the only defendant. Plaintiffs counsel could have quite easily satisfied \u00a7 2679(d)(5)\u2019s requirement by declining to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit and forcing the government to substitute the United States as the defendant in place of Harris. If that had been done, Martin would not be facing the problem she encounters today. As the clear language of \u00a7 2679(d)(5) requires the United States to be a party defendant, we conclude that Martin\u2019s claim cannot be saved by that exception. Therefore, her administrative claim, filed more than two years after the claim arose, is time-barred. Because Martin failed to satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirement, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear her claim. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\">. Specifically, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail. The failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to such claims as may be asserted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by third party complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\">. Section 2679(d)(2) states, in relevant part: Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
