We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Barajas demonstrated extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5)(i); <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Barajas\u2019 withholding of removal claim because the discrimination and harassment he experienced in Mexico did not rise to the level of persecution, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003), and the criminal rape by an older schoolmate was not on account of a protected ground, <em>see Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence further supports the agency\u2019s determination that Barajas failed to establish a clear probability that he would be persecuted based on his sexual orientation upon his return to Mexico. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cWhen, as here, a petitioner has not established past persecution, there is no presumption to overcome ... [and] the IJ and the BIA are entitled to rely on all relevant evidence in the record, including a State Department report\u201d). Accordingly, Barajas\u2019 claim for withholding of removal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Barajas\u2019 CAT claim because he failed to show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Mexico. See <em>Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721-22 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
