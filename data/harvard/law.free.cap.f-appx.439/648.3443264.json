Petitioners allege they fear persecution from gang members because of their membership in a social group consisting of \u201cpeople who fear crime.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish that they were targeted, or will be targeted, because of their membership in a social group, and failed to establish a nexus to any other protected ground. <em>See Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1016 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Cir.2010) (\u201c[a]n alien\u2019s desire to be free from harassment by criminals motivated by theft or random violence by gang members bears no nexus to a protected ground\u201d); <em>Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 861-62 (9th Cir.2009) (social group must be sufficiently particular, and not too broad and diverse). Because petitioners did not establish a nexus to a protected ground, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Petitioners\u2019 claim, that their due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s failure to fully articulate its reasoning, is belied by the record, which includes the BIA\u2019s detailed decision dismissing their appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 claims, raised for the first time in their opening brief, that their opposition to gangs constituted political opinion and that petitioners feared domestic violence against women in Honduras, because petitioners failed to administratively exhaust these claims. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
