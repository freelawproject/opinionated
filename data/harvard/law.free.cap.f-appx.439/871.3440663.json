On appeal, Clarke argues that the BIA and IJ erred in concluding that he was an \u201calien crewman\u201d and thus statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The Attorney General may, in his discretion, adjust the status of an alien admitted or paroled into the United States if the alien meets certain requirements. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). When applying for adjustment of status, the alien bears the burden of establishing that he meets the eligibility requirements. INA \u00a7 240(c)(4), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4) (as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-18). However, adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(a), is not available to an \u201calien crewman.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). The INA defines a \u201ccrewman\u201d as \u201ca person serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(10), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Clarke argues that he does not meet the definition of a crewman because he did not enter the United States while employed on a ship, nor did he have a contract of employment as a crewman waiting for him in the United States at the time of his entry. However, an alien need not be a crewman before he enters the United States in order to meet the INA\u2019s definition; it is sufficient that the alien enter the United States \u201cin pursuit of his calling as a seaman.\u201d <em>Parzagonis v. I.N.S., </em>747 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1984). Clarke entered the United States with a nonimmigrant \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa. A \u201cC-l\u201d visa classification is given to non-immigrants in transit, and a \u201cD\u201d visa classification is given to someone accorded \u201calien crewman\u201d status. <em>See Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 82, 85-86 (BIA 2009). The IJ found that Clarke\u2019s visa type was a clear indication that Clarke was a crewman, and requested that Clarke submit documentary evidence of his visa application to establish that the C-l visa was issued for some purpose other than to join a ship as a crewman. Clarke declined to present any such evidence. Rather, his counsel acknowledged at the hearing that Clarke\u2019s visa application would show that he represented to immigration officials that he was an intending crewman in order to obtain his visa.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we cannot say this record compels reversal of the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Clarke was an \u201calien crewman\u201d and thus failed to meet his burden of establishing that he was eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. We have jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether Clarke was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010). We review the BIA and IJ\u2019s finding that Clarke was a \"crewman\u201d for substantial evidence and will reverse the agency\u2019s findings only if the record compels reversal. <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. Clarke argues that under the BIA\u2019s unpublished decision in <em>In re: Saturnino Orocay Baguis Jr., </em>2005 WL 1848389 (BIA May 6, 2005), he should be classified as a nonimmigrant in transit, not an alien crewman, because he was issued a Form 1-94 rather than a Form 1-184 or Form 1-95 upon his entry into the United States. As an initial matter, this decision is unpublished and does not control here. Moreover, we see no reversible error in the IJ\u2019s determination that Clarke's case is distinguishable from <em>In re: Saturnino </em>because the record shows that Clarke obtained his visa by representing that he intended to obtain work as a crewman in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
