On January 14, 2011, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal of McFadden\u2019s petition and denial of his motion to amend, with notice that objections were to be filed within fourteen days of service of the report. On February 7, 2011, the district court dismissed McFadden\u2019s action, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and stating that because McFadden failed to object to the report, he was not entitled to de novo review, an explanation of the district court\u2019s decision, or the right to appeal. McFadden timely appealed. On appeal, McFadden complains that he did not receive the magistrate judge\u2019s report or the accompanying notice. A litigant who fails to timely object in writing to a magistrate judge\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law is not entitled to de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s determinations, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (West Supp.2011), and is barred from contesting these determinations on appeal. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985). However, this waiver is a prudential rule, not a jurisdictional requirement. <em>United States v. Schronce, </em>727 F.2d 91, 93-94 (4th Cir.1984). Consequently, when a litigant is proceeding pro se, this court has held that he must be given fair notice of the consequences of failing to object before such a procedural default will result. <em>Wright, </em>766 F.2d at 846. When objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s determinations have been filed, de novo review by an Article III judge is not only required by statute, <em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47-48 (4th Cir.1982), but has been held indispensable to the constitutionality of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Act. <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 681-82, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">The record supports McFadden\u2019s claim that he did not receive the magistrate judge\u2019s report. On January 18, 2011, the court received McFadden\u2019s change of address notice. On that same day, the magistrate judge\u2019s report was mailed to McFadden\u2019s original address. There is no indication in the record that the report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>forwarded to McFadden\u2019s new address. Because it appears that McFadden did not receive either the magistrate judge\u2019s report itself or notice of the consequences of failing to object to the report, we are constrained to return the case to the district court so that McFadden can be provided with a copy of the report and notice of the need to file timely and specific objections to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
