We bypass the question of whether the petitioner, Kenneth Ware (\u201cWare\u201d), exhausted his federal due process claim in the state courts, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2), and we affirm the denial of his claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-20\">Ware argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction under the Massachusetts Armed Career Criminal statute. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 269, \u00a7 10G(b). He contends that his prior drug conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense because it was not a \u201cserious drug felony\u201d as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, \u00a7 10G(e). Subsection 10G(e) defines a \u201cserious drug felony\u201d as \u201can offense under chapter 94C involving the manufacture, distribution or possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance [ ] for which a maximum term of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d Ware was previously convicted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a) of possession with intent to distribute a class B substance. But he points to the fact that in that prior case, he was prosecuted in the state district court, where the maximum sentence he faced was only two and one-half years. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, \u00a7 27. If he had been prosecuted in the superior court, however, he would have faced a potential maximum sentence of ten years. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The Massachusetts Appeals Court, interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, \u00a7 10G(e), concluded that under the state statute, Ware\u2019s previous conviction under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a) does qualify as a \u201cserious drug felony\u201d within the meaning of the state armed career criminal act. <em>See Commonwealth v. Ware, </em>75 Mass.App.Ct. 220, 223-25, 913 N.E.2d 869, 872-74 (2009). This court is bound by that interpretation of the state statute. <em>See Bradshaw v. Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 76, 126 S.Ct. 602, 163 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005) (\u201ca state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus\u201d) (citing <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 691, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975)); <em>see also Pulley v. Harris, </em>465 U.S. 37, 41, 104 S.Ct. 871, 79 L.Ed.2d 29 (1984) (\u201cA federal court may not issue the writ [of habeas corpus] on the basis of a perceived error of state law.\u201d). Given that Ware\u2019s prior drug dealing conviction did qualify as a predicate offense under the state armed career criminal statute \u2014 a conclusion which the federal courts must respect \u2014 the evidence clearly was sufficient to support Ware\u2019s conviction as an armed career criminal. Thus, his federal due process claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
