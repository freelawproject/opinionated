Factual findings underlying the agency\u2019s denial of relief are reviewed for substantial evidence, <em>Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1115 (9th Cir.2000), and they are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). As the facts of the case are known to the parties, we need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">With respect to withholding of removal, the agency denied relief because the government established that Singh \u201ccould avoid a future threat to his ... life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Nothing in the record compels a contrary conclusion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). In his own testimony, Singh only expressed a fear of Punjab police, and noted several lengths of time in which he was able to reside in other portions of India without incident. The record further demonstrates that Punjabi Sikhs such as Singh are able to relocate to other parts of India. Moreover, the record does not compel the conclusion that rank-and-file members of Singh\u2019s political party are subject to persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The agency likewise denied relief under the CAT, because the government established that Singh \u201ccould relocate to a part of the country of removal where he ... is not likely to be tortured.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3)(ii). There is no presumption of future persecution in this context: rather, \u201cthe burden is on the applicant to show that it is more likely than not that [ ]he will be tortured, and one of the relevant considerations is the possibility of relocation.\u201d <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Singh\u2019s assertions with respect to this claim are substantially similar to those under withholding of removal. For all the reasons stated in the prior Part, Singh has \u201cfailed to establish that internal relocation within [India] was impossible.\u201d <em>Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2008). The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s request for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Accordingly, Singh\u2019s petition for review with respect to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT is</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-25\">. Singh's asylum claim is addressed in a separate opinion. <em>See Singh v. Holder, </em>No. 08-70434, 623 F.3d 633 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
