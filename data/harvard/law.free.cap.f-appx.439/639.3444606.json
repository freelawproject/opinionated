We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004), and we review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination based upon the Id\u2019s conclusion that several of Chen\u2019s documents likely were fabricated, <em>see Desta, </em>365 F.3d at 745 (fraudulent documents going to heart of claim may justify adverse credibility finding), and based upon Chen\u2019s failure to provide sufficiently detailed testimony about his detention and mistreatment, <em>see Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (approving agency\u2019s finding that an applicant\u2019s testimony could be doubted given its lack of specificity). In the absence of credible testimony, Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-23\">Because Chen\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he points to no other evidence the IJ should have considered, substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">The BIA did not err by declining to consider the new evidence Chen submitted on appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). To the extent the BIA construed Chen\u2019s submission of new evidence as a motion to reopen or motion to remand, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because Chen failed to demonstrate that his additional evidence was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
