Appellant alleges that defendants violated his constitutional rights by administratively imposing a term of post-release supervision in 2006, and continuing to enforce the supervision term until his resentencing in 2009. On March 23, 2010, the district court granted defendants-appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s claims for compensatory damages on the basis of qualified immunity and the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Our review of a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, based upon qualified immunity grounds and the Eleventh Amendment, is de novo, accepting as true all material allegations of the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor. <em>Pena v. DePrisco, </em>432 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">After having independently reviewed the record in light of these principles, as to the claims for damages, we affirm the judgment for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s decision and in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott v. Fischer, </em>616 F.3d 100 (2d Cir.2010). In addition, because appellant did not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that his claim against the Franklin Correctional Facility was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, this claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The district court, however, did not discuss appellant\u2019s claims for equitable relief. In addition to seeking damages, appellant had also sought injunctive relief in the form of removal from the Division of Parole\u2019s supervision and custody. Qualified immunity and sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment do not bar such claims for equitable relief. <em>Fulton v. Goord, </em>591 F.3d 37, 45 (2d Cir.2009) (holding injunctive relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment); <em>Adler v. Pataki, </em>185 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that qualified immunity does not bar actions for declaratory or injunctive relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Nonetheless, based on the record below, the district court did not err in dismissing all claims. Upon appellant\u2019s resentencing by the New York State Supreme Court, the court reinstated its original sentence of four years with no period of post-release supervision, thus terminating the Division of Parole\u2019s custody of appellant. This occurred approximately one month after appellant filed the present underlying action in the district court. Therefore, appellant\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
