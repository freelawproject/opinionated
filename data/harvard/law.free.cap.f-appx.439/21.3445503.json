Each of Rellou\u2019s claims raised the issue of whether First Unum Life Insurance Company (\u201cFirst Unum\u201d), as administrator of the JP Morgan Chase Long-Term Disability Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), properly exercised its discretion in deducting from Rellou\u2019s long-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) payments the amount of Social Security Disability Insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) payments that she received from the government for her dependent children. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See, e.g., Paneccasio v. Unisource Worldwide, Inc., </em>532 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Doninger v. Niehoff, </em>642 F.3d 334, 344 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). Having conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record and considered the parties\u2019 submissions, we affirm the judgment of the District Court for substantially the reasons stated in its thorough and well-reasoned opinion. <em>See Rellou v. JP Morgan Chase Long-Term Disability Plan, </em>No. 07-CV-1334 (KMK), 2009 WL 3151230 (S.D.N.Y. Sep.30, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">With respect to Rellou\u2019s claim for improper denial of ERISA plan benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (2006), the District Court properly held that the plain language of the Plan and other related documents \u2014 received by Rellou prior to her applications for LTD payments and for SSDI benefits \u2014 made it clear that her LTD payments would be offset by any SSDI benefits she or her family or dependents received, and that this unambiguous language was not modified by a Resource Guide that Rellou had received in 2002. In so holding, the District Court properly accounted for the fact that First Unum operated under a conflict of interest, insofar as First Union both determined Rellou\u2019s eligibility for benefits and paid the benefits out of its own pocket. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 111, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008) (\u201cIf a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who <em>is operating under a conflict of interest, </em>that conflict must be <em>weighed as a \u201cfactor </em>in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d \u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphases in original). Rellou\u2019s argument on appeal that the District Court did not properly weigh First Unum\u2019s conflict of interest is unpersuasive. As the District Court noted, given the unambiguous language of the documents Rellou received, this was not a close call. Indeed, the District Court stated that \u201cthe result here would be the same even under a <em>de novo </em>standard.\u201d <em>Rellou, </em>2009 WL 3151230, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">With respect to Rellou\u2019s claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the District Court properly found that she failed to show that there was any material misrepresentation or omission on which she could have relied to her detriment. On appeal, Rellou argues that the District Court improperly found that her reliance on defendants\u2019 statements was not detrimental because it failed to consider evidence of the \u201cpunitive tax liabilities\u201d on her SSDI benefits, which resulted in her receiving a lesser total payment from her combined long-term disability payments and SSDI benefits than she would have received had she never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>applied for SSDI benefits. Contrary to Rellou\u2019s assertion, it does not appear that this argument was made in the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court generally will not review arguments raised for the first time on appeal, except \u201cwhere necessary to avoid a manifest injustice or where the argument presents a question of law and there is no need for additional fact-finding.\u201d <em>Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lerner, </em>416 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rellou has failed to show that either of those conditions are present in this appeal. In any event, her argument is moot because the District Court\u2019s discussion of detrimental reliance was merely dicta, given its express holding that Rellou failed to show a material misrepresentation or omission, a necessary element of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Finally, with respect to Rellou\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim, the District Court correctly concluded that the 2002 Resource Guide, on which Rellou allegedly relied to her detriment, was not a promise and that there were no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d present, as required for an ERISA plaintiff to succeed on a promissory-estoppel claim. <em>See Weinreb v. Hosp. for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Inst., </em>404 F.3d 167, 172-73 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted) (explaining elements of promissory-estoppel claim in ERISA context).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We have reviewed Rellou\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We reject all of Rellou\u2019s claims on appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\">. To support her argument, Rellou attached to her brief a March 2009 letter from her accountant setting forth her tax liability on her SSDI benefits for tax years 2005 to 2008. This letter was not provided to the District Court during the summary-judgment briefing. The District Court's docket sheet indicates that, in June 2009, while the summary-judgment motions were pending, Rellou attempted to deliver additional papers to the court without her attorney\u2019s knowledge. <em>See </em>ROA Doc. 63. However, in response to a letter from First Unum\u2019s counsel, the District Court indicated that it had not reviewed, and would not review, this <em>ex parte </em>submission. <em>See id. </em>Because the submission was never docketed, it is unclear whether the accountant\u2019s letter was included among these additional papers. What is clear, however, is that this evidence was not properly presented to, or considered by, the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
