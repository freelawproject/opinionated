PORFILIO, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-22\">An immigration judge (IJ) denied Carlos Navarro-Perez\u2019s requests for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal, and he petitions for review. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Mr. Navarro, a native and citizen of Mexico, first entered the United States with his father in 1990. At that time, he was seven years old. In 1997, 1998, or 1999, he was caught at the border and returned to Mexico, but he illegally reentered the United States the next day. During the summer of 2002 (\u201cprobably ... May or June----[o]r July\u201d), Mr. Navarro visited Mexico for two or three weeks. Admin. R. at 120. When he returned to the United States, he was stopped at the border and officials took him to jail, fingerprinted him, and \u201cthrew [him] back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. When asked at the hearing how old he was \u201cat th[at] time,\u201d he responded, \u201cI was \u2014 I had to have been, maybe, 19.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He returned to the United States by sneaking through a river.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">On December 1, 2003, Mr. Navarro pleaded guilty to and was convicted of third-degree assault in Colorado. The conviction stemmed from a 2002 fight he had with an ex-girlfriend who went to the hospital after Mr. Navarro \u201cpunched her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. Two years later, he pleaded guilty to another Colorado third-degree assault charge. The second charge was the result of a bar fight where Mr. Navarro threw beer bottles and \u201chit some girl ... in the neck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. The administrative record is less detailed concerning the 2005 third-degree assault charge, but it is uncontested that Mr. Navarro was indeed convicted of this charge, <em>see </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">In early 2006, Mr. Navarro married a United States citizen with whom he has three children. She filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf in July of that year; at the same time, Mr. Navarro filed a Form 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Petition for Alien Relative was approved on April 20, 2007. \u201cThat approval officially established [Mr. Navarro and his wife\u2019s] marital relationship for immigration purposes, and it was one prerequisite that had to be satisfied before [Mr. Navarro] could apply for ... adjustment of status.\u201d <em>United States v. Atandi, </em>376 F.3d 1186, 1187 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">On April 3, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) served Mr. Navarro with a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings, alleging he had entered the United States in 1997 without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer, and charging him as subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Mr. Navarro, through counsel, conceded removability as charged and indicated he was seeking cancellation of removal under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), and adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), based on his marriage to a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In October 2009, after a number of hearings at which Mr. Navarro was represented by counsel and testified, an IJ issued an oral decision denying the relief sought. Mr. Navarro appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The BIA dismissed the appeal. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Navarro was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his 2003 third-degree assault conviction constituted a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) (requiring, among other things, that to be eligible for cancellation of removal an alien must not have been convicted of a crime under \u00a7 1182(a)(2), which includes a CIMT). In reaching this determination, the BIA relied on Mr. Navarro\u2019s 2003 record of conviction, explaining that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">clearly shows that the respondent pled guilty to acting knowingly <em>and </em>recklessly to cause bodily injury.... This level of intent and injury demonstrates that he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Matter of Solon, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 239 (BIA 2007) (discussing interplay between intent and degree of harm caused).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Admin. R. at 4 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Admin. R. at 172 (criminal complaint charging Mr. Navarro with \u201cunlawfully, knowingly <em>and </em>recklessly causing] injury to\u201d his ex-girlfriend (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">The BIA rejected Mr. Navarro\u2019s argument that Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-204 \u201cis not divisible,\u201d Admin. R. at 4, explaining that Mr. Navarro \u201cmisapprehends the holding in <em>Marquez Garda v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 1288 (10th Cir.2009), which actually held that [\u00a7 18-3-204] covers conduct that is morally turpitudinous, as well as conduct that is not. 584 F.3d at 1289.\u201d Admin. R. at 4. Further, noted the BIA, in <em>Marquez Garda </em>the court \u201cheld that the burden was on the respondent to prove his eligibility for the requested relief, and because the record was inconclusive [in <em>Marquez Garda,] </em>the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.\u201d Admin. R. at 4. Turning to Mr. Navarro\u2019s 2005 third-degree assault conviction, the BIA decided the record was \u201cinconclusive, meaning that under <em>Marquez Garda, </em>[Mr. Navarro] ha[d] not met his burden of proof to establish eligibility for relief.\u201d Admin. R. at 4. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A) (alien bears burden of proof to establish eligibility for relief from removal); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">The BIA also agreed with the IJ\u2019s denial of Mr. Navarro\u2019s application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because he had failed to carry his burden of demonstrating he was not inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). That subsection states, \u201c[a]ny alien who ... has been unlawfully present in the United States for an aggregate period of more than 1 year ... and who enters or attempts to reenter the United States without being admitted is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>In particular, the BIA highlighted Mr. Navarro\u2019s testimony that he first entered the United States in 1990, he turned eighteen on July 22, 2001, and he \u201cadmitted to returning to Mexico briefly in the summer of 2002.\u201d Admin. R. at 4. As such, the BIA concurred with the IJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Navarro \u201cfailed to show that he ha[d] not been unlawfully present in the United States for 1 year since he turned 18 years old,\u201d and concluded he was therefore ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>Id. </em>at 4. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The issues raised by Mr. Navarro relate to his applications for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b and adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. While we are statutorily precluded from reviewing \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under\u201d those sections, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we nonetheless retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review\u201d regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of an alien\u2019s applications, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201cWe have construed \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law\u2019 language to reach ... constitutional and statutory-construction questions, not discretionary or factual questions.\u201d <em>Lorenzo v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1278, 1282 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1281, 1282 (10th Cir.2006) (construing \u201cquestions of law\u201d in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to include \u201ca narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction\u201d and rejecting a broader interpretation that would grant jurisdiction to review \u201call claims having a legal dimension\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">\u201cBecause a single member of the BIA decided the appeal and issued a brief opinion, we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination and limit our review to issues specifically addressed therein.\u201d <em>Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 1294, 1297 (10th Cir.2011) (brackets omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may, however, \u201cconsider the IJ\u2019s decision for a further explanation of the grounds for the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s \u201clegal determinations de novo.\u201d <em>Herrera-Castillo, </em>573 F.3d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">\n<em>Cancellation of removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">In his petition for review, Mr. Navarro contends that \u201c[although there was ambiguity in both the 2003 and 2005 convictions,\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 23, the IJ and BIA erroneously failed to consider his testimony in determining the turpitude question, as prescribed by <em>Matter of Silva-Trevino, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 687, 704 (BIA 2008) (requiring adjudicators to consider \u201cadditional evidence the adjudicator determines is necessary ... to resolve accurately the moral turpitude question\u201d \u201cif the record of conviction does not resolve the inquiry\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support, he contends that his \u201ctestimony does not go into detail as to the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>suffered by the victims in either case\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no actual evidence specifically of a serious bodily injury,\u201d which, he argues, \u201cmust be necessary for the Colorado Statute to be a CMT [sic].\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 25. <em>Cf. Brue v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.2006) (observing that we are without jurisdiction to \u201creweigh evidence to determine if the crime was indeed particularly serious\u201d). He sums up his argument in a conclusory fashion, asserting that the \u201cfacts do not remotely sound in a willful or intentional or even knowingly state of mind.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In resolving the turpitude issue with respect to Mr. Navarro\u2019s 2003 third-degree assault conviction, the BIA relied on the record of conviction. The BIA was therefore not required to consider Mr. Navarro\u2019s testimony. See <em>Silva-Trevino, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 704. With respect to his 2005 third-degree assault conviction, the BIA determined that the record was inconclusive; and, having examined the record, it is clear Mr. Navarro\u2019s testimony was taken into account in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">To the extent Mr. Navarro asks this court to reconsider the facts in his case, including his hearing testimony, and conclude that either or both of his convictions were not crimes involving moral turpitude, we are without jurisdiction to do so. An alien does not raise a constitutional claim or question of law \u201cwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) ... by arguing that the evidence was incorrectly weighed, insufficiently considered, or supports a different outcome.\u201d <em>Alzainati v. Holder, </em>568 F.3d 844, 850-51 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part Mr. Navarro\u2019s challenges to the denial of his application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\n<em>Adjustment of Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">With regard to his application for adjustment of status, Mr. Navarro asserts that what is critical is whether he demonstrated he was subject to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii), which contains an exception to inadmissibility for unlawfully present aliens under eighteen years of age in calculating the alien\u2019s period of unlawful presence, <em>or </em>whether he was subject to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), as the BIA and IJ concluded, and as the government maintains. Mr. Navarro attempts to shore-up his assertion with challenges to the IJ\u2019s (but not the BIA\u2019s) (1) factual findings, <em>see </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 15 (arguing that the \u201cIJ determined against the weight of the evidence that [Mr. Navarro] had been present in the United States for more than one year prior to his departure\u201d), and (2) interpretation of the hearing testimony, <em>see id. </em>at 18 (\u201cThe alien\u2019s own credible testimony is sufficient to establish the record and facts and therefore, sufficient to demonstrate his burden.\u201d). We are without jurisdiction to consider these challenges. <em>Alzainati, </em>568 F.3d at 850-51; <em>Lorenzo, </em>508 F.3d at 1282 (explaining that this court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u2019s \u201cquestions of law language\u201d does not reach \u201cdiscretionary or factual questions\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Mr. Navarro also claims the BIA\u2019s \u201cdecision is deficient ... and is arbitrary and capricious\u201d because the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cand not the testimony in this case.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 19. But he provides no support or elaboration, whatsoever. See <em>Murrell v. Shalala, </em>43 F.3d 1388, 1389 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994) (observing that \u201cperfunctory complaints\u201d that \u201cfail to frame and develop an issue\u201d are insufficient \u201cto invoke appellate review\u201d). If he is asking this court to reconsider his hearing testimony and conclude that he met his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>burden of demonstrating he was not present in the United States for an aggregate period of more than one year <em>between </em>turning eighteen (on July 22, 2001,) and <em>leaving </em>the United States in the summer of 2002, we are without jurisdiction to do so. <em>Alzainati, </em>568 F.3d at 850-51; <em>Lorenzo, </em>508 F.3d at 1282.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Finally, Mr. Navarro contends that because the BIA and IJ erroneously</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ada\">failed to address in whole <em>Padilla-Caldera v. Gonzales[, </em>453 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir.2005), <em>overruled by Padilla-Caldera v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 1140 (10th Cir.2011),] and <em>In re Briones[, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355 (BIA 2007),] it is unclear the stance this court will take in terms [of] whether the BIA has drawn a rational relationship between 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Pet\u2019r Br. at 20. He then invites \u201cthis court ... not [to] defer to the BIA[\u2019s]\u201d construction of those statutes, asserting <em>\u201cBriones </em>is itself arbitrary, capricious and manifestly contrary to the law.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 20-21 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Despite Mr. Navarro\u2019s assertions, our precedent dictates our \u201cstance.\u201d Less than two months after he filed a petition for judicial review, we concluded that the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 371, must be accorded Chevron<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> deference. Pad<em>illa-Caldera, </em>637 F.3d at 1152. Stated differently, we concluded that this court must accord deference to the BIA\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat an alien who is inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) cannot qualify for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i) absent a waiver of inadmissibility (which is not at issue here).\u201d <em>Padilla-Caldera, </em>637 F.3d at 1143 (citing <em>Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 371). In reaching this conclusion, we \u201cnote[d] that every other court to consider the matter ha[d] reached the same conclusion,\u201d <em>Padilla-Caldera, </em>637 F.3d at 1152 (citing cases from the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits), and we acknowledged that we had previously \u201cadopted a different line of reasoning\u201d in <em>Padilla-Caldera, </em>453 F.3d at 1244. <em>Padilla-Caldera, </em>637 F.3d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part Mr. Navarro\u2019s challenges to the denial of his application for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">We DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction Mr. Navarro\u2019s challenges to the factual findings underlying his applications for cancellation of removal and adjustment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>status. We DENY the balance of the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

In his opening brief, Mr. Navarro asserts, on several occasions, that <em>Padilla-Caldera, </em>453 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir.2005), is still good law.
