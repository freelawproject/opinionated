(collectively, \u201cQVC\u201d), appeal the denial of their request for a preliminary injunction against defendant-appellees Your Vitamins, Inc., and Andrew Lessman (collectively, \u201cLessman\u201d). For the reasons given, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we set forth only the facts and history that are relevant to our conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Andrew Lessman owns a company called Your Vitamins, Inc., d/b/a Procaps Labs, which sells a product called \u201cHealthy Hair, Skin, and Nails,\u201d as well as various products containing reservatrol. He used to sell his vitamin products on QVC, but, several years ago, switched to QVC\u2019s rival, HSN. Some time after the switch, QVC introduced a supplement called \u201cHealthy Hair, Skin, and Nails\u201d (\u201cQVC\u2019s Healthy HSN\u201d), the same name that Lessman uses for his own supplement. QVC also sells several forms of a reservatrol supplement that compete with Lessman\u2019s versions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">In January 2010, shortly after the introduction of QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN, Lessman posted several blog posts on his website, complaining about what he perceived to be the unfairness of QVC\u2019s using the name of his product for its own. In addition to complaining about QVC\u2019s conduct, Less-man alleged that (1) QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN is over 90% additives; (2) there is a significant body of troubling research that connects hyaluronic acid, an ingredient in QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN, to cancer, that \u201cit is totally useless and potentially harmful,\u201d and, while it \u201cdoes not necessarily \u2018cause\u2019 cancer ... credible research points to a relationship and mechanism, which should preclude its use in vitamins\u201d; (3) that Healthy Hair\u2019s silica is \u201cmore common[ly]\u201d known as \u201csand or glass\u201d and \u201cWe also use silica in our Healthy Hair Skin &amp; Nails, but because we recognize its solubility limitations, we include our soluble organic silicon\u201d; and (4) that QVC\u2019s reservatrol product includes 3 artificial colors, \u201cis almost two-thirds additives,\u201d comes from <em>polygonum cuspidatum, </em>not Japanese knot-weed, contains a Healthy Heart Blend, \u201can all but meaningless list of seven different botanicals \u2014 NONE of which states a standardization of any kind,\u201d and (in drink form) contains 4 grams of sugar per serving from \u201ca mystery source.\u201d He also made a number of general pejorative remarks about QVC\u2019s products, calling them \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cembarrassing,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cdisturbing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">QVC sued, alleging false advertising in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, as well as bringing state-law claims. It sought an injunction against the contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ued publication of Lessman\u2019s blog posts. The District Court denied the injunction, finding that QVC had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. QVC then brought the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">To determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction, \u201ca district court must consider: (1) whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief; (S) whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the non-moving party; and (4) whether granting the preliminary relief will be in the public interest.\u201d <em>Iles v. de Jongh, </em>638 F.3d 169, 172 (3d Cir.2011). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>PennMont Securities v. Frucher, </em>586 F.3d 242, 245 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), forbids the use in commerce of \u201cany ... false or misleading representation of fact which ... misrepresents the nature, characteristics, [or] qualities ... of another person\u2019s goods, services, or commercial activities.\u201d QVC alleges that Lessman\u2019s blog posts contain characterizations of its products which are false or misleading. In order to establish liability under \u00a7 43(a), QVC must show, among other elements, that Lessman\u2019s \u201ccommercial message or statement is either (1) literally false or (2) literally true or ambiguous, but has the tendency to deceive consumers.\u201d <em>Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co., </em>290 F.3d 578, 586 (3d Cir.2002); <em>accord Castrol, Inc. v. Pennzoil, </em>987 F.2d 939, 943 (3d Cir.1993). The District Court analyzed Lessman\u2019s blog posts under both frameworks and concluded that QVC had not shown them to be either literally false or literally true, but with the tendency to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">A. Literal falsity</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u201cA literally false message may be either explicit or conveyed by necessary implication when, considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.\u201d <em>Novartis, </em>290 F.3d 578, 587-88 (3d Cir.2002). False-advertising jurisprudence presumes that when a defendant has made a literally false statement, consumer confusion will result. Therefore, \u201c[w]hen consumer deception can be determined by examining the challenged name or advertising on its face, the plaintiff is excused from the burden of demonstrating actual deception through the use of a consumer survey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587. However, \u201conly an <em>unambiguous </em>message can be literally false. The greater the degree to which a message relies upon the viewer ... to integrate its components and draw the apparent conclusion ... the less likely it is that a finding of literal falsity will be supported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, while \u201cmisdescriptions or false representations of specific characteristics of a product\u201d may be actionable, \u201cexaggeration or overstatement expressed in broad, vague, and commendatory language,\u201d commonly known as \u201cpuffery,\u201d is not. <em>Castrol, </em>987 F.2d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The District Court considered all the evidence and concluded that QVC had not made a showing that it was reasonably likely to demonstrate that Lessman\u2019s blog posts were literally false. In particular, the District Court found that QVC had not shown that Lessman\u2019s statements of fact\u2014 concerning the percentage of additives in QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN, the existence of a \u201crelationship\u201d (albeit not a causal one) between hyaluronic acid and cancer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>presence of silica in QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN, and the composition of QVC\u2019s reservatrol products \u2014 were false. QVC objects that the District Court failed to consider Less-man\u2019s factual statements in their full context, including Lessman\u2019s general negative remarks about QVC\u2019s products, but the context did not render Lessman\u2019s statements <em>literally false. </em>Whether a consumer, considering both Lessman\u2019s factual claims and his general rhetoric about QVC, might potentially be <em>misled </em>by his blog posts, must be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Like the District Court, we find Less-man\u2019s remarks concerning the relationship between hyaluronic acid and cancer the most troubling of his statements. If his statements concerning that relationship had been literally false, his later statement that the levels of the acid in QVC\u2019s Healthy HSN were so low that it nonetheless would not have an effect would not be sufficient to save him from a finding of literal falsity. One cannot escape liability for a literally false claim by pointing to a later disclaimer. <em>See SmithKline Beecham Cons.Healthcare, L.P., v. Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Cons.Pharm. Co., </em>906 F.Supp. 178, 186 (S.D.N.Y.1995). However, we agree with the District Court that Lessman\u2019s statements concerning hyaluronic acid, while somewhat difficult to parse, cannot be read as unambiguously false.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We defer to the District Court\u2019s factual findings in this matter, and see no basis for a holding of clear error. Given those findings, and the District Court\u2019s application of the correct legal standard, we find no abuse of discretion with respect to QVC\u2019s claims of literal falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">B. Misleadingness</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In contrast to claims of literal falsity, \u201cwhere the advertisements are not literally false, plaintiff bears the burden of proving actual deception by a preponderance of the evidence. Hence, it cannot obtain relief by arguing how consumers <em>could </em>react; it must show how consumers <em>actually do </em>react.\u201d <em>Sandoz Pharm. Corp. v. Richardson-Vicks, Inc., </em>902 F.2d 222, 228-29 (3d Cir.1990). \u201cThe success of the claim usually turns on the persuasiveness of a consumer survey.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Co. v. Winback and Conserve Program, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 1421, 1443 (3d Cir.1994). The only evidence QVC offers for consumer reaction to Lessman\u2019s blog posts is the comments which appeared on those posts, purportedly left by consumers. The District Court examined all the sixty-odd comments posted and found that only a handful suggested that consumers had been misled into a materially false belief about QVC\u2019s products. In sum, it concluded that the evidence was inadequate to show that QVC was reasonably likely to prevail on the issue of misleadingness.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also note that, even were the comments more abundant, this sort of evidence will often be of only limited value. Comments left on blog posts can be very difficult to authenticate. The use of false identities in Internet forums is now a well-known tactic for attacking cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>porate rivals. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brad Stone and Matt Richtel, <em>The Hand That Controls the Sock Puppet Could Get Slapped, </em>N.Y. Times, July 16, 2007 (\u201cJohn Mackey, the chief executive of Whole Foods Market ... used a fictional identity on the Yahoo message boards for nearly eight years to assail competition and promote his supermarket chain\u2019s stock.\u201d). Even if a poster is \u201clegitimate,\u201d doubts will often remain as to the sincerity of the comment. <em>See, e.g., Trolling for Your Soul, </em>The Economist, Mar. 31, 2011 (\u201c\u2018Trolling\u2019 \u2014 posting wilfully inflammatory, off-topic or simply stupid remarks \u2014 plagues blogs and other online forums.\u201d). And, finally, even if a poster is genuine and making a comment in good faith, whether he or she would fall in to the universe of consumers whose opinions are relevant (i.e., those who are or potentially might be purchasers of the products in question) often cannot be known. <em>See Merisant Co. v. McNeil Nutritionals, LLC, </em>242 F.R.D. 315, 319 (E.D.Pa.2007) (citing <em>Pittsburgh Press Club v. United States, </em>579 F.2d 751, 758 (3d Cir.1978)). Given these considerations, it was especially appropriate for the District Court to give the blog comments only limited weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Ultimately, the District Court correctly concluded that QVC had not shown on the record at the time that it was reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of this action and therefore that it was not entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the decision of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\">. The District Court has jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1338, and 1367(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\">. QVC argues that even a single instance of confusion may be sufficient to establish liability. However, every case it cites for this proposition concerns deception under the other branch of the Lanham Act \u2014 that is, with respect to trademark confusion. Even in that context, this proposition is not necessarily accepted. <em>See Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Dooney &amp; Bourke, Inc., </em>561 F.Supp.2d 368, 385-86 (S.D.N.Y.2008). Giving full weight to the relevant handful of blog comments, we will not disturb the District Court's finding that they were \"insufficient to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s burden that the advertising tends to deceive or mislead a substantial portion of the intended audience.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T, </em>42 F.3d at 1443 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
