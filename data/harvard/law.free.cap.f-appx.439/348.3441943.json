Morgan argues that the Government was required to file a motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>dure based on his substantial assistance in providing information in the criminal prosecution of another individual. He does not argue that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Grant, </em>493 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.2007). He has also failed to show that the Government either was compelled to file or bargained away its discretion concerning whether to file a Rule 35 motion. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 368 n. 2 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Morgan\u2019s motion to compel was \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Morgan\u2019s motion to compel and related discovery motion. <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 769 n. 3 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3368, 176 L.Ed.2d 1254 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
