We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review Fonseca-Arauz\u2019s contention that she is a member of a particular social group of women who are victims of domestic violence and are unable to obtain protection from the governmental authorities because she did not present this distinct claim to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). Fonseca-Arauz does not challenge the agency\u2019s finding that she failed to establish past persecution. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Fonseca-Arauz did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>not establish that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution because there is no evidence her ex-husband will harm her on account of a protected ground. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051-52 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Fonseca-Arauz\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Because Fonseca-Arauz failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that she has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Molina-Morales, </em>237 F.3d at 1052. Accordingly, Fonseca-Arauz\u2019s withholding of removal claim also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Fonseca-Arauz does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Finally, Fonseca-Arauz\u2019s claim that the BIA failed to articulate reasons for denying her relief is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AC9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
