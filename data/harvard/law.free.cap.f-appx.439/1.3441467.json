R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b23-26\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed August 20, 2010, and October 29, 2010, be affirmed. Appellant has not shown any error in the district court\u2019s holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Comcast of Potomac, LLC. Comcast of Potomac is not a resident of the District of Columbia, and appellant did not allege sufficient facts to show that Comcast of Potomac performed actions in the District of Columbia sufficient to warrant the district court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over it. <em>See International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); D.C.Code \u00a7 13-423; <em>GTE New Media Services, Inc. v. BellSouth Corp., </em>199 F.3d 1343, 1347-50 (D.C.Cir.2000). Appellant has also not demonstrated that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>court abused its discretion in making an independent determination of damages and declining to award attorneys\u2019 fees when it entered default judgment against Credit Protection Association. Following an entry of default, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine what damages are appropriate, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2), and appellant appeared pro se and presented no evidence of any attorneys\u2019 fees he had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
