Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was rebutted by evidence of changed country conditions. <em>See Kumar v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 931, 934 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). We reject Zecena\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s analysis was not sufficiently individualized. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 999-1000 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cit is entirely appropriate for the BIA\u201d to use its expertise in considering country reports and deciding which portions are relevant to applicant).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">The court lacks jurisdiction to review Zecena\u2019s contention that he qualifies for humanitarian asylum because he failed to exhaust this claim before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
