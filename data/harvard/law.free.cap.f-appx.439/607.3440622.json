Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the discrimination Vasilchuk suffered in Soviet Moldova and later in Transnistria, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201ctwo occasions where [petitioner] was \u2018pushed\u2019 while attending church services interrupted by government officials does not compare to the severity of physical abuse that in other cases we have deemed persuasive to show persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Vasilchuk did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his Pentecostal religion. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he IJ and the BIA are entitled to rely on all relevant evidence in the record, including a State Department report, in considering whether the petitioner has demonstrated that there is good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d). We lack jurisdiction to review Vasilchuk\u2019s claim based on incidents related to his family\u2019s emigration to the United States because he did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Velasco-Cervantes v. Holder, </em>593 F.3d 975, 978 n. 3 (9th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Vasilchuk\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Because Vasilchuk did not establish eligibility for asylum, it necessarily follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Vasilchuk\u2019s claim for CAT relief because he failed to show it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to Transnistria. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, in part; DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
