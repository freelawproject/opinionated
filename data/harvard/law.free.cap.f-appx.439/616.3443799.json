We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-26\">Kilinyan contends her due process rights were violated because almost all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the IJ\u2019s doubts concerning credibility related to a faulty translation of the name of Kilinyan\u2019s political party.
