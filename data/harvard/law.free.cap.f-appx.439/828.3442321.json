Savage contends that the Army retaliated against her by giving her a rating of \u201c3\u201d on a five-tier scale on her 2007 annual performance evaluation and that, as a result of this rating, she received lower compensation than other employees of similar rank who were also under Butler\u2019s supervision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>We apply the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> burden-shifting analysis to Savage\u2019s retaliation claim. <em>See Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir.2010). Under this framework, if a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a presumption of retaliation arises, and \u201cthe burden of production shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the employer articulates such a reason, \u201cthe presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted and drops from the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff then \u201chas a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was merely a pretext to mask discriminatory actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1181-82 (quotation omitted). The Army conceded for purposes of summary judgment that Savage had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, and Savage does not argue that the Army failed to proffer legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its actions. Accordingly, the only issue on appeal is whether Savage has demonstrated that the Army\u2019s proffered reasons were merely a pretext for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The Army proffered the following non-retaliatory reasons for Savage\u2019s rating: (1) while Savage received top performance scores from 1996 through 2006, the Army implemented a new and more complex rating system in fiscal year 2007, under which most employees received a rating of \u201c3\u201d; (2) unlike the other employees working under Butler, Savage\u2019s duties included a supervisory objective, for which it was extremely difficult to earn a rating of higher than \u201c3\u201d; (3) Butler recommended that Savage receive a rating that would result in Savage receiving the same compensation as the other employees working under Butler, but the seven-member panel ultimately responsible for Savage\u2019s final rating downgraded Butler\u2019s recommended rating; (4) the panel members that recommended the downgrade had no knowledge of Savage\u2019s EEOC complaint;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (5) after the panel downgraded Savage\u2019s recommended rating, Butler believed that nothing further could be done to challenge the panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">On this record, we find that Savage has failed to show that these proffered reasons were merely pretextual. Savage admits that \u201c3\u201d was the expected rating score for most employees under the Army\u2019s new rating system. She does not dispute that Butler recommended a substantially similar rating for her as for the other employees under Butler\u2019s supervision, and had the panel followed Butler\u2019s recommendation, Savage would have received the same compensation as her colleagues. Indeed, Butler fully adopted Savage\u2019s own self-assessment of her performance and accomplishments when she submitted her recommended rating. While the panel ultimately gave Savage a lower rating than that recommended by Butler, Savage presented no evidence suggesting that any of the panel members who voted to downgrade her rating were aware of her EEOC complaint and, thus, they could not have acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>with a retaliatory intent. Finally, Savage presented no evidence of accomplishments that would have warranted a rating above a \u201c8\u201d under the new rating system, and she presented no information that Butler could have used to challenge the panel\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting the Army summary judgment on Savage\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">As to her Privacy Act claim, Savage argues that Butler disclosed the terms of Savage\u2019s EEOC settlement agreement to Savage\u2019s co-worker, Edna Sheridan, and that because Butler knew about the settlement information from the Army\u2019s record-keeping system, Butler\u2019s disclosure of this information constituted a violation of the Privacy Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, to establish a claim under the Privacy Act, Savage must demonstrate not only that the government\u2019s failure to fulfill its record-keeping obligations proximately caused an adverse effect on Savage, but also that she suffered actual damages. <em>Fanin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans </em>Affairs, 572 F.3d 868, 872 (11th Cir.2009). Regardless of whether Butler unlawfully disclosed the terms of Savage\u2019s settlement agreement to Sheridan, Savage presented no arguments or evidence that she suffered any adverse effects from this disclosure, much less any actual damages. Accordingly, on this record, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Army on Savage\u2019s Privacy Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\">.

In her reply brief, Savage presents additional arguments for why the Army retaliated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>against her. However, she has not raised these arguments in her initial brief, and, therefore, we will not consider them. <em>See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 972-73 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \"an argument not included in the appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed abandoned,\u201d and presenting that argument in the reply brief \"does not somehow resurrect it\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

The record reflects that one member of the panel was aware of Savage\u2019s EEOC complaint, but that member recommended that Savage be rated higher than the panel ultimately decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b853-7\">. In support of her argument that the Army\u2019s proffered reasons were mere pretext, Savage points to the fact that Butler distributed customer satisfaction surveys to her team members \u2014 the results of which would contribute to the employee\u2019s overall rating \u2014 but excluded Savage from the initial distribution, thereby leaving her with insufficient time to obtain substantive responses from her customers. However, the record reflects that when Savage received the surveys 9 days after her coworkers, she did not send them out to a single customer, nor did she request an extension of time to do so. In addition, Savage points to no facts in the record that would support a finding that she was intentionally omitted from the initial email.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b853-21\">.
