ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b773-21\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-22\">Defendant and appellant Eric Stanton Kutz pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. He was sentenced on the felon-in-possession count as an armed career criminal, pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d), and received the mandatory ACCA enhanced sentence of 180 months on that count. Mr. Kutz appeals that sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b773-24\">On March 29, 2010, Mr. Kutz engaged in a high speed car chase in Oklahoma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>City, Oklahoma, following an attempted traffic stop by police. During the chase, police officers pursuing Mr. Kutz observed a firearm and a bag containing a white substance (which turned out to be methamphetamine) being thrown from the passenger side window of the vehicle Mr. Kutz was driving. When he crashed his car into a tree, Mr. Kutz, a convicted felon, was arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession with intent to distribute the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Prior to the scheduled trial, the government filed a notice of its intention to seek an enhanced penalty for the felon-in-possession count pursuant to the ACCA, because Mr. Kutz had previously committed three violent felonies. Mr. Kutz pled guilty to both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR indicated the government\u2019s intention to seek the enhanced penalty under the ACCA. The government identified three predicate convictions which it argued were crimes of violence and, accordingly, qualified Mr. Kutz for the enhanced ACCA penalty. These three convictions were: (1) assault and battery with a dangerous weapon; (2) pointing a firearm at another; and (3) assault and battery upon a law enforcement officer. Mr. Kutz objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Mr. Kutz concedes that the first two convictions qualify as crimes of violence for ACCA purposes. Both before the district court and on appeal, however, Mr. Kutz argues that the third conviction (assault and battery upon a law enforcement officer) does not fall within the statutory definition of a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>559 F.3d 1143 (10th Cir.2009), the district court held that battery on a police officer qualifies categorically as a predicate crime of violence for ACCA purposes. It accordingly sentenced Mr. Kutz as an armed career criminal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">A \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is any crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-11\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). \u2018Whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>608 F.3d 663, 665 (10th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">The first of the two subsections in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is called the \u201cforce\u201d clause; the first part of the second subsection is called the \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause; and the second part of the second subsection is called the \u201cresidual\u201d clause. The parties agree that the question in this case is whether Mr. Kutz\u2019s conviction for assault of a police officer falls within the residual clause as a crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">In \u201cdetermining whether a prior conviction falls under the ACCA, we apply a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u2018categorical approach,\u2019 generally looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>652 F.3d 1244, 1246 (10th Cir.2011) (further quotation omitted). If, on the other hand, \u201ca criminal statute proscribes conduct broader than that which would satisfy the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony,\u201d we apply the \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, we may \u201calso look at the charging documents and documents of conviction to determine whether the defendant in a particular case was convicted of an offense that falls within the ACCA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The prior conviction at issue in this case was a conviction for the assault and battery of a law enforcement officer, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 649(B). In particular, Mr. Kutz avers that the assault involved his reaching out from between jail cell bars and \u201cgrabbing a female corrections officer by the hip in the buttock region.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5. Mr. Kutz concedes that in <em>Williams, </em>we held that a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 649(B) qualifies categorically as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender provisions of the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d). As we stated, \u201cbattery on a police officer, as defined by Oklahoma statutes, ordinarily involves purposeful, aggressive, and violent conduct, and creates a serious potential risk of physical injury. Williams\u2019 1995 conviction, therefore, categorically qualifies as a crime of violence under [USSG] \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>559 F.3d at 1149. Mr. Kutz argues that we are not bound by <em>Williams, </em>however, because it is simply \u201cwrong,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14, and it could be revisited in <em>en banc </em>review. Mr. Kutz also argues that <em>Williams </em>is distinguishable because it involved the career offender provisions of the Guidelines, whereas this case involves the statutory career offender provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">None of these arguments is persuasive. It is well established that we \u201care bound by the holdings of previous panels unless and until they are overruled by a rehearing of this Court en banc or the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>603 F.3d 1218, 1220 n. 1 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 351, 178 L.Ed.2d 228 (2010). And, it is of no moment that <em>Williams </em>involved the Guidelines and this case involves the statutory provisions, inasmuch as we construe the career offender provisions in them identically. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>576 F.3d 1060, 1068 n. 2 (10th Cir.2009) (noting that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s analysis under the ACCA \u2018applies equally to the sentencing guidelines\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Tiger, </em>538 F.3d 1297, 1298 (10th Cir.2008))).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">We are therefore bound by <em>Williams </em>to conclude that Mr. Kutz\u2019s prior conviction for assault on a law enforcement officer qualifies as a violent felony for ACCA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentencing determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. While the plea agreement contained a waiver of the right to appeal, the government told the district court at the sentencing hearing that it would suspend the waiver to allow Mr. Kutz to appeal the court's ruling on whether the ACCA penalty applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">. Our court has also recently held that a violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 650.2(B) (involving assault and battery by a person in the custody of Juvenile Affairs on an employee of that office), a statute nearly identical to Okla. Stat. tit. 21. \u00a7 649(B), constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>652 F.3d 1244 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
