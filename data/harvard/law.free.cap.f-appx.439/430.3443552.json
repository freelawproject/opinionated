Fofana now appeals, claiming that the district court (1) issued a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum and (2) violated his due process rights by sentencing him more harshly based on his alien status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we vacate his supervised-release sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-24\">Illegal alien Sekou Fofana pleaded guilty to participating in a \u201cblack money\u201d scheme in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court sentenced him to six months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">At the conclusion of Fofana\u2019s prison term, authorities released him into the custody of Immigration and Customs En<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>forcement (ICE). Pending a deportation hearing, ICE released Fofana on bond; he was supposed to report to probation within seventy-two hours to begin his supervised release. He did not report until a year later \u2014 after probation issued a follow-up notice \u2014 and then received instructions regarding the conditions of his supervised release. Fofana then failed to call the probation office to learn which officer it had assigned to him. Efforts to reach Fofana proved futile. Fofana\u2019s officer could not reach him via telephone and, upon investigating his purported residence, discovered an unopened letter she had sent him. A woman at the residence denied that Fofana lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">During his release, authorities arrested Fofana in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \u2014 outside the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which he was not supposed to leave without permission \u2014 for engaging in a fraudulent scheme similar to that which led to his initial conviction. Following Fofana\u2019s arrest, he contacted his probation office in Pennsylvania; the office \u201cdenied his case\u201d and refused to supervise him.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The probation office filed a petition claiming that Fofana violated the terms of his supervised release by failing to (1) surrender to probation following his release by ICE; (2) follow his probation officer\u2019s instructions; (3) obtain permission before leaving the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; and (4) notify his probation officer within seventy-two hours of his arrest. Probation later amended its petition to add an allegation that Fofana also violated his supervised-release terms by engaging in the additional fraudulent scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">At his revocation hearing, Fofana refused to concede the factual allegations relating to his Harrisburg conduct. The government agreed to proceed based only on the other four alleged violations of his supervised release, which resulted in a guidelines range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. The government recommended a twenty-four-month sentence. The district court sentenced Fofana to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment and thirty-six months\u2019 supervised release. Fofana now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Fofana first contends \u2014 and the government agrees \u2014 that, in imposing a sentence of thirty months\u2019 incarceration followed by thirty-six months\u2019 supervised release, the district court erred by imposing a sentence greater than that authorized by statute. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">[w]hen a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release <em>shall not exceed </em>the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">(emphasis added). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514 \u2014 a class B felony and \u201cthe offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release\u201d \u2014 permits a maximum term of supervised release of sixty months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b). By sentencing Fofana to a total of sixty-six months\u2019 imprisonment and supervised release, the district court unlawfully surpassed this limitation, necessitating remand. <em>See Brown, </em>639 F.3d 735, 736-37 (vacating defendant\u2019s supervised-release sentence where district court failed to heed limitation on length of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>supervised release imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Fofana next claims that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by sentencing him more harshly based on his alien status. We ordinarily review constitutional challenges to a sentence de novo, <em>United States v. Graham, </em>622 F.3d 445, 452 (6th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 251 (2011), unless the defendant did not register his objection before the district court, in which case plain-error review applies, <em>see United States v. Hall, </em>411 F.3d 651, 653 (6th Cir.2005). Here, Fofana failed to object at his sentencing hearing. The district court failed, however, to provide Fofana with an opportunity to lodge specific objections after announcing the sentence but before adjourning the sentencing hearing, as required by <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865, 872-73 (6th Cir.2004). Although not conclusively determined by this circuit, cases since <em>Bostic </em>suggest that this requirement is applicable only to objections regarding error in the sentencing procedure. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Freeman, </em>640 F.3d 180, 185-86 (6th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 385 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc). If, in fact, <em>Bostic </em>does not apply to constitutional claims, Fofana\u2019s failure to object would result in plain error-review of Fofana\u2019s claim, regardless of the court\u2019s own failure to comply with the <em>Bostic </em>requirement. On the other hand, if <em>Bostic </em>does apply to constitutional claims, we would review Fofana\u2019s claim de novo. Because Fofana\u2019s claim fails under either standard of review, we decline to decide here which applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Summoning precedent from other circuits, Fofana posits that increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence based on his alien status violates his due process rights. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Cardenas, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 579, 583 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201cSentencing a defendant more harshly because of his alien status violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>797 F.2d 417, 419 (7th Cir.1986) (noting that treating defendants more harshly based on their nationality or alien status \u201cobviously would be unconstitutional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">We need not determine whether to adopt this stance in our circuit because the transcript lacks evidence that the district court increased Fofana\u2019s sentence based on his alien status. The court granted an upward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors of retribution, general deterrence, and incapacitation. With respect to incapacitation, which the court described as the \u201cmain\u201d factor, the court noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">if Mr. Fofana is not in custody, ... he\u2019s going to be involved in criminal activities. The Court is unable to rely upon the Immigration Service in keeping the defendant in custody. So the Court is going to go outside of the guideline range to impose a higher sentence. And the Court would encourage the Immigration Service, during this time period, to initiate deportation proceedings while he\u2019s still in federal custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The court focused on averting additional criminal conduct by incapacitating Fofana. Recognizing that Immigration Services may not keep Fofana in custody does not suggest that Fofana received a harsher sentence than he would have were he a legal resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Fofana grasps at other instances where the court mentioned his alien status, but these too fail him. In some instances, the court did no more than acknowledge Fofana\u2019s alien status and its surprise that Fofana had not already been deported. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Gomez, </em>797 F.2d at 419 (\u201c[T]he sentencing judge [need not] shut his eyes to the reality of the factual situation before him and pretend that the defendant is not an illegal alien.... \u201d). In other instances, the court alluded to its previous imposition of a lenient sentence because it believed Fofana would be deported. <em>See United States v. Jabi, </em>416 Fed.Appx. 512, 516 (6th Cir.2011) (\u201c[T]he fact that [the defendant] will be deported after serving his sentence could counsel toward a shorter sentence.... \u201d). Finally, the court noted its willingness to terminate Fofana\u2019s incarceration early if immigration initiated deportation. <em>See United States v. Molina, </em>563 F.3d 676, 679 n. 3 (8th Cir.2009) (noting that court could consider the effects of defendant\u2019s eventual deportation in connection with the statutory sentencing factors). In none of these instances does the court suggest that it sentenced Fofana more harshly due to his alien status.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">For the above reasons, we vacate Fofana\u2019s supervised-release sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\">. In his brief, Fofana additionally claimed that the district court issued a substantively unreasonable sentence. But because his incarceration ended prior to oral argument, Fofana has conceded that this argument is moot. See <em>United States v. Brown, </em>639 F.3d 735, 736 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-26\">.
