After Shanyfelt filed his complaint in a Georgia court, Wachovia removed the action to the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Shanyfelt\u2019s complaint after he failed to comply with an order to provide a more definite statement of his claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e). Shanyfelt argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court should have <em>sua sponte </em>remanded the complaint to state court because Shanyfelt and McCalla Raymer are both citizens of Georgia. Shanyfelt also argues, for the first time, that the defendants committed fraud by submitting fraudulent documents to the district court and to the state courts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-23\">Wachovia, Wells Fargo, Mortgage Registration, and McCalla argue that Shanyfelt waived \u201call of [his] arguments\u201d by failing to present them to the district court, but we disagree in part. Although we will not consider \u201c \u2018arguments not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal,\u2019 \u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994)), \u201c[a] litigant generally may raise a court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance,\u201d <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 455, 124 S.Ct. 906, 915, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004). We decline to consider Shanyfelt\u2019s arguments about fraud, but we address his argument about subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-24\">The district court had subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain Shanyfelt\u2019s complaint based on diversity of citizenship. A district court has diversity jurisdiction when the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Although Shanyfelt argues that both he and McCalla Raymer are citizens of Georgia, Shanyfelt never served McCalla Raymer with a summons and complaint while the action was pending in the district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) (requiring service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>within 120 after complaint is filed). Wachovia mentioned that failure to serve McCalla Raymer in its notice of removal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b) (allowing removal based on \u201cparties in interest [who are] properly joined and served\u201d). The district court was entitled to entertain Shanyfelt\u2019s complaint without regard to the citizenship of McCalla Raymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The dismissal of Shanyfelt\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
