Jones argues that: (1) his above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable because his violations of the terms of his supervised release were only technical violations; and (2) an upward variance from the sentence suggested under the Guidelines was not warranted because none of the Chapter Seven policy statements for justifying an upward variance are applicable to his case. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter 7 recommended guideline range for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sen-fence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In explaining the sentence, the district court need not specifically discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, if it is clear from the record that the district court properly considered all the factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The justification for a variance from the guideline range must be \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186-87 (quotation omitted). We \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, a district court does not abuse its discretion when it merely attaches \u201cgreat weight\u201d to a single, permissible factor or set of factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 56-59, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201cChapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs violations of [supervised release] and contains policy statements, one of which provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4). We have consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. <em>Id. </em>However, the district court is required to consider the statements, and when exceeding them, \u201cmust normally indicate that it considered [them].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence that represented an upward variance from the sentence suggested under the Guidelines. The district court concluded that Jones\u2019s history of violating the terms of his supervised release necessitated the imposition of a sentence above the range recommended under the Guidelines. The court\u2019s determination was fully justified in light of the frequency and immediacy of Jones\u2019s violations following his release. The upward variance was also justified by the fact that Jones\u2019s supervised release had been revoked previously for use of a controlled substance and failure to report, and Jones had again engaged in the same conduct. Moreover, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that the recommended sentence was insufficient to comply with the statutory purposes. This finding was not error and Jones has presented no argument adequate to suggest that it was. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
