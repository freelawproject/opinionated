On appeal, Samaniego contends that he was entitled to a decrease in offense level based on his minor role in the offense. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We write principally for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Ortega Drug Trafficking Organization (\u201cOrtega DTO\u201d) is a criminal organization based in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Since at least 2002, the Ortega DTO has been involved in the distribution and trafficking of methamphetamine and cocaine, bringing drugs from Mexico and California to be sold in Pennsylvania. In September 2006, investigators intercepted a delivery and arrested several members of the conspiracy, including Samaniego. Samaniego, who is a commercial truck driver by trade, transported a large shipment of drugs hidden inside a pre-packed tractor-trailer wheel from California to Pennsylvania. He was paid $800.00 for his participation in the conspiracy. Investigators recovered 31 kilograms of cocaine and 22 pounds of methamphetamine from the tractor-trailer wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In the fifty-count, multi-defendant indictment, Samaniego was charged with six counts: one count of conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine and 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1); one count of distribution of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine and aiding and abetting, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; one count of distribution of 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and aiding and abetting, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and three counts of unlawful use of a communication facility in the commission or facilitation of a felony drug offence, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">In 2007, Samaniego pled guilty to these six charges. Samaniego subsequently attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, but the motion was denied. In June 2010, the District Court conducted a sentencing hearing. After addressing objections to the Presentence Report, the District Court assigned Samaniego a base offense level of 38, with a criminal history category of III. It refused to grant Samaniego an offense-level reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines, finding that he had not shown himself to be a minor participant in the 2006 trafficking conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, after reviewing the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors of record, the District Court elected to give Samaniego a downward variance of 52 months, imposing a below-Guidelines sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the first three counts and 48 months\u2019 for each of the final three counts, all to run concurrently. Samaniego timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>We \u201cmust sustain the District Court\u2019s factual findings as to a \u00a7 3B1.2 minimal or minor role adjustment unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 351 (3d Cir.2002). Because the District Court\u2019s determination is \u201cheavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case,\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n.3(C), \u201cdistrict courts are allowed broad discretion in applying this section.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that his role in the offense makes him \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.3(A); <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 240. We will reverse only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Samaniego asserts that his limited role as a courier for the drugs, or \u201ca mere mule,\u201d entitled him to a minor role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2. Section 3B1.2 provides for a four-level decrease in offense level if a defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in an offense, a two-level decrease if he was a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and a three-level decrease if he falls between. A defendant is a \u201cminimal participant\u201d if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4. A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">A defendant\u2019s eligibility for an offense level reduction turns on several factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise; (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants; and (3) the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001). Samaniego argues that he is entitled to a decrease in offense level because his guilt was based on one act of drug distribution with little knowledge of the transaction\u2019s details. However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s participation in a drug operation was limited to that of courier is not alone indicative of a minor or minimal role.\u201d <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991). After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the District Court did not commit clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">At a minimum, Samaniego knew that the Ortega DTO was involved in selling and distributing drugs and that his job was to transport a drug shipment from California. Moreover, Samaniego\u2019s role in transporting the drugs to Pennsylvania was crucial to the success of the conspiracy. The importance of his role is highlighted by the sheer quantity and value of drugs he was delivering and the distance he had to travel in order to deliver them. Furthermore, given his confessed awareness that the tractor-trailer wheel he was transporting contained drugs, the claim that Samaniego never actually examined the tire does not diminish his culpability. Based on these facts, the District Court did not clearly err in concluding Samaniego was a \u201ckey participant\u201d in the conspiracy and did not deserve a decrease in his offense level based on a minor or minimal role.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (App. at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. We note that Samaniego\u2019s true name is Reymundo Garcia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\">. The District Court also declined to grant an offense-level reduction based on acceptance of responsibility because Samaniego had previously attempted to withdraw his guilty plea. (App. at 260.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. Samaniego also appears to argue that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the District Court did not grant the \u00a7 3B1.2 offense-level reduction. Generally, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard and review a sentence for reasonableness, which requires that the sentence be both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>ed States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217-18 (3d Cir.2008). Because we conclude that the District Court did not commit clear error in denying the offense-level reduction, we also conclude that the sentence was procedurally sound.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
