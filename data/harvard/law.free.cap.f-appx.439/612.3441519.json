We have jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In light of our contemporaneously filed opinion in the Mastros\u2019 related appeal, <em>Momot v. Mastro, </em>No. 10-15276, we vacate and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">At the time the district court issued its order denying the Mastros\u2019 motion to compel arbitration under section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4, its decision was correct. To have ruled otherwise would have required the court to address the arbitrability of Momot\u2019s claims, the same issue that was then pending before the Nevada district court. <em>See Pacesetter Sys., Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>678 F.2d 93, 94-95 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In light of our holding in the related appeal that the parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability, however, the FAA mandates that the district court grant the motion to compel arbitration. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 218, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985) (stating that FAA section 4 \u201cleaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts <em>shall </em>direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED with instructions to grant Appellants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b634-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
