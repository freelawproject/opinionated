Lamb, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ming Zhao Jiang, </em>No. A094 041 765 (B.I.A. June 7, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A094 041 765 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 17, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Jiang\u2019s asylum claim was based primarily on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. We have specifically held that a woman\u2019s forced abortion under the Chinese family planning policy does not qualify as <em>per se </em>persecution with respect to her spouse. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007). Accordingly, the agency did not err in finding that Lin was not eligible for relief on this basis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">While a spouse\u2019s forced abortion is not <em>per se </em>persecution, applicants may base their claims on \u201cpersecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer\u201d on account of their \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive family planning policy. <em>See id.; see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Jiang ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>gues that he resisted the family planning policy by \u201cassisting\u201d in the removal of his wife\u2019s intra-uterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d). The BIA has held that a female asylum applicant\u2019s removal of an IUD may constitute other resistance to the Chinese family planning policy. <em>See Matter of M-F-W-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 638, 638 (B.I.A.2008), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 64 (2d Cir.2011). Here, however, it is unclear whether the removal of Jiang\u2019s wife\u2019s IUD can be deemed \u201cother resistance\u201d on his part. Through counsel, Jiang argued before the IJ that he resisted the family planning policy because he \u201cdecided,\u201d with his wife, to have the IUD removed. Jiang did not testify to any action he took to assist in the removal of the IUD. Instead, he testified that he personally never encountered the family planning officials or discussed the family planning policy with them. Accordingly, on this record, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Jiang did not demonstrate that he engaged in \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy. <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Moreover, even if Jiang\u2019s assistance in the removal of his wife\u2019s IUD might be characterized as \u201cother resistance,\u201d he was also required to show that he suffered persecution in the past or had a fear of future persecution on account of that resistance. See <em>id. </em>However, the BIA did not err in concluding that Jiang\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable, given that he testified that he was not harmed in the past and did not show or allege that he was sought by Chinese officials due to his alleged resistance. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 399 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008). Accordingly, the agency did not err in denying Jiang asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, as all three claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (withholding of removal); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
