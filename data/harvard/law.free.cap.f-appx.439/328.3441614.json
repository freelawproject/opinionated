Man-ton, Jr. (\u201cMant\u00f3n\u201d) and Sherrie Buras Mant\u00f3n (collectively \u201cMantons\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Defendants-Appellees St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Rodney Jack Strain, Jr. (\u201cStrain\u201d), St. Tammany Parish Sergeant Brian O\u2019Cull (\u201cO\u2019Cull\u201d), and St. Tammany Parish (collectively \u201cParish\u201d). The district court dismissed the Mantons\u2019 claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluding that the Mantons had failed to raise an issue of material fact. We AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">This case arises from the circumstances surrounding Manton\u2019s arrest. After an interview with a suspect in a bank fraud, a Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office detective learned that Mant\u00f3n was also involved in the fraud. After several additional interviews, the detective informed St. Tammany officer O\u2019Cull about Manton\u2019s involvement in the scheme. O\u2019Cull obtained a search warrant for Manton\u2019s home and an arrest warrant for Mant\u00f3n. On January 24, 2008, Police searched Manton\u2019s residence and found a shotgun, which violated the terms of his state probation. The next day, St. Tammany police arrested Mant\u00f3n for bank fraud and a probation violation. Police held Mant\u00f3n for four months and released him when the State dropped the bank fraud charges. The Mantons then sued the Parish under \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Parish had violated Manton\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights with an unlawful search and seizure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, taking the facts in a light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>QBE Ins. Corp. v. Brown &amp; Mitchell, Inc., </em>591 F.3d 439, 442 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">The Mantons allege that the Parish violated Manton\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when the Parish searched Manton\u2019s home and arrested Mant\u00f3n because the Parish lacked probable cause for valid warrants. \u201cA police officer seeking the issuance of a ... warrant must present an affidavit containing facts sufficient to \u2018provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kohler v. Englade, </em>470 F.3d 1104, 1109 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). In submitting an affidavit for a warrant, an officer may rely upon \u201cinformation provided by other officers.\u201d <em>Bennett v. City of Grand Prairie, Tex., </em>883 F.2d 400, 407 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The Mantons offer three arguments in support of their claims. First, the Man-tons argue that police did not have probable cause because the affidavits used to obtain the warrants were based upon false information. The Mantons, however, have failed to demonstrate that the affidavits contained false information. Second, the Mantons argue that O\u2019Cull lacked probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>cause because he did not have personal knowledge of the investigation\u2019s facts. This argument is without merit: When preparing a warrant affidavit, an officer may rely upon information from other officers. <em>Bennett, </em>883 F.2d at 407. Third, the Mantons assert that the arrest of Man-ton was illegal because a Jefferson Parish detective told O\u2019Cull not to arrest Manton. But, even if this was true, the Mantons fail to cite any authority that indicates this is a constitutional violation. Therefore, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">. The Mantons have waived any appeal to the district court's summary judgment order regarding their \u00a7\u00a7 1985, 1986, and 1988 and Eighth Amendment claims. Under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)-(B), failure to raise a point of error in a brief will waive that issue on appeal. <em>See also Alameda Films v. Authors Rights Restoration, </em>331 F.3d 472, 483 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Martinez-Mercado, </em>888 F.2d 1484, 1492 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-14\">. In their brief, the Mantons also allege a violation of Manton\u2019s Second Amendment rights. We will not consider this argument, however, because the Mantons offer this claim for the first time on appeal. <em>See Vogel v. Veneman, </em>276 F.3d 729, 733 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
