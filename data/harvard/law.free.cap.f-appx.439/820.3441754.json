That sentence was the product of a downward variance from the applicable guidelines range of 151 to 188 months imprisonment. On appeal, Ortiz argues that he should have been sentenced instead to the statutory minimum sentence of 60 months imprisonment. Ortiz argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because, in calculating his advisory guidelines range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, the district court applied a Sentencing Guideline that (i) was not supported by empirical data and (ii) produced a guidelines range that violated the purposes of sentencing in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">We generally review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">We examine whether a sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. And we will vacate a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">Ortiz\u2019s argument that his 96-month sentence is substantively unreasonable lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>merit. The court considered the arguments of each party at the sentence hearing, weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and determined that a downward variance of 96 months was appropriate. That sentence, moreover, was well below Ortiz\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months. Based on the record before us, we cannot discern an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
