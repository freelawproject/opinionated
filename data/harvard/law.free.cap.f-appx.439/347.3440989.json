Plaintiffs affidavit and affidavits from his fellow employees state that he worked in the Gulf of Mexico on vessel rigs at times and platform rigs at other times. They assert with particularity that he worked on named jack-up rigs during his first period of employment (1994-2002), but do not specify that he worked on these vessel rigs from 2005 until 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Nabors filed affidavits supported by Abram\u2019s personnel records asserting that Abram did no work on vessels from 2005 until 2009. This is the relevant time period. <em>See Patton-Tully Transp. Co. v. Ratliff, </em>797 F.2d 206 (5th Cir.1986) (a four-month hiatus in employment was a significant enough break to require a separate evaluation of duties during the re-employment period to determine seaman status at the time of the accident). Abram\u2019s summary judgment evidence did not dispute this evidence with respect to the relevant time period so as to create an issue of fact. The district court correctly granted summary judgment and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
