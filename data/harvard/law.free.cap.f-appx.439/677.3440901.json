HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">Plaintiff-appellant Dustin J. Merryfield is confined at Larned State Hospital in Larned, Kansas, under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 52-29a01, <em>et seq., </em>as a patient in the Kansas Sexual Predator Treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He brought a pro se civil rights class action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas against the Disability Rights Center of Kansas (DRC) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The DRC is a private, non-profit corporation organized in the state of Kansas that receives and uses federal funds to, among other things, advocate for the rights of disabled Kansans.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Mr. Merryfield sought to have the DRC represent him in bringing complaints against Larned State Hospital. The DRC declined his requests on a number of grounds. Mr. Merryfield\u2019s federal suit asserts that the DRC\u2019s refusal of representation violated his rights, and the rights of others similarly situated, in a number of ways. He also asserted that HHS failed to ensure that the DRC properly used the federal funds it received. Further factual details are not necessary as all of Mr. Merryfield\u2019s claims rested on his assertion that the district court had jurisdiction over his complaint against the DRC under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), because the DRC is a federal agency. His sole point on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that it did not have jurisdiction because the DRC was not a federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">For the purposes of the APA, the term \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency,\u201d subject to a few exceptions not applicable here. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b). The DRC receives federal funds under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAI-MI). Mr. Merryfield\u2019s assertion is that this receipt of federal funds makes the DRC a federal agency. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Supreme Court has recently explained that the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act) offered States federal money to, among other things, improve medical care for persons with developmental disabilities. <em>See Va. Office for Prot. &amp; Advocacy v. Stewart, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 1635-36, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011). It required a state, as a condition of receiving that money, to \u201cestablish a protection and advocacy (P &amp; A) system.\u201d Id. at 1636. The court noted that the PAIMI Act increased that funding and \u201cextends the mission of P &amp; A systems to include the mentally ill.\u201d Id. Under the DD Act and the PAIMI Act, the P &amp; A systems are required to have certain powers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Further \u201c[a] participating State is free to appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P <em>&amp; </em>A system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the purposes of the PAIMI Act is \u201cto assist States to establish and operate a protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10801. An \u201celigible system\u201d is a \u201csystem established in a State to protect and advocate the rights of persons with developmental disabilities under subtitle C of the [DD Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10802(2). The \u201celigible system\u201d then receives allotments from the federal government to establish and administer systems to assist the mentally ill. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10808. The \u201celigible system may use its allotment ... to enter into contracts with State agencies and nonprofit organizations which operate throughout the State.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10804(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Thus, it is clear that the purpose of the federal statute is not to set up federal agencies in each of the states, but to assist the States in setting up their own systems. The systems in those states may then provide the services anticipated by the PAIMI Act through either state agencies or nonprofit organizations. If Kansas had chosen to provide these services through a state agency, that agency would not be considered a federal agency. <em>See, e.g., Hunter v. Underwood, </em>362 F.3d 468, 477 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe APA does not grant federal courts jurisdiction to review actions of state or municipal agencies.\u201d); <em>Sw. Williamson Cnty. Cmty. Ass\u2019n v. Slater, </em>173 F.3d 1033, 1035 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cBy its own terms, the APA does not apply to state agencies.\u201d). Here, Kansas has designated not one of its own agencies as its P &amp; A system, but the DRC, a nonprofit entity. Thus, the removal from the federal government is even greater. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the DRC is not a federal agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\">. The SVPA, K.S.A. 59-29a01 <em>et seq., </em>was enacted for the \"potentially long-term control, care and treatment of sexually violent predators,\u201d as well as for the protection of the public. K.S.A. 59-29a01; <em>see </em>K.S.A.2008 Supp. 59-29a07(a). Once it has been determined that a person is a sexually violent predator, he or she shall be committed to the custody of [the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services] for control, care, and treatment \"until such time as the person\u2019s mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large.\u201d K.S.A.2008 Supp. 59-29a07(a). Because the SVPA narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who find it difficult, if not impossible, to control their dangerousness, the SVPA was found to be facially constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>[Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 356-60, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997)].</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\"><em>Johnson v.

The system \"shall ... have the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect ... if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\u201d [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(B); \u00a7 10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statutory requirements, it must be given access to \"all records\u201d of individuals who may have been abused, <em>see </em>\u00a7 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); \u00a7 10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>as well as \"other records that are relevant to conducting an investigation,\u201d \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a P &amp; A system have authority to \"pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of\u201d its charges. \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(A)(i); <em>see </em>\u00a7 10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own rights, a P &amp; A system may \u201cpursue administrative, legal, and other remedies on behalf of\u201d those it protects. \u00a7 10805(a)(1)(C); <em>see </em>\u00a7 15044(b). <em>Va.

We note that Mr. Merry field briefly argues that the terms \"federal instrumentality\u201d and \u201cfederal agency\u201d are interchangeable and that, therefore, the DRC is a federal agency. He does not elaborate on this assertion in his brief to this court, but we note that he argued to the district court that \"[t]he [DRC] in 2009 showed they were a federal instrumentality in a case before the United States District Court, for the District of Kansas, when they filed an action under the Administrative Procedures Act, against the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d Aplt.App. at 70. Mr. Merryfield provides no legal authority to support the novel proposition that simply filing a lawsuit under the APA makes a plaintiff a federal instrumentality or agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
