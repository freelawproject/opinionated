On appeal, Diaz-Maldonado argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction that was not pled in the indictment, admitted by him, nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Diaz-Maldonado concedes that this argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), as well as this Court\u2019s decisions that have recognized that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent until overruled by the Supreme Court. He states that he is simply seeking to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review because a majority of the justices on the Court have indicated that the prior conviction exception is no longer valid, and because the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), supports <em>overruling Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">We have explicitly rejected the argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is no longer good law and continue in that rejection. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that we have \u201cspecifically rejected the argument that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was undermined by the <em>Apprendi </em>decision\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Diaz-Maldonado next argues that the district court committed procedural error by incorrectly calculating his criminal history score. He asserts that he should not have received 3 criminal history points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>for a 1990 conviction for selling cocaine and heroin because it was imposed more than 15 years before his current offense commenced, and should therefore have been excluded under the criminal history rules. Similarly, he asserts he should not been assessed one criminal history point for his 1996 conviction because it occurred more than ten years prior to the commencement of his current offense. Diaz-Maldonado further argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to make any reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and by failing to explain the reasons for his sentence, including a statement that the sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to satisfy the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, when a defendant raises sentencing arguments for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Here, it is unclear whether Diaz-Maldonado\u2019s objection to the length of his sentence adequately preserved his objection to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. However, we need not resolve which standard of review applies because his arguments fail under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we will first ensure \u201cthat the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court need not explicitly articulate that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and need not discuss each factor so long as the record indicates that the court considered the factors in some form. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007). Rather, in explaining a sentence, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Section 3553(a) provides that a sentencing court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes [of sentencing].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant should be assessed three criminal history points \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Such a sentence must have been imposed \u201cwithin fifteen years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense\u201d to be counted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). Similarly, the probation officer is to add one criminal history point for other prior sentences not otherwise covered. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c). However, such a sentence must be \u201cimposed within ten years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \u201cAny prior sentence not within the time periods specified is not counted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">We have determined that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, \u201cthe crime of being \u2018found in\u2019 the United States commences when the alien enters the United States and is not completed until the defendant\u2019s arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>447 F.3d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Thus, the date on which an alien is \u201cfound in\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>United States is the date the offense was completed. <em>See id. </em>(stating that the crime of illegal reentry is completed when a defendant was found in the United States). Conversely, the offense conduct begins \u201cwhen the alien illegally enters the United States\u201d and therefore, \u201ccan run over a long period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In this case, the district court did not procedurally err by assessing Diaz-Maldonado four total criminal history points for his 1990 and 1996 convictions. It is undisputed that Diaz-Maldonado re-entered the United States in October 2004 after being deported. He was then \u201cfound in\u201d the United States on February 22, 2008, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement was notified of his presence in the United States. <em>See Scott, </em>447 F.3d at 1368. Accordingly, his \u00a7 1326 offense commenced in October 2004 and ended in February 2008. <em>See Scott, </em>447 F.3d at 1368. Therefore, the district court properly assessed Diaz-Maldonado 3 criminal history points because his 1990 sentence was imposed within 15 years of the beginning of his instant \u00a7 1326 offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Similarly, the court properly assessed him one criminal history point for his 1996 sentence because it occurred within ten years of the beginning of his instant \u00a7 1326 offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The district court also did not procedurally err by failing to explicitly state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or by omitting a statement that Diaz-Maldonado\u2019s sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the goals of sentencing. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 944. The record indicates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the court (1) questioned the government about its authority to impose a sentence under \u00a7 3553 rather than a guidelines sentence, (2) determined that the sentencing calculations in the PSI were correct, and (3) determined that the Guidelines were properly applied, and because (4) Diaz-Maldonado referenced his history and characteristics and the circumstances of his crime in arguing for a sentence at the low-end of the guidelines range. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 944 (concluding that, despite failing to cite \u00a7 3553(a), the district court evaluated the statutory factors because it considered appellant\u2019s objections, his motion for a downward departure, and the PSI, all of which implicated several of the factors); (R4 at 6-7,19-20). Thus, the record set forth enough to demonstrate that the sentencing judge \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Finally, neither we nor the Supreme Court have mandated that district courts follow a precise script when imposing a particular sentence. The district court was not required to \u201cincant the specific language\u201d of \u00a7 3553(a) to specify that Diaz-Maldonado\u2019s sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the goals of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that, when imposing a sentence, the district court need not \u201cincant the specific language used in the guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Accordingly, after review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly considered Diaz-Maldonado\u2019s prior convictions when imposing his sentence and did not otherwise commit procedural error. We therefore affirm his 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-15\">.
