We find no abuse of discretion in these rulings, and therefore affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In the negligence action below, Revella claimed that defendant-appellee Kohl\u2019s Department Stores, Inc. (\u201cKohl\u2019s\u201d) falsely reported to the United Store Mutual Association (\u201cUSMA\u201d) database \u2014 which is used by major retailers to conduct background checks of prospective employees \u2014 that she had been terminated from employment with Kohl\u2019s for theft. She claimed that, as a result of Kohl\u2019s negligence, she was unable to secure employment for a four-month period in 2004, until she was hired by Marshalls, a retail outlet that did not use the USMA database. After leaving Marshalls, she took a job a Linens \u2018n Things in February 2006, but was terminated just a week after being hired, when Linens \u2018n Things discovered the false report on the USMA database. Thereafter, she was unable to secure employment in retail for another three months, before concluding in May 2006 that she was unemployable and therefore deciding to enroll in community college to embark on a different career. Revella sought damages for lost income for the four-month period in 2004 and an undefined period following her termination by Linens \u2018n Things in 2006, in addition to damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Prior to trial, Kohl\u2019s stipulated to its negligence in making the false report, but maintained that its negligence did not proximately cause Revella\u2019s claimed damages. Kohl\u2019s also moved, <em>in limine, </em>for a ruling precluding Revella\u2019s proffered expert testimony on economic damages, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the proffered testimony was unduly speculative. Additionally, Kohl\u2019s moved, <em>in limine, </em>to preclude Revella from seeking any damages whatsoever on the theory that the report did not proximately cause her claimed damages. After a hearing, the District Court ruled that Revella would be permitted only to prove damages from the time that she was terminated from Linens \u2018n Things, in February 2006, to the time that she enrolled in community college, in May 2006. It concluded that evidence of Revella\u2019s lost income in the four-month period in 2004 was too speculative for \u201cnumerous reasons,\u201d including that there was no firm evidence that the false report had even been filed at that time. With respect to prospective lost income post-dating her enrollment in community college and tuition expenses related thereto, the District Court concluded that \u201cthere is insufficient basis to say that she could never get a job in retail and had to go to school to be a psychologist.\u201d Because Revella\u2019s expert had only calculated her prospective lost income, the District Court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling effectively precluded Revella\u2019s expert testimony on lost income entirely. Later, after the close of evidence, the District Court ruled that the jury could not consider evidence of lost income relating to the period between her termination from Linens \u2018n Things and her enrollment in community college, because Revella had relied only on her own uncorroborated recollection of her income at Linens \u2018n Things to prove these damages. The District Court therefore instructed the jury not to consider lost-income damages, and the jury subsequently found in favor of Revella, but awarded her only damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We review a district court\u2019s \u201cdecision to admit or exclude evidence ... for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Henry v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., </em>616 F.3d 134, 149 (2d Cir.2010); <em>cf. Sims v. Blot, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cA district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or rendered a decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(alteration, citations, and quotation marks omitted)). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We find no error in the <em>in limine </em>rulings from which Revella appeals. Revella sought to prove damages for the four-month period of unemployment during 2004 through circumstantial evidence that Marshalls, the only retail outlet to hire her after she left Kohl\u2019s, did not use the USMA database. The District Court was well within his discretion in finding that such circumstantial evidence provided an unduly speculative basis for Revella\u2019s expert to opine on lost income, especially given the lack of any evidence to show that Kohl\u2019s had actually made the false report to the USMA database prior to that time, or that any of the stores that declined to hire her did so after consulting the database. With respect to prospective lost income post-dating her enrollment in community college, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that it is entirely speculative to assume that she would never have gotten another job in retail, especially given the fact that the false report had, by then, been removed from the USMA database and both Kohl\u2019s and the USMA had provided Revella with letters explaining the error. It was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to preclude Revella from testifying, based on her own experience, that she was unemployable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We have reviewed all of Revella\u2019s arguments on appeal and we conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
