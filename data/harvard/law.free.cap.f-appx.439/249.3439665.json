We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-26\">Winston entered the United States on a K-3 nonimmigrant visa on March 14, 2010. On May 10, 2010, he pled guilty to assault and battery under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-57.2, following an altercation with his wife in which he grabbed her, attempted to choke her, and punched a wall. On the same day, he pled guilty to violation of a protective order under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.1-253.2 for sending his wife a letter from prison in which he told her that he loved her and asked her to drop the protective order and post bond for him. In removal proceedings, the immigration judge and the Board found that the Government properly met its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that Winston was removable as charged. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(3)(A) (2006). Winston did not seek relief from removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>We have reviewed the record and find that Winston\u2019s conviction for assault and battery against a family member was a crime of domestic violence. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae, an alien who commits a crime of domestic violence is deportable. A \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is any crime of violence, as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, committed against a specified group of persons, including a current spouse. A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 16(a) as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Winston\u2019s conviction for assault and battery against his wife under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-57.2 is not categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because Virginia\u2019s common law conception of battery includes any offensive touching, not only the use of physical force. <em>United States v. White, </em>606 F.3d 144, 153-55 (4th Cir.2010). However, where the elements of a crime are ambiguous, this Court uses a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d and examines the charging documents to determine whether the crime was violent. <em>United States v. Kirksey, </em>138 F.3d 120, 124 (4th Cir.1998). In this case, the immigration judge examined the charging documents and found that Winston pled guilty to grabbing his wife during an argument, attempting to choke her, and punching a wall. This meets the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and thus Winston\u2019s guilty plea renders him deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The Board of Immigration Appeals further found Winston deportable on an alternative ground, namely for violating \u201cthe portion of a protection order that involves protection against credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury to the person or persons for whom the protection order was issued\u00ae\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii). Winston argues that his sending his wife a letter from jail in which he told her that he loved her and asked her to drop the protective order and post bond for him did not constitute either a threat of violence, repeated harassment or bodily injury. The Government responds that even if Winston\u2019s actions did not rise to that level, the no-contact portion of the protective order \u201cinvolves protection against\u201d violence and harassment, and \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii) does not require that the violation actually constitute violence or harassment. <em>See Alanis-Alvarado v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 833, 839-40 (9th Cir.2009). This Circuit has not decided this issue, and does not do so here, because Winston\u2019s conviction for assault and battery against his wife is sufficient to find him deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Appellant also argues in his brief that his court-appointed attorney did not advise him of possible immigration consequences to his pleading guilty to the charges of assault and battery and violation of the protective order. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel includes the right to be informed of potential immigration consequences to a guilty plea. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1486, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). However, if Appellant wishes to make a case based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he must file for post-conviction relief in his state criminal case. <em>Ugwu v. Gonzales, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 917, 918 (4th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Abiodun v. Gonzales, </em>461 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir.2006); <em>Olivera-Garcia v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Trench v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 181, 184 (10th Cir.1986); <em>Zinnanti v. INS, </em>651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir.1981)). \u201c[T]he immigration judge and the Board cannot go behind the criminal judgment and consider an alien\u2019s collateral attack on his conviction\u201d \u2014 and neither can we. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We deny Winston\u2019s motion to strike the Attorney General\u2019s brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
