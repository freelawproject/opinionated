We review the dismissal of a complaint under either subsection of Rule 12 <em>de novo, </em>construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002); <em>See Makarova v. United States, </em>201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.2000). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">Levy alleges that the Defendants-Appellees violated his civil rights under \u00a7 1983 through various actions related to the revocation of his license to practice dentistry in 2007. In his appellate brief, he argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pre-deprivation proceeding conducted by the New York State Board of Regents, which is entrusted with the statutory authority to revoke a dentist\u2019s license under certain circumstances, <em>see </em>New York State Education Law \u00a7 6510, was inadequate for a number of alleged reasons, including that it arose out of a conspiracy to cover-up the conversion of Medicaid payments he was owed for his work as a dentist and subsequent payment of those funds into then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer\u2019s gubernatorial campaign fund. Levy also argues that he was not required to exhaust his remedies available under state law before he was able to bring a civil rights claim for violation of his due process rights. In this regard, Levy misses the point. The predeprivation proceedings available to him\u2014 which included notice and an administrative hearing at which Levy was represented by an attorney, presented evidence, and called witnesses \u2014 combined with the availability of an adequate post-deprivation remedy through New York\u2019s Article 78 proceeding, constituted sufficient process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 76 (2d Cir.2009) (denial by state agency of physician\u2019s petition to reinstate his revoked medical license did not deprive physician of due process, where physician was given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before his petition for reinstatement was denied, and an adequate post-deprivation remedy was available through Article 78 proceedings); <em>Rivera-Powell v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Elections, </em>470 F.3d 458, 466 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that pre-deprivation process was constitutionally adequate where the plaintiff received notice and was represented at a pre-deprivation hearing by an attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In addition, the district court properly dismissed Levy\u2019s damages claims against the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office, because, contrary to Levy\u2019s contention on appeal, the Eleventh Amendment provides a state and its agencies with immunity from claims for damages in federal court where, as here, the State has not given consent to be sued. <em>See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 100-01, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We have reviewed Levy\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
