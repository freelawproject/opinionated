Brown argues that the state failed to prove venue at his underlying criminal trial, rendering his conviction invalid, and that the defendants violated his due process rights when they did not investigate the validity of his underlying conviction before classifying him as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-20\">The district court found that Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), in which the Supreme Court held that when judgment in favor of a plaintiff seeking damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [the plaintiffs] conviction or sentence,\u201d the \u201cplaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. In other words, \u201cthe complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-21\">A judgment in favor of Brown on his \u00a7 1983 claim would necessarily imply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>invalidity of his underlying conviction for aggravated child molestation. Because Brown has not provided any evidence that this conviction has already been invalidated, the district court did not err in finding his claims barred by <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
