Nelson denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chang Bao Lin, </em>No. A099 427 645 (B.I.A. Aug. 6, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 427 645 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 23, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-23\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Lin\u2019s challenge to the pretermission of his asylum application because his assertion of a due process violation essentially disputes the correctness of the IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 328-29 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that a question of law is not implicated \u201cwhen the petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of the IJ\u2019s fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion.\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review as to asylum and address only Lin\u2019s challenges to the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Lin contends that the agency erred in finding that he did not establish past persecution. However, because Lin testified to only a brief altercation with authorities that did not result in arrest, detention, or serious injury, the agency reasonably concluded that he had not demonstrated harm rising to the level of persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding that persecution requires that the harm suffered be sufficiently severe, rising above \u201cmere harassment\u201d); <em>see also Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir.2011) (holding that petitioner failed to establish persecution where \u201che suffered only minor bruising from an altercation with family planning officials, which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect\u201d). Additionally, in light of the amount Lin paid to be smuggled into the United States, and his failure to present evidence of his financial circumstances, the agency reasonably found that the fine imposed was not so severe that it constituted persecution. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that an asylum applicant claiming that economic deprivation constituted persecution must offer some proof that he suffered a \u201cdeliberate imposition of substantial economic disadvantage.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The agency also did not err in finding that Lin did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be subjected to torture if he returned to China because of his illegal departure from the country. Contrary to Lin\u2019s characterization, the State Department reports on China in the record indicated that most returnees would be, at most, subjected to a brief detention, and Lin presented no particularized evidence suggesting that he would be tortured. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 157-60 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that a petitioner is not \u201centitled to CAT protection based solely on the fact that she is part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China,\u201d and that beyond generalized country conditions reports stating that some Chinese prisoners have been tortured, an applicant for CAT relief must submit particularized evidence suggesting that he is likely to be subject to torture in Chinese prisons). Moreover, Lin\u2019s claim that he is eligible for withholding of removal based on his illegal departure from China is unavailing because punishment for violation of a law applicable to all citizens does not, standing alone, establish persecution on a protected ground. <em>See Qun Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 163 n. 5 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201cPunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Accordingly, because Lin did not establish that he suffered past persecution or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that he is likely to be subjected to future persecution or torture, he did not establish his eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178, 184-85 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
