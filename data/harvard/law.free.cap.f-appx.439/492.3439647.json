Because we conclude that Kimble presented sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could find the defendants\u2019 proffered hiring rationale pretextual, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-20\">This dispute arises from allegations that the Wood County Sheriffs Office (the \u201cOffice\u201d) racially discriminated against Kimble, an African American, when considering candidates for an internal promotion. The current County Sheriff, Mark Wasylyshyn, assumed his role in January 2005. Per Wasylyshyn\u2019s own testimony, upon taking office, he and his Chief Deputy, Eric Reynolds, sought to overhaul many of his predecessor\u2019s management policies. Of particular relevance, Wasylyshyn states that he intended to take a more aggressive stance on enforcement activities (e.g., writing tickets and making arrests) and implement more formalized hiring procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-21\">Eighteen months into Wasylyshyn\u2019s term, Sergeant Bill Frankart of the Office\u2019s Road Patrol Division announced his early retirement, thereby creating an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>opening for an Environmental Sergeant. The Environmental Sergeant\u2019s duties included enforcing solid-waste laws, inspecting junkyards, and supervising the deputy in charge of the inmate litter-control crew. Prior to his departure, Frankart, who employed Kimble part-time in his recycling business, met with Chief Deputy Reynolds to discuss potential replacements. At that time, Kimble had worked in the Office nearly seventeen years \u2014 having spent the last nine as a Road Patrol Deputy \u2014 and expressed interest in the position. Fran-kart thus told Reynolds about Kimble, stating that he would \u201cmake an excellent choice\u201d; Reynolds, however, responded with \u201csomething to the effect that he didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Reynolds officially posted the Environmental Sergeant opening at the end of August, but restricted it to current sergeants, none of whom was African American.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly after Reynolds announced the opening, Wasylyshyn approached Sergeant Jim Shank and encouraged him to apply. Shank refused for personal reasons, but also recommended Kimble\u2014 whom he had overseen on road patrol \u2014 for the position, since Kimble was trained in litter enforcement. Though Shank assured Wasylyshyn that he \u201creally never had any problems with [Kimble],\u201d the Sheriff stated that \u201che really didn\u2019t want [him] to have that position,\u201d and preferred somebody who would \u201cgo out and write some tickets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">When the posting period closed without any submissions, Reynolds extended the deadline and opened the position to deputies. He included several requirements in the job description: (1) at least five years\u2019 road-patrol experience; (2) a valid commercial driver\u2019s license, to be obtained within six months of receiving the position; (8) flexible days and hours; (4) record-keeping and statistic-development abilities; (5) computer experience; (6) public-speaking ability; and (7) no recent disciplinary issues. Deputy Kimble, who had the requisite experience and a commercial driver\u2019s license and considered himself otherwise qualified, applied for the position the first day it opened to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Also during this second posting period, the Office\u2019s Human Resources Representative, Joneal Bender, solicited applications from three deputies who passed through her office, even though none expressed interest in the position. In one instance, the would-be applicant, Deputy Tom Otley, told Bender that he lacked road-patrol experience and computer skills \u2014 both stated requirements for the position. Bender offered to draft a letter of interest for Otley and later did so, even though Otley expressed doubt about signing the letter and provided no input on the letter\u2019s content. After their conversation, Bender escorted Otley to Reynolds\u2019s office to discuss the position further. When Otley again explained his shortcomings, Reynolds assured him that he was \u201cthe most qualified for the job,\u201d and offered to \u201chelp\u201d him with his deficiencies. Despite this generous assistance, Otley, like the other two deputies Bender approached, ultimately declined to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">On the posting period\u2019s final day, Deputy Rodney Konrad, an eight-year veteran with the Office, submitted a letter of interest to Bender. Prior to applying, however, Konrad met with Reynolds to discuss his application because he realized he lacked a few months of the required road-patrol experience. After talking to Konrad, Reynolds presented the matter to Wasy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>lyshyn, who decided to waive the requirement for him. At that point Reynolds encouraged Konrad \u201cto go ahead and apply anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">When the posting period ended, Konrad and Kimble were the only applicants for the position. The Office scheduled interviews for early November and then compiled a five-member interview panel consisting of Ms. Bender, Chief Deputy Reynolds, Road Patrol Division Lieutenant William Ervin, and two individuals from the County Government \u2014 County Administrator Andrew Kalmar and Solid Waste Management District Director Ken Rieman.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">During the interviews, the panel asked Kimble and Konrad the same set of prepared questions. Each member took notes and scored the candidates according to a ten-category grading sheet that Wasylyshyn had prepared. After the question-and-answer session, the panel rated the candidates quite closely: in aggregate, Konrad received 200.5 points; Kimble received 194. Before discussing scores or recommendations, however, Reynolds distributed Law Enforcement Activity Reports (\u201cLEARs\u201d), detailing the two deputies\u2019 respective year-to-date citation and arrest statistics. Although enforcement rates were not among the selection criteria in the job posting, Bender requested that a lieutenant in the Road Patrol Division run the LEARs several weeks in advance, in preparation for the interviews. The reports showed that Konrad had issued more citations and made more arrests than Kimble. Reynolds then emphasized that high activity and enforcement levels were \u201cthe direction the sheriff wants.\u201d Upon receiving this new information, the panel took two votes: it voted three-to-two to recommend Kimble if Wasylyshyn \u201cliked the program just the way it was,\u201d and four-to-one to recommend Konrad if Wasylyshyn \u201cwanted to take a more strict law enforcement approach.\u201d Bender prepared a memo for Wasylyshyn explaining the panel\u2019s recommendations. Within days,' the Sheriff announced to the Office that he was promoting Konrad; Konrad assumed the position a month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In April 2007, Kimble filed a complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (the \u201cOCRC\u201d) alleging racial discrimination. After speaking with each member of the interview panel, the OCRC issued a determination letter finding \u201cprobable cause\u201d for discrimination. A few months later, Kimble initiated this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, claiming violations of (1) Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17; (2) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; and (3) the Ohio Civil Rights Act, Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 4112.01-4112.99. The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted following a hearing. <em>Kimble v. Wasylyshyn, </em>687 F.Supp.2d 703, 710-11 (N.D.Ohio 2009). In its memorandum opinion and order, the court concluded that although Kimble established a prima facie case of racial discrimination, he failed to show that the defendants\u2019 proffered reasoning for the hiring selection was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>Kimble appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">A. Applicable Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Ciminillo v. Streicher, </em>434 F.3d 461, 464 (6th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmovant must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Celotex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted). But in making our determination, we may not \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of [any disputed] matter,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); we must instead view the facts in the record and all inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 587-88, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The same legal analysis applies to all of Kimble\u2019s claims, regardless of whether they arise under Title VII, \u00a7 1981, or the Ohio Civil Rights Act. <em>See Hollins v. Atl. Co., </em>188 F.3d 652, 658 (6th Cir.1999). Because Kimble presents circumstantial (rather than direct) evidence of discrimination, we review his case under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting scheme. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>see also Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (expounding upon <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The parties concede that Kimble established a prima facie case of racial discrimination. <em>See, e.g., Risch v. Royal Oak Police Dep\u2019t, </em>581 F.3d 383, 391 (6th Cir.2009). Sheriff Wasylyshyn accordingly provided three legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for the hiring decision: (1) he preferred candidates with high activity, initiative, and self-motivation; (2) he sought the most qualified applicant for the position; and (3) he wished to focus on greater enforcement within the division. Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>Kimble must now show that Appellees\u2019 proffered reasons are pretextual by providing \u201csufficient evidence from which the jury [could] reasonably reject the employer\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co., </em>29 F.3d 1078, 1083 (6th Cir.1994), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2352, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009), <em>as recognized in Geiger v. Tower Auto., </em>579 F.3d 614, 621 (6th Cir.2009). A plaintiff may meet this burden either \u201cby persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer,\u201d or \u201cby showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089. But in either case, he must do so by producing additional evidence rather than mere conjecture. <em>Manzer, </em>29 F.3d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Kimble responds indirectly, by offering various items of circumstantial evidence in an attempt to refute Appellees\u2019 purported hiring rationale. In this instance, a jury may \u201cinfer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). As the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">[p]roof that the defendant\u2019s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive. In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party\u2019s dishonesty about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>material fact as \u201caffirmative evidence of guilt.\u201d Moreover, once the employer\u2019s justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (citation omitted). Our question thus becomes whether Kimble\u2019s prima facie case and circumstantial evidence could lead a reasonable jury \u2014 if it accepts his factual allegations as true and draws all inferences therefrom in his favor \u2014 to reject Appellees\u2019 proffered hiring rationale, thus permitting an inference that discriminatory intent truly motivated the decision. We believe that Kimble meets this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">B. Kimble\u2019s Circumstantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In his brief, Kimble highlights several facts that he believes call into question Appellees\u2019 articulated hiring rationale and instead reveal them true, discriminatory motive. Upon reviewing these assertions, we discuss his strongest arguments below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">1. Kimble was \u201cpre-rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">First, Kimble argues that Wasylyshyn and Reynolds summarily rejected his candidacy based upon his race. Although an employer has great flexibility in choosing a management-level employee, <em>Wrenn v. Gould, </em>808 F.2d 493, 502 (6th Cir.1987), evidence of preselection (or, presumably, as in this case, \u201cpre-rejection\u201d) \u201coperates to discredit the employer\u2019s proffered explanation for its employment decision,\u201d and \u201cis relevant evidence of the employer\u2019s motivation,\u201d <em>Goostree v. Tennessee, </em>796 F.2d 854, 861 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">In explaining how he was pre-rejected, Kimble stresses that both Reynolds and Wasylyshyn candidly opposed his supervisors\u2019 unqualified recommendations <em>before they had even seen Kimble\u2019s application materials. </em>But at the same time, Reynolds encouraged two Caucasian employees (Deputies Otley and Konrad) to apply, notwithstanding their professed inability to meet posted job requirements. In confronting this hurdle, Reynolds vaguely told one applicant he could \u201chelp\u201d him with his shortcomings and, after consulting with Wasylyshyn, offered to waive requirements for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">In light of these facts, we believe that a reasonable jury could infer that the Office anticipatorily decided not to hire Kimble. The reasons for the Office\u2019s decision are unclear. For example, Shank\u2019s testimony might support Wasylyshyn\u2019s explanation that he wanted to focus on enforcement. Yet the fact that Wasylyshyn and Reynolds offered to overlook or waive stated job requirements for some (Caucasian) applicants casts doubt on the assertion that they sought \u201cthe most qualified applicant\u201d for the job, or at least suggests that the stated requirements were not actually imperative. The more subjective Appellees\u2019 hiring decision, the more closely we must scrutinize their proffered rationales. <em>See Grano v. Dep\u2019t of Dev., </em>699 F.2d 836, 837 (6th Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]he legitimacy of the articulated reason for [an] employment decision is subject to particularly close scrutiny where the evaluation is subjective.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>2. HR assisted unqualified candidates, but not Kimble.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Second, Kimble claims that Bender helped thwart his promotion prospects by building a pool of Caucasian applicants, regardless of whether they met the position\u2019s stated requirements. Though Bender encouraged at least two unqualified employees to apply for the position, we find her interaction with Deputy Otley \u2014 for whom she drafted a letter of interest and arranged a meeting with Reynolds \u2014 most questionable. In her defense, Bender claims she was new to the position and did not know whether every employee had the necessary qualifications. But this testimony conflicts with Otley\u2019s statement that he explicitly told her he lacked both road-patrol experience and computer skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In addressing this point, the trial court described Bender\u2019s actions as \u201c[those] of a helpful Human Resources Manager.\u201d <em>Kimble, </em>687 F.Supp.2d at 710. Such a conclusion may oversimplify the situation. Providing an opportunity to one candidate in the hiring process, to the disadvantage of a competitor within a protected class, can serve as evidence of pretext. See <em>Kline v. Tenn. Valley Auth., </em>128 F.3d 337, 351 (6th Cir.1997); <em>Goden v. Runyon, </em>885 F.Supp. 1104, 1108-09 (W.D.Tenn.1995) (finding pretext where defendant-employer offered pre-interview subject matter training to a younger applicant, but not to an older applicant). Per Bender\u2019s own testimony, she was aware that Kimble was interested in the position on the day he submitted his materials \u2014 the day the posting opened. Yet she did not take him to see Reynolds or even forward his application until the deadline. Parsing these facts, we reason that a jury could infer that Bender provided preferential assistance to certain applicants and overlooked (or even helped them surmount) their deficiencies, all to Kimble\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">3. Only Kimble met the job\u2019s posted requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Third, Kimble points out that at the time of the posting of the Environmental Sergeant position, he was the most qualified applicant \u2014 at least in terms of its written requirements. Specifically, he possessed both the requisite road experience and a commercial driver\u2019s license (although the posting stated that applicants had six months to attain the license). Meanwhile, Konrad had no license and lacked a few months\u2019 patrol experience. And, when Reynolds offered to \u201cwaive\u201d the road-patrol requirement for Konrad, he did so very discreetly. He did not, for example, formally alter the posted job qualifications or mention the decision to the interview panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The district court dismissed this argument as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d stating that the Office did not intend for candidates to meet the job requirements before applying, but rather before assuming the position. But this reading conflicts with the posting\u2019s wording: \u201cAny Road Patrol Deputies meeting above requirements ... should submit a letter of interest....\u201d It does not say, \u201cAny Road Patrol Deputies <em>who will soon meet </em>above requirements.... \u201d Furthermore, Reynolds and Wasylyshyn\u2019s actions belie such an interpretation: if Konrad were eligible, why did they need to \u201cwaive\u201d the road-patrol requirement for him? And why did they withhold this waiver from the interview panel? We believe that a reasonable jury, accepting these allegations as true, could conclude that the two willingly overlooked their own requirements to promote favored candidates \u2014 again calling into question the objectivity of their assessment and furthering inferences of discrimination. <em>See Grano, </em>699 F.2d at 837 (recognizing that \u201csubjective evaluation processes intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>to recognize merit provide ready mechanisms for discrimination\u201d and thus call for close judicial scrutiny). Additionally, these actions appear to undermine Appellees\u2019 purported desire to \u201cselect the best candidate for the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">4. Enforcement rates were not part of the job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Fourth, Kimble highlights that after the panel completed its interviews, Chief Deputy Reynolds distributed enforcement activity reports and encouraged the panel to consider them when choosing between the candidates. Enforcement statistics and activity levels were nowhere in the job posting\u2019s requirements or description. Ultimately though, these numbers proved outcome determinative, as the panel\u2019s scenario-dependent recommendation suggests. Kimble argues that the numbers were the product of retroactive data mining, meticulously selected to \u201ctip the scale\u201d in Konrad\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In discussing this contention, the district court noted that the allegation \u201cbolsters rather than undermines\u201d Appellees\u2019 position, and applauded the Office for developing \u201ca valid way to distinguish the candidates.\u201d <em>Kimble, </em>687 F.Supp.2d at 709. Again, however, this observation makes light of Kimble\u2019s argument; he complains not that the Office used LEARs, but rather that it did so spontaneously and without warning to candidates or panel members. Office personnel prepared these lists weeks before the interview. Why then could they not advise the panel and interviewees that the LEARs might be consulted to settle a \u201ctie\u201d? We recognize that \u201cemployers are <em>not </em>rigidly bound by the language in a job description.\u201d <em>Browning v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>436 F.3d 692, 696 (6th Cir.2006). Still though, other circuits have held that an employer\u2019s departure from the selection criteria in a job announcement to the detriment of a minority employee can be probative of discrimination. <em>See Courtney v. Biosound, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 414, 421 (7th Cir.1994) (denying the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment in an age-discrimination case where the job description failed to mention a requirement that the employer later claimed was essential); <em>Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1225 (2d Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In response, Appellees argue that \u201cevery employee ... had reason to assume that activity levels would be considered.\u201d Yet this presumptive stance unfairly burdens the applicant to anticipate the employer\u2019s expectations. Indeed, Wasylyshyn himself conceded that this \u201cimportant factor\u201d should have appeared in the job posting. Thus, although the use of LEARs may have been an objective means of distinguishing between two qualified candidates, a jury might just as easily conclude that the data was prepared well in advance (as it indisputably was), then sprung upon the interview panel (again, as it indisputably was) to help ensure that Konrad received their recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">5. Earlier decisions overlooked enforcement rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Fifth, Kimble emphasizes that despite Wasylyshyn\u2019s professed desire to increase enforcement activity, in the last departmental promotion, the Sheriff selected Timothy Spees, a candidate whose LEARs were among the lowest in the applicant pool. Kimble argues that this sudden emphasis on activity levels is thus contrived. An employer\u2019s failure to uniformly apply the policies it cites as the basis for its hiring and firing decisions can demonstrate pretext. <em>See Harrison v. Metro. Gov\u2019t, </em>80 F.3d 1107, 1117 (6th Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 20, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), <em>as recognized in Jackson v. Quanex Corp., </em>191 F.3d 647, 667 &amp; n. 6 (6th Cir.1999); <em>accord Lamer v. Metaldyne Co., </em>240 Fed.Appx. 22, 33 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In response to this contention, the trial court noted that according to Shank and Wasylyshyn, Spees was head-and-shoulders above the other candidates, such that the panel did not need to resort to LEARs as a \u201ctie-breaking\u201d mechanism. <em>Kimble, </em>687 F.Supp.2d at 710. Moreover, Appellees note that Spees was promoted to Road Patrol Shift Sergeant, which, according to Wasylyshyn, is \u201cnot an enforcement position.\u201d Yet this latter argument conflicts with the testimony of Shank, who agreed that on road patrol, \u201cone of the main functions, if not the most important function, is ... activity levels on the road,\u201d (i.e., enforcement activity) and that the Office thus sought \u201csomebody proactive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s explanation\u2014 that LEARs were only a means of deciding between two closely qualified candidates\u2014 is workable, Kimble\u2019s argument casts doubt on the sincerity of Appellees\u2019 motives, as well as the objectivity of their procedures. After all, if enforcement really were that important to Wasylyshyn, why would he not consider it in all hiring decisions? A jury could reasonably disbelieve Wasylyshyn\u2019s proffered explanation, providing further evidence from which a jury might reject the Appellees\u2019 stated hiring rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">6. The OCRC found probable cause for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Finally, Kimble directs us to the OCRC\u2019s report, in which the agency concluded that it was \u201cprobable that [Appellees] engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice.\u201d Although the OCRC\u2019s report is not dispositive, <em>see Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 469-70, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982), parties may generally admit such findings at trial, <em>Chandler v. Roudebush, </em>425 U.S. 840, 863 n. 39, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976) (\u201cPrior administrative findings made with respect to an employment discrimination claim may, of course, be admitted as evidence .... \u201d). Moreover, the agency\u2019s probable cause finding should receive \u201csubstantial weight.\u201d <em>Wrenn, </em>808 F.2d at 499; <em>accord Cooper v. Phillip Morris, Inc., </em>464 F.2d 9, 12 (6th Cir.1972). The OCRC\u2019s determination is an additional piece of circumstantial evidence for the jury to consider, and it furthers Kimble\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">7. The totality of the evidence allows an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">As our past discussion suggests, this case involves a detailed fact pattern and highly particularized allegations, frustrating our attempts to find perfectly analogous case law. Precedent supports the notion that each of Kimble\u2019s assertions regarding the Department\u2019s handling of his application can suffice individually to thwart a defendant\u2019s proffered rationale. And, when we consider the totality of the evidence \u2014 (1) Kimble\u2019s \u201cpre-rejection\u201d; (2) HR\u2019s recruitment of unqualified candidates; (3) Reynolds\u2019s and Wasylyshyn\u2019s undisclosed decision to \u201chelp\u201d certain applicants with requirements or \u201cwaive\u201d requirements altogether; (4) the sudden introduction of enforcement statistics at the end of the interview process; and (5) the OCRC\u2019s probable cause finding \u2014 it too must suffice, leaving us with a strong suspicion of race-based preference. Moreover, we emphasize that at the summary judgment stage, Appellees face a very high burden: \u201cIf the plaintiff! ] ha[s] made out a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendant can be awarded summary judgment <em>only if no reasonable jury </em>could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>conclude that the reasons offered for the [detrimental employment action] were only a pretext hiding a discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Bender v. Hecht\u2019s Dep\u2019t Stores, </em>455 F.3d 612, 620 (6th Cir.2006) (emphasis added). And because we find that Kimble\u2019s evidence creates a compelling narrative that casts doubt upon Appellees\u2019 professed hiring rationale, we are unconvinced that <em>no reasonable jury </em>could find in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. The Office employs two African Americans among its roughly 122-member workforce: Deputy Kimble and another individual, a corrections officer. This 2-in-122 figure closely mirrors the demographics of Wood County as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. Kimble makes several other allegations, in addition to those that we examine: (1) that the Office delayed Konrad\u2019s start date a few weeks to allow him to gain requisite experience; (2) that the interview panel overlooked Kimble\u2019s past enforcement experience; and (3) that Wasylyshyn disregarded Kimble\u2019s higher interview scores for \"enthusiasm and motivation,\u201d despite a supposed desire to hire \"self-motivated\u201d individuals. Although these latter claims may offer slight probative value, because we deem Kimble's other arguments adequate, we do not address them now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
