After his case was consolidated with other related cases, Robins agreed to cooperate with a plaintiff-company, AXA Global Risks (AXA), for the duration of the trial, in exchange for $900,000. In a subsequent effort to settle his bodily injury claim against T &amp; B, Robins entered into a preliminary agreement with T <em>&amp; </em>B that would entitle Robins to payment of $5 million plus indemnification by T &amp; B, \u201cnot to exceed 1.2 million dollars,\u201d for any eventual liability that Robins might have to AXA for breach of contract. T &amp; B\u2019s primary insurance company, New Hampshire Insurance Company, agreed to pay $5 million of the settlement, but not the breach of contract damages. T &amp; B\u2019s secondary excess insurance company, Federal Insurance Company (Federal), paid $990,000. A year later, Federal filed a subrogation suit against New Hampshire and AIG Domestic Claims, Inc. (collectively New Hampshire), which served as the claims administrator on behalf of New Hampshire. New Hampshire filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. We REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">On July 5,1999, an explosion occurred at the Kaiser Aluminum Corporation\u2019s (Kaiser) aluminum processing plant in Gramercy, Louisiana. Several persons, including Robins, were injured. Subsequently, Robins filed suit in Louisiana state court against multiple defendants, including T &amp; B. Robins alleged that T &amp; B manufactured a product that contributed to the explosion. It is undisputed that New Hampshire was T &amp; B\u2019s first-layer insurer for the relevant time period that T &amp; B\u2019s policy with New Hampshire (hereinafter the New Hampshire policy or the Policy) provided coverage from January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2000. The Policy required New Hampshire to pay those sums that T &amp; B \u201cbecomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed by [T &amp; B] under an Insured Contract because of Bodily Injury.\u201d It is also undisputed that Federal was T &amp; B\u2019s second-layer excess insurer for the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">In late 2000, Robins\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with other lawsuits filed as a result of the explosion. Among the consolidated lawsuits was a suit by AXA and other property insurers which paid significant business-interruption and property-damage losses to Kaiser as a result of the explosion. Later, AXA contracted to lend Robins $900,000 in exchange for Robins\u2019s cooperation as a joint plaintiff in the consolidated suit against T &amp; B. The agreement also provided that, if Robins settled with another party without AXA\u2019s consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>he would be required to pay back the loan plus a $300,000 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On October 7, 2001, the day before the consolidated trial was set to begin, Robins entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with T &amp; B (hereinafter Preliminary Agreement). Relevant here, Paragraph 1 of the Preliminary Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">Thomas &amp; Betts corporation and Its Insurers agree to pay Wayne Robins, et al Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) as a result of that lawsuit entitled <em>In Re: Gramercy Plant Explosion at Kaiser, </em>and Master Docket Number 25,975, 23rd Judicial District Court, St. James Parish, Louisiana and Wayne Robins, Carolyn Robins, Shamita Robins, Damita Robins, Docket Number 26,671, 23rd Judicial District Court, Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6E\">Paragraph 5 of the Preliminary Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">Thomas &amp; Betts and Its Insurers agree to hold harmless, indemnify and defend Wayne Robins, et al, The Fields Law Firm and Cleo Fields for any amount owed to AXA, Kaisers Subrogated Property Reinsurers, Caleb Didriksen and the Didriksen Law Firm, not to exceed 1.2 million dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">On October 24, 2001, New Hampshire informed Robins that it \u201cdid not agree to provide the hold harmless and indemnification provisions cited in paragraph five of the agreement.\u201d Thus, the company refused to pay any sums related to Paragraph 5. The following day, Robins filed a motion to enforce the Preliminary Agreement. Soon after, AXA filed a similar motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">On December 6, 2001, T &amp; B sent a letter to Robins explaining its intention to deposit $5 million into the state court\u2019s registry, pending resolution of the terms of the settlement, if the matter was not resolved by the next day. Robins sent a letter responding to T &amp; B on the same day, stating that, if the funds were not paid to Robins by December 7, 2001, Robins would file suit against T &amp; B. T &amp; B deposited the $5 million into the state court\u2019s registry on December 6, 2001. On December 11, 2001, AXA sent Robins a demand for the $1.2 million, resulting from Robins\u2019s breach of contract. Robins faxed this document to Federal to advise the company of the status of AXA\u2019s demand. On December 10, 2001, Robins amended his motion to enforce settlement to include additional damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">It is not clear from the record whether the settlement agreement between Robins and T &amp; B was ever finalized \u2014 if and when the settlement was paid to Robins, how much Robins was paid, or which insurance company or companies paid those amounts. However, at some point, Federal paid $990,000 to Robins on T &amp; B\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">In April 2003, Federal filed suit against New Hampshire in Louisiana state court, seeking subrogation. The case was removed to federal court, pursuant to federal diversity jurisdiction. In its complaint, Federal claimed that New Hampshire should have paid the $990,000 to Robins because the amount was part of the settlement of Robins\u2019s bodily injury claim. Thus, it was within the limits of the New Hampshire policy. The case was administratively closed in August 2003, pending resolution of the underlying consolidated state law suit, but it was reopened five years later in November 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">After the case was reopened, the parties submitted a joint proposed scheduling order that included discovery, which the district court granted. However, before discovery could begin, New Hampshire filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the $990,000 was not a covered claim of bodily injury under the New Hampshire policy. Therefore, New Hampshire ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>gued, it was not obligated to subrogate Federal. The district court summarily affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, granting New Hampshire\u2019s motion and holding that Federal failed to prove that it paid any amount rightfully owed to T &amp; B by New Hampshire. Federal appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cWhen sitting in diversity, this Court applies the substantive law of the state.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>620 F.3d 509, 516 n. 2 (5th Cir.2010). The parties do not dispute that this case is governed by Louisiana law. This court reviews a district court\u2019s application of state law and grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holt v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>627 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). In reviewing summary judgment, \u201c[w]e construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party....\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Although not mentioned in its filings to the district court or to this court, Federal\u2019s subrogation claim is a third-party performance and legal subrogation claim, arising under articles 1855 and 1829 of the Louisiana Civil Code. Article 1855 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhV\">Performance may be rendered by a third person, even against the will of the obligee, unless the obligor or the obligee has an interest in performance only by the obligor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">Performance rendered by a third person effects subrogation only when so provided by law or agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">Article 1829 provides in relevant part that \u201c[sjubrogation takes place by operation of law ... in favor of an obligor who pays a debt he owes with others or for others and who has recourse against those others as a result of the payment....\u201d La. Civ.Code art. 1829(3). To this end, \u201c[sjubrogation is a legal fiction whereby payment by a third person ... extinguishes an obligation of the original creditor. The third person then steps into the shoes of the original creditor, acquiring the right to assert the actions and rights of the original creditor.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Berthelot, </em>732 So.2d 1230, 1233 (La.1999) (citations omitted). In other words, Federal cannot recover the $990,000 it paid on T &amp; B\u2019s behalf unless that amount was covered by the New Hampshire policy. Therefore, determining whether Federal is entitled to subrogation turns on: (1) the limits of the New Hampshire policy and (2) whether Federal\u2019s payment fits within the limits of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">As previously mentioned, the New Hampshire policy requires New Hampshire to pay those sums that T &amp; B \u201cbecomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed by [T &amp; B] under an Insured Contract because of Bodily Injury.\u201d The district court held that the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d limits the New Hampshire policy to tort liability. We agree. \u201cLegally obligated to pay\u201d is not defined in the Policy. Therefore, under Louisiana law, we must give the phrase its \u201cgenerally prevailing meaning.\u201d La. Civ.Code art.2047. Because no Louisiana court has interpreted the meaning of \u201clegally obligated to pay,\u201d we must make an A'ne-guess about how the Louisiana courts would interpret the phrase. <em>See State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Fullerton, </em>118 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.1997). To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>this end, it is well settled that the use of the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d in an insurance policy limits coverage to damages arising out of tortious acts and does not cover contractual obligations. <em>See Data Specialties, Inc. v. Trans. Ins. Co., </em>125 F.3d 909, 911-12 (5th Cir.1997) (examining Texas law and citing numerous federal and state court decisions that interpret \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d to limit policy coverage to tort liability); <em>see also </em>7A Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance \u00a7 103:14 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cWhile the phrase \u2018legal liability\u2019 includes liability assumed by contract, the phrases \u2018liability imposed by law,\u2019 and \u2018legally obligated to pay as damages\u2019 do not.\u201d). Thus, the district court correctly held that the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d in the New Hampshire policy limits the Policy\u2019s coverage to damages arising out of tort liability and does not cover contract damages. We next examine whether Federal\u2019s payment fits within the limits of the New Hampshire policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">An \u201cinsurer should have to reimburse the insured only to the extent that the settlement compromised claims that were covered by the policy.\u201d Allan D. Windt, 2 Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 6:31 (5th ed.2009) (footnote omitted); <em>see generally Gulf Fleet Marine Operations, Inc. v. Wartsila Power, Inc., </em>797 F.2d 257 (5th Cir.1986). Here, the only claim at issue is the bodily injury claim Robins brought against T &amp; B. When T &amp; B entered into the settlement agreement with Robins, the settlement was created solely to extinguish the bodily injury claim. Although a portion of the settlement agreement was characterized as amounts to indemnify Robins for his breach of contract with AXA, Robins did not have a breach of contract claim against T &amp; B. Therefore, any sum of money paid to Robins by T &amp; B was to compensate Robins for his bodily injury claim. In other words, the labeling of each component of the settlement does not change the reason for the agreement \u2014 settlement of the bodily injury claim. Consequently, the amount described in Paragraph 5 is not attributable to a breach of contract claim that is outside the limits of the New Hampshire policy. The payment was made in consideration for settlement of the bodily injury claim. Neither party disputes that the bodily injury claim is covered by the New Hampshire policy. Thus, the entire settlement amount was within the limits of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">We conclude that, because T &amp; B\u2019s payment to Robins was wholly within the limits of the New Hampshire policy, Federal was not responsible for paying any amounts attributable to the settlement agreement and is entitled to subrogation. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s summary judgment and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
