We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The IJ found Zha not credible for several reasons, including concerns with Zha\u2019s demeanor and implausibilities regarding his decision to apply for asylum. In light of the IJ\u2019s findings, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1040-44 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Because petitioners\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and they point to no other evidence the IJ should have considered, substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
