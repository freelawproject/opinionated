We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Tejada\u2019s asylum claim because she failed to demonstrate the Guatemalan government was unable or unwilling to protect her from the gang members that threatened her, <em>see Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005) (noting burden is on the applicant to show the government is unable or unwilling to control the nongovernmental persecutor), and she failed to establish it was not reasonable for her to relocate within Guatemala, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">Because Tejada failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
