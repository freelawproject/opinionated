On appeal, Nunez argues that the district court erred when it included a 16-level enhancement for a 2006 offense for trafficking cocaine under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.135. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">In 2010, Nunez pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1326(a) and (b)(2). Nunez had been removed from the United States on two other oceasionsin one instance after he was convicted of a felony in Florida for trafficking 28 grams or more of cocaine. Nunez was assigned a criminal history category of III and an offense level of 21, including a 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>enhancement for the drug offense, which placed him within the guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Nunez objected to the enhancement, arguing that his 2006 conviction did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(a)(i). Nunez specifically argued that Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 898.135 did not include the requisite \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element required to qualify it as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under 2L1.2. The district court rejected this argument, without further explanation, and sentenced Nunez to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release. Nunez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cFederal law, not state law, controls the application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Nunez argues that the district court erred when it applied a 16-level enhancement to his offense because his 2006 conviction does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135. Specifically, he contends that the Florida statute, despite its \u201ctrafficking\u201d label, does not meet the federal definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The government responds that Nunez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">\u201cThe United States Code increases the authorized maximum penalty to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if the illegally reentering alien\u2019s deportation followed an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 conviction.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). A 16-level enhancement is warranted if the alien has been previously deported after a felony drug trafficking conviction for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. <em>Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">For the purposes of this enhancement, the Guidelines define a drug trafficking offense as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) <em>with intent </em>to manufacture, import, export, <em>distribute, </em>or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmnt. (l(B)(iv)) (emphasis added). The Florida statute under which Nunez was convicted provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-14\">Any person who knowingly sells, purchases, manufactures, delivers, or brings into this state, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, 28 grams or more of cocaine ... or of any mixture containing cocaine, but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine or any such mixture, commits a felony of the first degree, which felony shall be known as \u201ctrafficking in cocaine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.135(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">Nunez argues that the district court erred because the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element present in the federal statute is absent from the Florida statute. In <em>Madera-Madera, </em>this court addressed a similar argument, determining that a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>fendant \u201cmust be in possession of a <em>significant </em>quantity of drugs before Georgia deems the offense drug \u2018trafficking.\u2019 \u201d 333 F.3d at 1232 (emphasis in the original). Although there is no specific \u201cintent to distribute\u201d in the Georgia statute, this court concluded that \u201cdrug trafficking is a more serious offense than either simple possession or possession with the intent to distribute\u201d and, thus, the statute \u201cnecessarily infers an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses a certain amount of drugs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Although a Georgia drug-trafficking statute was at issue above, in <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153-56 (11th Cir.2005), we determined that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction \u201cfor trafficking in cocaine by possession of between 200 and 400 grams of cocaine,\u201d in violation of Florida\u2019s drug-trafficking statute was a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). We concluded that Florida\u2019s three-tiered system was \u201cnot materially distinguishable\u201d from Georgia\u2019s system, and, thus, <em>Madera-Madera </em>dictated that James\u2019s offense involved an intent to distribute because \u201cFlorida\u2019s drug trafficking statute necessarily [implies] an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses 28 grams or more [of cocaine].\u201d <em>James, </em>430 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Here, Nunez\u2019s objection to the 16-level enhancement to his base offense level is foreclosed by <em>Madera-Madera. </em>The district court properly concluded that Nunez\u2019s 2006 conviction under \u00a7 893.135(l)(b) was a proper predicate for the \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), despite the absence of a separate \u201cintent to distribute\u201d clause in the Florida statute, because Nunez possessed a quantity of cocaine from which an intent to distribute could be inferred. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\">. Although Nunez cites to Fifth, Sixth, Ninth and Tenth Circuit decisions, <em>Madera-Madera </em>remains binding precedent in this circuit, which we are bound to follow unless it is overruled <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
