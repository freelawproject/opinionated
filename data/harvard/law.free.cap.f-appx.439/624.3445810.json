We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Page contends that the Board\u2019s 2004 decision to deny him parole was not supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and therefore violated his due process rights. After briefing was completed in this case, this court held that a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) is required to challenge the denial of parole. <em>See Hayward v. Marshall, </em>603 F.3d 546, 554-55 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc). Now the Supreme Court has held that the only federal right at issue in the parole context is procedural, and the only proper inquiry is what process the inmate received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly. <em>See Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 859, 863, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011) (per curiam). Because Page raises no procedural challenges regarding his parole hearing, a COA cannot issue, and we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Further, because Page has not has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we decline to certify his remaining claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We deny Page\u2019s \u201cmotion to amend petition for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d received on October 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
