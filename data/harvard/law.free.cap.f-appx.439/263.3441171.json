The district court sentenced Mendoza to a total of 132 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of forty-eight months on Count One and eighty-four months on Count Two, to be served consecutively. In determining the sentence for Count One, the district court varied upward from the high end of Mendoza\u2019s sentencing range under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines by eleven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On appeal, Mendoza challenges only the substantive reasonableness of this upward variance. We have reviewed the record and discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Savillon-Matute, </em>636 F.3d 119, 122 (4th Cir.2011). Ordinarily, this review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. However, because Mendoza \u201cdoes not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his sentence\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8 <em>n. </em>1), we need only consider whether Mendoza\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">When reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, this court assesses \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [(2006)] factors supported [the sentence] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 56, 128 S.Ct. 586. The court \u201cmust \u2018take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Morace, </em>594 F.3d 340, 346 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 307, 178 L.Ed.2d 199 (2010). When the district court exercises its discretion and varies from the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, it must explain its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2946, 180 L.Ed.2d 236 (2011). Although the district court \u201cmust ensure that its justification supports \u2018the degree of the variance,\u2019 \u201d it need not make \u201ca finding of \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances\u201d in order to impose a sentence outside the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47), 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Mendoza contends that his variance sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the statutory aims of sentencing and because the district court failed to appropriately weigh those 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors that supported his request for a within-Guidelines sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">In explaining its reasons for the upward variance in Count One, the district court identified several \u00a7 3553(a) factors that supported its decision. Specifically, the court cited Mendoza\u2019s obstructionist conduct, which included providing a false name and date of birth to the police and minimizing the seriousness of the offense, and Mendoza\u2019s leadership role in the robbery, as relevant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 the nature and circumstances of the offense \u2014 and found these factors were unaccounted for in the Guidelines calculation for Count One. The court further opined that the robbery was \u201cvery violent,\u201d in that Mendoza had pointed his firearm at a shop clerk\u2019s head, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (sentence should reflect the seriousness of the offense), and that this too was not accounted for in the Guidelines calculation. Finally, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>addressed Mendoza\u2019s personal history and characteristics, noting that it was sympathetic to Mendoza\u2019s lack of a stable family environment and his substance abuse problems. The court ultimately concluded, however, that the danger Mendoza posed to the community \u2014 evidenced by the fact that, despite his relatively young age (twenty-five), Mendoza had a history of using aliases, two convictions for driving while impaired, and a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon \u2014 trumped any leniency that these factors might otherwise support. Thus, the court opined that an upward variance was necessary to protect the public from any further crime Mendoza may commit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). We thus conclude the district court\u2019s well-reasoned explanation amply justified the extent of the variance it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Because there was no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s reasoning in this case, we will defer to it. <em>See Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d at 366-67 (holding sentencing court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence six years longer than advisory Guidelines range was reasonable, because district court employed \u00a7 3553-based reasoning to justify the variance); <em>see also United States v. Jeffery, </em>631 F.3d 669, 679 (4th Cir.) (\u201c[District courts have extremely broad discretion when determining the weight to be given each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.-(U.S. June 2, 2011) (No. 10-10894). We therefore affirm Mendoza\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
