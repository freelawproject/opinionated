We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C, \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Paola-Lopez asserts she was a victim of domestic abuse perpetrated by a Honduran citizen. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Paola-Lopez\u2019s asylum claim because she failed to demonstrate the Guatemalan government was unable or unwilling to protect her from her former partner. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005) (noting burden is on the applicant to show the government is unable or unwilling to control the non-governmental persecutor). Accordingly, her asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Because Paola-Lopez failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Paola-Lopez\u2019s CAT claim because she failed to establish a likelihood of torture by or with the acquiescence of government officials if returned to Guatemala. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007). Paola-Lopez\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider her CAT claim is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
