We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-24\">Lu contends that the occupational restriction imposed by the district court should be stricken because it is not reasonably necessary to protect the public, it is vague and overbroad, and it effects an improper delegation to the probation officer. Because Lu did not challenge the occupational restriction in the district court, we review his claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>545 F.3d 743, 747 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-25\">In light of the close relationship between the crime committed and condition imposed, there was no plain error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the condition was reasonably necessary to protect the public. <em>See United States v. Betts, </em>511 F.3d 872, 875 (9th Cir.2007). Lu\u2019s vagueness and overbreadth challenge fails because the condition is sufficiently clear to inform him of what conduct is proscribed, and is not overbroad. <em>See Vega, </em>545 F.3d at 749-50. Finally, Lu has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by delegating authority to the probation officer to waive the occupational restriction. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>417 F.3d 1064, 1072 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cFor an error to be plain, it must be \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 under current law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
