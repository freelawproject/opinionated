More specifically, Flood contends that the defendants handcuffed him for a prolonged period of time in a way that aggravated his pre-existing back injury and caused him severe pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-21\">The case has previously been before this Court. In January 2009, the District Court dismissed Flood\u2019s amended complaint. It held that the excessive-force claim was barred by issue preclusion because the Court had resolved the underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ing issues adversely to Flood in adjudicating Flood\u2019s suppression motion in his criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We vacated this part of the District Court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Flood v. </em>Schaefer,; 367 Fed.Appx. 315 (3d Cir.2010). We held that issue preclusion did not apply because, \u201c[i]n his suppression motion, Flood did not raise any excessive force claims arising under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and, as a result, the District Court did not rule upon these issues. <em>Id. </em>at 318. We explained that this holding was not contrary to the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because \u201cit is analytically possible for Flood to claim that Appellees subjected him to unconstitutional conditions even if a statement he made during the same time period was voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. We then ruled that \u201cFlood\u2019s claims are not barred by preclusion principles since, as indicated above, Flood could not be expected to raise excessive force claims in his suppression hearing which were unrelated to the voluntariness of his confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we held that \u201cif, as Flood alleges, police were aware that he had a severe back injury and handcuffed him in a manner that caused excessive pain and suffering, he could succeed in proving that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On remand, Flood sought to compel the production of certain audio tapes, which he claimed would show that the defendants were aware of his back injury. A magistrate judge denied that motion. The magistrate judge viewed Flood\u2019s motion as an attempt to resurrect a previously dismissed claim that his criminal case had been plagued by evidence tampering; the judge did not explicitly consider Flood\u2019s contention that these tapes would bear on the defendants\u2019 knowledge of his back injury. Flood filed objections to the District Court, but the Court did not rule upon those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The magistrate judge then ordered the parties to present all the evidence that they could muster concerning the excessive-force claim and, upon receiving this evidence and supporting briefs, recommended that the District Court grant summary judgment to the defendants. The magistrate judge provided two bases for this recommendation. First, the magistrate judge concluded that Flood\u2019s claim was barred by issue preclusion, because Flood should have raised it as a defense in the suppression hearing; since Flood did not raise the claim then, he was precluded from doing so in this action. Second, the magistrate judge stated that Flood\u2019s claim could not proceed because he had failed to produce \u201ca shred of objective evidence that he suffered any injury\u201d from the defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct. The District Court approved and adopted this report and recommendation and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. Flood then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">We will vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment. As noted above, the District Court first held that Flood\u2019s excessive-force claim was barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion. Issue preclusion applies when the following three circumstances are present: \u201c(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Duhaney v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 340, 347 (3d Cir.2010). We have already held that \u201cFlood\u2019s claims are not barred by preclusion principles since, as indicated above, Flood could not be expected to raise excessive force claims in his suppression hearing which were unrelated to the voluntariness of his confession.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>367 Fed.Appx. at 319. Given this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>holding, the District Court\u2019s ruling that Flood should in fact have raised his excessive force claim in the criminal action cannot stand. <em>See generally Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 867 (3d Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The District Court\u2019s second ground for granting summary judgment to the defendants is also flawed. The Court concluded that Flood could not withstand summary judgment because he had failed to present \u201cobjective evidence of injury.\u201d However, in evaluating claims of excessive force, the central issue is the force the officers employed (and whether it was reasonable under the circumstances), not the injury they caused. <em>See Smith v. Mensinger, </em>293 F.3d 641, 649 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also Chelios v. Heavener, </em>520 F.3d 678, 690 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough injury is a relevant factor in determining whether an officer used excessive force, an excessive force claim does not require any particular degree of injury.\u201d); <em>see also Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 1179, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010) (emphasizing this point in the Eighth Amendment context). Similarly, to the extent that the injuries Flood sustained are relevant, the evidence that he presented \u2014 primarily, his affidavit \u2014 is \u201cabout the best that can be expected from him at the summary judgment phase of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Kyler, </em>204 F.3d 102, 108 n. 7 (3d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks, alterations omitted). As we explained in our previous opinion, Flood may assert a viable excessive-force claim by showing that the \u201cpolice were aware that he had a severe back injury and handcuffed him in a manner that caused excessive pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>367 Fed.Appx. at 319. The District Court therefore erred in focusing exclusively on the degree of injury Flood suffered rather than the force used by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Finally, Flood argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion to compel the production of certain audiotapes that he contends would help to show that the defendants had knowledge of his back injury. We observe that while Flood appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s adverse ruling to the District Court, the Court never ruled on Flood\u2019s objections. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). Consequently, we must remand for the District Court to consider in the first instance\u2014 after further development of the record, if necessary \u2014 whether Flood is entitled to production of these tapes. <em>See Hutchinson v. Pfeil, </em>105 F.3d 562, 566 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the defendants and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-12\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, <em>State Auto Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Pro Design, P.C., </em>566 F.3d 86, 89 (3d Cir.2009), and review the order denying the motion to compel for abuse of discretion, <em>Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., </em>621 F.3d 261, 281 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">. The District Court\u2019s focus on the force that the defendants allegedly used during the last two hours of Flood's detention, to the exclusion of the earlier hours that Flood was held, also rests on a misapprehension of our previous opinion. We held that it was legally permissible for Flood to argue that the defendants \"subjected him to unconstitutional conditions even if a statement he made <em>during the same time period </em>was voluntary.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>367 Fed.Appx. at 319 (emphasis added). Thus, Flood may base his claim on force that was allegedly used at any point during his detention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-14\">. Flood also filed a motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief and, soon thereafter, his reply brief. We grant this motion and thus deem his reply brief timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
