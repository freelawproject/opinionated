R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Irene Melendez, a native and citizen of El Salvador, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Melendez failed to establish she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). We decline to consider whether Melendez\u2019s family constitutes a partieular social group because Melendez did not present that distinct argument to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Melendez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Melendez failed to establish it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if returned to El Salvador. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Finally, Melendez\u2019s contention that she was denied due process because the BIA failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision is belied by the record. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must show error and prejudice to establish a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
