On appeal, McCollough argues that she established a prima facie case of discrimination, specifically disparate disciplinary treatment based on sex, and that Chief Letteney is not entitled to qualified immunity on her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) equal protection claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, \u201cviewing the facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Emmett v. Johnson, </em>532 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). If the moving party sufficiently supports its motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must demonstrate that there are genuine issues of material fact. <em>Emmett, </em>532 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits \u201cdiscrimination] against any individual with respect to h[er] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (West 2003). Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, \u201ca plaintiff may proceed under the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2018pretext\u2019 framework, under which the employee, after establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, demonstrates that the employer\u2019s proffered permissible reason for taking an adverse employment action is actually a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Diamond v. Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). It is well established that, even under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting scheme, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff at all times. <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that MeCollough failed to establish a prima facie case that Defendants discriminated against her on the basis of sex where none of the male comparators had engaged in similar or more serious misconduct. <em>See Cook v. CSX Transp. Corp., </em>988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1993) (discussing prima facie case of discriminatory discipline). Likewise, we conclude that MeCollough has failed to demonstrate a prima facie case with respect to her \u00a7 1983 claim against Chief Letteney. <em>See Holder v. City of Raleigh, </em>867 F.2d 823, 828 (4th Cir.1989) (\u201cOur analysis with respect to Title VII also governs plaintiffs claims under ... [\u00a7 ] 1983.\u201d). Because MeCollough has not asserted a viable constitutional claim against Chief Letteney, we have no occasion to consider whether he is entitled to assert qualified immunity as a defense. <em>See Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (\u201cA court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\">. McCollough has forfeited appellate review of her remaining claims by failing to raise them in her opening brief. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999). To the extent she seeks to raise a claim of constructive discharge for the first time on appeal, that claim is not properly before us. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
