We have carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal and conclude that Dean has waived appellate review of the arguments in Sections II through V of her opening brief. Counsel failed to adequately support the arguments with specific facts and citations to the record, as required by Rule 28(a)(9)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 </em>F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cFailure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of the claim on appeal.\u201d); <em>Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C.Cir.1983) (Scalia, Cir. J.) (declining to review \u201casserted but unanalyzed, claim\u201d because \u201cappellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but [rather] ... as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them\u201d). This court cannot assume counsel\u2019s duty to advocate on Dean\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">With regard to Dean\u2019s claim that the district court failed to take into account Chrysler\u2019s financial woes, that information related only to whether a conflict of interest existed. Even without the financial information, the district court found that a conflict of interest existed but that no other factor indicated an abuse of discretion in connection with Chrysler\u2019s denials of benefits. <em>See Booth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. </em>Assocs. <em>Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>201 F.3d 335, 342-43 (4th Cir.2000) (discussing eight factors pursuant to which courts determine whether an abuse of discretion exists). Moreover, this information was not part of the administrative record upon which the denial was based. Thus, it was not properly before the district court. <em>See Bernstein v. CapitalCare, Inc., </em>70 F.3d 783, 788-89 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
