We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Cruz-Contreras\u2019s motion to reopen to rescind his removal order, where Cruz-Contreras did not allege a lack of notice of the hearing or file his motion within 180 days of the order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i),(ii). Nor did the agency abuse its discretion in denying the motion because Cruz-Contreras failed to establish changed circumstances. <em>See Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir.2008) (evidence must demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief warranting reopening based on changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">To the extent Cruz-Contreras contends that he should be permitted to file an asylum application, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Chen v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir.2008), which held that an alien subject to a final removal order may only reapply for asylum through a successful motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-21\">Cruz-Contreras\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to articulate its reasoning is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>We do not consider Cruz-Contreras\u2019s contentions raised for the first time in the opening brief, as those were not exhausted before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Cruz-Contreras\u2019s renewed request for a stay of removal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
