We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Alvarado-Alvarado\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to show that personal service of his Order to Show Cause containing his hearing information was insufficient to provide him with notice of that hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (repealed 1996). Additional notice provisions relevant to juveniles do not apply to Alvarado-Alvarado because he was not under eighteen years of age at the time the order was served. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(1993); <em>see also Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1150, 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Alvarado-Alvarado\u2019s contention that the Order to Show Cause was invalidated by his lack of address because he did not raise that issue to the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We do not consider Alvarado-Alvarado\u2019s remaining contentions because the denial of his motion to reopen is dispositive on all forms of relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
