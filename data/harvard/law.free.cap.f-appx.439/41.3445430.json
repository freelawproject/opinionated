In <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>the United States Supreme Court made \u201cclear that the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d 551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Therefore, this Court is \u201cobliged to examine the question <em>sua sponte.\u201d Travelers Ins. Co. v. Carpenter, </em>411 F.3d 323, 328 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">District courts, not the courts of appeals, have the authority to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, if certain statutory conditions are met. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)-(6); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(1) (\u201c[T]he court [of appeals] may not extend the time to file ... a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4).\u201d). Pursuant to Rule 4(a)(5) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A). A Rule 4(a)(5) motion to extend must be filed within the 30-day grace period immediately following the original 30-day appeal period, or the district court is without power to grant an extension. <em>See Cohen v. Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>142 F.3d 116, 118-19 (2d Cir.1998) <em>(per curiam). </em>The district court may also reopen the time to file a notice of appeal for a period of 14 days if: (1) the moving party was entitled to a notice of the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d), but did not receive notice within 21 days after judgment was entered; (2) the motion is filed within 180 days after entry of judgment or within 14 days after the moving party receives notice, whichever is earlier; and (3) no party would be prejudiced. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(A)-(C). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant an extension of time to file under Rule 4(a)(5) or reopen the time to file under Rule 4(a)(6) for abuse of discretion. <em>See Goode v. Winkler, </em>252 F.3d 242, 245 (2d Cir.2001) (extension motion); <em>Avolio v. County of Suffolk, </em>29 F.3d 50, 52 (2d Cir.1994) (motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Here, the district court\u2019s judgment was entered on June 11, 2010, and Millhouse did not file his notice of appeal until September 20, 2010-70 days after Rule 4(a)(1)\u2019s 30-day period for filing a timely notice of appeal expired on July 12, 2010. Although Millhouse filed two documents in the district court during the period between the entry of judgment and the filing of the notice of appeal, the first of these documents was not filed until August 8, 2010, and therefore even if it could be construed as a notice of appeal, it too would be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Additionally, a liberal reading of these two documents reveals that the district court properly exercised its discretion in declining to construe them as motions seeking to extend or reopen the time to file a notice of appeal. The first document, which was filed within Rule 4(a)(5)\u2019s 30-day grace period to extend the time to file a notice of appeal, contained no reference to an appeal, an extension of time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>file, any district court order, the district court\u2019s judgment, or even to Millhouse\u2019s complaint in general. The second document, filed after Rule 4(a)(5)\u2019s 30-day grace period expired, failed to state any facts that would entitle Millhouse to relief under Rule 4(a)(6) and, most importantly, did not allege that he never received the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See, e.g., Goode, 252 </em>F.3d at 245 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Accordingly, because the notice of appeal was untimely filed, this appeal must be, and therefore is, DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. The Appellees were not served below, and although they have appeared in the instant appeal, they have not filed a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
