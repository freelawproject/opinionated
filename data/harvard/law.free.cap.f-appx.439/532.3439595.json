The IJ denied Roblero-Berduo\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). For the reasons stated below, Roblero-Berduo\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Petitioner was born in Guatemala in 1980. Roblero-Berduo traveled to the United States in 1999, at the age of eighteen. He left Guatemala around May 2 of that year, arriving in Phoenix, Arizona, roughly ten or fifteen days later. His parents and two brothers remain in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">In July 2006, Petitioner was served with a Notice to Appear before an IJ in Detroit, Michigan. At a hearing before the IJ, Petitioner admitted most of the allegations in the Notice, claimed to have entered the United States on May 2, 1999, and conceded his removability. Roblero-Berduo requested withholding of removal as a refugee and CAT withholding. Though he initially acknowledged that he was time-barred from seeking asylum, Roblero-Berduo later argued that changed country conditions in Guatemala excused his failure to request asylum within the one-year statutory limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">Petitioner is an avowed Evangelical Christian, as are several members of his family. When Roblero-Berduo was twelve years old, Roblero-Berduo, his father, and his brother were leaving church. Between ten and fifteen guerrillas surrounded Roblero-Berduo\u2019s father and accused him of converting several guerrillas to Christianity. The guerrillas then kidnapped Roblero-Berduo\u2019s father, beat him, and held him for a day. Largely on account of that incident, Roblero-Berduo fears that guerrillas will persecute him on the basis of his faith if he returns to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">At the hearing in front of the IJ, Petitioner offered other evidence of persecution against Evangelical Christians in Guatemala. Roblero-Berduo produced a newspaper article describing an Evangelical Christian couple that was kidnapped, tortured, and killed after leaving a religious retreat on an unspecified date. Roblero-Berduo also testified that guerrillas have beaten his siblings on account of their church activities since he left Guatemala. His asylum application did not refer to his siblings specifically but stated, \u201cI would be subject to torture as many others in my family have been.... \u201d (A.R.260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">Gang members also killed Roblero-Berduo\u2019s cousin, Armando. Armando worked as a bus driver at the time of the incident, and the gang members killed Armando because he refused to surrender the money he had collected from passengers. The IJ cast doubt on whether Armando\u2019s murder was in any part motivated by religious persecution, reasoning that Roblero-Berduo had not produced any evidence suggesting that motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The IJ found Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony regarding his father\u2019s kidnapping credible, but, in other respects, the IJ assigned Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony negative credibility. For example, on his asylum application, Roblero-Berduo stated that he lived in Los Angeles from 2001 through 2005, after which he moved to Detroit. In his 2007 testimony, Roblero-Berduo asserted that he had been attending a church in Detroit for nine years. When the IJ asked him to explain the discrepancy between these statements, Roblero-Berduo explained that he attended church in Detroit while living in California. The IJ also noted Roblero-Berduo\u2019s failure to provide evidence regarding his relationship with his cousin, Armando, and evidence in support of his claim that guerillas beat his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The IJ denied all three of Roblero-Berduo\u2019s applications, and the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Roblero-Berduo timely petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decision to this Court, which has authority to review a BIA decision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Roblero-Berduo challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his asylum application, arguing that the IJ and the BIA should have concluded that changed country conditions allowed Petitioner to apply for asylum beyond the one-year statute of limitations. Respondent contends that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to undertake such a review, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Lacey v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 514, 518 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Bauer v. RBX Indus., Inc., </em>368 F.3d 569, 578 (6th Cir.2004)). The party invoking jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>Charvat v. EchoStar Satellite, LLC, </em>630 F.3d 459, 462 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may grant asylum to an alien who has \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d in his country of nationality or residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), 1101(a)(42)(A). An alien must apply for asylum within one year after the date of his arrival in the United States. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The Attorney General may consider an application filed beyond the limitations period if the alien demonstrates \u201cthe existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum.\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Section 1158(a)(3) prohibits a court from reviewing \u201cany determination of the Attorney General\u201d related to an asylum application\u2019s timeliness or an alien\u2019s showing of changed circumstances. Before Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) with the Real ID Act of 1995, this Court held that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) prohibited judicial review of any denial of asylum, where the IJ has found that an application was untimely and changed circumstances did not extend the application deadline. <em>See Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003). The Real ID Act did not alter \u00a7 1158(a)(3), but it recognized a court of appeals\u2019 continuing jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims [and] questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). In <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743 (6th Cir.2006), this Court modified the holding of <em>Castellano-Chacon </em>\u201cto bar our review of asylum applications denied for untimeliness only when the appeal seeks review of discretionary or factual questions.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748. The BIA\u2019s conclusion in this case that changed country conditions did not excuse Roblero-Berduo\u2019s untimely asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>application is a factual question that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) and <em>Almuhtaseb </em>prohibit us from reaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Petitioner attempts to refashion the issue, arguing that he seeks review of a question of law rather than a question of fact. According to Petitioner, the BIA applied the incorrect standard in determining whether changed circumstances justified his late application. Petitioner points out that governing regulations define \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) as \u201cincluding], but not limited to: (A) [cjhanges in conditions of the applicant\u2019s\u201d resident nation, \u201c(B) [cjhanges in the applicant\u2019s circumstances that materially affect [his] eligibility for asylum,\u201d and \u201c(C) [i]n the case of an [applicant] who had previously been included as a dependent\u201d on an asylum application, a change in the relationship making him a dependent. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(i) (subdivisions in original). Emphasizing the phrase \u201cinclude, but ... not limited to,\u201d Petitioner argues that the BIA erred by failing to consider the \u201ctotality of the changed circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is unconvincing. He does not argue that the IJ or BIA omitted specific changed circumstances from their consideration. Rather, he recites the evidence he submitted and suggests the IJ and BIA should have arrived at a different conclusion. No matter how Roblero-Berduo describes his line of argument, it plainly contests factual determinations that we may not revisit. <em>See Almuhtaseb, </em>453 F.3d at 748. Therefore, we dismiss this portion of the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">II. Withholding of Removal Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">A. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Roblero-Berduo applied for withholding of removal under INA and the CAT. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18. Where the BIA issues a decision, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision and any portions of the IJ\u2019s ruling incorporated in that decision as the final agency order regarding the petitioner\u2019s removal. <em>Zhao v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 238, 246 (6th Cir.2009). The Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision while considering additional comments from the BIA. <em>Mapouya v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 396, 405 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">An applicant is eligible for withholding of removal if, upon removal to his nation of residence, his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The applicant must prove that he is more likely than not to suffer persecution on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). In order to demonstrate a likelihood of persecution, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents\u201d of \u201cphysical punishment, infliction of harm, or ... significant deprivation^] of liberty\u201d on a protected ground. <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 390 (6th Cir.1998). The persecution must be directed to persons who \u201cdiffer (in race, religion, or political opinion) in a way that is regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389 (quoting <em>Surita v. INS, </em>95 F.3d 814, 819 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">Additionally, an applicant may be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT if he proves that, upon removal to his nation of residence, he is likely to be tortured. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). In pertinent part, the applicable regulation defines torture as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person\u201d for certain purposes, such as intimidation, punishment, or discrimination. 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). A CAT applicant must establish a \u201cparticularized threat of torture.\u201d <em>Castellano-Chacon, </em>341 F.3d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The applicant\u2019s testimony can carry the his burden without corroboration if it is credible. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) &amp; (c)(2). The Court reviews an IJ\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Zhao, </em>569 F.3d at 246. We must uphold the IJ\u2019s factual determination \u201cas long as it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The Court may only reverse a fact determination if a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Though an IJ\u2019s credibility determination is entitled to substantial deference, the adverse credibility finding must be supported by specific reasons and must be based on an inconsistency that \u201cgo[es] to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 926 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The BIA\u2019s order denying withholding of removal must be upheld unless it is \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and represents an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 596 (6th Cir.2001) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) and (D)). In order to obtain a reversal, a petitioner must demonstrate that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA, rather than that the evidence merely supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 702-03 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">B. IJ\u2019s Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Roblero-Berduo challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that part of his testimony lacked credibility. In her opinion denying Petitioner\u2019s applications, the IJ explicitly assigned positive credibility to Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony as a whole. Specifically, the IJ found Roblero-Berduo\u2019s account of his father\u2019s kidnapping \u2014 the incident she considered central to his applications\u2014 credible. However, the IJ found other areas of Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony incredible. Those areas included Roblero-Berduo\u2019s contention that his siblings suffered religious persecution, which he offered late on cross-examination and which the IJ found lacking in support elsewhere in the record; the motivation ascribed to the murder of his cousin; and his assertion that he attended church in Detroit while living in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The reservations the IJ expressed about Petitioner\u2019s testimony played no part in the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm. The BIA reasoned that the documentary evidence and the fact that Petitioner\u2019s family has remained in Guatemala since 1992 controverted Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was likely to suffer religious persecution if removed. By omitting any reference to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, the BIA signaled that it would have reached the same result even if the IJ had rated Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony as entirely credible. Since Roblero-Berduo\u2019s credibility did not affect the Board\u2019s decision, and because the IJ rated the most crucial portion of Petitioner\u2019s testimony as positive, Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility decision does not determine the disposition of his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>C. Immigration and Nationality Act</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Roblero-Berduo mounts two challenges to the conclusion that he failed to demonstrate a likelihood of persecution upon his removal to Guatemala. First, Roblero-Berduo argues that the IJ and BIA overlooked substantial evidence of the steady increase in Guatamela\u2019s crime rate and the converse deterioration of the civil authorities\u2019 ability to limit gang violence. Roblero-Berduo provided the IJ with significant documentary evidence of the violence in Guatemala and the inexperience and corruption that prevent the police from countering gang violence. On the basis of this evidence, Roblero-Berduo contends that the IJ and BIA should have concluded he is likely to suffer religious persecution in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">This Court has explained that an applicant seeking withholding of removal must demonstrate that he is at particular risk of persecution. <em>Almuhtaseb, </em>453 F.3d at 750 (citing <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998)). A general or random possibility of persecution in the proposed country of removal typically does not support withholding. <em>Castellano-Chacon, </em>341 F.3d at 550; <em>Almuhtaseb, </em>453 F.3d at 750. Rather, an applicant must demonstrate a likelihood of persecution \u201con account of\u2019 religion or another protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). Roblero-Berduo\u2019s evidence of Guatemala\u2019s gang violence supports the proposition that he is at risk of violence, but it does not support the proposition that he is at risk of violence \u201con account of\u2019 his religion. <em>Id. </em>We disagree with Petitioner\u2019s contention that the aforementioned evidence compelled a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Second, Roblero-Berduo argues the IJ and BIA assigned too little weight to the evidence of religious persecution his family has suffered. We disagree. The IJ and Board offered sound reasons for declining to treat Petitioner\u2019s father\u2019s kidnapping as dispositive. The BIA and IJ relied on the fact that, even after his father\u2019s kidnapping, many members of Roblero-Berduo\u2019s family have remained in Guatemala since 1992. Furthermore, Roblero-Berduo\u2019s father continues to evangelize door-to-door. As this Court has previously reasoned, the fact that similarly-situated family members remain in the proposed country of removal cuts against the conclusion that a petitioner is likely to suffer religious persecution upon removal. <em>See Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 488 (6th Cir.2001). The fact that Roblero-Berduo\u2019s family members continue to practice their religion in Guatemala, along with Roblero-Berduo\u2019s failure to provide other reliable evidence of the persecution of Evangelical Christians in Guatemala, requires this Court to affirm the order of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">D. Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">It is unclear from Petitioner\u2019s brief whether he challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for CAT withholding on appeal. Assuming he does, we deny Roblero-Berduo\u2019s petition. The Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Roblero-Berduo\u2019s CAT application on the same basis it affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of his withholding of removal claim. It specifically cited the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner\u2019s family has remained in Guatemala since 1992 without incident and Petitioner\u2019s failure to offer evidence that Evangelical Christians are tortured in Guatemala. On appeal, Roblero-Berduo has failed to demonstrate that the evidence of record compels the contrary conclusion. <em>See Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 702-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>03. Therefore, we deny the petition for review on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS in part and DENY in part Roblero-Berduo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. In any event, we would have rejected Petitioner's challenge. The most significant portion of Roblero-Berduo\u2019s testimony that the IJ dismissed as incredible regarded the motive for his cousin's murder. Roblero-Berduo failed rebut the IJ's suggestion that the murder stemmed from a robbery rather than from religious persecution. Because of Roblero-Berduo's vagueness in describing the circumstances of his cousin\u2019s murder, the IJ did not treat that portion of the testimony as evidence of a threat to Petitioner's safety as an Evan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>gelical Christian. The IJ cited specific reasons for discounting Roblero-Berduo\u2019s credibility on this point, and we find no evidence compelling us to conclude that the determination was incorrect. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
