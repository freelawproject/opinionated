The parties stipulated in the plea agreement to a sixty-month term of imprisonment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), and the district court sentenced Brown to the stipulated term. Brown timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">On appeal, Brown\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues, but questioning whether the district court complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in accepting Brown\u2019s guilty plea and the reasonableness of Brown\u2019s sentence. Brown has filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government has elected not to file a response brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">Because Brown did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Brown] must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir.2007). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court substantially complied with Rule 11 and that Brown\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We therefore affirm Brown\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">With regard to Brown\u2019s sentence, we do not have jurisdiction over this portion of the appeal. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2006), a defendant\u2019s appeal of a sentence to which he stipulated in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is limited to circumstances where his \u201csentence was imposed in violation of law [or] was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>146 F.3d 796, 797 (10th Cir.1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ted); <em>see United States v. Littlefield, </em>105 F.3d 527, 527-28 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Here, Brown\u2019s sentence was not imposed in violation of law, as his sixty-month sentence is well-within the maximum sentence of forty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Additionally, Brown\u2019s sentence is not the result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, because a sentence imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is contractual and not based on the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Cieslowski, </em>410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Littlefield, </em>105 F.3d at 528. Because \u00a7 3742(c) bars review of a sentence imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement and none of the exceptions apply, we dismiss the appeal of Brown\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and Brown\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. Further, we deny Brown\u2019s motion to relieve his appellate attorney. This court requires that counsel inform Brown, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Brown requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Brown. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
