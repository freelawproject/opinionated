The record does not compel the conclusion that Salamanca was persecuted or feared persecution on account of a protected ground. Salamanca\u2019s asylum claim was pretermitted as untimely, and his withholding claim fails because petitioner failed to establish any nexus between the claimed persecution and a protected ground for purposes of withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Salamanca\u2019s claim raised for the first time on appeal, that his family constituted a social group, because petitioner failed to administratively exhaust the claim. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
