The matter was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who directed the District Attorney of Lancaster County to respond to the petition. Meanwhile, Young requested that the District Court furnish him with \u201cthe court docket and documents.\u201d A Deputy Clerk informed Young that there was a 30-cent fee for the information he requested, that the records could not be sent until the fee was received, and that the documents could not be provided free of charge without a specific order from the judge. Young now asks us to direct the District Court Clerk to provide him with copies of the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ments he seeks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Issuance of a writ of mandamus is an appropriate remedy in extraordinary circumstances only. <em>See Sporck v. Peil, </em>759 F.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir.1985). Its main purpose is \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943). To justify the Court\u2019s use of this remedy, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthere are no other adequate means of relief and the right to the writ is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>First Jersey Sec., Inc. v. Bergen, </em>605 F.2d 690, 700 (3d Cir.1979). Young\u2019s petition does not meet these requirements. Indeed, he can obtain the requested documents by paying the requisite fee. <em>See </em>Electronic Public Access Fee Schedule (reprinted with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914). Nevertheless, as a courtesy in this instance, the Clerk of this Court is hereby directed to provide to Young, without charge, one (1) copy of the District Court docket report.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Young\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. Other than the \"docket statement,\u201d which we believe refers to the District Court docket report, Young has not identified the court documents that he wants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
