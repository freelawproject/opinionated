In each robbery he handed a bank teller a note demanding money and stating that he was armed with a gun. He pleaded guilty to five counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and agreed to a broad waiver of his appellate rights, including his right to challenge his sentence. The district court sentenced Lee on each count to 115 months \u2014 the top of the guidelines range\u2014 to be served concurrently. Lee filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel contends that the appeal is frivolous and seeks permission to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Lee did not respond to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See </em>CIR. R. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Lee has told his counsel that he does not want to have his guilty pleas vacated. Counsel therefore properly refrains from discussing the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the pleas. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Counsel does consider whether Lee could challenge his sentence, but concludes that doing so would be frivolous in light of the broad appeal waiver included in his plea agreement. Lee expressly waived his right to challenge a within-guidelines sentence in that agreement. An appeal waiver stands or falls with the guilty plea, <em>United States v. Quintero, </em>618 F.3d 746, 752 (7th Cir.2010), and therefore any challenge to Lee\u2019s sentence would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
