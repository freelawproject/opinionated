The district court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cWhether an appeal is moot is a jurisdictional matter, since it implicates the Article III requirement that there be a live case or controversy.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">According to the BOP website, Purviance was released from prison on July 15, 2011, and his prison sentence can therefore no longer be shortened. <em>Cf. United States v. Booker, </em>645 F.3d 328 (5th Cir.2011) (relying on the prison release date shown on the BOP website to find that the appellant\u2019s claim was moot). Although a district court may alter a petitioner\u2019s period of supervised release in an appropriate case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1) or (2), <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000), the district court in this case lacks jurisdiction to grant such relief with respect to Purviance\u2019s 25-year term of supervised release. The sentencing court has jurisdiction over that issue, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3583(e), and Purviance was sentenced in another district. A sentencing court can transfer such jurisdiction to another district court, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605, but no transfer occurred in this case. Therefore, there is no possibility that the district court may alter Purviance\u2019s period supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e), <em>see Johnson v. Pettiford, </em>442 F.3d 917, 918 (5th Cir.2006), and we dismiss this appeal as moot. We likewise deny all pending motions as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
