Garay argues that his sentence below the advisory guideline range is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse a sentence as substantively unreasonable only if, after considering the totality of the circumstances, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">Garay\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The eight-level enhancement of Garay\u2019s sentence rationally deters those who seek to reenter the United States illegally after having committed several crimes. Garay entered the United States illegally three times and has 11 prior convictions, including a burglary conviction. The district court reasonably determined that, in the light of Garay\u2019s criminal history, a sentence of 21 months promotes deterrence, protection of the public, and respect for the law, and it reflects the seriousness of Garay\u2019s offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Ga-ray\u2019s sentence is below the advisory guideline sentence of 24 months. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
