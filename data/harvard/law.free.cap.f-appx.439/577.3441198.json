We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cui v. Mukasey, </em>588 F.3d 1289, 1290 (9th Cir.2008), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying a continuance on the ground that Mohamed did not demonstrate good cause. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (an IJ may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown); <em>see also Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1247 (IJ did not abuse discretion in denying a continuance where alien had no approved visa petition and no relief was immediately available).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">The IJ also did not abuse his discretion by denying Mohamed\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture because Mohamed did not establish good cause for failing to provide his fingerprints as ordered, and the IJ warned him that failure to comply would result in the denial of his applications. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.10; <em>cf. Cui, </em>538 F.3d at 1293-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
