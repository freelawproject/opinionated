Jones claimed that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when police officers entered a residence without a warrant and searched his person. Jones was arrested following discovery of a handgun in his pants, and he was subsequently convicted of being a convicted felon illegally in possession of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">The district court denied Jones\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith based on its determination that Jones\u2019s claims were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). By moving for IFP status, Jones is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into Jones\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-21\">Jones contends that the district court erred in applying <em>Heck </em>to bar his claims; he also asserts that it was error to dismiss his claims with prejudice as frivolous. He argues generally that, given the independent source and inevitable discovery doctrines, a Fourth Amendment violation does not necessarily impugn the validity of a conviction. However, Jones does not explain how such doctrines apply to the facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">Jones has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his claims were barred by <em>Heck. See Hudson v. Hughes, </em>98 F.3d 868, 872-73 (5th Cir.1996). He has also failed to show that the district court erred in dismissing his <em>Heck-barred </em>claims with prejudice as frivolous. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 283-84 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s complaint as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
