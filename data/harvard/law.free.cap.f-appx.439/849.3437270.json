Appellants filed separate suits in the district court against several court-reporting firms alleging that their billing practices violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cFDUTPA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.201, and unjustly enriched the firms. After having had the benefit of oral argument and after thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We review a district court\u2019s class certification order only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Fitzpatrick v. Gen. Mills, Inc., </em>635 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2011). \u201c[A]n abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Birmingham Steel Corp. v. TVA, </em>353 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). \u201cIt is irrelevant whether this Court would have granted [class] certification.\u201d <em>Babineau v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>576 F.3d 1183, 1189 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cAs long as the district court\u2019s reasoning stays within the parameters of Rule 23\u2019s requirement for certification of a class, the district court decision will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>635 F.3d at 1282 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Rule 23(b)(3) requires that common questions of law and fact predominate over issues affecting only individual members. Rule 23(b)(3) also requires that a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudicating the controversy. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 motions for class certification. The district court discussed the difficulties associated with identifying class members who fit Appellants\u2019 proposed class definition. In analyzing whether common questions of fact and law predominate, the district court correctly noted that FDUTPA does not require individualized proof of subjective reliance. <em>See Fitzpatrick, </em>635 F.3d at 1283 (explaining that a plaintiff asserting a FDUTPA claim \u201cneed not show actual reliance on the representation or omission at issue\u201d). The court highlighted, however, how differences in the circumstances under which putative class members purchased transcripts from the court-reporting firms create many individualized factual and legal issues with respect to the FDUTPA claim. Further, this Court has noted that \u201ccommon questions will rarely, if ever, predominate\u201d in an unjust enrichment claim. <em>See Vega v. T-Mobile, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1256, 1274 (11th Cir.2009). In light of the individualized questions of fact and law and manageability concerns, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
