Bennett\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to address his request for a below-Guidelines sentence because of his ailing health. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Because Bennett requested a sentence below his Guidelines range, his claim was properly preserved, and this court reviews it for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard, reversing \u201cunless ... the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 576, 578 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201cBy drawing arguments from \u00a7 3553 for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed, an aggrieved party sufficiently alerts the district court of its responsibility to render an individualized explanation addressing those arguments, and thus preserves its claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court must first assess whether the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 576 (\u201c[A]n individualized explanation must accompany <em>every </em>sentence.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (holding that the \u201cindividualized assessment ... must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and [be] adequate to permit meaningful appellate review\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAlthough a court need not necessarily issue a comprehensive, detailed opinion, the court\u2019s explanation must nonetheless be sufficient \u2018to satisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The district court\u2019s explanation \u201cneed not be elaborate or lengthy!,]\u201d however. <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330. \u201cThat is especially true where, as here, the sentence is inside the advisory guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 639 (4th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2128, 176 L.Ed.2d 749 (2010). As this court has noted: <em>\u201cGall </em>was quite explicit that district courts should provide more significant justifications for major departures than for minor ones. But when a district court does not depart or vary at all, it may provide a less extensive, while still individualized, explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations, quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">If there is no procedural error, we may then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Morace, </em>594 F.3d 340, 346 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">We reject Bennett\u2019s argument that his sentence should be vacated because the district court did not explain why it rejected his health-related argument. This court may look to the entirety of Bennett\u2019s sentencing proceeding to determine whether the district court understood Bennett\u2019s argument for a reduced sentence but had reasons for rejecting that argument. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 344-45, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Unlike in <em>Lynn, </em>it is apparent from the record that the district court considered counsel\u2019s argument for a below-Guidelines sentence, stated that it was adopting the presentence investigation report\u2019s (\u201cPSR\u201d) findings as its rationale for Bennett\u2019s sentence, and discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it believed justified Bennett\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>603 F.3d 267, 272 (4th Cir.2010) (finding no procedural error where the district court adopted the PSR, heard counsels\u2019 argument and the defendant\u2019s allocution, stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that a Guidelines sentence satisfied those factors, and imposed the sentence requested by the defendant, while explicitly recognizing that the last criterion was not dispositive of its affirmance); <em>cf. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 584-85 (finding reversible error where the district court gave \u201cno indication that [it] considered the defendant\u2019s nonfrivolous arguments prior to sentencing him\u201d and stated only that it found Lynn\u2019s sentence to be \u201cfair and appropriate and consistent with the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d before imposing Lynn\u2019s sentence) (internal ellipses and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Although, admittedly, it would have been preferable for the district court to have specifically mentioned Bennett\u2019s health when it explained how it believed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified the sentence imposed, the district court explicitly acknowledged that it was aware of Bennett\u2019s ailing health before imposing sentence and indicated that it was recommending a particular correctional institution \u201cbecause of its medical facilities!.]\u201d Thus, the record makes clear that the district fashioning its sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">We find that the district court\u2019s analysis as to why it believed the 120-month sentence was justified under \u00a7 3553(a) allows this court to conduct \u201cmeaningful appellate review\u201d and \u201cpromotefs] the perception of fair sentencing!,]\u201d and that its reasoning for Bennett\u2019s sentence was sufficiently individualized and reflected a considered ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tionale. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Thus, because the sentencing transcript makes clear that the district court considered counsel\u2019s arguments for a below-Guidelines sentence but had a \u201creasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority,\u201d <em>United States v. Engle, </em>592 F.3d 495, 500 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 165, 178 L.Ed.2d 41 (2010), we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
