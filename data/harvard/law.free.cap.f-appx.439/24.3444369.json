ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">Petitioner Clyde Staubley seeks review of the Board\u2019s decision affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s award of benefits under the LHWCA for a ten percent permanent impairment of his lungs commencing on January 31, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by not taking judicial notice of the American Medical Association\u2019s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (the \u201cGuides\u201d) in evaluating his claim for benefits and by finding that his impairment became permanent in January 2008 rather than at the time of his retirement. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Under the LHWCA, an ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are binding on the Board if supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, <em>see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>921(b)(3), and we review the Board\u2019s decision for adherence to that standard, see <em>Rasmussen v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., Elec. Boat Div., </em>993 F.2d 1014, 1015-16 (2d Cir.1993); see <em>also Pietrunti v. Dir., Ofice of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>119 F.3d 1035, 1040 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cIf the decision of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence, is not irrational, and is in accordance with the law, the decision must be affirmed.\u201d). Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a factual conclusion.\u201d <em>New Haven Terminal Corp. v. Lake, </em>337 F.3d 261, 265 (2d Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>any errors of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We agree with the Board that the ALJ most likely erred by not taking judicial notice of the Guides. Because the LHWCA requires that a claimant\u2019s permanent impairment be determined \u201cunder the [Gjuides,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(10), it stands to reason that an ALJ can rely on the Guides without the parties specifically introducing them into the record. That said, we also agree with the Board that under the circumstances of this case, the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Staubley identifies two consequences of this error which he alleges warrant reversal. First, he asserts that had the ALJ consulted the Guides, she would have found they were consistent with Dr. Martin Cherniack\u2019s determination that Staubley suffered from a five-percent \u201cpermanent defect\u201d in 1992. Thus, he argues, she would not have refused to credit Cherniack\u2019s determination because he did not rely on the Guides in rendering this opinion. That Cherniack failed to apply the Guides was not the only reason, however, that the ALJ did not credit his assessment of a five-percent defect. She found, in addition, that Cherniack\u2019s evaluation lacked evidentiary support because Cherniack relied exclusively on the fact that Staubley\u2019s lungs showed evidence of pleural plaques, which the ALJ noted did not establish a pulmonary impairment. This finding is well supported. Drs. Stephen Matarese, Michael Teiger, and Milo Pulde all confirmed that while pleural plaques do typically indicate past exposure to asbestos, they do not evidence impairment. Indeed, Matarese \u2014 Staubley\u2019s treating physician and expert witness\u2014 testified explicitly that Staubley\u2019s pleural plaques were \u201cbenign.\u201d Therefore, because pleural plaques are not evidence of impairment and because Cherniack relied solely on those plaques to support his finding of a five-percent defect, the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit Cherniack\u2019s medical opinion is supported by substantial evidence, regardless of her failure to take judicial notice of the Guides.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Second, Staubley argues that if the ALJ had taken judicial notice of the Guides, she would have discovered that the variability shown in Matarese\u2019s and Teiger\u2019s predicted values for Staubley\u2019s diffusion capacity was based on the physicians\u2019 use of different standards to calculate those values. He maintains that had the ALJ applied the Guides to the raw data from his pulmonary function tests, she would have realized that his diffusion capacity steadily diminished over time. We reject this argument. Our review of the ALJ\u2019s decision confirms that she was well aware that the predicted values recorded by Matarese and Teiger varied because the physicians used different standards. And to account for this variation, the ALJ specifically limited her findings to Matarese\u2019s pulmonary function test results, since Matarese used the same predicted value standard in all of his tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Additionally, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Staubley\u2019s impairment became permanent in January 2008 is supported by substantial evidence. Voluntary retirees like Staubley are entitled to disability benefits under the LHWCA for any \u201cpermanent impairment\u201d as defined under the Guides. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902(10), 908(c)(23), 910(d)(1)-(2); <em>Rajotte v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>18 BRBS 85 (1986) (\u201cUnder the Act ..., when a[n] employee voluntarily retires and his disease becomes manifest subsequent to his retirement, recovery is limited to permanent partial disability based on the extent of claimant\u2019s impairment [under the Guides].\u201d). \u201cThe onset date of such disability award[ ] ... [is] the date when claimant\u2019s impairment became permanent.\u201d <em>Barlow v. W. Asbestos Co. &amp; State Comp. Fund., </em>20 BRBS 179, 182-83 (1988). Permanency can be shown in two ways: (1) when the claimant reaches \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d as demonstrated by the medical evidence; or (2) when the claimant\u2019s disability \u201chas continued for a lengthy period, and it appears to be of lasting or indefinite duration, as distinguished from one in which recovery merely awaits a normal healing period.\u201d <em>Eckley v. Fibrex &amp; Shipping Co., </em>21 BRBS 120, 122-23 (1988) (quoting <em>Watson v. Gulf Stevedore Corp., </em>400 F.2d 649, 654 (5th Cir.1968)); <em>accord Pittsburgh &amp; Conneaut Dock Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>473 F.3d 253, 259 (6th Cir.2007) (discussing these two tests).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Here, the ALJ found that Staubley reached maximum medical improvement in January 2008 and that his impairment was permanent at that time. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Matarese testified at his deposition in May 2008 that Staubley was \u201cat maximum medical improvement right now,\u201d a finding consistent with Staubley\u2019s pulmonary function test results. Matarese noted also that even as of January 2008, Staubley remained essentially \u201casymptomatic,\u201d a diagnosis confirmed by Teiger and Pulde. Staubley does not challenge these facts. Instead, he relies on Cherniack\u2019s 1991 evaluation which showed that Staubley\u2019s lungs contained pleural plaques and asserts that this confirms that he had a permanent impairment at the time he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tired. We disagree. As already discussed, evidence of pleural plaques does not demonstrate impairment. Substantial evidence thus supports the ALJ\u2019s permanency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We have considered all of Staubley\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is thus DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A6\">. Staubley also petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. However, because he does not separately address that order in his brief on appeal, we deem any challenge to that decision forfeited. <em>See Norton v. Sam's Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (\"Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">. Staubley also appears to argue that the ALJ should have independently determined under the Guides whether the raw data from Cherniack's 1991 pulmonary function test showed that Staubley\u2019s diffusion capacity was abnormal. We reject this argument. Although an ALJ should reach a reasoned judgment based on the evidence presented and need not defer to any particular medical opinion or theory, <em>see McLaughlin v. Sec\u2019y of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>612 F.2d 701, 705 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Marcus v. Califano, </em>615 F.2d 23, 27 (2d Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1979), the AU \"cannot arbitrarily substitute h[er] own judgment for competent medical evidence,\u201d <em>McBrayer v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>712 F.2d 795, 799 (2d Cir.1983). Here, Chemiack, an experienced pulmonary specialist, concluded that based on his evaluation of the 1991 pulmonary function test results, Staubley\u2019s diffusion capacity was normal. Staubley would have the ALJ contradict this finding and render an independent medical opinion based on Cherniack's raw recorded data. This is not permitted. <em>See id. </em>(\"While an administrative judge is free to resolve issues of credibility as to lay testimony or to choose between properly submitted opinions, he is not free to set his own expertise against that of a physician who testified before him.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
