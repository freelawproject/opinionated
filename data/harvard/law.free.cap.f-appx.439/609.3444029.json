We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal because petitioners failed to show that the kidnaping and threats experienced by Blanco-Rodriguez were motivated on account of a protected ground rather than by personal retribution. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cpurely personal retribution is, of course, not persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground); <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997) (a petitioner cannot establish a nexus to a protected ground by inference \u201cunless the inference is one that is clearly to be drawn from the facts in evidence\u201d). In the absence of a nexus to a protected ground, petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>Soriano v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners failed to establish it is more likely than not that they will be tortured on return to Colombia. <em>See Soriano v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
