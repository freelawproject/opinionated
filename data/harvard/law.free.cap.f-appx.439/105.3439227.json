For the reasons that follow, we will deny the mandamus petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in the most extraordinary of circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A mandamus petitioner must establish that he has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain the requested relief, and that he has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As a general rule, the manner in which a court disposes of cases on its docket is within its discretion. <em>See In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982). Indeed, given the discretionary nature of docket management, there .can be no \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to have the district court handle a case on its docket in a certain manner. <em>See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 36, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Nonetheless, mandamus may be warranted where a district court\u2019s delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">This case, however, does not present such a situation. Cooley filed his federal habeas petition in February 2010. Through March 2011, the District Court has routinely exercised jurisdiction by ruling on various motions. The subsequent four-month delay in the disposition of Cooley\u2019s habeas petition \u201cdoes not yet rise to the level of a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In light of Cooley\u2019s short sentence, we are confident that the District Court will rule on the matter expediently. Accordingly, we will deny Cooley\u2019s mandamus petition without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
