We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">The failure of a party to renew its preverdict Fed.R.Civ.P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 50(a) motion through a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion leaves this court powerless to review the district court\u2019s ruling: \u201cThe Supreme Court has held time and again that a party\u2019s failure to file a post-verdict motion under Rule 50(b) leaves an appellate court without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\u201d <em>A Helping Hand, LLC v. Baltimore County, Md., </em>515 F.3d 356, 369 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c[A]n appellate court lacks the power even to order a new trial if a party has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion following a jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370. Baltimore County failed to renew its motions post-verdict through Rule 50(b). Thus, it raises no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>issue renewable on appeal as to the jury\u2019s finding of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of the County\u2019s motion seeking remittitur for abuse of discretion. <em>Sloane v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, </em>510 F.3d 495, 502 (4th Cir.2007). In denying a motion for remittitur, \u201c[a] district court abuses its discretion only by upholding an award of damages when the jury\u2019s verdict is against the weight of the evidence or based on evidence which is false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">A compensatory damage award \u201cmust be proportional to the actual injury incurred\u201d and \u201cfocus on the real injury sustained.\u201d <em>Hetzel v. County of Prince William, </em>89 F.3d 169, 173 (4th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A jury\u2019s damage award should stand \u201cunless it is grossly excessive or shocking to the conscience.\u201d <em>Fox v. General Motors Corp., </em>247 F.3d 169, 180 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u201cCourts defer to a jury\u2019s award of damages for intangible harms, such as emotional distress, because the harm is subjective and evaluating it depends considerably on the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>247 F.3d at 180 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But \u201c[a] plaintiff seeking compensatory damages for emotional injuries cannot rely on conclusory statements that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress or the mere fact that a constitutional violation occurred, but, rather, the testimony must establish that the plaintiff suffered demonstrable emotional distress, which must be sufficiently articulated.\u201d <em>Knussman v. Maryland, </em>272 F.3d 625, 640 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the County\u2019s motion for remittitur.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-21\"> Like the district court, we presume that the jury followed the instruction commanding it to exclude any litigation-induced emotional distress from its damages calculation. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 631 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
