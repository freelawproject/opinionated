Kotlyarsky argues, for the first time, that his plea of guilty is invalid because he was misinformed about the length of his supervised release, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(H)-(I). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">Any error did not prejudice Kotlyarsky\u2019s substantial rights. Although the district court failed to inform Kotlyarsky about a minimum term of six years of supervised release, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), Kotlyarsky knew from his plea agreement, change of plea hearing, and presentence investigation report that he faced a term of \u201cat least\u201d three years of supervised release, <em>see United States v. Bejarano, </em>249 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.2001). Kotlyarsky failed either to object when the district court sentenced him below the statutory minimum term to five years of supervised release, <em>see id. </em>at 1306 n. 1, or to move timely to withdraw his plea of guilty, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>United States v. Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir.2009). Furthermore, Kotlyarsky does not argue that, \u201cbut for the error, he would not have entered [his] plea\u201d of guilty. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We AFFIRM Kotlyarsky\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
