We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We review district court orders granting motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) <em>de novo. Jasinski v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 184 (2d Cir.2003). When reviewing determinations made by the Commissioner, we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record. <em>See Burgess v. Astrue, </em>537 F.3d 117, 128 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 500-501 (2d Cir.1998) (noting that the focus of review is the administrative ruling, not the district court\u2019s decision). Moreover, we may set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision only if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence, or if the decision was based on legal error. <em>See Burgess, </em>537 F.3d at 127. \u201cSubstantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Here, after having conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. The evidence in the record concerning Klos\u2019s conditions, along with her own testimony, provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that she was not disabled under the Act during the relevant time period (March 17, 2000-December 31, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In addition, the new evidence that Klos submitted to the district court did not warrant remand under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Tirado v. Bowen, </em>842 F.2d 595, 597 (2d Cir.1988). As the district court correctly determined, much of the new evidence was cumulative, and, in any event, it was not material to Klos\u2019s disability claim for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion and order. Although medical evidence that postdates an ALJ\u2019s decision is not <em>per se </em>irrelevant, <em>see Pollard v. Halter, </em>377 F.3d 183, 193 (2d Cir.2004), the letters from Drs. Marin and Kamel here did not indicate that Klos\u2019s condition was more serious than previously thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We have considered all of Klos\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be unavailing. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
