Green, an Alabama state prisoner, appeals the dismissal of his <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus as barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>one-year statute of limitations. After review, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A. Green\u2019s State Felony Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In September 2004, Green was convicted of felony first degree sexual abuse in the Dallas County, Alabama Circuit Court. Green received a ten-year suspended imprisonment sentence and a split sentence of three years\u2019 probation and eighteen months of weekend sanctions in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">On July 31, 2006, while Green was on probation for the 2004 sexual abuse conviction, City of Selma police officers responded to a report that Green was involved in an incident involving a child at a local service station. Green was questioned, but not arrested. The same day, the child\u2019s mother filed a criminal complaint in the Municipal Court of Selma charging Green with sexual misconduct in violation of Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-6-65. The complaint alleged that Green, while standing at the cash register, lifted the child\u2019s dress and \u201cfelt on her bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">B. Green\u2019s Revoked Probation</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">On August 14, 2006, the state probation officer filed a delinquency report with the Dallas County Circuit Court recommending revocation of Green\u2019s probation and reinstatement of the original suspended ten-year sentence for the 2004 sexual abuse conviction. The recommendation was based on multiple alleged violations of the conditions of Green\u2019s probation, including his recent sexual misconduct charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">On August 18, 2006, Green was arrested on the new sexual misconduct charge and pled not guilty. On August 29, 2006, following a bench trial in Selma\u2019s Municipal Court, Green was convicted of misdemean- or sexual abuse in the second degree, in violation of Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-6-67(b) (the \u201cmisdemeanor conviction\u201d). Green did not file a direct appeal of the misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">On September 21, 2006, the Dallas County Circuit Court held a probation revocation hearing on the 2004 felony sexual abuse conviction. The state argued primarily that Green\u2019s 2006 misdemeanor conviction violated the conditions of Green\u2019s felony probation. The state argued that this was Green\u2019s second sexual offense involving children, he \u201ckeeps molesting kids,\u201d and \u201c[h]e needs to go to prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Green, through counsel, asserted that (1) the misdemeanor conviction resulted in a $300 fine that was satisfied by the ten days of time-served; (2) the misdemeanor conviction was improperly imposed because, <em>inter alia, </em>Green was not represented by counsel; and (3) Green had substantially complied with his probation conditions. The state responded that Green was not entitled to counsel because no jail time was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">During the revocation hearing, Green submitted copies of pay stubs as proof of employment and documentation showing that he had paid court costs, registered as a sex offender and completed his 300 hours of community service. Green testified that (1) he missed one probation appointment, but served additional sanction jail time for that, and (2) he was slow to complete his community service hours because he maintained full-time employment and served jail time on the weekends. As to his misdemeanor conviction, Green testified that he was originally charged with sexual misconduct, but the charge \u201cwas amended down to a misdemeanor.\u201d Green said that he pled not guilty to the misdemeanor charge because he was innocent and that he testified at the bench trial on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>behalf. Green explained that he did not have counsel to advise him and that he did not appeal the misdemeanor conviction because he had already served the ten days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Green\u2019s state probation officer testified that Green had a history of noncompliance with the conditions of probation over the two years of probation, but admitted that Green\u2019s worst noncompliance was his new sexual abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The Circuit Court revoked Green\u2019s probation and ordered him to serve the original ten-year sentence for the 2004 felony sexual abuse conviction with credit for time served. The Circuit Court found that Green had \u201csubstantially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of probation.\u201d The Circuit Court stated that it was \u201cseriously alarmed at the latest charges, particularly with the young lady in city court,\u201d noting that Green had minimized the offense by calling it a lesser offense, but \u201c[i]t still means that you did, in fact, commit the charge.\u201d Green did not file a direct appeal of the order revoking his probation and reinstating his ten-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">C. Green\u2019s Rule 32 Petition Regarding the Felony Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">On September 24, 2007, Green filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for relief from the ten-year sentence, pursuant to Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. On November 6, 2007, the Circuit Court denied Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition. The Circuit Court\u2019s order stated that Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition was denied based on findings \u201cthat the Petitioner received sufficient legal counsel,\u201d \u201cthat this court had proper jurisdiction of the matter,\u201d and \u201cthat the petitioner is not being held in custody in excess of his sentence.\u201d On December 14, 2007, Green appealed to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. The record does not reflect the disposition of Green\u2019s appeal or whether Green attempted to appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">D. Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">On February 23, 2009, while Green was still serving his reinstated ten-year sentence on the 2004 Circuit Court felony sexual abuse conviction, Green filed this <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition attacking the 2006 misdemeanor conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) his 2006 misdemeanor conviction was invalid because he was denied the right to counsel and (2) the 2006 misdemeanor conviction was used to enhance his current, ten-year sentence on the felony conviction. According to Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, on May 10, 2007, Green filed a Rule 32 petition in the City of Selma\u2019s Municipal Court. The Municipal Court denied Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The state\u2019s answer asserted that Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was barred by the one-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) and that Green did not meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement for habeas relief. The state argued that: (1) \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year limitations period began running on September 12, 2006, when the fourteen-day period for seeking direct review of Green\u2019s misdemeanor conviction expired; (2) after 241 days, on May 10, 2007, Green filed his Rule 32 petition challenging his misdemeanor conviction, tolling the limitations period until February 27, 2008, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>the fourteen-day period for filing an appeal of the denial of the Rule 32 petition expired; and (3) another 362 days passed before Green filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on February 23, 2009, for a total of 602 days, well beyond the one-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The district court construed the state\u2019s answer as a motion to dismiss and directed Green to respond. Green\u2019s response argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was entitled to equitable tolling because he had diligently pursued his Rule 32 petition attacking his misdemeanor conviction. Green argued that the tolling period did not end on February 27, 2008 as the state suggested, but rather continued while Green attempted to appeal the denial of his Rule 32 petition and pursued several state mandamus petitions, the last of which was finally resolved by the Alabama Supreme Court on December 4, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) concluding that Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely. In calculating the one-year limitation\u2019s period, the R &amp; R used the date the misdemeanor conviction became final. The R &amp; R determined that the one-year limitations period was tolled while Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition challenging the Municipal Court misdemeanor conviction was pending, but that Green was not entitled to tolling while he pursued his state mandamus petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The R &amp; R suggested that, even if Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was timely, it was likely Green could not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement. The R &amp; R concluded that there was no evidence that Green\u2019s misdemeanor conviction was used to enhance his current ten-year sentence given that Green\u2019s revocation was based on multiple probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Over Green\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the R &amp; R with one modification, that the one-year limitations period began to run on February 14, 2008, immediately after the denial of Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition challenging his misdemeanor conviction. Thus, the district court dismissed Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Green filed this appeal. This Court granted a certificate of appealability and appointed appellate counsel for Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">A. In Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">Because we are obliged to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking, we must address the threshold issue of whether Green was \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 when he filed his petition. <em>See Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">A district court has jurisdiction to entertain a \u00a7 2254 petition only if the petitioner is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). The \u201cin custody\u201d requirement means \u201cthat the habeas petitioner [must] be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition is filed.\u201d <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). Generally, if the petitioner\u2019s state sentence has fully expired, he does not meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 109 S.Ct. at 1926. However, when the \u00a7 2254 petition can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>construed as asserting a challenge to the current state sentence that was enhanced by an allegedly invalid prior state conviction, the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of federal habeas jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 109 S.Ct. at 1926-27; <em>see also Lackawanna Cnty. Dist. Att\u2019y v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 399-402, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 1571-73, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001) (concluding \u00a7 2254 petitioner satisfied \u201cin custody\u201d requirement because the earlier state conviction he nominally sought to challenge had been used to calculate his sentencing range for his later state conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Although such a \u00a7 2254 petitioner satisfies the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement, the petitioner may not collaterally attack the prior expired state sentence unless the petitioner alleges that the prior state conviction was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel announced in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). <em>Lackawanna, </em>532 U.S. at 404, 121 S.Ct. at 1574. Additionally, the \u00a7 2254 petitioner seeking relief under the <em>Lackawanna </em>exception must satisfy the procedural prerequisites for relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Here, although Green\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition primarily attacked his misdemeanor conviction, it also referenced his current Circuit Court felony ten-year sentence and expressly claimed that it was enhanced by the misdemeanor conviction. The record indicates that the state prosecutor, the probation officer and the Circuit Court all were particularly concerned about Green\u2019s new misdemeanor conviction and that Green\u2019s probation was revoked, and his ten-year sentence reinstated, in large part because of this new conviction. <em>See McCoy v. Wainwright, </em>804 F.2d 1196, 1197 n. 1 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that jurisdiction exists even if the earlier sentence has expired if there is \u201ca positive and demonstrable relationship between the prior convictions and [the petitioner\u2019s] present incarceration\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition also challenged his felony ten-year sentence and thus satisfied the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement as to the felony sentence. Furthermore, because Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition alleges that the misdemeanor conviction was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, it falls within the <em>Lackawanna </em>exception. Thus, the district court had federal habeas jurisdiction to review Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">B. Statute of Limitations for Felony Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The fact that Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition challenges his Circuit Court felony ten-year sentence has implications for whether the petition was barred by the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). \u201c[T]he writ and AEDPA, including its limitations provisions, are specifically focused on the judgment which holds the petitioner in confinement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferreira v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t ofCorrs., </em>494 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[T]he judgment to which AEDPA refers is the underlying conviction and <em>most </em>re-</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>cent </em>sentence that authorizes the petitioner\u2019s current detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (emphasis added) (concluding that one-year period began to run from the judgment entered upon resentencing rather than from the original judgment of conviction and sentence).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Instead of focusing on the misdemeanor conviction, the district court should have focused on the Circuit Court\u2019s order revoking Green\u2019s probation and its reimposition of the ten-year sentence. The timeliness of Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition must be evaluated based on when that Circuit Court judgment became final. Furthermore, the current record is not sufficiently complete to make a final determination as to timeliness because it contains only parts of the record related to Green\u2019s Rule 32 petition challenging the probation revocation and his ten-year sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (providing that the judgment does not become final until \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">For these reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and remand for further consideration of whether Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed as to the Circuit Court\u2019s September 21, 2006 order revoking probation and reimposing the ten-year sentence. On remand, the parties should be allowed to fully brief the statute of limitations issue with respect to the Circuit Court\u2019s order and to raise any other pertinent issues or defenses, including exhaustion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">. After filing his \u00a7 2254 petition, Green was released from prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\">. Green attempted to appeal the denial of that Rule 32 petition. When the Municipal Court failed to process his notice of appeal, Green filed a series of state mandamus petitions, the last of which was denied by the Alabama Supreme Court on December 4, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. Under Green\u2019s theory, if the limitations period was tolled until December 4, 2008, only eighty additional days had elapsed when Green filed his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b803-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning jurisdiction. <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\">. Although the Circuit Court found that Green committed multiple probation violations, it appears Green\u2019s new misdemeanor conviction was the primary basis for the probation revocation and full reinstatement of Green\u2019s suspended ten-year sentence. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 15 \u2014 22\u201454(d) (giving the Alabama circuit court the discretion to revoke a defendant's probation and reinstate the full prior suspended sentence if he commits a new offense, but limiting the court's ability to do so for other violations unless it finds that no measure short of confinement will adequately protect the community or will avoid depreciating the seriousness of the violation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order dismissing a federal habeas petition as untimely, but we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Thompson v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>595 F.3d 1233, 1235 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
