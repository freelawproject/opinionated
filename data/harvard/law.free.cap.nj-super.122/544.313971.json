(Parker) and The International Fidelity Insurance Company (International) to recover $12,000, the amount of the bid bond submitted by Parker as principal and International as surety to guarantee that Parker would enter into a contract if its bid were accepted by the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The trial court denied cross-motions for summary judgment made by plaintiff and Parker. At the same time it severed for trial the cross-claim and third-party action filed by International against Parker and its indemnitors and a cross-claim filed by Parker. By leave of the court, the township appeals from the denial of its motion for summary judgment, and Parker and International appeal from the denial of Parker\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The essential facts are undisputed. The township had advertised for bids for alterations of its municipal building. The specifications required each bidder to submit with its bid a surety bond in the amount of <em>5% </em>of the bid to insure that it would enter into the contract if it were the successful bidder. The specifications contained a provision authorizing the municipality to waive informalities in the bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">On December 2, 1969 Parker submitted a bid of $277,700 and a bid bond under seal, executed by it as principal and International as surety, in the amount of $12,000. The condition of the bond read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">Now, Therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">(a) If [the bid of the principal Parker] shall be rejected, or in the alternate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">(b) If said bid shall be accepted and the Principal shall execute and deliver a contract in the Form of Contract attached hereto, properly completed in accordance with said bid, and shall furnish a bond for the faithful performance of said Contract, and for the payment of all persons performing labor or furnishing materials in connection therewith, and shall in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>other respects perform the agreement created by the acceptance of said bid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">Then, This Obligation Shall Be Void, otherwise the same shall remain in force and effect; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Parker\u2019s bid, $277,700, was the lowest bid submitted and on December 30, 1969 the township committee awarded the contract to it. Notice of the award was given to Parker on January 5, 1970 and contract documents sent to it for execution on January 21, 1970. Parker did not execute the contract documents even though it was advised by letter of March 17, 1970 that a default would be declared and the work readvertised for bids. (Parker contends that it was unable to enter into the contract because International had refused to provide, as allegedly it had promised to do, the required performance bond. The breach of that alleged agreement forms the basis of the cross-claim filed by Parker: against International.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On April 9, 1970 the township committee readvortised for bids. It received new bids and awarded the contract to a company which submitted a low bid of $297,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">This action was then instituted. The answer filed by Parker admitted the material allegations of the township\u2019s complaint and alleged that (1) it, Parker, was \u201cat all times\u201d ready, willing and able to perform its contract, and (2) that the \u201cacts of the co-defendants caused the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">International\u2019s answer, filed in July 1970, embodied a cross-claim against Parker alleging that it had executed the bid bond on Parker\u2019s representation that its bid would be $240,000, whereas the bid submitted was $277,700. (International gives no indication of why it was prejudiced by the alleged misrepresentation.) The sole affirmative defense pleaded by International to the township\u2019s complaint was that the township\u2019s award of the contract to Parker \u201cwas illegal and improper in that the said bid did not conform with the instruction for bidders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">That affirmative defense embodies the sole substantive issue on this appeal. Defendants contend that Parker failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>to comply with the specifications when it submitted a bid bond of $12,000 instead of one for $13,885, 5% of its bid of $277,700; that its failure to submit a bond in the specified amount was a material and substantial irregularity which could not be waived by the township so that Parker\u2019s nonconforming bid was not subject to acceptance by plaintiff. That being so, the argument continues, Parker was not required to execute the tendered contract, so that there was no breach of the conditions of the bid bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The township\u2019s position is that the deficiency in the amount of the bid bond submitted by Parker, was a \u201cminor or inconsequential\u201d variance from the specifications which it could and did waive, in good faith, in awarding the contract to Parker, and that Parker\u2019s failure to execute the contract was a breach of the conditions of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The trial court, in denying the cross-motions for summary judgment, ruled that the question of whether the variance from the specifications was a \u201cminor or inconsequential\u201d variance (which could be waived) or a material departure from the specifications (which could not be waived) was a fact question precluding grant of summary judgment. We disagree and hold that the posed question is a legal issue to be decided on the uncontradieted proofs before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Before proceeding to a consideration of that issue, we note that the validity of the township\u2019s resolution of December 30, 1969 awarding the contract to Parker has never been challenged by any taxpayer or citizen of the township or by any competing bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Indeed, had one of Parker\u2019s competitors or a taxpayer waited, as did International, for a period of more than six months before seeking to attack the December 30, 1969 resolution awarding the contract to Parker, the attack would have been dismissed as untimely because not brought within 45 days of December 30, 1969. <em>B. </em>4:69-6. The attack hero made does not involve the basic statutory power of the township to act. <em>Cf. Greenberg v. Fornicola, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>1, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(1962). It is undisputed that the township had authority to contract for the improvement and that it had proceeded in accordance with the bidding statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:50-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The statute does not direct that a municipality demand that a deposit or bid bond accompany a bid. Nevertheless, a municipality may require, as plaintiff did, submission of \u201csome form of security as a guarantee that the contract [would] be entered into if the bid [were] accepted.\u201d <em>P. Michelotti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Fair Lawn, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>199, 202 (App. Div. 1959), certif. granted 31 <em>N. J. 75 </em>(1959), app. dism. 31 <em>N. J. </em>556 (1960); <em>Hillside Tp. v. Sternin, 25 N. J. </em>317, 323 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">At best, the attack here presented projects a debatable question as to whether the township could waive strict, and accept what it in good faith deemed substantial, compliance with a bid bond provision which it had elected to include in the specifications. Such an attack, if made by an unsuccessful bidder or a taxpayer of the township, would call for application of the general rule that \u201cattacks upon public contracts must be seasonably made.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Fornicola, supra, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>at 4. The circumstances would not call for invocation of the authority granted to a court by <em>R. </em>4:69-6 (c) to enlarge the 45-day period \u201cwhere it is manifest that the interest of justice so requires.\u201d <em>Cf. Greenberg v. Fornicola, supra, </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Nevertheless, despite the lapse of time, the meritorious issue presented must be decided in view of what the court said in <em>Hillside Tp. v. Sternin, supra, 25 N. J. </em>at 325-326, just as if it would have been decided if it had been raised in a timely attack by a taxpayer or unsuccessful bidder on the award of the contract to Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In <em>Hillside Tp. v. Sternin </em>the advertisement for bids for installation of two sirens provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">A certified check made payable to the Township of Hillside for not less than 10% of the amount bid must accompany each proposal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Sternin submitted a bid of $1,087.25. No cheek accompanied the bid. Indeed, Sternin contended that he was unaware of the advertisement for bids and of the specifications to which it referred. He said that he had submitted his bid as the result of conversations he had had with a municipal official. The contract was awarded to Sternin but he refused to sign it claiming that the work called for h}' the specifications was more \u201cdemanding\u201d than the work which his bid had contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In defense of an action instituted against him to recover the difference between his bid and that of the next lowest bidder, who was awarded the contract, Sternin contended that (1) his bid was not based on the specifications and that he should not be held to his bid, and (2) the municipality had no authority to accept his bid since he had not submitted a certified check with the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The trial court, in granting summary judgment to Sternin, ruled in his favor with respect to both contentions. On the township\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that, with respect to the first contention, a factual issue existed precluding grant of summary judgment on that ground. Nevertheless, the court held Sternin was entitled to judgment, even though he was thus taking advantage of his own default, because the township had no authority to accept his bid since he had not submitted the check called for bjr the advertisement for bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u25a0 The court recognized that \u201cminor or inconsequential variances and technical omissions [in the bid] may be the subject of waiver\u201d by the municipality, but held that the deficiency in Sternin\u2019s bid \u2014 the failure to submit the required check \u2014 was a \u201cmaterial departure\u201d from the bidding requirements which could not be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">It is immediately evident \u2014 defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary notwithstanding \u2014 that the situation presented in <em>Hillside Tp. v. Sternin, supra, </em>differs materially from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>present in the case before us. In <em>Hillside Township </em>the bidder failed to submit any cheek. Indeed, he neither attempted to, or intended to, submit a check as called for by the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Here, however, there is not even a suggestion of an intent to ignore the bid bond requirements of the specifications. Parker\u2019s bid was accompanied by a bid bond, executed by it as principal and an insurance company as surety, in the substantial amount of $12,000, although that amount was $1,885 less than 5% of the bid of $277,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The precise question here presented has not been dealt with in the reported cases. However, in our opinion, those which are most pertinent \u2014 see, <em>e. g., P. Michelotti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Fair Lawn, supra; Bryan Const. Co. v. Bd. of Trustees, etc., Montclair, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>200 (App. Div. 1954); 10 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 29.66, 29.29 (3d ed. 1966) \u2014 support our conclusion that the variance between $13,885, the amount of the bid bond which should have been submitted with the bid of $277,700, and $12,000, the amount of the bid bond actually submitted, was minor and inconsequential. The township committee, whose good faith is not challenged, was authorized to waive the variance and award the contract to Parker, the lowest bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Apposite is what this court said in <em>Bryan Const. Co. v. Bd. of Trustees, etc., Montclair, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">[The municipality] expressly and specifically reserved \u201cthe right to waive minor informalities\u201d in any bid. Further, a municipal body has a greater function in dealing with irregularities in such matters than merely exercising a ministerial and pei\u2019functory role. It has inherent discretionary power, and what is more, a duty to secure, through competitive bidding, the lowest responsible offer, and to effectuate that accomplishment it may waive minor irregularities, [at 206]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">See also <em>Faist v. Hoboken, </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>361, 363 (Sup. Ct. 1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Parker\u2019s failure to enter into the contract awarded it entitles plaintiff to recover on the bid bond whose conditions were thus breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The order appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff against Parker and International for the amount due on the bid bond.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
