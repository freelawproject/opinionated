A.

J. 21 </em>(1961), for alleged \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In Continental\u2019s petition of appeal filed with the Bergen County Tax Board for the tax year 1969, the only reason alleged for reduction of the assessment was \u201cNot true value.\u201d In the petition to the Division of Tax Appeals for the same year, the allegation of aggrievement was that \u201cthe said assessment is in excess of its true value\u201d and the prayer was that the assessment \u201cbe reduced to the true value of the property.\u201d Thus, in neither tribunal was there an allegation of \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d remediable under <em>Kents. </em>Because the issue was not raised, the claim of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d was not properly cognizable by the Division and its action in applying the 15% reduction on such basis as to the tax year 1969 is reversed. <em>Cleff Realty Co. v. Jersey City, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>465 (App. Div. 1956), certif. den. 23 <em>N. J. </em>58 (1956); <em>Matawan v. Tree Haven Apts. Inc., </em>108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>111, 116 (App. Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The following capsulizes that portion of the decision of the Division which sets the framework of the issue of discrimination for our consideration as to the year 1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Division said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">A claim of discrimination has been made by the appellants. The allegation is based on Kents type discrimination and they request Kents type relief. The record shows that during the years 1969 and 1970, the Village of Ridgefield Park has been assessing <em>at a common level </em>of assessment which was less than 100 per cent. I find for that year the actual assessment was on the basis of 85 per cent of true value. I therefore find for the years 1969 and 1970 all of the assessments which have been determined here should be reduced by the sum of 15 per cent. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The \u201cfinding\u201d that \u201cfor that [sic] year the actual assessment was on the basis of 85 per cent of true value\u201d is somewhat obscure both as to \u201cwhat year\u201d was intended and as to whether it was a finding that the actual assessment of the subject property was at 85% of true value, or whether the finding referred to assessments generally. If the subject properties were indeed assessed at such percentage, there could have been no discrimination even on the Division\u2019s theory <em>(i. e. </em>that the \u201ccommon level\u201d was at 85%). To reach the issue presented, we shall construe the language upon the assumption that this finding was meant to assert that the \u201ccommon level\u201d was at 85% of true value. In any event, we hold that the Division erred in granting <em>Kents </em>relief on the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"> In order to make out a case of actionable discrimination, these elements must be proved: (1) that the real property generally in the municipality was asssesed at less than true value; (2) what the common assessment level was, and (3) the true value of the subject property upon which the common level percentage would operate. <em>Reading Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Woodbridge Tp., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>407, 426 (1965); <em>Matawan v. Tree Haven Apts. Inc., supra, </em>108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 116; <em>Feder v. Passaic, </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157, 160 (App. Div. 1969). If there is <em>no </em>common level shown and there <em>is none which the assessor is endeavoring to apply, </em>and the assessment is substantially higher than the \u201caverage ratio\u201d determined by the Director of Taxation, the \u201caverage ratio\u201d may be applied under <em>Kents, </em>and the assessment reduced by that proportion. <em>Matawan v. Tree Haven Apts. Inc., supra, </em>108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 116; <em>Feder v. City of Passaic, supra, </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As noted above, the Division\u2019s decision found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">*' * *' The record shows that during the years 1969 and 1970, the Village of Ridgefield Park has been assessing <em>at a common level </em>of assessment which was less than 100 per cent. I find for that year the actual assessment was on the basis of 85 per cent of true value * * * [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">There is no evidential support in the record for <em>so </em>much of this finding as concerns assessment at a common level less than 100%. Indeed, there was no testimony by-taxpayers\u2019 experts as to a common level, and the assessor\u2019s uncontroverted testimony is that for his 12 years as assessor he has been assessing at true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Nor was there any showing that, as in <em>Kents, </em>there was no common level, toward the end that the average ratio from the Director\u2019s Tables might be enlisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The Division erred in equating the \u201caverage ratio,\u201d accepted by the assessor in his testimony for what it is and no more,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a \u201ccommon level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The \u201caverage ratio\u201d is quite a different concept from \u201ccommon level.\u201d In fact, the \u201ccommon level\u201d imports general <em>equality </em>in the incidence of the tax, and the \u201caverage ratio\u201d necessarily makes for unequal proportions of value and thus for <em>inequality </em>of treatment and burden in the apportionment of the tax as between the several property owners. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western R. R. Co. v. Neeld, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>561, 573 (1957), and <em>Switz v. Middletown Tp., </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>580, 594 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In <em>North Bergen Tp. v. Venino, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>143 (App. Div. 1957), the Division of Tax Appeals attempted to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the \u201caverage ratio\u201d of the Director and the Hudson County equalization table to correct what it deemed, because of said tables, a discriminatory assessment. Judge (later Justice) Francis said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">May the tables described be used as the sole reason for a finding of discrimination? And, where such tables are offered or used as the <em>sole </em>means of demonstrating discrimination against an individual property owner, may the average ratio of assessment to true value as shown therein be applied to the actual true value of the individual parcel of realty in order to achieve equality and eliminate discrimination? The answers to these questions must be in the negative. <em>Sueh treatment fails to take cognisance of the essential difference between the concepts of average ratio of assessment to tme value for equalisation table purposes and common ratio of assessment. </em>The average ratio achieved in the statutory equalization process is the arithmetical mean of the varying percentages of true value applied by the local assessor in assessing properties in the taxing district. A <em>common ratio </em>signifies that <em>the same standard of percentage of value </em>is used in assessing <em>each property in the district. </em>If the same standard or common ratio were applied uniformly in all municipalities throughout the State, there would be no need for equalization tables (assuming, of course, that true value was ascertained honestly and in good faith), for then there would be no discrimination. Obviously, therefore, <em>application of the average ratio, </em>ascertained for purposes of equalizing the county tax burden among municipalities or for purposes of allocation of school aid, <em>cannot bring about equality of tax burden among individual property owners within a given municipality. </em>A common level of individual assessment cannot be achieved by that means <em>alone. </em>[At 147; emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Ooncededly, <em>Venino </em>was decided before <em>Kents, </em>which did apply the \u201caverage ratio\u201d on the facts there presented. But, as will be seen below, the record here does not comport with that in <em>Kents. Venino </em>was one of the cases cited in <em>Kents </em>(34 <em>N. J. </em>at 26) as an instance where efforts had erroneously been made to prove \u201ccommon level\u201d by relying on the average ratio. The court in <em>Kents </em>exposed the limitation of the \u201caverage ratio,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">The question is whether the average ratio thus determined may be used to deal with the problem of <em>intramunicipal </em>inequality. If the sales data used to find the ratio in fact revealed some percentage of true value about which the bulk of individual assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tended to cluster, one might accept that percentage as the common level of assessments. But the underlying sales material may reveal no such central figure, but rather widely varying assessment ratios within each of the four classes of property referred to above. [34 <em>N. J. </em>at 27]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">After pointing out that the sales upon which the average ratio is based ranged, in that case, from 2.25% to 88% of the assessed value for land and comparable widely disparate percentages for residential and \u201cother property,\u201d the court demonstrated the irrelevance of the \u201caverage ratio\u201d to \u201ccommon level,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">It is clear the average ratio is not a handy tool with which one seated at a desk can bring all assessments to full true value. The reason, of course, is that since the individual assessments vary within a wide range, the inequities would be aggravated if all assessments were brought to full true value upon the assumption that they reflect a uniform percentage of that value. <em>Switz v. Middletown Twp., supra </em>(23 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>604) <em>; Delaware, Lackawanna and Western R. R. Co. c. Neeld, supra </em>(23 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>574). Nothing short of complete revaluation, parcel by parcel, plus appropriate measures to keep the rolls current can achieve equality, [at 27],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Nevertheless, in <em>Kents </em>the court strove to determine whether the average ratio may ever be used to reduce an assessment substantially above it. And it then, with several <em>caveat </em>references to the inherent weaknesses of the concept, laid down the limited circumstances where, as a last desperate measure to avoid inequality of treatment, reliance could be placed on the \u201caverage ratio.\u201d Chief Justice Weintraub, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Where, as here, the record of sales indicates there is no common level for all or any class of real property and the assessors disavow any effort to achieve one, the average ratio should be deemed sufficient evidence of the level to which reduction should be granted in the absence of circumstances indicating that the average should be modified for that purpose. The trier of the facts may properly consider any weakness which may appear as, for example, a paucity of sales in the municipality concerned or some imbalance caused by unusual experience, [at 31].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The court in <em>Kents </em>then noted that the record in that case justified the use of the average ratio. The proofs demonstrated there was no common level and the assessors disavowed any effort to achieve one. The sales underlying the average ratio were substantial, the assessments of new motels were \u201csubstantially\u201d below the average ratio and the assessments of the property involved \u201csubstantially\u201d exceeded the ratio. Thus it was that the court said: \u201c* * * until some better technique appears or some other suitable one is provided by statute, we are satisfied to utilize the average ratio in eases <em>such as the one before </em>us\u201d (at 33; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">That is not the situation here. In 1963 a revaluation was made in Ridgefield Park. The assessor\u2019s testimony here was that, while the assessments remained the same through 1970, they were \u201cuniform\u201d throughout the municipality. There was an effort by the assessor to maintain assessments at a common level of true value and a revaluation was again made for the tax year 1971. Moreover, the Division here gave no consideration to the inherent value of the \u201caverage ratio\u201d in Ridgefield Park, or its possible weaknesses. Nor was there any showing that the assessment of the subject property was \u201csubstantially\u201d higher than the \u201cgreat hulk\u201d of assessments in the municipality. Uniformity is the desideratum, inequality of tax treatment the evil to be prevented. There is no evidence in the record here to negate the former or to demonstrate the latter. The true thrust of <em>Kenls </em>is at \u201cunequal treatment\u201d (34 <em>N. J. </em>at 31). We find none of that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The judgment of the Division is reversed insofar as it reduced the assessments by 15% for reasons of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d for the tax years 1969 and 1970. The matter is remanded for entry of judgment in the Division for those years in accordance with views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The property was owned by the Continental Paper Company (Continental) during the tax year 1969, and for the tax year 1970 part of it was owned by Alford Industries, Inc. (Alford), and part by Simkin Industries (Simkin). Except where specific reference is made to the various owners, they shall be referred to as \u201cthe taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> The merits of the claim of discrimination likewise would be applicable to the tax year 1969 if \u201cdiscrimination\u201d had been properly raised in the petitions of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-10\"> So far as pertinent this testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">Q. All right. Now are you aware of the Table of Equalized Valuations as promulgated by the Division of Taxation, Department of the Treasury for the subject years 1968 and 1969?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">MR. DFRKIN: Your Honor, we'll admit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">MR. WALSH: You admit the <em>average ratio </em>as applied by the Director of the Division of Taxation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">THE WITNESS: The <em>average ratio </em>is the result of the selling</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>prices of all the properties in the Village, and those that didn\u2019t sell would have the same treatment as those that sold. It would be no different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Q. Well, if I told you, assuming for the purposes of this hearing, that the Village of Ridgefield Park for the year 1969 had an <em>average ratio </em>of sale to true value of S.99% [sic] would you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">A. I would agree with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Q. Now, for the year 1968, would you agree that the <em>average ratio </em>was 83.53%?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">A. The ratio based on the selling prices of the properties that were used in this study was 83%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\"><em>\u2022Q. </em>Now, if you assessed the subject premises at 100% of true value, do you believe that there was some discrimination in connection with that assessment in connection with the <em>average </em>ratio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">A. I misunderstood your question before. All the properties in the Village were assessed\u2019 at a hundred per cent in 1963, none of the values have changed. The assessment stayed for eight years in a row. So <em>if </em>the <em>sales ratio </em>based on a few of the selling prices we had reflected that in that space of time the ratio went from a hundred to eighty-three, then I must say that the value that -I have on that property record card is 83%, and not 100%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">Q. You say it is not 100% now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">MR. WALSH: That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-15\">REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. DURKIN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-16\">Q. Mr. Howard, isn\u2019t this ratio change due to inflation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-17\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-18\">Q. And if we had a depression couldn\u2019t it react the opposite way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7\">A. It sure could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-19\">&lt;J. You have in no way attempted to treat any of the properties in Ridgefield Park but in a uniform manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-20\">A. All uniformly.
