On July 1, 1968, by written contract, plaintiff agreed to sell its business to defendant and, among other things, the agreement provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">This Agreement shall be governed, construed and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Supreme Court of the State of New York, in the County of New York, shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any claims or disputes pertaining directly or indirectly to this Agreement or to any matter arising therefrom. Each of the parties hereby expressly submits and consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or proceeding commenced by the other in such Court, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">While au agreement to be bound by the laws of a designated state cannot oust a state of judicial jurisdiction, it will be enforced unless it is unfair, unreasonable or against the public policy of the forum state. <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7 80 at 244 (1971); <em>Central Contracting Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>367 <em>F. </em>2d 341 (3 Cir. 1966); <em>Mayer v. Roche, </em>77 <em>N. J.
