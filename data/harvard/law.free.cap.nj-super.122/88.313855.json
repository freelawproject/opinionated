DE ANGELO, PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT, v. ALSAN MASONS INC., DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b108-4\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b108-5\">Submitted January 2, 1973-</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ab\">Decided January 12, 1973.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b109-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Before Judges Collester, Leonard and Halpern.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-9\"><em>Messrs. Carton, Nary, Witt &amp; Arvanitis, </em>attorneys for appellant <em>(Mr. James D. Carton, III, </em>on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-10\"><em>Messrs. Norton &amp; Kalac, </em>attorneys for respondent <em>(Mr. Peter P.

The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that the Division\u2019s findings were against the weight of evidence in that (a) petitioner\u2019s illness was not compensable because it was related solely to everyday emotional stress, and (b) the opinion given on causal relationship by petitioner\u2019s medical expert was \u201ca net opinion based on complete speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">The scope of our appellate review limits us to a determination of whether the findings of the judge of compensation could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the whole record, after giving due weight to his expertise in the field and his opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of hearing and seeing the witnesses. <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>113, 117-118 (1969); <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>589, 599 (1965). This is the same test utilized prior to March <em>2, </em>1972, from which date appeals from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division come directly to us under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-66. To effectuate and implement the statute, <em>B. </em>2:2-3 (a) was amended, effective September 5, 1972, abolishing <em>de novo </em>appeals to the County Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"> In reaching this conclusion, we take judicial note of the fact that hearings before the Division are adversary in nature; are presided over and tried by a judge who must now be an attorney-at law of New Jersey <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:1A \u2014 12.1 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-49), and that the judge is required to file a copy of his determination and award <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-58). Under such circumstances, the judge of compensation\u2019s determination, when reviewed on appeal, is equivalent to a trial by a judge without a jury. <em>Abeles v. Adams Engineering Co., Inc., </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>411, 423-424 (1961) <em>State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1970). Additionally, the same test is generally applied in appeals to this court from determinations by administrative agencies. <em>E. g. Atkinson v. Parsekian, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>143, 149 (1962); <em>Hornauer v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>501 (App. Div. 1956). See, also, the many examples of the application of this test in the dissenting opinion of Justices Francis and Jacobs in <em>Ricciardi v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>445, at <em>p. </em>454 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">So viewed, we affirm essentially for the reasons expressed by Judge Hapier in the Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
