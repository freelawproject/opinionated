Port of New York Authority, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>414 (1962). There our Supreme Court held (at 423) that \u201cproperty of public agencies which is not used for the authorized public purpose or held for such expected use within a reasonable time\u201d is not exempted from taxation. It also there ruled that the \u201crevenue motive\u201d is not such an authorized public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Por reasons set forth in our opinion in <em>Brody v. Millville, </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 (App. Div. 1972), filed simultaneously herewith,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we agree with the Division of Tax Appeals that Airwork Company and Boeing Vertol are sufficiently dedicated to a public use as to justify the exemption. Nor do we have any doubt that the restaurant operated by Dale Wettstein serves the requisite public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> Questions of fact and law are sufficiently common to this action and <em>Brody v. Millville, </em>that final arguments were consolidated, and the parties stipulated that the records in both were to be considered in each.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
