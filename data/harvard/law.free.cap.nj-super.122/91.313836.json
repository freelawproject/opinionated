The note was the last of a series of renewal notes given to secure a loan originally negotiated on June 10, 1968. At the time the June 1970 note was executed a previous note, -on which a balance of $902 was owing, was can-celled and defendant received $85 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">At the time of the renewal defendant filled out and submitted an application which required a listing of his currently outstanding debts. He represented in his application that his debts consisted of the balance due plaintiff, and two additional obligations totalling $860, a total of $1,762. He specifically wrote, \u201cI owe no other debts.\u201d However, on December 2, 1970 defendant filed a petition in bankruptcy listing 19 unsecured creditors to whom a total of $11,754.98 was owing. He had been indebted to 13 of these creditors in an amount exceeding $9,200 on the date of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">At the trial defendant pleaded his discharge in bankruptcy as a defense. Plaintiff countered that defendant\u2019s liability to it was incurred by means of the materially false statement referred to, hence the debt was not affected by the discharge in bankruptcy. 11 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 35(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge, sitting without a jury, held that the debt was not discharged but limited plaintiff\u2019s recovery to the sum of $85, the additional money, over and above the balance due on the old note, which defendant received at the time of the renewal. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We hold that plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the full amount of the balance due on the note, with interest. The facts here closely resemble those in <em>Personal Finance Co. of Paterson v. </em>Snyder, 131 <em>N. J. L. </em>597 (Sup. Ct. 1944), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>which we hold to be controlling. In that case plaintiff, which held defendant\u2019s note on which a balance of $254.65 was owing, accepted a renewal in the amount of $300 on the basis of a statement of debts which proved to be false, and was permitted to recover the entire balance due on the note rather than the sum of $45.35, the difference between the balance due on the original note and the amount of the renewal. See also <em>Personal Finance Co. of N. J. v. Bruns, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>133, 135-136 (App. Div. 1951); <em>Beneficial Finance Co. v. Norton, </em>76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>577, 584 (App. Div. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of judgment for plaintiff in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"> Defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy was filed prior to the effective date of the 1970 amendment <em>(Pub. L. </em>91-467, \u00a7 5-7, 84 <em>Stat. </em>992) to 11 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
