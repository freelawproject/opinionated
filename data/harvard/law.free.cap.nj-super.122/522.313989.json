ANTHONY JOHN LA PORTE, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b542-5\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b542-6\">Argued June 20, 1972</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Anl\">Decided July 5, 1972.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Before Judges Labrecque, Kouovsky and Allcorjl</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-5\"><em>Ms. Rosemary K. </em>Reavey, Assistant Deputy Public Defender, argued the cause for the appellant <em>{Mr. Stanley G. Van Ness, </em>Public Defender, attorney; <em>Martha K. Kiviiny, </em>Assistant Deputy Public Defender, of counsel and on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-6\"><em>Mr. Ralph J.

Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U. S. </em>443, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971); <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>143, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 L. Ed. 2d 612 (Decided June 12, 1972). Accordingly, there was no error in the action of the trial court denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The conviction of the defendant of the present charges of robbery, when armed (arising out of the Belleville hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>up), must be reversed, however, despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt of such charges. The defendant was unduly and improperly prejudiced at the trial by testimony on the- State\u2019s case relating to the fact that he was \u201cwanted\u201d by the police of a neighboring community for another armed robbery; and by'permitting the prosecutor to ask each of two character witnesses called by the defendant, whether they were aware that defendant, in March, 1970, \u201cwas arrested for the crime of embezzlement\u201d from his then employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Notwithstanding the direction of the trial judge to \u201cstrike\u201d the testimony regarding the other armed robbery, and his cautionary instructions to the jury on this testimony as well as on the information supplied to the jury by the prosecutor concerning the defendant\u2019s arrest for embezzlement, such extraneous, improper information could hardly have been ereased from the minds or the consideration of the individual members of the jury. With such information in mind, the jurors could not avoid being prejudiced by it in passing on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charge of armed robbery, here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
