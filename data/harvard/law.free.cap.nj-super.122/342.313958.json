The accident occurred while she was driving to her work at the offices of the Authority in Woodbridge from her home in Eatontown. Her claim petition was dismissed in the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and on her appeal to the County Court. While she argues here that her employment by the Authority requires a finding that the accident happened \u201con the premises\u201d of her employer and a consequent declaration of compensability, the real thrust of her appeal is that the furnishing of toll-free coupons to her by her employer to facilitate her use of the Parkway prevents application of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d exclusion and renders the untoward event one arising out of and in the course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">No real issue of fact exists. The coupons were provided at no cost to Mrs. Pearce, and without them she would have had to pay a toll on the route from her home to Woodbridge. The coupons were only to be used in going to and coming from work and a designation on the tickets limiting by number allocation the toll gates authorized to accept these tickets worked toward that end. Petitioner was not required by her employer to use the Parkway in commuting, and toll-free alternate roads were available, although petitioner insisted that Route 35 \u2014 the most likely of these \u25a0\u2014 was \u201cout of my way and traffic is abominable on that highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Since <em>Bryant v. Fissell, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>72 (Sup. Ct. 1913), compensability requires that an accident arise out of and in the course of the employment. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-7. And at least since <em>Moosebrugger v. Prospect Presbyterian Church, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>212 (1953), and probably before (see <em>e. g., Gullo v. American Lead Pencil Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>484 (E. &amp; A. 1938)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">The rule in this State is * * that when an employee is simply on his way to or from his regular place of employment and sustains injury, such injury does not arise out of and in the course of his employment. [12 <em>N. J. </em>at 214]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Such rule, commonly called the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, has survived to the present, but barely. Exceptions accommodating compensability have been generously engrafted, as detailed and documented in <em>Hammond v. The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>7, 11 (1970). As commented upon by one writer, and noted in <em>Hammond </em>at 12, the exceptions have become so numerous they have \u201cswallowed the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It is neither our obligation nor our prerogative to depart from the law as enunciated by our Supreme Court. And despite the last rites administered in <em>Hammond </em>and more recently in <em>Bergman v. Parnes Brothers, Inc., </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>559 (1971), the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule has not yet been declared dead. (See concurring opinion of Erancis, J. in <em>Bergman, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>567, 568.) Nor are we privileged to administer the <em>coup de grace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> But we can and do announce that the circumstances of the instant matter fit well within previously sanctioned exceptions, and particularly within those which recognize the employer\u2019s contribution to transportation of the employee as an incident of employment sufficient to bring the employee\u2019s travel within the course of, as well as arising out of, the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> We are aware of the fact that much of the precedent in this area involves distinguishing features such as compul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sory instructions with, respect to the route <em>(Lehigh Navigation Coal Co. v. McGonnell, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>428 (Sup. Ct. 1938), aff\u2019d o.b. 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>583, 97 <em>N. J. L. </em>583 (E. &amp; A. 1939) ); wholly free transportation <em>(Fisher v. Tidewater Building Co., </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>103 (Sup. Ct. 1921), aff\u2019d o.b. 97 <em>N. J. L. </em>324 (E. &amp; A. 1922)); or substantial distance and substantial employer contribution <em>(Filson v. Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., </em>82 <em>N. J. Super. </em>185 (App. Div. 1964), but <em>cf. Watkins v. Cowenhoven, </em>90 <em>N. J. Super. </em>17 (App. Div. 1965), certif. den. 46 <em>N. J. </em>538 (1966)). We realize that this exception takes shape and dimension, in part at least, in cases where the employer provided the actual transportation <em>(Williams v. Bemco Industries, </em>118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>481 (App. Div.), certif. den. 61 <em>N. J. </em>163 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">But we do not believe any of these features to be an invariable requirement for rejection of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. We think employment being what it is by nature, the intrusion of an employer into his employee\u2019s travel habits, customs, or economics, necessarily implies some benefit to or for the employer no matter how altruistic may be other concomitant motivations. The employment incident thus generated, coupled with such considerations as essentiality to the work of travel to and from by the employee and the risks inherent in travel (see <em>Hammond, supra, </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>at 13), ought to be enough, it seems to us, to remove the insulation of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule and- project employee travel into the orbit of \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">So here. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation for a determination of benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
