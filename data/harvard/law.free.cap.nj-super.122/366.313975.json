(appellant), the former employer of Constantine P. Bessasparis (claimant), appeals from a decision of the Board of Beview which affirmed the decision of the Appeal Tribunal that the claimant was eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The claimant had worked for appellant for more than five years as a Class A machinist. By May 1971 his wage rate was $4.27 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In January 1971 the union of which claimant was a member had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with appellant. That agreement provided, among other things, that an employee laid off from one department and entitled to exercise plant seniority must accept the next lower job to which he is entitled or else he is to be removed from the recall list, taken from the seniority list, and all his plant and departmental seniority cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Shortly before claimant left for vacation on May 21, 1971 he was notified by his employer that he was to be laid off on May 28 from his position as Class A machinist. He was then offered work in one of several less skilled jobs which paid from $3.21 to $3.35 per hour. During his vacation claimant decided that he could not afford to work at the reduced rate, accepted the lay-off and began to seek work at his previous wage rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It is undisputed that claimant actively sought work and that it was not until November 7, 1971 that he obtained a new job at a base rate which was only 5% less than he earned as a Class A machinist and which provided an opportunity for a substantial amount of overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In the meantime claimant had on June 8, 1971 applied for unemployment benefits. The Deputy found that he was eligible and not disqualified for such benefits. On successive appeals by Johns-Manville, the Deputy\u2019s determination was affirmed by the Appeal Tribunal on August 5, 1971 and by the Board of Review on August 31, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">At appellant\u2019s request the Board re-opened the matter on November 28, 1971 and then, by its decision of December 28, 1971, ruled that claimant was eligible for benefits from June 8, 1971 to November 7, 1971, the date he obtained new employment. This appeal is taken from the Board\u2019s decision of December 28, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In that decision the Board, after making findings of fact, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">OPINION:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">We have recognized as a general proposition that where down-grading is not severe and the loss of pay is not heavy a claimant should continue at the work offered rather than go on unemployment rolls. However, this is not such a case. * * * Although the employer argues that the claimant, with incentive and overtime pay, could have maintained his earnings level, the uncontroverted testimony of the claimant leads to the conclusion that with the information available to him at the time he made his decision, the claimant had the choice of becoming unemployed or continuing in a comparatively low skilled job paying over twenty-five per cent less than he last earned and with limited prospect of improvement. Under the circumstances his leaving the work rather than accept transfer was with good cause attributable to such work and does not subject him to disqualification under <em>It. S. </em>43:21-5(a) or 5(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">The claimant\u2019s efforts to find work resulting in reemployment in his skilled capacity at a base rate approximately five per cent less than he last earned but with much overtime show him to have been so available for work as to meet the eligibility requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU5\">\n<em>DECISION:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">The claimant was eligible for benefits, without disqualification, from June 8 through November 7, 1971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Appellant, relying on cases of which <em>Goebelbecker v. State, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>53 (App. Div. 1958), is typical, argues that claimant was \u201cdisqualified for unemployment compensation benefits under the \u2018voluntary quit\u2019 provision of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :21-5 (a) and the \u2018available for work\u2019 provision of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5(c)\u201d because he had refused the other jobs which appellant had offered him.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">However <em>Goebelbecker </em>and similar cases are clearly distinguishable. In those cases the factual situation was that described in the first sentence of the Board\u2019s \u201cOpinion,\u201d cases in \u201cwhich the downgrading [was] not severe and the loss of pay not heavy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Here, however, the Board found that the loss of pay which claimant would suffer if he accepted the low-skilled jobs and wages which appellant offered was substantial. That finding is fully supported by substantial evidence in the record and is entitled to particular weight because of the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ministrative tribunal\u2019s familiarity \u25a0with and expertise in employment matters. There is no warrant for our disturbing those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We agree with the Board\u2019s determination that a substantial reduction in wages constitutes,good cause for leaving work under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5 (a). That determination is in accord with the weight of reasoned authority. <em>Bunny\u2019s Waffle Shop v. California Employment Com\u2019n, </em>24 <em>Cal. </em>2d 735, 151 <em>P. </em>2d 224, 228 (Sup. Ct. 1944); <em>Robertson v. Brown, </em>139 <em>So. </em>2d 226 (La. Ct. App. 1962); <em>Pacific Mills v. Director of Division of Employ. Sec., </em>322 <em>Mass. </em>345, 77 <em>N. E. </em>2d 413 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1948); <em>Dubkowski v. Administrator, Unemploy. Comp. Act, </em>150 <em>Conn. </em>278, 188 <em>A. </em>2d 658 (Sup. Ct. Err. 1963); 81 <em>C. J. S. Social Security and Public Welfare </em>\u00a7 170 at 258; see also <em>Wojcik v. Bd. of Review, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>341 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Further, under the facts of this case we find no merit to appellant\u2019s argument that claimant had refused to \u201caccept suitable work when offered him\u201d and hence was disqualified under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5(e). It is clear from the Board\u2019s findings that work offered by appellant was not \u201csuitable\u201d within the meaning of the cited section. <em>Wojcik v. Bd. of Review, supra, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>at 345; <em>Dubkowski v. Administrator, Unemploy. Comp. Act, supra; Shay v. Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>424 <em>Pa. </em>287, 227 <em>A. </em>2d 174 (Sup. Ct. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Finally, there is no substance in appellant\u2019s suggestion that in view of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, an employee refusing the transfer offered by the employer disqualifies himself from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. See <em>Stonco v. Bd. of Rev., Div. of Emp. Sec., </em>106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 12 (App. Div. 1969); <em>Dubkowski v. Administrator, Unemploy. Comp. Act, supra. </em>The right to unemployment compensation benefits stems from the Unemployment Compensation Law, not from agreements between the employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Moreover, the collective bargaining agreement in this case does not in fact provide that an employee refusing a transfer should forfeit his rights to unemployment compensation benefits. If it did contain such a provision, the provision would be void. \u201cAny agreement by an individual to waive, release, or commute his rights to benefits or any other rights [under the unemployment compensation law} shall be void.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21 \u2014 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The decision of the Board of Review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
