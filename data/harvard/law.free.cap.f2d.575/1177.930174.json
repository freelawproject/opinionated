Reference is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>made to the comprehensive findings of fact and opinion of Judge Irene F. Scott, reported at 35 T.C.M. 733 (1976), for a recitation of pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The taxpayer, a Tennessee corporation, was formed for the purpose of acquiring and leasing real estate. Certain of its real estate was acquired by the State of Tennessee by eminent domain, resulting in a capital gain to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">The issue is whether the proceeds of the capital gain were invested in real estate as a tenant in common with a co-owner, as the taxpayer contends, or whether the proceeds were invested in a joint venture as asserted by the Commissioner. The Tax Court found that the taxpayer invested in a joint venture and a partnership under both Tennessee and federal law. The Tax Court concluded that because the interest purchased by the taxpayer was a partnership interest, it was personal rather than real property; and that, consequently, the taxpayer, having not acquired \u201clike kind\u201d property, was not entitled to nonrecognition of the gain realized under \u00a7 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">Upon consideration of the briefs and oral arguments, and the entire record, we conclude that the findings of fact of the Tax Court are not clearly erroneous, <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 290-91, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960), and that its conclusions of law are correct for the reasons stated in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed. No costs are taxed. Each party will bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
