(Armco), alleging that he had been terminated from his employment on racial grounds in June of 1975. The District Court granted Armco\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>since suit was not filed within the 90-day period following receipt of the EEOC notice of right to sue, and also the suit was untimely under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 because filed over the 2-year prescriptive period provided by Texas law for such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Appellant received his notice of right to sue letter from the EEOC on July 19, 1977, a Tuesday. He began this action on October 19,1977, 92 days after the notice was received.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) requires that a complaint be filed within 90 days after receipt of a right to sue letter, and this 90-day period has been held to be jurisdictional. See <em>Pacheco v. Phelps Dodge Refining Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1976, 531 F.2d 709, and cases therein cited. The court may not extend this period, <em>Archuleta v. Duffy\u2019s Inc., </em>10 Cir. 1973, 471 F.2d 33, and an action filed within 91 days is still time barred, <em>Minor v. Lakeview Hospital, </em>E.D.Wis.1976, 421 F.Supp. 485. The court, therefore, had no jurisdiction over the action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 this action was also properly dismissed, since appellant alleges that his discharge was in June of 1975 and suit was not filed until October 19, 1977, some 2 years and 4 months later. Under <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), the state statute of limitations would apply. Vernon\u2019s Tex.Civ.Stat.Ann. Art. 5526 requires that an action be brought within 2 years of the act forming the basis of the suit. See <em>Dupree v. Hutchins Bros., </em>5 Cir. 1975, 521 F.2d 236; <em>Page v. U.S. Industries, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1977, 556 F.2d 346. Accordingly, the \u00a7 1981 action is some 4 months late. Appellant\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations was tolled by the pendency of his administrative complaint with the EEOC has been decided adversely to his position in <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">His other claim that the alleged discrimination should be treated as a continuing violation is invalid since termination of employment, either through discharge or resignation, is not a \u201ccontinuing\u201d violation that operates as a bar to the application of pertinent limitation periods for filing discrimination charges. <em>Olson v. Rembrandt Printing Co., </em>8 Cir. 1975, 511 F.2d 1228; <em>Terry (Leftwich) </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Brass Company, </em>7 Cir. 1975, 519 F.2d 806; <em>Rudolph v. Wagner Electric Corp., </em>E.D.Mo.1978, 445 F.Supp. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">. For purposes of computing this 90-day limitation period the first day is omitted and last day counted. <em>Geronymo v. Joseph Horne Co., </em>W.D.
