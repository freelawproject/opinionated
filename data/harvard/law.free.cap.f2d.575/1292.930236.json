We deny the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">The subpoena duces tecum ordered the attorney to bring with him certain books and papers which, he asserts, were delivered to him in his capacity as an attorney defending a client in a criminal investigation. The attorney brought the documents under seal to the district court, and requested an <em>in camera </em>examination by the district judge. The district judge examined the documents and ordered the attorney to comply with the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">The usual method for challenging a subpoena duces tecum or other order requiring the production of information after the court denies a motion to quash is to refuse to produce the information and then to appeal the judgment which follows the resulting contempt citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">The denial of the motion to quash is not itself an appealable order. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>402 U.S. 530, 91 S.Ct. 1580, 29 L.Ed.2d 85 (1971); <em>Cobbledick </em>v. <em>United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">An attorney need not, however, surrender his client\u2019s documents and wait for the client\u2019s appeal from a judgment of conviction to test the asserted claims of privilege. <em>Maness v. Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 460-461, 95 S.Ct. 584, 42 L.Ed.2d 574 (1975). A contempt judgment for refusal to comply with the subpoena is appealable, and is both the statutory way and the orderly way to bring a question of this character before the court of appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826. To move in this court to stay an interlocutory order by the district court in a case of this kind is premature. Such motions proliferate piecemeal appeals without a compensating expedition of the work of either the district court or of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-10\">An attorney may assert before the grand jury the attorney-client privilege with regard to documents if two conditions are met: (1) the documents have been turned over by the client in the course of seeking legal advice, and (2) the client would be entitled to assert a privilege if the documents were in his possession. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 391,403-05, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1975); <em>United States v. Osborn, </em>561 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-11\">The government has stipulated that the documents at issue were turned over for the purpose of seeking legal advice, so the attorney\u2019s assertion of the attorney-client privilege turns solely on whether the client could successfully invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in the circumstances of this case if the subpoena were directed to him. <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S., at 405, 96 S.Ct. 1569. That matter can be addressed, if necessary, in contempt proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">The temporary stay heretofore granted pending the oral argument in this case is vacated, the motion is denied, and the matter is remanded to the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
