We remand to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as the successor to the FPC,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> for consideration of whether such compensation should be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">The issue arises out of orders of the FPC relating to two successive interim curtailment plans for the interstate natural gas pipeline transmission system of Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia). The appeal is by Elizabethtown Gas Co. (Elizabethtown), one of the public utilities that buys natural gas from Columbia for resale to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">Elizabethtown opposed each of the plans on the ground that it unfairly failed to compensate the customers of Columbia which received less than their pro rata <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>share of gas. The Commission approved the plans, rejecting Elizabethtown\u2019s claim on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act to order or approve any curtailment plan that included a compensation feature. The appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">As indicated at the outset, in our view, the Commission does have the power to require compensation as part of a curtailment plan. We remand for a determination in appropriate proceedings whether or how this power should be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"aao-dedup-0\">The procedural background of these pending appeals is of considerable complexity. To aid reader understanding, we have presented that background in some detail in Appendix A to this opinion, and confine ourselves at this point to a brief statement that Elizabethtown contends that the interim curtailment plans approved by the FPC are unlawful (as constituting undue preference and for other reasons) because the plans do not provide a compensation feature, whereby purchasers who receive more than their pro rata share of gas pay a surcharge, and purchasers who receive less than their pro rata share of gas receive compensation out of the proceeds of the surcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">II. COMMISSION\u2019S AUTHORITY TO EMPLOY A COMPENSATION PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">On the merits, these appeals pose the question whether the FPC was correct in its construction of the Natural Gas Act, when it determined that a compensation scheme is impermissible under the Act as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">As set forth in Appendix A, the Commission\u2019s position emerged in these proceedings in the course of procedural rulings in the handling of a Columbia plan that contained a compensation feature. Columbia then dropped the compensation feature (\u201cunder duress\u201d) in the next interim plan(s) proposed to the FPC, and those interim plans were in due course approved. The FPC has rejected Elizabethtown\u2019s petitions for rehearing, which sought a compensation feature, and in doing so has relied on its opinion in the <em>Transco </em>case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another opinion and order of the Commission to similar effect has been reversed by the Fifth Circuit and certiorari has been denied. <em>Mississippi Public Service Commission v. F P C, </em>522 F.2d 1345 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 870, 97 S.Ct. 181, 50 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Although the procedural situation is complicated almost beyond belief, we find the issue on the merits to be relatively simple. In brief, we agree with the reasoning of Judge Bell in <em>Mississippi Public Service Commission, </em>and with his reliance upon the language of the Supreme Court in <em>F P C v. Louisiana Power and Light Company, </em>406 U.S. 621, 92 S.Ct. 1827, 32 L.Ed.2d 1723 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">In the latter case, the Court dealt with a somewhat different issue \u2014 that of the Commission\u2019s authority to regulate curtailment of direct interstate sales of natural gas\u2014 but its construction of the Act is relevant to the case at bar. In finding authority for such curtailment in the Commission\u2019s <em>transportation </em>jurisdiction, the Court noted that the Commission has broad powers to meet its responsibilities under that aspect of its jurisdiction. The Commission</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">must be free, \u201cwithin the ambit of [its] statutory authority, to make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances.\u201d <em>F P C v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 586, 62 S.Ct. 736, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (1942). Section 16 of the Act assures the FPC the necessary degree of flexibility in providing that: \u201cThe Commission shall have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>power to perform any and all acts, and to prescribe, issue, make, amend, and rescind such orders, rules, and regulations as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this act . . .\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717o. In applying this section, we have held that \u201cthe width of administrative authority must be measured in part by the purposes for which it was conferred . ' . . . Surely the Commission\u2019s broad responsibilities therefore demand a generous construction of its statutory authority.\u201d <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 776, 88 S.Ct. 2050, 20 L.Ed.2d 1379 (1968) . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">406 U.S. at 642, 92 S.Ct. at 1839.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">No compensation feature was involved in the curtailment plan at issue in <em>Louisiana Power and Light </em>That case did, however, turn on an expansive view of the Commission\u2019s latitude to make \u201cpragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances,\u201d and the statutory grant of \u201cnecessary degree of flexibility\u201d as necessary or appropriate to further the Congressional objective. In our view, this embraces the authority to employ a compensation feature as part of a curtailment plan where necessary or appropriate to promote the policies of the Natural Gas Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Implicit in the Commission\u2019s handling of the case at bar is its view that it was inconsistent to require a purchaser to provide for compensation in order to obtain rights to- deliveries of natural gas when those deliveries were properly allocated to him. The Commission argues, for example, that a compensation scheme, by rewarding low priority users and penalizing high priority users, is \u201cinconsistent with the theory and purpose of end use curtailment.\u201d (Br. at 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">In human affairs generally our society owns a deep-seated conviction that, to use Emerson\u2019s words in the influential essay on Self-Reliance, a man should not be required to \u201cpay for a privilege where [he has] intrinsic right.\u201d That principle does not answer the question, however; it rather bids us to focus on defining the \u201cright\u201d that is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">The decision that a system of priorities is mandated by fundamental policy considerations does not, in our view, necessarily imply that priority status should be entirely unburdened. The question of whether, and how, to provide compensation may well turn on the fairness of balancing the benefit accorded a high-priority purchaser with a charge that offsets, at least in part, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>added expense imposed by a curtailment plan upon a lower-priority purchaser.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not attempt to resolve this question on the present facts. We hold, merely, that it is open to the Commission to consider employing a compensation feature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">In order that the Commission may proceed, on the premise of legal authority, to consider whether and how a compensation feature should be or should have been included, we remand for further consideration by the Commission, in appropriate proceedings, of an interim curtailment plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\"><em>So </em>ordered<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">APPENDIX A: PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">On December 15, 1971, Columbia filed with the Commission a curtailment plan providing for pro rata curtailment of large wholesale customers in the event of gas shortages. The plan included an exemption from curtailment to protect residential and commercial service, and a compensation provision to reimburse customers who might suffer greater than pro rata curtailment as a result of the exemption provision. After a period of suspension by the Commission, the plan was made effective on Columbia\u2019s motion as of April 1, 1972, and continued in effect until November 1,1972.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">1972 INTERIM PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"Aug\">On September 29, 1972, the Commission approved an interim settlement curtailment plan with similar provisions, to be effective until July 1, 1974. Under this plan, buyers who took advantage of the exemption provision to purchase more than their pro rata share of gas were subject to a surcharge on such exempt volumes of $1.65 per Mcf during the months of November through March, and 50$ per Mcf during the months of April through October. The proceeds of this surcharge were to be used by Columbia to compensate the purchasers who, in ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>feet, freed up the exempt volumes by receiving less than their pro rata share of gas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The .compensation feature was intended by Columbia to \u201cprovide[ ] an incentive for its customers to develop their own peak shaving facilities, ... to preclude customers from requesting exempt volumes except when actually needed to protect firm non-industrial loads, and [to] compensate[] customers providing the exempt volumes for using their own peak shaving facilities.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">1974 INTERIM PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"ACl\">On June 6, 1974, the Commission granted Columbia\u2019s motion to extend this interim curtailment plan until April 30, 1975.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, on January 24, 1975, and March 25, 1975, the Commission, acting on the complaint of Washington Gas Light Company (WGL) (a customer of Columbia), issued orders reflecting a change in its appraisal of the compensation feature. While the mandate of these orders was simply to set a date for formal hearing of WGL\u2019s complaint, the Commission\u2019s language made it clear that it now regarded the compensation feature as illegal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Columbia\u2019s 1974 interim curtailment plan was due to expire on April 30, 1975. On April 1, 1975, Columbia filed a motion with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the Commission requesting an extension of that interim curtailment plan for six months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of the Commission\u2019s new appraisal of the compensation provision, however, Columbia felt that it had \u201cno alternative but to propose an extension of its interim plan as modified to exclude said compensation features.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Columbia expressed disagreement with the Commission\u2019s determination of illegality, but stated that it felt itself \u201cunder duress\u201d of the Commission\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">By order of April 25, 1975, the Commission granted Columbia\u2019s motion to extend the 1974 interim plan, (modified to delete the compensation feature) for a six-month period ending October 31, 1975.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Elizabeth-town\u2019s application for rehearing was denied, and it filed an appeal with this court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">1975 INTERIM PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"Axgr\">Because of continuing doubts as to when a permanent curtailment plan for Columbia would be approved, Columbia and Armco Steel Corporation presented to the Commission on July 2, 1975, competing proposals for a new interim curtailment plan, to take effect beginning November 1, 1975. Both of these proposals effected curtailment through a system of priorities of service (ranging from high-priority residential service to low-priority large-volume industrial boiler fuel use) rather than through the pro rata cutback approach, with exemptions, employed in Columbia\u2019s earlier curtailment plans. Elizabethtown opposed both proposals because of their failure to include a compensation provision to ameliorate what Elizabethtown regarded as disproportionate allocations of shortages.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">By order of October 31, 1975, the Commission prescribed Columbia\u2019s 1975 Plan as an interim curtailment plan for the period November 1, 1975 through March 31, 1976 \u201cand thereafter subject to further order of the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It rejected the contentions of Elizabethtown concerning the need for a compensation provision, referring to its previously expressed views on this matter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Elizabethtown applied for rehearing on the ground <em>inter alia, </em>that this curtailment plan created undue preferences, and lacked a compensation feature that would redress these preferences and induce the favored buyers to exercise self-help.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>By order of March 26, 1976, the Commission denied Elizabethtown\u2019s application for rehearing. Elizabethtown filed an appeal with this court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> asking that the Commission be required to institute a compensation feature, retroactive to November 1, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b958-23\"> See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 et seq., \u00a7 7295(c) (Supp. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\">.

In finding that the FEA had authority under \u00a7 4(a) of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 628, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(a) (1976), to promulgate the Old Oil Entitlements Program, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.67, the court held that \u201c[a] proper interpretation of the Allocation Act and its provisions requires recognition of the fact that the authority under Section 4(a) must be read together with the objectives [set forth in Section 4(b)] which the exercise of that authority is to obtain.\u201d 529 F.2d at 1022.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">In <em>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v.

(As explained in Appendix A, that is the period governed by the 1974 interim curtailment plan, as extended in time and modified to omit the compensation feature originally in Columbia\u2019s 1974 plan.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">Elizabethtown\u2019s response develops a contention that the 1974 plan, as modified, presents a live issue because its disposition affects the proper handling by the Commission of the 1975 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">In <em>American Smelting and Refining Co. v.

Under the approach there enunciated, the proponent of an existing plan would, indeed,-enjoy some advantage deriving from considerations of burden of proof. But we dealt there with an existing plan; here, by contrast, the curtailment plan challenged in No. 75-1767 expired of its own force. Elizabethtown cannot, consequently, derive any procedural advantage from <em>American Smelting </em>on remand. Naturally, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact will be required to meet the substantial evidence test, and its action in settling upon a new interim curtailment plan must not be arbitrary or capricious.
