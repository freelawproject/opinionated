The taxpayer asserts numerous issues in this appeal' from the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We find them all to be without merit and affirm the judgment of the district court. A brief discussion of several of these points follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-27\">Taxpayer filed his federal income tax returns for 1974 and 1975 and \u201cdid complete it up to the point wherein [taxpayer] determined that to provide information might tend to incriminate [taxpayer].\u201d R. 7. He thereafter went on the offensive and filed this suit seeking judicial determination of the constitutionality of the income tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Neither injunctive nor declaratory relief are available to the taxpayer in this case. The very language of the Declaratory Judgment Act precludes a federal court from giving relief in actions involving federal taxes. 28- U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. Injunctive relief is also barred under the terms of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). See <em>Hartman v. Switzer, </em>376 F.Supp. 486 (W.D.Pa.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Taxpayer asserts that the Tax Court of the United States is unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit has already considered this contention and found it to be without merit. <em>Nash Miami Motors, Inc. v. C. I. R., </em>358 F.2d 636 (5th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. den., </em>385 U.S. 918, 87 S.Ct. 227, 17 L.Ed.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Finally, taxpayer contends that the questions on the individual income tax return are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court recently stated that \u201cthe questions in [an] income tax return [are] neutral on their face and directed at the public at large,\u201d <em>Garner v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 648, 660, 96 S.Ct. 1178,1186, 47 L.Ed.2d 370, 381 (1976) citing <em>Albertson </em>v. <em>SACB, </em>382 U.S. 70, 79, 86 S.Ct. 194, 15 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965), and thus not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Finding these and all other issues raised to be without merit, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
