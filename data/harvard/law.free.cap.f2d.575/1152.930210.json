The arrest had been made as a result of an eyewitness to the robbery who identified Sylvester Tate as the bank robber and also took down the license number of the rented car. These, plus other proofs, were more than sufficient to sustain the jury verdict of guilty as to both appellants, and we find no reversible error in the trial proceedings or the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-23\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
