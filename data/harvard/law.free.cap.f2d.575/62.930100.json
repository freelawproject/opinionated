Longman, </em>102 Eng. Rep. 138,140 (K.B.1801), <em>quoting Sayre v. Moore </em>(Hil.1785).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The necessity of balancing these divergent concepts is illustrated in this case in which we are asked to determine whether an artist infringed a copyright, which he had once owned, by painting another work portraying the same general subject matter. The district court found no infringement and, being in agreement, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In a series of suits and cross suits, Albert Earl Gilbert and Franklin Mint Corporation were accused of infringing on the purported copyright of National Wildlife Art Exchange, Inc. to a painting, \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom.\u201d After a bench trial, the district court found that the copyright was valid, but there had been no copying and, consequently, no infringement. Companion cases of defamation, disparagement, and unfair competition were also decided by the district court but have not been pursued on these appeals, which are confined to the infringement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">In late July or early August, 1972 Ralph H. Stewart began to implement a plan of organizing a business enterprise which would publish and market limited edition prints of wildlife. He telephoned Gilbert, a nationally recognized wildlife artist, and asked him to paint a water color of cardinals. Gilbert agreed and in the following months completed \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom,\u201d using as source material color slides, photographs, sketches, and two stuffed cardinal specimens. He signed and dated the painting, and placed a copyright notice on it before August 25, 1972, the day when Stewart came to the artist\u2019s residence and approved the rendition. While there, Stewart gave Gilbert a check in the amount of $1,500, bearing on the back a notation, \u201cFor Cardinal painting 20 X 24 including all rights \u2014 reproduction etc.\u201d On the following day, Stewart and Gilbert discussed a proposal to incorporate National Wildlife Exchange, Inc. to market prints of Gilbert\u2019s future works. They agreed in general on the plan but it was understood that at a later date attorneys for both parties would draw up a contract in terms meeting their approval. Gilbert endorsed Stewart\u2019s check and cashed it on August 28, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Early in September, 1972, Gilbert delivered the painting to Stewart. That same month, Stewart incorporated National and transferred the painting to it. In connection with his activities for National, an outline of the design of \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom\u201d was embossed on his white business cards. No color was applied to the design and no copyright notice was printed on the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">National placed a representation of the painting in the fall 1972 Newsletter to Members of the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology. No copyright notice of National was affixed but Gilbert\u2019s was visible. National published a brochure encap-tioned \u201cIntroducing a First,\u201d in December, 1972 which sought orders for prints of \u201cCar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>di\u00f1\u00e1is on Apple Blossom,\u201d and in the next month, it distributed an edition limited to 300 prints of the painting. All bore Gilbert\u2019s copyright notice. A year later, National filed for copyright registration of \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom\u201d which was subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Gilbert and National ultimately were unable to agree upon terms of the business venture discussed in August of 1972, and in January, 1975, Gilbert agreed to paint a series of four water color birdlife pictures, including one of cardinals, for Franklin Mint Corporation. The series was completed in January of 1976, and included a work entitled \u201cThe Cardinal.\u201d Franklin made engravings of the four paintings which were sold as a group and not separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In painting \u201cThe Cardinal,\u201d Gilbert used some of the same source material he had utilized for \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom,\u201d including preliminary sketches from his collection, photographs, slides, and a working drawing. In addition, however, he used other slides of foliage taken after comple'tion of the earlier painting and sketches specifically developed for \u201cThe Cardinal,\u201d as well as a series of cardinal photographs. He did not use the stuffed bird specimens which had served as models for \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">After hearing extensive testimony and viewing Gilbert\u2019s rendition of a cardinal painted in the courtroom during the trial, the district judge found that the artist had not copied \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom\u201d when he painted \u201cThe Cardinal.\u201d The court also determined that title to the copyright of \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom\u201d passed to Stewart when he purchased the painting with the $1,500 check bearing a limited endorsement. In addition, the court ruled that distribution of Stewart\u2019s business card did not constitute a publication without notice which would forfeit National\u2019s copyright protection. And, since Gilbert\u2019s copyright notice appeared on the picture in the Cornell bulletin, the court decided that no forfeiture occurred by such publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Unlike a patent, a copyright protects originality rather than novelty or invention \u2014 conferring on the owner the sole right to reproduce the work and to \u201ccontrol all the channels through which work or any fragments of work reach the market.\u201d Chafee, <em>Reflections on the Law of Copyright: I, </em>45 Colum.L.Rev. 501, 505 (1945). It has been said: \u201cOriginality in this context \u2018means little more than a prohibition of actual copying.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, </em>191 F.2d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 1951) (citations omitted).. If there is no copying, there can be no infringement. <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>347 U.S. 201, 218, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954); <em>Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Salkeld, </em>511 F.2d 904 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Pinchock, </em>423 U.S. 863, 96 S.Ct. 122, 46 L.Ed.2d 92 (1975); <em>Alfred Bell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Catalda Fine Arts, supra, </em>at 103 &amp; n.16. Copying done from memory is as objectionable as that done by tracing or direct view, <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. </em>v. <em>Kalpakian, </em>446 F.2d 738, 741 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Wihtol v. Wells, </em>231 F.2d 550 (7th Cir. 1956). Circumstantial evidence of access to the protected work and substantial similarity between it and the alleged infringing work can be used to infer copying when direct evidence is lacking. <em>See Reyher v. Children\u2019s Television Workshop, </em>533 F.2d 87 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 980, 97 S.Ct. 492, 50 L.Ed.2d 588 (1976); <em>Arnstein v. Porter, </em>154 F.2d 464, 468 (2d Cir. 1946), <em>cert. denied, </em>330 U.S. 851, 67 S.Ct. 1096, 91 L.Ed. 1294 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">To reconcile the competing societal interests inherent in the copyright law, copyright protection has been extended only to the particular <em>expression </em>of an idea and not to the idea itself. <em>See Mazer v. Stein, supra, </em>347 U.S. at 217-18, 74 S.Ct. 460; <em>Baker v. Selden, </em>101 U.S. 99, 102-03, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879). In <em>Dymow v. Bolton, </em>11 F.2d 690, 691 (2d Cir. 1926), the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201cJust as a patent affords protection only to the means of reducing an inventive idea to practice, so the copyright law protects the means of expressing an idea; and it is as near the whole truth as generalization can usually reach that, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>same idea can be expressed in a plurality of totally different manners, a plurality of copyrights may result and no infringement will exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>See also </em>Comment, <em>\u201cExpression\u201d and \u201cOriginality\u201d in Copyright Law, </em>11 Washburn L.J. 440 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Since copyrights do not protect thematic concepts, the fact that the same subject matter may be present in two paintings does not prove copying or infringement. Indeed, an artist is free to consult the same source for another original painting. As Justice Holmes stated: \u201cOthers are free to copy the original [subject matter]. They are not free to copy the copy.\u201d <em>Bleistein </em>v. <em>Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>188 U.S. 239, 249, 23 S.Ct. 298, 299, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Precision in marking the boundary between the unprotected idea and the protected expression, however, is rarely possible, <em>see Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin Weiner Corp., </em>274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir. 1960); <em>Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., </em>45 F.2d 119,121 (2d Cir. 1930), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 U.S. 902, 51 S.Ct. 216, 75 L.Ed. 795 (1931), and the line between copying and appropriation is often blurred. Troublesome, too, is the fact that the same general principles are applied in claims involving plays, novels, sculpture, maps, directories of information, musical compositions, as well as artistic paintings. Isolating the idea from the expression and determining the extent of copying required for unlawful appropriation necessarily depend to some degree on whether the subject matter is words or symbols written on paper, or paint brushed onto canvas.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Moreover, in the world of fine art, the ease with which a copyright may be delineated may depend on the artist\u2019s style. A painter like Monet when dwelling upon impressions created by light on the facade of the Rouen Cathedral is apt to create a work which can make infringement attempts difficult. On the other hand, an artist who produces a rendition with photograph-like clarity and accuracy may be hard pressed to prove unlawful copying by another who uses the same subject matter and the same technique.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A copyright in that circumstance may be termed \u201cweak,\u201d <em>see First American Artificial Flowers, Inc. v. Joseph Markovits, </em>342 F.Supp. 178, 186 (S.D.N.Y. 1972), since the expression and the subject matter converge. <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, supra. </em>In contrast, in the impressionist\u2019s work the lay observer will be able to differentiate more readily between the reality of subject matter and subjective effect of the artist\u2019s work. The limitations imposed upon the artist by convention are also factors which must be considered. A scientific drawing of a bird must necessarily be more similar to another of the same nature than it would be to an abstract version of the creature in flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The \u201ccopying\u201d proscribed by copyright law, therefore, means more than tracing the original, line by line. To some extent it includes the appropriation of the artist\u2019s thought in creating his own form of expression. In <em>Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Salkeld, supra </em>at 907, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201cTo establish a copyright infringement, the holder must first prove that the defendant has copied the protected work and, second, that there is a substantial similarity between the two works. . . . Phrased in an alternative fashion, it must be shown that copying went so far as to constitute improper appropriation, the test being the response of the ordinary lay person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">In that case, the district court had found copying but made no specific finding that would meet the second test \u2014 \u201cthat of substantial similarity in the sense of an appropriation of the original work.\u201d Copying which had been determined by dissection of the two works at issue was not sufficient, we said, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201csubstantial similarity to show that the original work has been copied is not the same as substantial similarity to prove infringement. As the <em>Arnstein </em>case points out, dissection and expert testimony in the former setting are proper but are irrelevant when the issue turns to unlawful appropriation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>testimony was presented by experts for the respective parties to support and refute substantial similarity. There are indeed obvious similarities. Both versions depict two cardinals in profile, a male and a female perched one above the other on apple tree branches in blossom. But there are also readily apparent dissimilarities in the paintings in color, body attitude, position of the birds and linear effect. In one, the male cardinal is perched on a branch in the upper part of the picture and the female is below. In the other, the positions of the male and female are reversed. In one, the attitude of the male is calm; in the other, he is agitated with his beak open. There is a large yellow butterfly in \u201cCardinals on Apple Blossom,\u201d and none in \u201cThe Cardinal.\u201d Other variances are found in the plumage of the birds, the foliage, and the general composition of the works. Expert testimony described conventions in ornithological art which tend to limit novelty in depictions of the birds. For example, minute attention to detail of plumage and other physical characteristics is required and the stance of the birds must be anatomically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There was also testimony on the tendency of some painters to return to certain basic themes time and time again. Winslow Homer\u2019s schoolboys, Monet\u2019s facade of Rouen Cathedral, and Bingham\u2019s flatboat characters were cited. Franklin Mint relied upon these examples of \u201cvariations on a theme\u201d as appropriate examples of the freedom which must be extended to artists to utilize basic subject matter more than once. National vigorously objects to the use of such a concept as being contrary to the theory of copyright. We do not find the phrase objectionable, however, because a \u201cvariation\u201d probably is not a copy and if a \u201ctheme\u201d is equated with an \u201cidea,\u201d it may not be monopolized. We conceive of \u201cvariation on a theme,\u201d therefore, as another way of saying that an \u201cidea\u201d may not be copyrighted and only its \u201cexpression\u201d may be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The district court had the opportunity to hear the testimony from the artist and found credible his statement that he did not copy. For further support, Gilbert painted a third picture, \u201cThe Cardinal,\u201d while in the courtroom and without referring to either of his earlier paintings. The court determined that although some of the same source materials were used in all three paintings, similarity between the works necessarily reflected the common theme or subject and each painting was a separate artistic effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">It is well settled that credibility determinations are uniquely the province of the fact-finder. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Gereau, </em>502 F.2d 914, 921 (3d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 909, 95 S.Ct. 829, 42 L.Ed.2d 839 (1975). Although evidence of access and similarity between the paintings constitute strong circumstantial evidence of copying, they are not conclusive, <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, supra, </em>2 M. Nimmer on Copyright, \u00a7\u00a7 139.4 at 605, 141.2 at 613-14 (1976). The trial court\u2019s finding of no copying, based as it is on the testimony-of the artist and other evidence of creativity, may be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Rosen v. Loew\u2019s Inc., </em>162 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1947). This situation is different from that in <em>Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Salkeld, supra, </em>where we passed on the question of similarity between the copyrighted and accused work <em>after </em>copying had been established to determine if there had been appropriation. There, we were, in as good a position to make a judgment as the trial court. Here, however, we have not had the opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and, thus, are not in the position to judge credibility as was the district judge. Accordingly, we conclude that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>court did not err in finding that there was no copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Even if it be assumed that the trial court\u2019s finding was based only on an application of a mechanical standard of copying \u2014 a tracing concept \u2014 without consideration of the appropriation factor, we would affirm. We have examined the two paintings and based upon our own observations and impressions, we conclude that while the ideas are similar, the expressions are not. A pattern of differences is sufficient to establish a diversity of expression rather than only an echo. <em>Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Salkeld, supra; Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, supra </em>at 741-42. The similarities here are of a nature not calculated to discourage an artist in the development of a specialty yet sufficiently distinguishable to protect his creativity in that sphere. Just as Justice Holmes would not ban the ballerinas of Degas, we may not excommunicate the cardinals. <em>See Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., supra, </em>188 U.S. at 251, 23 S.Ct. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We conclude that the district judge did not err in finding that there was no copyright infringement. Consequently, we need not decide whether there was a forfeiture of the copyright by publication of the business cards. Similarly, since there was no infringement established, we do not address ourselves to the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that National had acquired Gilbert\u2019s copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">. <em>Compare Esquire, Inc. v.
