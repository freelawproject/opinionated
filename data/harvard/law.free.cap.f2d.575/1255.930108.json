The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 232 N.L. R.B. 62 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">Upon careful consideration of the record and of the briefs of the parties, the Court has concluded that the order of the agency is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and that no error of law appears. In our view, the Board correctly held that the union violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(i)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act by encouraging employees of a masonry subcontractor to refuse to perform services for their employer with an object of forcing him to cease doing business with an unorganized general contractor. <em>See NLRB v. Pipefitters, </em>429 U.S. 507, 97 S.Ct. 891, 51 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">The Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the union\u2019s motions for a bill of particulars, a continuance and a reopening of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">Accordingly, we enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
