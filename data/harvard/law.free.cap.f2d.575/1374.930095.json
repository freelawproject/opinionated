BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1448-25\">Plaintiff, a black employee at the Chal-mette, Louisiana plant of Kaiser Aluminum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>and Chemical Corporation (Kaiser), appeals from a judgment dismissing his individual and class claims of racial discrimination in employment. Finding errors of both fact and law in the dismissal at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">In July 1966, the named plaintiff, Harris Parson, filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e), claiming that Kaiser discriminated against him on the basis of his race in refusing to promote him to the position of foreman. Parson also alleged that Kaiser maintained racially segregated facilities and that, with the cooperation of the employees\u2019 bargaining representative, Local 225 of the Aluminum Workers International Union (Local 225),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied black employees equal opportunities for advancement. The EEOC found reasonable cause to believe that Kaiser and Local 225 engaged in discriminatory practices and, after attempting a cure by conciliation, issued Parson a right to sue notice in August 1967.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-8\">All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-15\">Parson brought suit in September 1967, seeking relief against Kaiser under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>Union for violations of Title VII and of the duty of fair representation imposed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>Another black employee, Arcell Williams, joined Parson in the suit, claiming that he had been discriminatorily discharged. Parson and Williams subsequently amended their complaint to include allegations of discriminatory employment practices against a class of black hourly employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After extensive and prolonged pretrial proceedings, the case came to trial in 1973. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the defendants moved under F.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for an involuntary dismissal on the ground that \u201cplaintiffs have shown no right to relief\u201d on either their individual or class claims. The District Court recessed the trial, dismissed Williams\u2019 claim and, in May 1974, some fourteen months later, dismissed Parson\u2019s individual suit and the class action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its findings of fact and conclusions of law issued under F.R.Civ.P. 52(b), the District Court held that no discrimination was present in any of the actions or practices asserted by the plaintiffs. Parson appeals on behalf of himself and the class he represents from the judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">Although the complaint alleged a variety of discriminatory practices,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the appeal is limited to the following findings and conclusions: defendant Kaiser did not discriminate against Parson by refusing to award him the promotion he sought; Kaiser did not discriminate against the class in making promotions to supervisory positions; Kaiser did not discriminate in providing training and opportunities for entry to craft positions; and Kaiser and the Union did not discriminate in the contractual procedures governing bidding and transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">We hold that as to each of these issues, the District Court erred in holding that no discrimination was evidenced and in dismissing the suit. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with the standards developed in this Circuit and the Supreme Court for judging claims of racial discrimination in employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-13\">\n<em>II. The Challenged Employment Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-14\">Kaiser is engaged in the production of aluminum from powered alumina at the Chalmette facilities. At the time of trial, the plant employed over 2,400 people, of whom approximately 20 percent were black. Kaiser has operated the Chalmette plant since 1951. At that time, blacks were hired only as laborers and the physical facilities of the plant were rigidly segregated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s essential claim at trial and on this appeal is that insufficient progress has been made since then to satisfy the requirements of the civil rights statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>\n<em>A. Promotions to the Position of Foreman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfU6\">The plaintiff presented evidence tracing the evolution of the procedures for selecting foremen from the hourly employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Until April 1966, Kaiser had no written procedures or standards governing such promotions. At that time, Kaiser adopted-a system requiring each shift foreman to evaluate the hourly employees under his supervision every six months and report the names of likely candidates. Those listed would be further screened by the general foremen and departmental superintendents, and if approved, would be administered two personnel tests, the Wonderlic Test and the How to Supervise Test. The candidates achieving sufficiently high scores would then be classified as \u201ctrainee foremen,\u201d a status that allowed them to replace absent permanent foremen and, depending on their success, to advance to a permanent position as openings occurred. Parson\u2019s application for promotion was considered one month after this procedure had been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">This system for considering applicants was modified in June of 1967 to ameliorate the requirement that an hourly employee could not become a candidate for a supervisory position without his immediate foreman\u2019s recommendation. The revised procedure required each foreman to submit the names of those employees who had indicated a wish to be promoted, \u201cbut whom the Foreman believes do not have the qualifications.\u201d An applicant not approved by either his shift foreman or the department superintendent was further reviewed by a committee authorized to reverse the previous decisions and allow the employee to take the personnel tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">The following year, Kaiser\u2019s program was revised, apparently to reflect and anticipate changes in the law of employment discrimination. The use of the Wonderlic Test for identifying qualified condidates was eliminated after a validation study designed to relate the tests to the demands of the job failed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1970, Kaiser further revised the selection methods by instituting a procedure for selecting permanent foremen. This procedure was based on annual evaluations and recommendations from immediate supervisors subject to review by general foremen and department superintendents. When vacancies occurred, the department superintendent and personnel relations superintendent would select candidates from the group judged qualified in the annual screening. These prospects were interviewed and a choice recommended for the final approval of the plant works manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-12\">The last revision in the selection procedure relevant to this litigation occurred in April 1972. For the first time, vacancies in shift foremen positions were posted on a central bulletin board. An hourly employee interested in the position requested an application form, and the applications, together with the written evaluation of the applicant\u2019s foreman, were screened by a committee that interviewed the leading candidates and made a final recommendation. The committee, which consisted of five persons, had a frequently changing membership, and in at least one instance documented in the record, the membership included blacks. In making its selections, the committee used a written list of criteria and standards. This list represents the first written standards guiding the selection of supervisors used at the Chalmette plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief paints the following statistical picture of Kaiser\u2019s foreman population.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In July 1965, when Title VII be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>came effective, there were 209 supervisors employed at the Chalmette plant, all of whom were white. Of these, over 150 served as shift foremen, the position to which Parson aspired. In July of 1965, Kaiser employed 1,873 hourly production workers, of whom 15 percent were black. In September 1971, when Kaiser filed its last responses to discovery motions, 164 shift foremen served at the plant, of whom 8, or less than 5 percent, were black.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At that time, more than 21 percent of Kaiser\u2019s hourly employees, and 29 percent of the hourly production workers, were black. Between July 1965 and September 1971, 9 blacks were promoted to shift foreman jobs. Between September 1971 and the time of trial, April 1973, 4 additional blacks were promoted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> All but one of this last group was selected under the 1972 selection procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">\n<em>B. Interdepartmental Transfers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">A Kaiser employee who desires to transfer to a position in another department must follow the procedures established by the contractual agreement between Kaiser and the Union. The Supplement Seniority Agreement [sic] of February 1, 1972, in effect at the time of trial, requires that vacancies for permanent jobs (except those openings subject to \u201cdepartmental job bids,\u201d discussed below) are to be posted at centrally located bulletin boards and that employees are to use a formal bidding system to apply for the openings. Success in transfer is determined by either plant seniority alone or by a combination of plant seniority and other qualifications. To assess the impact of these procedures, it is necessary to examine the development of the transfer and seniority systems before and after the effective date of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">Kaiser restricted blacks to menial positions \u2014 laborer and porter \u2014 from 1951 to 1956, when blacks were allowed to transfer to some production departments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Entry into production departments remained subject to other restrictions, however. A \u201cpassing\u201d score on the Wonderlic Test was required as a condition of entry to some of the production departments until 1968. Until 1962, departmental seniority determined eligibility for transfer and advancement: employees within a department would bid on vacancies on the basis of their relative length of service within that department. In 1962, plant seniority was substituted for departmental seniority as the bidding standard within the production departments, and in 1962, plant seniority was adopted as the standard in the craft departments as well. Under this system, an employee\u2019s eligibility for bidding is based on his total length of service at the Chalmette plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s major complaint as to the present transfer system is that employees transferring to a new department can bid only for entry level jobs in that department, usually the job of \u201cspare.\u201d Vacancies for positions above the entry level are posted only within that department and only em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>ployees already in the department are eligible to bid. A transferring employee must occupy the spare position in the new department for a minimum of ten days, during which time he may elect to return to his old job with no loss in pay, seniority, or eligibility for promotion in the old department. At the end of the ten-day trial period, the transferee is eligible to bid for vacancies that arise in the new department on the basis of his plant seniority. If the spare job pays less than the job from which the employee has transferred, he must take the cut in pay until a higher paying job in the new department becomes available and the employee is able successfully to bid for it. A departmental employee thus has preference over employees from other departments for promotion to all non-entry level vacancies within his department.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-4\">\n<em>C. Entry Into Craft Positions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The craft positions at issue come within the jurisdiction of the Power Maintenance Department and the Reduction Maintenance Department at the Chalmette plant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Most of the craft positions are filled without on-the-job training or apprenticeship programs. The following requirements are or have been conditions for entry to such positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\"><em>Prior experience. </em>Most of the craft jobs require previous experience in the craft involved. While the length and type of experience required varies from craft to craft, industrial experience is preferred. There is some evidence in the record that this requirement is not consistently applied and that decisions to waive or modify it are within the discretion of the supervisor involved in the hiring process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-10\"><em>Testing and educational requirements. </em>Beginning in 1959 and continuing until 1968, Kaiser required that an applicant achieve a certain score on the Wonderlic Test as a condition for entry to any craft position.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This requirement was dropped after a 1967 validation study indicated that the test could not satisfy the standards governing the permissible use of such employment devices.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Until 1968, Kaiser also required each applicant to take a written test relating to the skills of the particular craft involved. After these tests were eliminated, Kaiser used \u201cstructured interviews\u201d to examine applicants orally on the same information. Until 1970, a high school diploma was a prerequisite for entry into several of the crafts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-11\"><em>Training programs. </em>Kaiser adopted its first training program for craft jobs in April 1969. Under this program, which applied to the categories of electrician, instrument repairman, and mechanic, trainee jobs were open for plant-wide bidding. However, trainees were required to have completed two years of high school to be eligible for the mechanic program, to have a high school diploma for the other two craft programs, and to pass an aptitude test administered by the Louisiana State Employment Service. Two of the twelve craft trainees enrolled in the program after a little over one year of operation were black.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-12\">Parson draws on Kaiser\u2019s Affirmative Action Report for statistical information as to the impact of Kaiser\u2019s entry requirements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Of the craftsmen employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>1965, 3, or less than 1 percent, were black. In 1971, 8 out of 468 craftsmen, or approximately 2 percent, were black. At the time of trial, there were a total of 11 black craftsmen employed at the plant, all working in the Reduction Maintenance Department. While Parson concedes that complete figures as to employee turnover in the crafts since 1965 are not available, he convincingly uses Kaiser\u2019s 1970 Seniority List to provide a rough estimate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This list shows that Kaiser hired 22 of the 96 craftsmen in the Power Maintenance Department after 1965; 1 of the 22 was black. Of the 365 craftsmen in the Reduction Maintenance Department, 65 were hired after 1965, and of these, 3 were black.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">Parson bases his challenges to the District Court\u2019s findings on the premise that in each of the areas detailed \u2014 promotions to foreman, transfer, and entry to the crafts\u2014 he presented a prima facie case of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">\n<em>III. The District Court\u2019s Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aas-dedup-0\">\n<em>A. Parson\u2019s Individual Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">Harris Parson was hired as a laborer at the Chalmette plant in 1953. In 1961, he transferred to the Metal Products Department as a \u201cspare\u201d and in 1964 was promoted to the semiskilled job of furnace operator, one of the top jobs in the department. In June of 1966, Parson requested that he be considered for the position of temporary foreman, the first black in his department to ask for such a promotion. After his request was denied, Parson filed a complaint with the EEOC and subsequently brought this suit. At trial, and on this appeal, Parson claimed that his work record was excellent, that his union activities demonstrated leadership capabilities, and that the only reasons for the failure to promote him were his race and his outspoken efforts to hasten the integration of the plant\u2019s facilities. To support his claim of racial discrimination, Parson introduced evidence of the comparative qualifications of white men who were promoted shortly after Parson\u2019s request was denied; asserted that the procedures for awarding promotions themselves violated Title VII; and urged that statistics comparing the number of black and white foremen to the racial composition of the hourly employee population showed a pattern of discrimination in promotions at the plant. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the District Court Judge made the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-11\">\u201cThe testimony at trial revealed that Parson was considered for promotion to foreman but did not get the job because he did not possess or demonstrate the requisite attributes necessary to perform the job. Parson did not get the job of foreman not because he was black but rather because he was not qualified. In fact, other black men have made foreman and other salaried positions in a number of departments of the Chalmette Works.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVi\">[Appendix, Vol. I, at 25.] On this basis, the District Court Judge concluded that Kaiser had not discriminated against Parson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-12\">In reviewing the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, we are mindful of our limited authority under the clearly erroneous standard of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). However, we are equally mindful that the clearly erroneous standard does not apply to findings made under an erroneous view of controlling legal principles. <em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>5 Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 418, 423-24, <em>cert. denied, </em>1972, 406 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 815; <em>Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 348, 356 n. 15. We are also careful in discrimination suits, where the elements of fact and law become particularly inter-meshed, of the distinction between findings of subsidiary fact and findings of ultimate fact. A finding of nondiscrimination is a finding of ultimate fact that can be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>versed free of the clearly erroneous rule. \u201cIn reviewing the District Court\u2019s findings, therefore, we will proceed to make an independent determination of appellant\u2019s allegations of discrimination, though bound by findings of subsidiary fact which are themselves not clearly erroneous. [W]e must [also] determine whether there are requisite subsidiary facts to undergird the ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Causey v. Ford Motor Co., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 516 F.2d 416, 420-21 [citation omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">In a nonclass claim of employment discrimination under Title VII, the plaintiff carries the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. The elements of a prima facie case were delineated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677: (i) the complainant must belong to a protected minority; (ii) must apply and be qualified for a job for which the employer is seeking applications; (iii) be rejected for the job; and (iv) the employer must then continue to seek applicants with the complainant\u2019s qualifications. When a plaintiff meets these criteria, the burden shifts to the defendant to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision. If the defendant can meet this burden, the plaintiff must then prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 802-804, 36 L.Ed.2d at 677-79; <em>Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 555 F.2d 1251,1255. The District Court\u2019s only finding of fact as to Parson\u2019s claim is that \u201che was not qualified\u201d for the position of foreman. For the reasons outlined below, this finding cannot stand and cannot serve as the basis for a Rule 41(b) dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">The District Court Judge offered no hints as to. the basis for his finding that Parson was not qualified for promotion to the position of foreman. We are simply unable to determine whether the Judge found sufficient subsidiary facts to under-gird the ultimate finding that the decision not to promote Parson was not racially motivated or taken in retaliation for his involvement in racial relations at the plant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is therefore necessary for us to reverse the dismissal of Parson\u2019s claim and remand for an articulation of the basis for the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Parson was not qualified to become a foreman. This articulation is to include an examination of the comparative qualifications of nonblacks promoted to foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">The District Court Judge\u2019s finding is also tainted by an incorrect understanding of the legal principles applicable to individual claims of racial discrimination in employment. It is clear law in this Circuit and in the Supreme Court that statistics as to the racial composition of the defendant\u2019s work force must be considered in judging individual allegations of discrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number><em>Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>1977, 433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786, 798; <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396, 417; <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>1973, 411 U.S. 792, 805, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668; <em>Peters v. Jefferson Chemical Co., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 516 F.2d 447, 450-51, <em>Burns v. Thiokol Chemical Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1973, 483 F.2d 300, 306. Parson presented evidence showing a marked disparity between the number of black hourly employees and the number of black foremen at the time he sought his promotion. The three black foremen employed at that time were restricted to the supervision of janitors, a situation that did not change until the next year. There is no mention of these figures in the District Court\u2019s findings or conclusions, leaving us with no assurance that the evidence was accorded the probative value it was due. Indeed, the Judge\u2019s statement that \u201cother black men have been made foreman\u201d indicates that he gave little, if any, weight to the evidence of statistical disparities. Moreover, the two individuals the Trial Court Judge identified as black supervisors were appointed in 1969 and 1973 \u2014 long after Parson applied for and was denied a promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">Finally, we agree with Parson\u2019s contention that the District Court Judge erred in ignoring the impact of the procedure for awarding promotions that was in effect at the time Parson\u2019s application was denied. The Judge found that \u201c[t]he process for the selection of a foreman ... is untainted by any overtones of racial discrimination.\u201d However, the process described in the finding does not correspond to that in effect in 1966, but rather to the procedure as revised in 1972.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At the time Parson made his request, Kaiser gave shift foremen veto power over any applicant; required each applicant to take two written tests; and specified no substantive criteria for guiding selections.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The procedure in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>effect at the time relevant to Parson\u2019s claim evidences many of the characteristics that we have long held violative of Title VII. In <em>Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 348, 358-59, we found that the following aspects of a promotion procedure were invalid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-5\">(i) The foreman\u2019s recommendation is the indispensable single most important factor in the promotion process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-6\">(ii) Foremen are given no written instructions pertaining to the qualifications necessary for promotion. (They are given nothing in writing telling them what to look for in making their recommendations.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-7\">(iii) Those standards which were determined to be controlling are vague and subjective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-8\">(iv) Hourly employees are not notified of promotion opportunities nor are they notified of the qualifications necessary to get jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-9\">(v) There are no safeguards in the procedure designed to avert discriminatory practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">These factors result in \u201cprocedures which depend almost entirely upon the subjective evaluation and favorable recommendation of the immediate foreman.\u201d They are therefore \u201ca ready mechanism for discrimination against Blacks.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 359; <em>see also, Jenkins v. Caddo-Bossier Assoc. for Retarded Children, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 570 F.2d 1227, at 1229; <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron &amp; Pipe Co., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 211, 239 \u2014 41. The District Court Judge clearly erred in judging Parson\u2019s individual claim as if his promotion request had been processed under a procedure adopted six years later. We remand for a reevaluation under the standards that existed in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-11\">\n<em>B. Discrimination Against The Class: Promotions To Foreman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au7\">The District Judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-12\">the evidence quite clearly demonstrated that blacks occupy many salaried positions at the Chalmette Works. There was no evidence indicating any present effects of any past discrimination which may have existed and the evidence relating to the selection process for foreman currently in operation at the Chalmette Works revealed no obstacles, overt or subtle, which prevent blacks from being promoted to the position of foreman. In fact, the very selection process that permits an individual to initiate his application for foreman and to be reviewed by a diversified Selection Committee contains appropriate safeguards to insure that blacks will be given consideration equal to that of whites.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-15\">On the basis of this finding, the Judge concluded that Kaiser had not discriminated against the class in the selection of foremen since the effective date of Title VII. In so holding, the Judge ignored the continuing effects of the pre-1972 procedures for the selection of foremen; ignored the statistics relied on by the plaintiff to document these effects; and ignored testimony as to individual instances of discrimination. The incorrect legal foundation for the Court\u2019s finding requires us to reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-16\">We have already described the procedures for selecting foremen at Kaiser and some of the similarities between the procedures used prior to 1972 and those condemned in <em>Rowe. </em>After the effective date of Title VII, Kaiser\u2019s method of selecting foremen granted veto power to immediate supervisors, provided hourly employees little information as to the necessary qualifications for promotion; provided those making the decisions no written standards or criteria for guidance; incorporated a personnel test since found discriminatory in impact in a number of Title VII cases,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and provided insufficient safeguards for avoiding the influence of discrimination. In 1972, on \u201cthe eve of trial,\u201d <em>Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>457 F.2d at 359, Kaiser did alter its promotion procedures in ways that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>promise to mit\u00edgate the likelihood of discrimination. However, as we have noted before, \u201cactions taken in the face of litigation are equivocal in purpose, motive and permanence,\u201d <em>James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings Co., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 559 F.2d 310, 325 n.18, <em>cert. denied, </em>1978, 434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 767, 54 L.Ed.2d 781, quoting <em>Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 28, 33, and do not redress the grievances of those injured by the previous practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">While the 1972 revisions of the selection procedure are laudable, we do not find sufficient evidence in the record to convince us that these procedures are not discriminatory in operation, although fair in form. The record does not clearly describe the contents of the evaluation form used in the selection process,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and testimony as to the weight accorded the different criteria specified indicates that they may remain susceptible to the exercise of great discretion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> On remand, the District Court should determine whether the evaluation method places undue reliance on general character traits, such that complete subjectivity remains likely. See Wade <em>v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, </em>N.D.Miss., 1974, 372 F.Supp. 126, <em>aff\u2019d in relevant part, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 528 F.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-17\">The District Court\u2019s evaluation of the likelihood of injury suffered by members of the class by the pre-1972 promotion procedures was a finding that \u201cblacks occupy many salaried positions\u201d at the plant. This ignores the statistical context provided by the plaintiff. We have sketched the disparities between the numbers of black hourly and black salaried-employees, and between black and white salaried employees.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The paucity of black foremen and the concentration of blacks in nonsalaried positions constitute a substantial statistical discrepancy that could alone establish a prima facie case of unlawful racial discrimination. <em>International Brotherhood of Team</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number><em>sters v. United States, </em>1977, 431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396; <em>James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings Co., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 559 F.2d 310, 329; Wade v. <em>Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 528 F.2d 508, 516-17; <em>United States v.

In addition to Kaiser\u2019s use of invalid procedures through 1972, the acknowledged presence of pre-Act discrimination, and the statistical discrepancies, Parson presented testimony by individuals of their experiences under these procedures. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 339, 97 S.Ct. at 1856, \u201c[T]he individuals who testified about their personal experiences with the company brought the cold numbers convincingly to life.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of racial disparities in promotions to foreman after 1965, the exclusion of blacks from such positions prior to 1965, subjectively based promotion decisions by white supervisors after 1965, and the testimony by individual class members of discrimination they suffered, make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory practices in the selection of foremen. The District Court Judge erred in dismissing this aspect of plaintiff\u2019s case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On remand, the \u201conus of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion\u201d is now on Kaiser. <em>James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings Co., supra, </em>559 F.2d at 331; <em>United States v. Hayes International Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1972, 456 F.2d 112, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-16\">\n<em>C. Discrimination Against The Class: Interdepartmental Transfers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-17\">Plaintiff\u2019s appellate attack on the transfer system at the Chalmette plant is focused on the requirement that employees transferring to another department must enter at the lowest level job in the new department, with a likely accompanying reduction in pay.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The District Court Judge made the following findings as to the present system governing transfers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-18\">[T]his court finds that the seniority system employed by Kaiser does not \u201climit the employment and promotional opportunities of Negro employees\u201d nor does Kaiser deny \u201cNegro employees the same rights of transfer\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-19\">Although there was some testimony to the effect that blacks were excluded from some departments in the early 1950\u2019s, it was shown that by 1956, black employees had begun to transfer to almost every department at the Chalmette Works. There was also uncontroverted evidence that plant seniority was established for all purposes within the production departments by 1962 and that the same princi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>pie was applied in the craft departments by 1965. It was further shown that the seniority system in effect since 1962 allowed any employee to bid for a vacancy within his department on the basis of his total continuous plant seniority. It was further shown that, although there are lines of progression in the various departments, an employee is not required to bid up the line job by job, but rather he may bid to any job in the department for which there is a vacancy and in so doing may move around other employees who are junior to him by plant seniority. It was further shown that an employee wishing to transfer between departments, who is a successful bidder, enters the new department for a 10-day trial period and if he decides that he does not like the department or the job to which he has transferred, he has a right to return to his former job without losing any seniority. On the other hand, if he wishes to stay in the new department, after expiration of ten day period, the employee is free to bid on the basis of his qualifications and plant seniority on any vacanty in that department. The evidence established beyond a doubt that many black employees have taken advantage of these transfer opportunities and have rapidly advanced to higher paying jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-4\">This Court finds that the method of transfer from department to department at the Chalmette Works does not discriminate against the class. This Court further finds that there is no loss in an employee\u2019s seniority as a result of his transferring between departments and that there is full plant seniority carryover on all such transfers. It should also be noted that a substantial number of black employees, who testified at the trial, had reached the top jobs in their respective departments prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Such evidence clearly illustrates that the seniority system, as developed through the collective bargaining process, does not now nor did it historically exclude blacks or other employees from utilizing their plant seniority for transfer and promotion at the Chalmette Works.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">The Judge\u2019s findings as to the role of plantwide seniority are not challenged here. We recognize that the relatively early adoption of plantwide seniority that is carried with an employee who transfers between departments places Kaiser\u2019s system above many that we have seen in this Court. <em>E. g., James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fitting Co., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 559 F.2d 310, 317. However, we do not believe that the trial judge adequately responded to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the ten-day bottom entry requirement hampered the advancement of black employees from the laborer positions to which past practices once restricted them. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">The difficulty with the bottom entry requirement is that the transferring employee must remain in the spare or lowest position for ten days <em>or </em>until a vacancy in a higher job becomes available. Such a vacancy may arise within twelve days after the transfer. The discriminatory vice rests in the danger that a vacancy may not arise for months, or even years. We have held that similar plans that restrict transfer to entry level jobs and limit advancement to upper level jobs to persons already in the department are invalid. See <em>United States v. Hayes International Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1972, 456 F.2d 112, 117. Such a system gives the old seniority criterion a continuing discriminatory effect; blacks are kept at a disadvantage begun by the past practices that kept them out of the nonlaborer departments. Because the ten-day period in the spare position is a minimum rather than a maximum requirement, it does not sufficiently distinguish Kaiser\u2019s system from those we have found defective. We hold that the District Court\u2019s finding is based on a mistaken understanding of what constitutes the \u201cpresent effects of past discrimination,\u201d and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">Kaiser and the Union attempted to justify the bottom entry requirement by arguing that it trains transferring employees and allows them an opportunity to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>termine if they wish to remain in the new department. [R., Vol. IX, Doc. 191, at 113 (testimony of Kaiser\u2019s Industrial Relations Superintendent).] This argument invokes the so-called business necessity justification, which \u201cexcept[s] those few employment practices, which are <em>non-intentionally </em>discriminatory or neutral, but perpetuate the consequences of past discrimination, because of their overriding business necessity.\u201d <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., supra, </em>494 F.2d at 244 [emphasis in original].<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, this doctrine is very narrow. A practice which is demonstrably discriminatory in impact must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzW\">not only <em>foster </em>safety and efficiency, but must be <em>essential </em>to that goal. <em>United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>446 F.2d 652, 662 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>451 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972). In other words, there must be no acceptable alternative that will accomplish that goal \u2018equally well with a lesser differential racial impact.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\"><em>Id., </em>at n.87. In evaluating Kaiser\u2019s argument, the District Court Judge did not give sufficient consideration to whether the bottom entry requirement met this standard. On remand, this assessment must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">A Union is jointly liable with the employer for discrimination caused in whole or in part by the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Carey v. Greyhound Bus Co., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 500 F.2d 1372; <em>United States v. United States Steel Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 520 F.2d 1043 <em>cert. denied, </em>1976, 429 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 61, 50 L.Ed.2d 77. The transfer and bidding policies that we find deficient were part of the Supplement Seniority Agreement between Kaiser and the Union. [Appendix, Vol. II, at 288-292.] As the representative of the black employees, the Union is charged with the duty of protecting them from invidious treatment. \u201c[I]t would be difficult to fasten liability on one party to the labor contract which was a substantial cause of the discriminatory employment practices and grant total immunity from such liability to the other party.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 5 </em>Cir., 1974, 491 F.2d 1364, 1381. Any monetary liability imposed upon the employer must be shared by the Union. <em>See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>1975, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280; <em>United States v. United States Steel Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 520 F.2d 1043; <em>Myers v. Gilman Paper Co., </em>5 Cir., 1977, 544 F.2d 837, <em>modified, </em>556 F.2d 758, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>434 U.S. 801, 98 S.Ct. 28, 54 L.Ed.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">\n<em>D. Entry Into Craft Positions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-9\">After the plaintiff presented evidence as to the requirements conditioning entry to the crafts and the racial composition of the craft categories, the District Court found that: the testing procedures had been eliminated in 1968 and no evidence suggested \u201cthat but for the use of the tests prior to 1968, any member of the class would have obtained a higher paying position\u201d; \u201cthe requirement that applicants for crafts positions possess some experience does not discriminate against the class\u201d; and no evidence showed that Kaiser\u2019s \u201cmethods of training discriminated against the class.\u201d Because the District Court failed to consider critical aspects of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and applied incorrect legal principles, these findings must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-10\">The District Court Judge again appears to have ignored the statistical evidence. The plaintiff presented figures showing that in 1973, less than 3 percent of Kaiser\u2019s craftsmen were black. These numbers, when placed against the information as to the percentage and number of blacks among the hourly employees, are entitled to critical, if not dispositive weight, in assessing whether plaintiff has shown a prima facie case of discrimination. The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>argument is that these statistics demonstrate that Kaiser\u2019s practices with regard to selection of craftsmen contain elements of present discrimination and facially neutral policies that perpetuate past bias in hiring for craft positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Several of the incidents of past bias are recent \u2014 use of the Wonderlic Test through 1968, a written test until after 1968, and the requirement of a high school diploma. The practice challenged here is the requirement of prior industrial experience. Under Title VII, practices and procedures \u201ccannot be maintained if they operate to \u2018freeze\u2019 the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>1971, 401 U.S. 430, 91 S.Ct. 879, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158. \u201cIf an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id., </em>401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853. The statistical evidence, with the testimony by individual members of the class as to obstacles they encountered in seeking entry to the crafts, requires the conclusion that the plaintiff made a prima facie showing that the current system, with its prior experience requirement, is discriminatory in effect. Kaiser therefore has the burden of showing that the prior experience requirement has \u201ca manifest relationship\u201d to the legitimate needs of the craft positions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, </em>401 U.S. at 432, 91 S.Ct. at 854; see also <em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>5 Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">The plaintiff also challenged the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim of discrimination with regard to training programs for the crafts. At the time of trial, Kaiser imposed testing and educational requirements on applicants to the training programs, requirements which presumptively account for the disparities between the number of black and white craft trainees. Again, this is sufficient to give Kaiser the burden of showing that these eligibility requirements are justified by the needs of the programs. <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Co., supra. </em>The District Court erred in dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">\n<em>IV. Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">We have held that the District Court erred in dismissing the individual and class claims at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. On remand, the Trial Judge must determine the best method of completing the proceedings. However, the defendants should be allowed to present their evidence, and the District Court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to supplement the present record, in chief or by rebuttal, without being required to offer again the evidence already introduced.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">Because of the likelihood that practices may have altered since this case was first tried, and because the law has also changed, the District Court on remand must reexamine the evidence in light of the present law allocating burdens of proof in individual and class claims of employment discrimination in determining the existence of liability and the scope of necessary relief. However, the District Court must remain conscious that while Kaiser\u2019s recent affirmative action programs and modifications in past practices will clearly shape the nature of any prospective, injunctive relief,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>do not absolve Kaiser or the Union of liability for the injuries suffered by members of the class from the continuing impact of past discrimination. As we have clearly held, \u201c[o]nce a court has determined that a plaintiff or complaining class has sustained economic loss from a discriminatory employment practice, back pay should normally be awarded unless special circumstances are present.\u201d <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 211, 252-53; <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>1975, 422 U.S. 405, 413-425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 491 F.2d 1364, 1380.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">Plaintiff also claims that the appropriate remedies for discrimination in transfers and promotions are those designed to place the black employee in the position he would have occupied but for the discrimination suffered \u2014 that is, his \u201crightful place.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We agree that this comports with the \u201cmake whole\u201d approach of Title VII. Because of the early termination of the proceedings below, the District Court did not consider whether such remedies were necessary. On remand, the District Court is directed to consider the \u201crightful place\u201d theory, particularly with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint concerning the transfer system, in determining the need for and the scope of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">.

Parson\u2019s shift foreman, Jim Saucier, his general foreman, Jim Cruse, and the superintendent of the Metal Products Department, Paul Petit, testified at trial or through depositions introduced as evidence as to their reasons for denying Parson the promotion. Reports and memos by Saucier, Cruse, and Jim Mayeaux, who served as Parson\u2019s foreman for a short time during the relevant period, both contemporaneous with the decision against promoting Parson and prepared later in connection with EEOC proceedings or this suit, were also introduced. These sources contain several different grounds for Parson\u2019s failure to obtain his promotion, including inadequate performance as a furnace operator; inability to accept criticism; lack of loyalty to Kaiser; difficulties Parson might encounter with white subordinates; inability to take orders; and inability to plan well. R., Vol. II, 91-102, 104-116. Parson contests the validity of some of these statements, attacks others as clear indications that he was not r\u00abimoted because of his activities in attempting to desegregate the plant facilities (he lacked \u201cloyalty\u201d to the company, criticized the company, and could not \u201cget along\u201d with people); and identifies others as pretexts for racial discrimination. While the District Court Judge clearly has the task of evaluating the credibility of conflicting evidence and witnesses subject to the clearly erroneous rule, e. g., <em>Bolton v. Murray Envelope Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 493 F.2d 191, 193-94, his failure to make any factual findings as to why Parson was not qualified for the position of foreman makes it impossible for the plaintiff to attack or for us to review the result under the proper standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">. The District Cpurt Judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-5\">The process for the [selection of a foreman] by Kaiser is untainted by any overtones of racial discrimination. Although the post of foreman is not controlled by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as vacancies occur they are posted on the plant bulletin board and any employee can initiate, on his own behalf, an application for consideration as foreman. All applications for foreman are considered by a review board. Individuals who have initiated an application are reviewed and evaluated by a Management Committee composed of: the Industrial Relations Superintendent, the Employee\u2019s Supervisor, the Departmental Supervisor where the vacancy exists, the plant manager or his designee, and a Black representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">The procedure described here corresponds to that adopted by Kaiser in 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">.

Plaintiff was unable to provide record data with which to estimate turnover among foremen after 1965. However, proof of turnover is not part of a prima facie case of discrimination.

At that juncture of the litigation, it is unnecessarily complicating and cumbersome to compel any particular discriminatee to prove class coverage by showing personal monetary loss. What is necessary to establish liability is evidence that the <em>class </em>of black employees has suffered from the policies arid practices of the particular employer.
