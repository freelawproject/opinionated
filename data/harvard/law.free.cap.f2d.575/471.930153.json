United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal question to emerge on rehearing is whether some employees can obtain relief under \u00a7 1981 that is not available to them under Title VII. We hold that in this instance they cannot, and we modify our initial opinion and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Incumbent black employees who were discriminated against when hired before the effective date of Title VII in 1965 were subsequently prevented by the company\u2019s bargaining agreement from obtaining jobs as line drivers while maintaining their full company seniority. The district court\u2019s order provided relief to employees who suffered in this way from the present effects of pre-Act discrimination. Rehearing disclosed that the relevant provisions of the bargaining contract involved in this case and the one considered in <em>Teamsters </em>are virtually identical. Both contracts provided that employees could not carry their full company seniority for all purposes with them when they transferred to line driver positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In <em>Teamsters </em>the Court considered the effects of \u00a7 703(h) of the 1964 Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h)] on the contract\u2019s seniority system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">[W]e hold that an otherwise neutral, legitimate seniority system does not become unlawful under Title VII simply because it may perpetuate pre-Act discrimination. Congress did not intend to make it illegal for employees with vested seniority rights to continue to exercise those rights, even at the expense of pre-Act discriminatees. 431 U.S. at 353-54, 97 S.Ct. at 1864.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Therefore, <em>Teamsters </em>invalidates our af-firmance of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the company\u2019s seniority system violated Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">The employees assert, however, that \u00a7 703(h) is expressly limited to Title VII and that it should not be construed as a restriction on \u00a7 1981. They therefore insist that the seniority system violates their rights secured by \u00a7 1981 and that they are entitled to relief under that statute. It is this issue that we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, provides: All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not repeal by implication any part of \u00a7 1981. This is firmly established by both the legislative history of the 1964 Act and its 1972 amendments. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 457-61, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975); <em>cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 416 n.20, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968). Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>1981 affords a federal remedy against racial discrimination in private employment that is \u201cseparate, distinct, and independent\u201d from the remedies available under Title VII of the 1964 Act. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 461, 95 S.Ct. 1716. Thus an employee \u201cwho establishes a cause of action under \u00a7 1981 is entitled to both equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and, under certain circumstances, punitive damages.\u201d 421 U.S. at 460, 95 S.Ct. at 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This case therefore presents the question of whether the incumbent employees who were discriminatorily hired before 1965 when Title VII became effective have a cause of action under \u00a7 1981 because the bargaining contract\u2019s restriction of carryover seniority perpetuates the pre-1965 hiring discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of course, each pre1965 incumbent black employee had a cause of action under \u00a7 1981 because of the company\u2019s discriminatory hiring practices. But all parties recognize that this cause of action is barred by North Carolina\u2019s three year statute of limitations, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-52(1), which is made applicable to the \u00a7 1981 claim. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 462, 95 S.Ct. 1716.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"> The seniority provision of the bargaining contract was facially neutral, applying to both white and black employees if they transferred to the higher paying position of a line driver. Both black and white employees were subject to loss of their former departmental seniority and had to start at the bottom of the seniority list for line drivers even though they may have had more employment seniority than line drivers higher on the ladder. Consequently, \u00a7 1981 does not afford the black employees relief, because this statute confers on black persons only the same rights possessed by white persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Moreover, the application of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 does not lead to a different conclusion. Section 1988 directs federal courts to enforce \u00a7 1981 \u201cin conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable . . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1988 in itself does not create any cause of action, but it \u201cinstructs federal courts as to what law to apply in causes of action arising under federal civil rights acts.\u201d <em>Moor </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 703-06, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 1792, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973); <em>Scott v. Vandiver, </em>476 F.2d 238, 242 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">In <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), the Court held: \u201cUnder the [1964] Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to \u2018freeze\u2019 the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\u201d This concept is essential to the employees\u2019 suit. However, in <em>Teamsters v. United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 349, 97 S.Ct. 1843, the Court held that the <em>Griggs </em>rationale is not applicable to a seniority system that is lawful under \u00a7 703(h). Ordinarily, \u00a7 1988 enables a district court to utilize <em>Griggs\u2019 </em>interpretation of Title VII in a \u00a7 1981 employment discrimination suit, but the court cannot transgress the limitation placed on the <em>Griggs </em>rationale in <em>Teamsters </em>with respect to \u00a7 703(h). A ruling that a seniority system which is lawful under Title VII is nevertheless unlawful under \u00a7 1981 would disregard the precepts of \u00a7 1988. An analogous situation concerning the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u00a7 1988 is presented by <em>Moor v. County of Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), dealing with the enforcement of a \u00a7 1983 claim by utilization of a state law which made municipalities vicariously liable for the acts of their employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court held that such a state law could not be utilized to enforce the rights secured by \u00a7 1983 because it was inconsistent with federal law that excludes municipal corporations from liability under \u00a7 1983. 411 U.S. at 706, 93 S.Ct. 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Our conclusion accords with decisions that have held, although in different context, that \u00a7 1981 does not invalidate bona fide seniority provisions. <em>See, e. g., Chance v. Board of Examiners, </em>534 F.2d 993, 998 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Watkins v. United Steel Workers Local 2369, </em>516 F.2d 41, 49-50 (5th Cir. 1975); Waters v. <em>Wisconsin Steel Works, </em>502 F.2d 1309, 1320 n.4 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>cf. Patterson v. American Tobacco Co., </em>535 F.2d 257, 270 (4th Cir. 1976). It is also consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). <em>Johnson </em>emphasized that a party proceeding under \u00a7 1981 is not restricted by the administrative and procedural requirements of Title VII, but nothing in <em>Johnson </em>suggests that a practice lawful under Title VII can be held unlawful under \u00a7 1981. On the contrary, <em>Johnson </em>recognizes that Congress noted that Title VII and \u00a7 1981 are \u201cco-extensive\u201d and that they \u201caugment each other and are not mutually exclusive.\u201d 421 U.S. at 459, 95 S.Ct. at 1719. <em>Johnson </em>gives no indication, however, that Congress intended to create conflicting and contradictory standards for determining what constitutes illegal discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We therefore withdraw our mandate and direct that a new judgment issue consistent with this opinion. We remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of the claims made by those employees who were afforded relief on the basis of the seniority system that <em>Teamsters </em>later held to be lawful. The parties suggest that additional evidence may be necessary, and the district court should reopen the proceedings for this purpose. Although the union did not appeal from the entry of the injunction against it, we direct the district court to permit it to move for relief from this order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). The union\u2019s conduct in agreeing to the seniority system violated neither Title VII nor \u00a7 1981. Therefore, the judgment against it should be vacated. <em>See, Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 356, 97 S.Ct. 1843. In all other respects we affirm the district court for the reasons stated in our initial opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">. Our initial decision is reported as <em>Johnson v. Ryder Truck Lines, Inc., </em>555 F.2d 1181 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-13\">.

Theoretically, the same measure of retroactive seniority would be available to pre-1965 incumbents who sought linehaul jobs, but it would be of less value to them because they could not carry over their full employment seniority to their new job assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\">.

Where my reasoning differs from that of the majority is with respect to plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action under \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">I readily agree that under \u00a7 1981, standing alone, the plaintiffs\u2019 only cause of action was their initial discriminatory employment. Unlike Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)), which proscribes discriminatory hiring or firing of an employee <em>and </em>other discrimination with respect to \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1981 merely guarantees the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>black employee the same right to contract for his services \u201cas is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d The right guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 was denied when black employees were denied the right to be hired in certain classifications of jobs because of their race. But having obtained initial employment in classifications in which they were acceptable, I find no subsequent violation of \u00a7 1981 by reason of the seniority provisions of the bargaining contract. After initial employment, the right of blacks to contract was not abridged by reason of their race.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">As the majority describes, the seniority provision of the bargaining contract was facially neutral, applying to both white and black employees if they transferred to the higher paying position of line driver. Both black and white employees were subject to loss of their former departmental seniority and in the event of a transfer they would be required to start at the bottom of the seniority list for line drivers even though they may have had more employment seniority than line drivers higher on the ladder. The conclusion that the operation of the seniority provision of the bargaining contract to freeze blacks in the less desirable jobs for which they had been hired did not violate \u00a7 1981 is supported by <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers Local 2369, </em>516 F.2d 41, 49-50 (5 Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although <em>Afro-American Patrolmen\u2019s League v. Duck, </em>503 F.2d 294 (6 Cir. 1974), and <em>Macklin v. Spector Freight Systems, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 69, 478 F.2d 979 (1973), reach a different result, I am more persuaded by <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">If I am correct that the plaintiffs\u2019 sole claim under \u00a7 1981 was their original discriminatory employment, that claim was barred by North Carolina\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, as defendants pleaded in their answers to plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. <em>See </em>North Carolina Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-52(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Unlike the majority, I think that \u00a7 1988 has nothing to do with this case. The thesis of the majority is that \u00a7 1988 imports into \u00a7 1981 both Title VII and the judicial gloss which has been placed upon it. The majority says that by virtue of \u00a7 1988 the discriminatory practices and procedures of the company, including a facially neutral seniority system which perpetuates past dis-criminations, held to be a violation of Title VII in <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), are now also outlawed by \u00a7 1981. Stated more simply, \u00a7 1981, despite the limited scope of its language, now outlaws that which was proscribed under Title VII. But, the majority reasons, the limitation on <em>Griggs </em>articulated in <em>Teamsters, </em>as a result of \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, is also imported into \u00a7 1981 with the result that plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under \u00a7 1981. With this reasoning, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Section 1988 speaks of the \u201cexercise\u201d of the jurisdiction of the federal courts in civil and criminal matters conferred on them by the Civil Rights Acts and the \u201cenforcement\u201d of those statutes. It requires that both the exercise of jurisdiction and the enforcement of the substantive law be in conformity with the laws of the United States \u201cwhere such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect.\u201d But in all cases in which federal laws \u201care not adapt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ed to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable <em>remedies </em>[emphasis added], the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the State wherein the court ... is held . . . shall\u201d be applied \u201cso far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">I would stress that \u201cexercise\u201d of jurisdiction and \u201cenforcement\u201d refer to the <em>remedies </em>available and not to the threshold determination of whether a provision of the Act has been violated. Of course, I do not doubt that \u00a7 1988 imports into \u00a7 1981 many provisions of federal and state law to cover situations in which \u00a7 1981 is silent. A good example is the North Carolina statute of limitations which I think bars plaintiffs\u2019 recovery under \u00a7 1981 in the instant case. Incorporation of a state statute of limitations relates to remedy and not to the right to be enforced. In short, the provisions of state and federal law which are imported into \u00a7 1981 do not relate to the substantive proscriptions of \u00a7 1981; they relate solely to how remedies for acts illegal under \u00a7 1981, standing alone, are to be redressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Support for my view is found in both <em>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, </em>396 U.S. 229, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969), and <em>Moor v. County of Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). In <em>Sullivan </em>where the pertinent issue was the measure of damages to be applied for a violation of \u00a7 1982, the Court relied on \u00a7 1988 to authorize resort to the state rule which appeared best to serve the policies expressed in the federal statutes. What impresses me is the clear implication in both the majority and dissenting opinions that the sole effect of \u00a7 1988 is to provide a <em>remedy </em>for violation of the Civil Rights Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>Moor </em>is even more specific on the point. There the question was whether state law could be invoked under \u00a7 1988 to render a municipality liable for its violation of \u00a7 1983, notwithstanding that, under federal law, a municipality had been held not to be a \u201cperson\u201d amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983. The Court held that it could not, but significantly it rested its view not primarily or solely on the language of \u00a7 1988 which made inapplicable \u201cinconsistent\u201d state rules, but on the ground that \u00a7 1988 \u201cwas [not] meant to authorize the wholesale importation into federal law of state causes of action \u2014 not even one purportedly designed for the protection of federal civil rights.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 411 U.S. at 703-04, 93 S.Ct. at 1793.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">I recognize that <em>Moor </em>was concerned with the application of state law to expand the scope of one of the Civil Rights Acts, while in the instant case we are concerned with the use of federal law to give an expanded meaning to \u00a7 1981. But I see no ground for distinction in determining the purpose and effect of \u00a7 1988, and I therefore read <em>Moor </em>to hold that \u00a7 1988 does not incorporate into and expand \u00a7 1981 by the provisions of Title VII, with or without their judicial gloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">In summary, my reason for denying plaintiffs\u2019 recovery under \u00a7 1981 is that the only causes of action which plaintiffs have under \u00a7 1981 are time-barred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-15\">. Section 2000e -2(a)(2) also proscribes the limitation, segregation or classification of employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive them of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>employment opportunities or adversely affect their status as employees because of their race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>.

If the majority\u2019s citation of these cases is intended to constitute implied approval of their theory of implied repeal, I disassociate myself from this view. Because <em>Johnson v.
