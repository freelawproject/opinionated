Based upon our review of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that the Board\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence and that the Board applied the correct legal principles to the facts. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Board, and we grant the cross-petition for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">This is another in a series of cases growing out of the prolonged struggle between IOMMP and District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Association-Associated Maritime Officers, AFL-CIO (MEBA). Because a description of the conflict has been given so well by the Fifth Circuit in <em>International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>NLRB (Westchester Marine Shipping Co.), </em>539 F.2d 554 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 828, 98 S.Ct. 106, 54 L.Ed.2d 86 (1977), we need not set out the full history once again. It suffices to say merely that IOMMP and MEBA each represents licensed deck officers, and that the two are in intense competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">The facts giving rise to this appeal center upon IOMMP\u2019s <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> picketing of, and filing an in rem action against, the <em>Mount Explorer, </em>owned at the time in question by intervenor Cove Tankers Corporation (Cove).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Until early 1975, the <em>Mount Explorer </em>was called the <em>William J. Fields. </em>It was owned by the Syracuse Corporation, operated by the Texas City Tankers Corporation, and manned by licensed deck officers from IOMMP. The vessel was laid-up and sold to Cove, its IOMMP licensed deck officers having been compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-19\">After a period of time in a Galveston, Texas, layberth, the vessel emerged as the Mount <em>Explorer, </em>manned with licensed deck officers from MEBA. In late April 1975, the <em>Mount Explorer </em>docked at Brady Island and the Crown Oil refinery, both of which are in or near the Port of Houston, Texas. .At both facilities, the vessel was met with picket signs reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>WE HAVE A CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT COVERING THIS SHIP. IT WAS FORMERLY NAMED THE S/S WILLIAM J. FIELDS. IT IS NOW CALLED THE S/S MOUNT EXPLORER.

Exh.) 11, Appendix (App.) at 437. The lien was released after the filing of a $100,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>000.00 bond, and the <em>Mount Explorer </em>departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">In June 1975, the vessel returned to the Port of Houston, and was again subjected to picketing. The signs read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">WE ARE NOT CLAIMING ANY RIGHT TO THE JOBS ON THE S/S MOUNT EXPLORER.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AS A RESULT OF ITS HAVING BEEN OPERATED AS THE S/S WILLIAM J.

WE HAVE NO DISPUTE WITH ANY OTHER VESSEL AT THIS FACILITY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-14\">INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> OF MASTER MATES AND PILOTS OFFSHORE DIVISION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">In contrast to what happened in April 1975, the picketing managed to halt the loading of the ship. A temporary restraining order was obtained to halt the picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">The Board\u2019s general counsel brought unfair labor practice proceedings, charging that IOMMP\u2019s conduct had violated sections 8(b)(1)(B), 8(b)(4), and 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (b)(4),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (e)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (1970). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found for the general counsel, and, on appeal, the Board affirmed the sections 8(b)(1)(B) and 8(b)(4) violations, but dismissed the section 8(e) violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-21\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>(A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or to enter into any agreement which is prohibited by subsection (e) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">We perceive the principal issue as whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the underlying findings of fact. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)-(f) (1970). <em>See generally </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976); <em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Insofar as relevant to the contentions raised by petitioner on this appeal, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s determinations that the picketing and the filing of the in rem action were directed toward (1) replacement of the MEBA officers with IOMMP members, (2) recognition of IOMMP by Cove, (3) adoption of the standard-form IOMMP collective bargaining agreement by Cove. 224 N.L.R.B. 1626, 1633-35 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Strong evidence supporting the findings of fact may be found in the wording of the first set of picket signs: \u201cWe have a current collective bargaining agreement covering this ship.\u201d The standard IOMMP collective bargaining agreement requires that IOMMP be recognized as the sole collective bargaining representative of the licensed deck officers, G.C. Exh. 7, \u00a7 11(1), App. at 417, and that replacements be IOMMP members generally hired through IOMMP hiring halls. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 II, App. at 417-18; Transcript (Tr.) at 161, App. at 131. Thus, the assertion that there is a \u201ccurrent collective bargaining agreement covering this ship\u201d has manifold significance. First, it is equivalent to a demand that IOMMP be recognized as the sole collective bargaining representative of the licensed deck officers, and, second, it implies that Cove violated the section II replacement procedures of the IOMMP contract. Thus, the assertion of a collective bargaining agreement is totally inconsistent with the theory now advanced by <em>petitioner </em>\u2014 id <em>est, </em>that it was merely seeking wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">It is clear that IOMMP employed a standard form collective bargaining agreement \u2014 the so-called \u201cMaster Collective Bargaining Agreement\u201d \u2014 which, by its own description, covered all employers under contract with IOMMP. G.C. Exh. 7 at 1, App. at 417; <em>see </em>Tr. at 124-26, App. at 98 \u2014 100; Tr. at 146-48, App. at 119-21. As noted above, adoption of the terms of the standard agreement by Cove would have required, <em>inter alia, </em>that IOMMP be recognized exclusively, and, by clear logical extension, that the MEBA officers be replaced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tr. at 164, App. at 133; Tr. at 173, App. at 140; Tr. at 205-10, App. at 158-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">The evidence provided by the wording of the signs is, in our view, of particular quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tative value in that the wording was prepared in consultation with counsel. G.C. Exh. 2 at 4, App. at 373; Tr. at 74, App. at 59; Tr. at 76, App. at 61. In view of the holding of this court in <em>International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots v. NLRB (Marine &amp; Marketing International Corp.), </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 486 F.2d 1271 (1973) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 956, 94 S.Ct. 1970, 40 L.Ed.2d 306 (1974), to the effect that replacement picketing violates section 8(b)(1)(B), IOMMP acted perilously indeed by broadly asserting the existence of a current collective bargaining agreement. If IOMMP were in fact limiting itself to a claim for wages, it seems that, as a matter of common sense, this limited purpose would have been disclosed plainly by the picket signs. Neither set of picket signs reveals that IOMMP\u2019s intent was to limit itself to a claim for wages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tr. at 177-78; App. at 144-45. Captain Holdeman did not express the \u201cfact\u201d of IOMMP\u2019s limited objective to Cove, nor, to his knowledge,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> did anyone at IOMMP directly communicate this \u201cfact\u201d to Cove. <em>Id. </em>This continued failure to give Cove effective notification is quite persuasive evidence that IOMMP\u2019s true purpose did not change from April to June 1975.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Another important piece of evidence is Captain Holdeman\u2019s newspaper article in the May 1975 issue of <em>The Master, Mate &amp; Pilot. </em>G.C. Exh. 2 at 4, App. at 373. Captain Holdeman, a vice president of IOMMP\u2019s Offshore Division and port agent for Galveston, Tr. at 68, App. at 54, was, by his own admission, a prime mover in the decision to picket and in the picketing itself. <em>See </em>Tr. at 74, App. at 59; Tr. at 76, App. at 61; Tr. at 97-98, App. at 81-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The headline of the article is: <em>MM&amp;P </em>[IOMMP] <em>to Fight for Jobs </em>on Runaway Ship MOUNT EXPLORER.\u201d G.C. Exh. 2 at 4, App. at 373 (emphasis added). The body of the article states that the <em>Mount Explorer </em>\u201cwas then, before and always under contract to . MM&amp;P [IOMMP] for the Master and Mates,\u201d and, therefore, IOMMP \u201cwas going to fight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The author goes to express his general concern for IOMMP jobs in the face of MEBA \u201craids,\u201d and he specifically characterizes MEBA\u2019s actions with respect to the <em>Mount Explorer </em>as a \u201craid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Captain Holde-man gives the same characterization in his oral testimony. Tr. at 140, App. at 114; <em>see </em>Tr. at 208, App. at 161. Taken together, this evidence provides substantial support for the finding that \u201can essential element of ... [the] rivalry [between IOMMP and MEBA] is a <em>battle over jobs </em>\u2014a battle to determine whether the ships involved shall be manned by members of IOMMP dispatched from its hiring halls or by . MEBA members from that union\u2019s hiring halls.\u201d 224 N.L.R.B. at 1635.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Captain Holdeman goes on to render a description of the circumstances surrounding the filing of the in rem action:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-15\">Now, it was becoming noticeable that we were faced with too many legal road blocks. A \u201chard\u201d picket line would bring fast action from the courts in the form of an injunction. A \u201csoft\u201d picket line is ineffective and frustrating to the members. Something new had to be added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-16\">Friday, the Legal Beagles came up with a suit against the vessel for the wages of the dispossed [sic] Master and Mates from pay-off to the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>contract. Since they were on the picket line, they were easy to get in touch with. All gave their permission and the Vice President of the Gulf authorized the suit in the name of the Organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-4\">The next step was to slap a lien on the vessel with a $100,000.00 bond. This was done at 15:10, Friday, the 25th [of April 1975].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">G.C. Exh. 2 at 4, App. at 373. Thus, there is abundant evidence that the genesis of the in rem action was approximately contemporaneous with the first, relatively ineffectual picketing, that the idea for the in rem action flowed from the \u201cLegal Beagles\u201d to the plaintiffs in that action, that the go-ahead for the suit came from IOMMP, that it was related intimately to the ongoing picketing, and, indeed, that it was intended as a dramatic, tactical supplement to the picketing. This interpretation of these events is confirmed by the testimony of Captain Holde-man. <em>See </em>Tr. at 195-97, App. at 148-50. <em>See also </em>Tr. at 87-89, App. at 71-73; Tr. at 205-10, App. at 158-63. Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that the wage claim in the lawsuit was \u201can afterthought, constituting a strategem to mask Respondent\u2019s [IOMMP\u2019s] real intent,\u201d 224 N.L.R.B. at 1634, and that the lawsuit was filed in furtherance of IOMMP\u2019s \u201c \u2018larger objective,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>Both of these determinations were adopted expressly by the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 1626 n.2. Further, we do not disagree with the Board\u2019s own finding that \u201cthe filing of the lawsuit may not have been taken in complete good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">In its brief, IOMMP contends that it was attempting scrupulously to conform its conduct to the law as established in <em>Marine &amp; Marketing International Corp. </em>and <em>West-chester Marine Shipping </em>Co.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 29-34. IOMMP argues that its past violations are not highly probative in logic of the fact that it violated the law in this instance. We are inclined to agree. On the other hand, we must note that its past violations are not particularly persuasive evidence that IOMMP did <em>not </em>break the law in this instance, contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 29-34. From our examination of the record evidence, we must conclude that the findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Insofar as is relevant here, section 8(b)(1)(B) makes it an unfair labor practice for a \u201clabor organization\u201d to \u201crestrain or coerce ... an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purpose[ ] of the adjustment of grievances.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B) (1970). Relying upon the decision of this court in <em>Marine &amp; Marketing International Corp. </em>and its own prior decision in <em>Westchester Marine Shipping </em>Co.,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Board held that IOMMP violated section 8(b)(1)(B) by its picketing and its filing of an in rem action with the object of having Cove replace its MEBA crew, recognize IOMMP, and adopt IOMMP\u2019s terms. 224 N.L.R.B. at 1626, 1634-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">Licensed deck officers are \u201csupervisors\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1970). <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 8. IOMMP, however, also represents a number of \u201cemployees\u201d as defined by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) (1970).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The master and chief mate have grievance adjustment re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>sponsibility, 224 N.L.R.B. at 1632, and are \u201crepresentatives\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(4) (1970) and section 8(b)(1)(B). <em>Westchester Marine Shipping Co., 539 F.2d </em>at 556. Because of its \u201cemployee\u201d membership, IOMMP is a \u201clabor organization\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(5) (1970), and therefore is subject to the restraints embodied in section 8(b)(1)(B). <em>Westchester Marine Shipping Co., 539 </em>F.2d at 559-60; <em>Marine &amp; Marketing International Corp., </em>486 F.2d at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Petitioner once again seeks to relitigate its contention that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, it is not subject to section 8(b)(1)(B) restraints when it is not acting on behalf of its \u201cemployee\u201d membership. Brief for Petitioner at 35-51; Petitioner\u2019s Reply Brief at 2-12. Petitioner urges us to overrule the decision of this court in <em>Marine &amp; Marketing International Corp., </em>arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that it is undercut substantially by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 641, </em>417 U.S. 790, 94 S.Ct. 2737, 41 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). In rejecting petitioner\u2019s interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B), we find that we are unable to improve upon the excellent reasoning of Judge Ainsworth in <em>Westchester Marine Shipping Co., </em>and therefore we adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">IOMMP, relying upon <em>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958), argues that this application of section 8(b)(1)(B)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> violates its constitutionally protected right of association. Brief for Petitioner at 51-53; Petitioner\u2019s Reply Brief at 7 n.4. We are unable to subscribe to petitioner\u2019s analysis. It has been held that the first amendment protection to the right of association applies to union membership, <em>American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees v. Woodward, </em>406 F.2d 137 (8th Cir. 1969); <em>McLaughlin v. Tilendis, </em>398 F.2d 287 (7th Cir. 1968), and that a significant encroachment on first amendment rights will trigger the exacting analysis of <em>NAACP v. Alabama, Buckley v.

The question, then, is whether the picketing and in rem action had an unlawful objective \u2014 that is, attempting to force Cove to sign the standard contract of IOMMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">We have found that the determination that IOMMP\u2019s actions were directed towards forcing the terms of IOMMP\u2019s contract upon Cove is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See </em>text, <em>supra </em>at ---of 188 U.S.App.D.C., at 902-904 of 575 F.2d. IOMMP argues that, in order to make a finding of a violation of section 8(b)(4), there must be a showing that IOMMP\u2019s actions were directed <em>specifically </em>at forcing adoption of the \u201csales and transfers\u201d clause by Cove \u2014 that is, that IOMMP \u201cwould have continued to picket even if Cove had offered to reinstate all the former MMP [IOMMP] deck officers and to sign a contract containing all the terms of the standard MMP [IOMMP] contract except that particular provision.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 60-61. We do not share this interpretation. Clearly, it is not necessary to find that the <em>sole </em>object of IOMMP\u2019s action was to force adoption of a clause proscribed by section 8(e). <em>NLRB v. Denver Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, </em>341 U.S. 675, 689, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951). \u201cA strike or other coercive action to obtain a contract clause which is unlawful under section 8(e) is also an unfair labor practice under the express language of section 8(b)(4)(A).\u201d <em>NLRB v. Amalgamated Lithographers of America (Ind.), </em>309 F.2d 31, 42-43 (9th Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 943, 83 S.Ct. 936, 9 L.Ed.2d 968 (1963). It is sufficient if <em>any </em>object is unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 43. As noted above, there is substantial evidence supporting the finding that an object was to force adoption of the standard agreement, including the \u201csales and transfers\u201d clause. We therefore uphold the Board\u2019s finding of a section 8(b)(4) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">IOMMP maintains that the Board should not have found the filing of an in rem action to be an unfair labor practice as such a finding would be inconsistent with the doctrine of <em>Clyde Taylor Co., </em>127 N.L.R.B. 103 (1960). The principle relied on by petitioner is that the Board \u201cshould accommodate its enforcement of the Act to the right of all persons to litigate their claims in court, rather than condemn the exercise of such right as an unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109; <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioner at 65; Petitioner\u2019s Reply Brief at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">The language relied upon by petitioner does not indicate that the filing of a lawsuit will <em>never </em>be regarded as an unfair labor practice, nor do we interpret it to have such a meaning. Rather, the language is, in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>view, a mere expression of a general liberality in accommodating the filing of lawsuits. Where, as here, the lawsuit was coupled with a lien, and was intimately related to ongoing picketing for an unlawful objective, and \u201cmay not have been taken in complete good faith,\u201d 224 N.L.R.B. at 1626 n.2, we can see no inconsistency between <em>Clyde Taylor Co. </em>(and its progeny) and the Board\u2019s determination in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The doctrine, as subsequently developed in <em>Television </em>Wisconsin <em>Inc., </em>224 N.L.R.B. 722, 722 n.2 (1976) (\u201cWe agree with the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s finding that the Union\u2019s action in filing a suit to enforce an unlawful union-security clause violated Sec. 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act\u2014 not because of the Union\u2019s subjective intent, <em>but because of the unlawful objective sought by the Union.\u2019\u2019) </em>(emphasis added), would appear to contemplate a situation such as our own. Where, as here, a union files an in rem action with an unlawful objective, and \u201cthe filing of the lawsuit may not have been taken in complete good faith,\u201d we will not decline to affirm, on the basis of <em>Clyde Taylor Co., </em>the Board\u2019s determination that an unfair labor practice has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">We have examined the order of the Board and have found it to be tailored properly to the violation and to be in accordance with applicable law. <em>See West-chester Marine Shipping Co., </em>539 F.2d at 561. IOMMP urges that the order should be modified so as to permit picketing for IOMMP\u2019s non-replacement objectives as presented here. We agree with the Fifth Circuit that \u201cthe practical effect of seeking these other objects is tantamount to coercion of the employers in the selection of their licensed deck officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Thus the cross-petition for enforcement is granted, and the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\">. 224 N.L.R.B. 1626 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-13\">.

The ALJ noted that IOMMP argued that the Lawrence group of companies was obligated under the \u201csubsidiary and affiliate\u201d clause. 224 N.L.R.B. at 1631.

In its brief, petitioner appears to abandon its contention that Cove was bound under the \u201csubsidiary and affiliate\u201d clause, <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioner at 30 n.8, and maintains that IOMMP only desired expected wages. <em>Id. </em>at 29-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b972-19\">.
