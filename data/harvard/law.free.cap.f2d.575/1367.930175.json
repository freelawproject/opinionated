These regulations, promulgated under the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 et seq., control the manner in which participating hospitals review their physicians\u2019 efforts. The district court held that it had jurisdiction, and found against the plaintiff-appellant on the merits. We find there is no subject matter jurisdiction, and vacate the judgment below without prejudice to CMS to file other appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">Title XVIII of the Social Security Act establishes the Medicare program. Part A of that program provides hospital insurance for the aged and certain disabled individuals of any age. The government undertakes to reimburse authorized \u201cproviders of services\u201d for a covered beneficiary\u2019s health costs. These providers include hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies, but not individual physicians. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">Congress feared that the existence of a federal blank check would lead providers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>use their resources inefficiently. To avoid that, the Act requires that each hospital or skilled nursing facility must have in effect a \u201cutilization review plan\u201d to qualify as a provider. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(e)(6), (j)(8). A \u201csufficient\u201d plan reviews the admissions to a facility, the duration of stays, and the professional services, including drugs, furnished the patients to determine both the medical necessity for the actions and their effects on the efficiency of the facility. The statute specifies the composition of the reviewing group.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-4\">\u201c(k) A utilization review plan . shall be considered sufficient . . . if it provides (2) for such review to be made by either (A).a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians, with or without participation of other professional personnel, or (B) a group outside the institution which is similarly composed and (i) which is established by the local medical society and some or all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the locality, or (ii) if (and for as long as) there has not been such a group which serves such institution, which is established in such other manner as may be approved by the Secretary . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(k). If the institution is very small or lacks an organized medical staff, the review must be accomplished by the outside group or other method allowed in subsection (B). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has the authority to promulgate necessary regulations for the Medicare Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh. The Secretary is given the power to authorize state health agencies to determine whether a facility may participate in Medicare as a provider. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395aa(a). Under his general authority to promulgate regulations, the Secretary defined the composition of the review body in the alternative ways used by the statute. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1035(e)(1). In order to guide state agencies in their eligibility determinations, the Department\u2019s Bureau of Health Insurance produced the \u201cState Operations Manual\u201d, known as HIM \u2014 7. Unlike the statute, and unlike the regulation, the section defining utilization review plans in HIM-7 specifies a preferred alternative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayt-dedup-0\">\u201c2510(a) <em>In-House Committees </em>\u2014 Typically and preferably when a hospital has a sufficiently large staff the utilization review committee is, as in the words of the law, comprised of, \u2018a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians with or without the participation of other professional personnel\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">HIM-7 acknowledged that the law provides an alternative, but authorizes that alternative only in limited situations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-10\">\u201cThe law provides for alternate types of UR committees, where a facility does not have a sufficient number (two or more) of physicians on the house staff to serve on a UR committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">HIM-7, \u00a7 2515(a). Section 2515(b) establishes a preference for smaller facilities to use outside committees sponsored by medical societies, rather than some \u201cother manner as may be approved by the Secretary\u201d. Furthermore, that section advises state agencies to inform the facilities that any other plan is acceptable only until one of the preferred methods can be devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">That mandate of the Secretary sparked this law suit. The composition of the utilization review committee must be approved, or the facility will not be an authorized \u201cprovider\u201d. Without authorization, the government will not reimburse it for any services provided to patients otherwise eligible for Medicare. Provider status is essential to most American private hospitals. CMS, representing doctors at private institutions, disapproves of the preferred method of review. It believes that in-house review committees waste physician time and lead to conflicts, ethical and personal, within the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">On October 1, 1975, CMS filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Eastern District of New Orleans. CMS pressed three arguments. It urged that the Secretary had no power to establish mandatory preferences among the methods allowed by the statute. It maintained that HIM \u2014 7 was promulgated in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. It argued that the requirement violated the doctors\u2019 due process rights, protected by the fifth amendment. The Secretary moved to dismiss; CMS moved for summary judgment. After a hearing on the motions, the district court granted summary judgment for the Secretary in November 1976. The trial court found that it had jurisdiction under \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court held that the regulation was not inconsistent with the statute; that it was an interpretive rule, outside the restrictions of the A.P.A.; and held that no constitutional violation existed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">We cannot reach the merits on this appeal: the dispositive question is whether subject matter jurisdiction existed. The district court followed this and some other Courts of Appeals by holding that jurisdiction existed under \u00a7 10 of the A.P.A., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701-06. <em>See Ortego v. Weinberger, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 516 F.2d 1005; <em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation, Inc. v. Califano, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 534 F.2d 633, <em>modified on rehearing, </em>1977, 554 F.2d 714, <em>rev\u2019d en banc, </em>1978, 571 F.2d 328; <em>Bradley v. Weinberger, </em>1 Cir. 1973, 483 F.2d 410; <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Johnston, </em>4 Cir. 1961, 295 F.2d 856; <em>Sanders v. Weinberger, </em>7 Cir. 1975, 522 F.2d 1167, <em>rev\u2019d sub nom., Califano v. Sanders, </em>1977, 430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192; <em>Brandt v. Hickel, </em>9 Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 53; <em>Brennan v. Udall, </em>10 Cir. 1967, 379 F.2d 803; <em>Pickus </em>v. <em>United States Board of Parole, </em>1974, 165 U.S.App.D.C. 284, 507 F.2d 1107. The Supreme Court has now spoken to the contrary: \u201c[T]he APA does not afford an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action\u201d. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>1977, 430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">The district court held that general federal question jurisdiction was precluded by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc. To find jurisdiction, we would have to reverse that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">The Medicare Act does not have its own section precluding judicial review. Instead, \u00a7 1395\u00dc incorporates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h), which precludes review of decisions under Title II of the Social Security Act. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-8\">\u201cThe findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. <em>No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.\u2019\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">[emphasis added] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). Title II provides administrative and judicial review of the matters covered by \u00a7 405(h) through \u00a7 405(g). The Medicare Act incorporated \u00a7 405(h), precluding review, totally; it incorporated \u00a7 405(g), providing review, only in part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-10\">\u201cAny institution or agency dissatisfied with any determination by the Secretary that it is not a provider of services, or with any determination described in section 1395cc(b)(2) of this title [concerning termination by the Secretary of certain agreements], shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Secretary (after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing) to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(c). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395oo(f) (West Supp.1977) (added in 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">The question of review of decisions apparently precluded by \u00a7 1395\u00dc has been considered by several courts. The cases, however, have always been slightly different from this case. They have involved actions by providers complaining of reimbursement decisions and procedures. The Court of Claims ruled that it had jurisdiction as to questions of law and constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>al claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. <em>Whitecliff, Inc. v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl.1976, 536 F.2d 347, <em>cert. den. </em>1977, 430 U.S. 969, 97 S.Ct. 1652, 52 L.Ed.2d 361. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that it had jurisdiction over constitutional issues only. <em>St. Louis University v. Blue Cross Hospital Service, </em>8 Cir. 1976, 537 F.2d 283, <em>cert. den. </em>1977, 429 U.S. 977, 97 S.Ct. 484, 50 L.Ed.2d 584. In the Second and Seventh Circuits the Courts of Appeals have held that they have no jurisdiction, but that the Court of Claims does. <em>South Windsor Convalescent Home, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>2 Cir. 1976, 541 F.2d 910; <em>Trinity Memorial Hospital of Cudahy, Inc. v. Associated Hospital Service, Inc., </em>7 Cir. 1977, 570 F.2d 660.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">This Court had taken an inconsistent position. In <em>Gallo v. Mathews, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 534 F.2d 1137 (decided before <em>Califano v. Sanders </em>and relied upon by the district court here), the Court held that \u00a7 1395b precluded review, but that \u00a7 10 of the A.P.A. provided it. In <em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation, Inc. v. Califano, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 714, the panel\u2019s second opinion followed <em>Califano v. Sanders </em>and held that no A.P.A. jurisdiction existed. The Court held that \u00a7 1395\u00dc was not intended to preclude judicial review of issues, constitutional or statutory, which could be reviewed in no other way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We withheld deciding this case to await the result of this Court\u2019s reconsideration of <em>MacDonald </em>en banc. That decision, reported at 571 F.2d 328, resolves our major issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">The Court en banc held that \u201c\u00a7 405(h), incorporated into \u00a7 1395\u00dc of the Medicare Act, precludes all review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions by federal district courts brought under \u00a7 1331\u201d. 571 F.2d at 331. The Court refused to find a distinction between \u00a7 405(h) in the Title II context and \u00a7 1395\u00dc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>in the Medicare context because of the differing availability of review under \u00a7 405(g). Instead, it adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s position in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>1975, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522, that neither statutory nor constitutional claims could be reviewed under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">As a matter of statutory construction, the major difference between our case and <em>MacDonald, </em>as resolved by the en banc Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, is that these plaintiffs complain not of a decision denying reimbursement but of a regulation which does not affect reimbursement. <em>Salfi, </em>relied upon by the Court en banc, shows that distinction to be unimportant. In <em>Salfi </em>widows brought a class action challenging on constitutional grounds the statute\u2019s failure to cover certain women. The Court gave a broad reading to the third sentence of \u00a7 405(h) and held that it was \u201cmore than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion\u201d. 422 U.S. at 757, 95 S.Ct. at 2463. It then distinguished <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>1974, 415 U.S. 361, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389. In that case a challenge was brought to a provision concerning veterans\u2019 benefits. The Court held that review of a statutory limitation was not precluded by a section providing that decisions of the Administrator</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1444-5\">\u201con any question or law or fact . shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1444-9\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a), quoted in <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 761, 95 S.Ct. at 2465. The Court had found jurisdiction in <em>Johnson, </em>in spite of this language. The <em>Salfi </em>Court explained that while the Veterans\u2019 Administration statute precluded only review of <em>decisions </em>of the Administrator, \u00a7 405(h) extended to any <em>action </em>to recover on any claim. Thus, the fact that no administrative hearing or decision was involved in the instant case does not serve as a relevant distinction from <em>MacDonald. </em>This Court has decided that the Medicare Act withdraws jurisdiction from the district courts over actions like this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-10\">This construction of \u00a7 1395\u00dc does not end our inquiry. We must determine whether this construction totally precludes judicial consideration of claims of CMS, statutory and constitutional. If it does, we must consider whether such preclusion itself violates the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-11\">The question of Congressional power over jurisdiction is both ancient and difficult. It involves the most sensitive relationships between coequal branches of the federal government. Courts and commentators have long discussed the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While many commentators may have decided it, it is fair to say that the Supreme Court has not. Under <em>MacDonald, </em>this Court can only say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-G\">\u201cHappily, we need resolve neither Congress\u2019 intent to preclude review of constitutional claims nor the constitutionality of a statute so construed. We would face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>these issues only if <em>all </em>avenues of review were precluded. In <em>Whitecliff, </em>however, the Court of Claims determined it to have jurisdiction to review claims arising under the Medicare Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\">571 F.2d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">This particular suit cannot be brought in the Court of Claims. Its jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, which was never part of the section 41 of title 28 mentioned in \u00a7 405(h). It has jurisdiction over claims against the United States, without limitation as to jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That Court cannot provide the equitable or declaratory relief sought in this suit. <em>United States v. Alire, </em>1868, 73 U.S. 573, 6 Wall. 573, 18 L.Ed. 947; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>1886, 131 U.S. 1, 9 S.Ct. 669, 33 L.Ed. 90; <em>United States v. King, </em>1969, 395 U.S. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52. Nevertheless, the <em>issue </em>raised by the plaintiff could be heard by that Court if CMS can state a claim for damages or at least for nominal damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only the relief granted would be different, and Congress has power over the relief granted suitors against the United States and its officers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">The resolution we have reached is not pleasant. CMS has waited nearly three years for the resolution of its suit. The parties have briefed and argued their cases. When the suit was filed, before <em>Califano v. Sanders </em>and before <em>MacDonald, </em>the action gave no sign of being appropriate for the Court of Claims. Now, we must deny both parties a decision on the merits where at least one argument is substantial. But the alternative is to find that Congress cannot cut off our jurisdiction over these issues while providing another court, the Court of Claims, to hear the issues. That is a decision we cannot make. Moreover, we respect the ingenuity of lawyers. We do not exclude the possibility of plaintiff\u2019s counsel casting an action in terms of mandamus that might resolve what is obviously an important issue to the private hospitals in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-13\">The decision of the district court is vacated, and this suit is remanded for dismissal without prejudice to the plaintiff to file other appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-14\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">. The District of Columbia Circuit has also held that subject matter jurisdiction does not attach to claims under the Medicare Act. <em>Ass\u2019n of American Medical Colleges v. Califano, </em>1977, 186 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 569 F.2d 101. That case, however, involved a provider\u2019s claim for reimbursement and was brought after the amendments to \u00a7 1395oo created administrative and judicial review of such claims. Therefore, that Court did not face a situation where denial of federal question jurisdiction might preclude any judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">The First Circuit considered \u00a7 1395\u00dc before <em>Califano v. Sanders. </em>It avoided the question of federal question jurisdiction by finding jurisdiction under the A.P.A., which it held was not precluded by \u00a7 1395\u00dc. <em>Adams Nursing Home of Williamstown, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>1 Cir. 1977, 548 F.2d 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">Many district courts have considered the effect of \u00a7 1395\u00dc. In <em>Mid Atlantic Nephrology Center, Ltd. v. Califano, </em>D.Md.1977, 433 F.Supp. 23, Judge Thomsen held that, in the absence of any other judicial review, \u00a7 1395\u00dc did not preclude federal question jurisdiction over a challenge to Departmental action. The court distinguished its case from most provider cases because the plaintiff was not making a claim for benefits, but instead was seeking injunctive relief \u201cto compel HEW to abide by its own regulations\u201d. In <em>Humana of South Carolina, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>D.D.C.1976, 419 F.Supp. 253, the court found jurisdiction by reading \u00a7 405(h) as applying only after an administrative hearing. In <em>St. Elizabeth Hospital v. Califano, </em>E.D.Ky.1977, 441 F.Supp. 158, the court held that it had no federal question jurisdiction. In <em>Chelsea Community Hospital v. Michigan Blue Cross, </em>E.D.Mich.1977, 436 F.Supp. 1050,</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-10\">the court held that review of statutory issues was precluded. The court was troubled by the thought that jurisdiction for constitutional issues might be completely foreclosed. It assumed that jurisdiction existed and found the constitutional claims without merit. In <em>Medical Center of Independence v. Califano, </em>W.D. Mo. 1977, 433 F.Supp. 837, the court held that it had no federal question jurisdiction over pre-1973 claims. The court also held that \u00a7 1395\u00dc foreclosed mandamus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. In Pacific <em>Coast Medical Enterprises v. Califano, </em>C.D.Cal.1977, 440 F.Supp. 296, the court held that the statute prevented review of statutory issues, but not constitutional issues. It held, however, that the issues cast by the plaintiff in due process terms were in fact statutory issues. That court found mandamus was unavailable because the case was not proper for such relief under the general standards applied to mandamus petitions. A unique approach was taken by the district court in <em>Umedco, Inc. v. Califano, </em>C.D.Cal., June 9, 1977, Civ. No. 76-104-HP. That court distinguished <em>Salfi </em>as applying only to beneficiaries\u2019 claims. It held that it should not apply to providers\u2019 claims, and found jurisdiction to consider any constitutional issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">. The panel reached this conclusion with some reluctance. \u201cWe [find jurisdiction] realizing that our construction is strained . . 554 F.2d at 718. Judge Clark dissented, holding that Congressional failure to incorporate more of \u00a7 405(g) was not a mistake, but a conscious and permissible choice to limit review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">. The <em>MacDonald </em>case could have been distinguished from this case because it dealt with a provider who could se\u00e9k relief for periods after 1973 through the amendments to \u00a7 1395oo. The second panel opinion seems to read the amendments as Congressional correction of an oversight. 554 F.2d at 716.

The district courts would not have such jurisdiction over this claim, however, because \u00a7 1346(a) was part of section 41, and hence is within the language of \u00a7 405(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">. For example, violation of due process rights, standing alone, has been held to found a claim for nominal damages. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>1978, - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252. This plaintiff also alleges that its members\u2019 time is being wasted in violation of their constitutional rights. Therefore, a successful action would also involve actual damages. We note the plaintiff alleged that more than $10,000 was in controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1445-11\">. Congress could refuse to waive sovereign immunity at all, and deny all litigants against the United States any remedies. It may also restrict parties seeking to litigate certain claims to specified courts, even if the claims are of constitutional magnitude. <em>See Yakus v. United States, </em>1944, 321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834, where the Court held that a constitutional challenge to wage and price controls could not be brought in the Emergency Court of Appeals. <em>Cf. Morris v. Gressette, </em>1977, 432 U.S. 491, 97 S.Ct. 2411, 53 L.Ed.2d 506, which held that the decision of the Attorney General under the Voting Rights Act was not subject to judicial review. The statute provided that review of changes in a state\u2019s electoral system was proper either through a declaratory judgment action in the District of Columbia, or through submission to the Attorney General. Congress may also limit the availability of equitable relief in federal courts to private parties in suits against other private parties. The Norris-LaGuardia Act, restricting the use of federal injunctions in labor disputes, is a prime example. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115. <em>See Lauf v. E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., </em>1938, 303 U.S. 323, 58 S.Ct. 578, 82 L.Ed. 872. Remedies against the government have been limited in the context of Selective Service cases, although those cases do not easily lend themselves to a consistent interpretation. <em>See generally </em>Federal Courts and the Federal System at 365-72. The federal courts are also barred from issuing injunctions against the collection of federal taxes. Litigants are left to either refund suits or suits in the tax court. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
