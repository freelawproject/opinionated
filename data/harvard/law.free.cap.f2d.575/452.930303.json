The petitioners are the Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedoring Corporation and its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, Midland Insurance Company (hereafter collectively called the employer). The Board\u2019s order affirmed an administrative law judge\u2019s award to a longshoreman, Michael De Nichilo, for permanent total disability. The order also affirmed the denial of relief to the employer under the special fund provisions of \u00a7 8(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">The employer makes two contentions on this petition. First, it contends that the Board erred in concluding that substantial evidence supported the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that De Nichilo\u2019s disability, which followed a myocardial infarction, resulted from an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. Alternatively, it argues that even if De Nichilo\u2019s disability is compensable, it is entitled to avail itself of the liability limitation in \u00a7 8(f) because De -Nichilo had a pre-existing partial disability when the injury occurred on the job. We conclude that the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that De Nichilo suffered a compensable injury is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. However, we also conclude that the Benefits Review Board should have afforded the employer the protection of \u00a7 8(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">I. THE COMPENSABILITY OF DE NI-CHILO\u2019S DISABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">On December 28,1972, De Nichilo reported for work at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey. His normal duty was to operate a forklift inside a warehouse where his employer stuffed and stripped containers. On that day, however, he was assigned as a driver for a group of long<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>shoremen loading cargo on a ship. His task was to bring cargo from remote storage areas to the pier, where it could be hoisted into the ship\u2019s hold. According to the testimony credited by the administrative law judge, at about 10:30 A. M. De Nichilo and another longshoreman were directed to pick up several 1000-pound coils of wire which were resting in soft dirt some distance off the paved surface. After unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate their forklifts over the soft dirt, they decided to tow the coils to the paved surface with a hook and a rope. When De Nichilo forced a hook into one of the coils, he experienced chest pains, numbness in his arms, and shortness of breath. The discomfort continued until 4:30 P. M., when he experienced sharp pain and collapsed while attempting to mount his forklift. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was treated for a myocardial infarction until January 18, 1973. He was discharged from the hospital on that date. However, he has not worked since then and cannot return to work. Pri- or to December 28, 1972, De Nichilo had a history of heart disease complicated by diabetes mellitus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">At the hearing before the administrative law judge De Nichilo\u2019s medical expert testified that there was a causal connection between the extra-strenuous work De Nichilo performed in moving the wire coils and the December 28, 1972 myocardial infarction. The employer\u2019s medical expert disputed this, claiming instead that the December 28, 1972 attack was only a natural progression of De Nichilo\u2019s pre-existing coronary artery disease. Both experts agreed that De Nichilo suffered from a pre-exist-ing arteriosclerotic heart disease. The administrative law judge credited the opinion of De Nichilo\u2019s expert that the December 28, 1972 attack resulted from the stress of exertion during employment. That opinion, although disputed, provides evidentiary support for the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Similarly, there is disputed evi-dentiary support for the conclusion that De Nichilo\u2019s disability is permanent and total. Since the Benefits Review Board properly applied the substantial evidence standard of review under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3), we must affirm its decision. <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (Aleksiejczyk), </em>542 F.2d 602, 608 (3d Cir. 1976). We are not free to weigh the evidence ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">II. THE EMPLOYER\u2019S \u00a7 8(f) CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">All the medical experts agreed that prior to December 28, 1972, De Nichilo had a heart disease and a diabetic condition which made him more susceptible to a heart attack than someone not suffering from those conditions. The employer contends that even if the attack on that date was work-related, it was a second injury within the meaning of \u00a7 8(f). Accordingly, the employer claims that its liability should be limited by the terms of that provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>On June 18, 1976, the administrative law judge held that \u201c[s]ince his [De Nichilo\u2019s] pre-existing heart disease and diabetes did not affect his earning capacity, he did not suffer from an existing disability within the meaning of Section 8(f).\u201d App. at 20a. In reaching this decision, the administrative law judge relied heavily on the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision in <em>Aleksiejczyk v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., </em>1 BRBS 541, BRB No. 74-202 (1975). But <em>Aleksiejc-zyk\u2019s </em>construction of \u00a7 8(f), which the administrative law judge below accepted, was overruled by this court on June 23, 1976, in <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (Aleksiejczyk), supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The employer in the instant case pressed its \u00a7 8(f) contention before the Benefits Review Board. By the time of the Board\u2019s decision, it had become clear that the administrative law judge\u2019s reliance on the Board\u2019s <em>Aleksiejczyk </em>opinion was misplaced. Nevertheless, the Board rejected the employer\u2019s claim on a ground not considered by the administrative law judge \u2014 namely, that De Nichilo\u2019s prior condition was not manifest to the employer at the time that he was hired. The Board reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The principal purpose of the special fund in regard to second injuries is to assist the handicapped in obtaining employment. Congress, however, did not intend that all previous disabilities come within the scope of Section 8(f), but only those \u201cmanifest\u201d to the employer at the time of hiring. The availability of knowledge of the pre-existing condition to the employer, not necessarily his actual knowledge, is the relevant standard. <em>Pye v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>BRBS BRB No. 76-188, 76-188A (Feb. 18, 1977); <em>American Mutual Ins. Co. of Boston v. Jones, </em>[138 U.S.App.D.C. 269], 426 F.2d 1263 (D.C.Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The nature of claimant\u2019s previous disability, a weakness of the cardiovascular system, was not a disability patently obvious to an employer. There is record evidence that the claimant regularly performed his duties in spite of his heart problems. The employer may have been able to discover claimant\u2019s condition through an employment physical, but there is no evidence that the employer availed himself of that opportunity or that the employer had actual knowledge of claimant\u2019s previous disability. While the record in this case may indeed substantiate several elements of the employer\u2019s argument on the Section 8(f) issue, an essential element has not been established, namely that the previous disability be manifest to the employer at the time of hiring. Therefore, we sustain the law judge\u2019s finding that the special fund provisions do not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">App. at 28a-29a.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Naturally, the employer endorses our interpretation of \u00a7 8(f) in <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, </em>where we held that the test for a prior disability is a physical one rather than an economic one. A good part of the Director\u2019s brief addresses a reconsideration of that interpretation. However, our construction of \u00a7 8(f) has been followed by both the Fifth and the District of Columbia Circuits. <em>See C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 18, 564 F.2d 503 (1977); <em>Equitable Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>558 F.2d 1192, 1198 (5th Cir. 1977). Only the court in banc could reconsider our decision in <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores. E. g., Krolick Contracting Corp. v. Benefits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>Review Bd., </em>558 F.2d 685, 689 (3d Cir. 1977). The present dispute is between two competing insurance funds, and in the long run the certainty of coverage is probably as important as the correctness of our prior holding. Moreover, the underlying congressional purpose in creating the special fund was to encourage the employment of partially disabled persons. We remain convinced that our rejection of the economic test for disability is consistent with that purpose. Thus, we conclude that the administrative law judge erred in applying the economic test for disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">As we pointed out above, the Benefits Review Board did not rely on the economic test to reject the employer\u2019s \u00a7 8(f) claim. Instead, the Board ruled that \u00a7 8(f) did not apply because the employer had not established its knowledge of the prior disability. The employer concedes that it did not offer evidence of De Nichilo\u2019s prior disability. But the employer objects to the Benefits Review Board\u2019s deciding the case on a ground not considered by the administrative law judge and requests at least a remand so that it can prove its knowledge. The employer points out, however, that due to the nature of longshoring employment, in which a transitory labor force reports to a hiring hall, employers generally have no opportunity to conduct physical examinations for the purpose of discovering pre-hire physical disabilities. Thus, the employer concedes that in most cases within the coverage of the Act an employer will lack such knowledge. It urges, however, that if the test for \u00a7 8(f) coverage is the second employer\u2019s actual knowledge of the prior disability, employers will insist upon pre-hire physical examinations, thereby erecting barriers to the employment of the partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">At oral argument the Director\u2019s attorney conceded that this would be a possible if not likely consequence of an actual knowledge' requirement and that such a consequence would be inconsistent with the policy underlying \u00a7 8(f). The Director points out, however, that in <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">. The courts have adopted a \u201clatent-manifest\u201d test for determining when an employer will receive the benefit of \u00a7 8(f) treatment. Strong policy considerations dictate that only those employers who hire the handicapped with knowledge of their disabilities qualify for limited liability. The latent-manifest -test is one method for separating eligible from ineligible employers. In view of the difficulty of proving actual knowledge of a disability, the test is ordinarily an objective one. Conditions that are latent rather than manifest to a prospective employer do not qualify as \u00a7 8(f) disabilities. If this court determines that Aleksiejc-zyk\u2019s medical history was latent, the Board\u2019s order finding against Atlantic &amp; Gulf on the \u00a7 8(f) issue must be sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">The Administrative Law Judge found that the employer was aware of the medical problems of the decedent. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">542 F.2d at 609 (footnotes omitted). The quoted language might have been more carefully chosen, since it could be construed to refer to an actual knowledge requirement. Certainly the employer\u2019s actual knowledge of the disability, which the administrative law judge found in <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, </em>sufficed to establish a manifest rather than a latent disability. But we did not intent to hold in that case that actual knowledge was the only means for determining that a pre-hire disability was manifest for \u00a7 8(f) purposes. An examination by an employer may establish affirmatively that a disability was latent. <em>E. g., Duluth, M. &amp; I. R. Ry. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>553 F.2d 1144, 1151 (8th Cir. 1977). But an employer\u2019s lack of knowledge that an employee has an artificial limb or a glass eye is irrelevant, since such a pre-hire disability is clearly manifest in the sense that it is objectively determinable and free from doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Heart disease is not as obviously manifest a disability as is the loss of a limb or an eye. Nevertheless, in many instances heart disease is objectively determinable and objectively determined. The record be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>fore the administrative law judge contains the evidence of De Nichilo\u2019s prior hospitalization for a possible myocardial infarction and the testimony of Dr. Edward S. Wally that De Nichilo suffered from a coronary artery disease. The administrative law judge relied upon this evidence of De Nichi-lo\u2019s abnormal heart condition to conclude that the degree of stress De Nichilo underwent on December 28, 1974, produced the attack he suffered on that date. Although the administrative law judge did not use the word manifest, he found that De Nichi-lo had pre-existing physical infirmities of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. These were readily discoverable by any employer who looked at De Nichilo\u2019s medical record. That record makes the disability manifest. No more is required for the purpose of assuring that only eligible employers receive the insurance coverage provid\u00e9d by \u00a7 8(f) of the Act. Therefore, since the findings of the administrative law judge establish the existence of a manifest condition, we hold that the employer is covered by the special fund provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The petition to review the determination that De Nichilo is permanently and totally disabled will be denied. The petition to modify the order of the Benefits Review Board to limit the employer\u2019s liability to 104 weeks and to charge the excess to the special fund will be granted. An attorney\u2019s fee for De Nichilo\u2019s attorney, chargeable against the employer, will be awarded in an amount to be fixed on motion to this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">. The record is inconclusive as to whether De Nichilo had suffered an earlier myocardial infarction. This uncertainty is due to two medical experts\u2019 different evaluations of electrocardiograms. <em>Compare </em>App. at 36a and 130a <em>with </em>App. at 235a, 238a, 250a, and 262-66a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">.
