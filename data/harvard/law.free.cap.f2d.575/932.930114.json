(MDC) markets a computerized system for retrieving legal data. In February 1975, MDC submitted an unsolicited proposal to the Air Force recommending that the MDC system be-substituted for a competitor\u2019s system already in use by it. Some time in late August or September of that year \u2014 the record indicates only that it was between August 29 and September 22 \u2014 the Air Force rejected MDC\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Since that time, MDC has vigorously sought access under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, to the Air Force documents that reflect its course of negotiation with MDC\u2019s competitor as well as its consideration and rejection of MDC\u2019s February 1975 proposal. MDC\u2019s efforts have been partially successful, due both to the Air Force\u2019s voluntary compliance with some of MDC\u2019s FOIA requests, and to an earlier decision of a panel of this court involving a separate request. <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Department of Air Force (MDC-I), </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 566 F.2d 242 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">In its request involved in the present case, MDC seeks disclosure of Air Force documents reflecting the agency\u2019s evaluation and response to MDC\u2019s proposal. The Air Force complied with much of MDC\u2019s request in its initial response and further upon MDC\u2019s appeal within the agency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>The District Court, after <em>in camera </em>inspection, ordered additional disclosures of parts of two of the withheld items, but largely upheld the Air Force\u2019s claim that all or portions of eight documents fit within the policy-deliberative part of Exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">We agree with appellant that factual material cannot be exempt under Exemption 5, <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 93, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), so long as it does not \u201cexpose the deliberative process.\u201d <em>MDC-I, supra, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. at 364, 566 F.2d at 256. We agree with respondent and the District Court, however, that the material withheld in this case\u2014 mainly cost comparisons, feasibility opinions, and the data relevant to how the personnel involved arrived at those comparisons and opinions \u2014 are policy deliberative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>They are not raw facts with informational value in their own right, but instead serve primarily to reveal the \u201cevaluative\u201d process by which different members of the decision-making chain arrived at their conclusions\u2014 and what those predecisional conclusions are. <em>Washington Research Project, Inc. v. HEW, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 181, 504 F.2d 238, 250 (1974). In addition, the cost comparisons and feasibility opinions are directed at a very specific decision, <em>i. e., </em>whether or not to accept MDC\u2019s proposal. <em>See MDC-I, supra, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. at 365, 566 F.2d at 257; <em>Washington Research, supra; compare Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 194-98, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-47 (1976). While MDC correctly notes that the end product of these Air Force deliberations on the MDC proposal is not a \u201cbroad policy\u201d decision, that deliberation is nonetheless a type of decisional process that Exemption 5 seeks to protect from undue public exposure. <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 150-51, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975); S.Rep. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">In' sum we are in agreement with the District Court that <em>Washington Research </em>controls the present case. The former decision\u2019s reading of Exemption 5 to cover evaluative summaries of, and site visit reports on, mental health grant applications requires a similar \u25a0 result under the circumstances before us, involving the Air Force\u2019s evaluation of MDC\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d for a contract to furnish the Service\u2019s legal data retrieval system. We find MDC\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Washington Research </em>\u2014 including by reference to <em>Vaughn, supra </em>\u2014 unpersuasive. In both cases, the \u201cbasic factual data was available\u201d to the requester, <em>Vaughn, supra, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. at 198, 523 F.2d at 1147 n.38, leaving undisclosed only \u201cevaluations [and comparisons] based on the writer\u2019s own values.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">We are also convinced that, between the appeals officer at the Air Force and the District Court, the necessary efforts were made to identify and disclose all \u201creasonably segregable\u201d and purely factual material. The Air Force accordingly has complied with its own regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 806.25 (1976), as well as with FOIA. Thus, the Air Force official involved at the agency\u2019s appellate level averred in his affidavit that he attempted to disclose \u201c[a]ll reasonably seg-regable factual portions,\u201d Appendix (App.) at 12, and it seems clear from the materials he ordered provided to MDC (overruling his subordinate) that such an effort was made. He also showed an awareness of the rule that factual material may be withheld only if it was inseparable, without distortion, from the underlying policy deliberation. App. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Moreover, in reviewing that official\u2019s determinations, the District Court, following its own viewing of the documents, ordered disclosure of two minor \u201c \u2018factual\u2019 and \u2018narrative\u2019 \u201d portions. App. at 19, <em>quoting Washington Research, supra, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. at 181-82, 504 F.2d at 250-51. This last suggests both that Air Force officials exercised reasonably sound judgment in drawing their conclusions as to the exempt nature of the documents, and that the District Court carefully reviewed those administrative conclusions for consistency with the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Finally, appellant\u2019s complaints about the alleged brevity and conclusional format of the Air Force\u2019s description of the undisclosed materials and of its segregability claims lose much of their force because the District Court, after <em>in camera </em>inspection, accepted appellant\u2019s own description of the documents. It simply disagreed with appellant\u2019s legal conclusion as to the nonexempt nature of the materials thus described. App. at 19. We therefore do not have a situation in which the basic contents of the documents are in dispute. Instead, we are confronted primarily with legal questions which the District Court has answered correctly. <em>Compare MDC-I, supra, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. at 358, 566 F.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">We also reject MDC\u2019s other major claims, emphasized in oral argument, that the withheld material, especially item 6, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>is thoroughly reflective of the reasons actually, finally, and self-consciously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>relied on by the Air Force in rejecting the MDC proposal. If the withheld portions met this description, we agreed that they would embody the final decision itself and would have to be disclosed. <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra. See also </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 806.23(e)(5) (1976). At best, however, MDC could only assert before us in argument that the conclusions and supporting cost comparison data in the item 6 feasibility study issued on June 13, 1975, <em>might </em>contain the Air Force\u2019s reasons for its August-September 1975 decision not to accept MDC\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Refuting this assertion by MDC is the Air Force\u2019s own characterization of the study as \u201can internal communication of opinion [that] is not a final agency decision.\u201d App. 15. The Air Force\u2019s description is supported by the fact that two and one-half to three and one-half months passed between the issuance of the item 6 study and the agency\u2019s decision. During that time, as the document descriptions make clear, the cost study itself was apparently analyzed and criticized by Air Force officials, and \u201cadditional cost factors\u201d and \u201cpossible changes in the study\u201d were discussed. <em>See </em>items 2, 3, 4; note 1 <em>supra. </em>Moreover, two other withheld documents apparently contain evaluations of MDC\u2019s proposal that are separate from the cost study in item 6. <em>See </em>items, 7, 8; note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">There is accordingly no reason to believe \u2014 contrary to the Air Force\u2019s patently reasonable claim, which apparently was borne out by the District Court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>scrutiny \u2014 that (1) the conclusions of the cost study (or any of the other withheld items alone or together) embody or totally explain the decision to reject MDC proposal or (2) they were adopted by the Air Force as such, rather than simply used by it in reaching that decision. FOIA is not designed to force every government agency to produce a document explaining each of its decisions, nor is it designed to force the agency or courts to find and disclose whatever extant document comes closest to serving that decision-explaining role. <em>Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft, </em>421 U.S. 168,192, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 44 L.Ed.2d 57 (1975). We consequently see no reason to scrutinize the material ourselves <em>in camera, </em>as MDC requests, and we instead stand behind the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">MDC\u2019s final argument is that the Air Force must under Exemption 5, but did not, demonstrate that withholding the material serves some compelling government interest. Under other circumstances, we might be inclined to hold that Exemption 5, like all of the others, involves a <em>congressional </em>decision that any material fitting therein \u2014 by virtue of that fact alone \u2014 serves a sufficiently important governmental interest to allow nondisclosure if the agency decides that it is in its interest to withhold it. <em>See MDC-I, supra, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. at 371, 566 F.2d at 263 n.l (McGowan, J., dissenting). We need not reach that issue, however, because the District Court in this case found that disclosing the withheld material \u201cwould be \u2018injurious to the consultative functions of government that the privilege . . . protects.\u2019 \u201d App. at 21, <em>quoting EPA v. Mink, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 87, 93 S.Ct. 827 at 836. This finding, which we find substantially supported, is the very one that MDC claims is lacking, Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21, and it confirms the Air Force\u2019s own determination \u2014 satisfying 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 806.23 (1976), <em>see MDC-I, supra, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. at 366-67, 566 F.2d at 258-59\u2014 that \u201ca significant governmental purpose would be served by withholding the documents . . . App. at 13. If government employees expected that every written recommendation, cost analysis, or feasibility opinion \u2014 as well as the criteria used in reaching the same \u2014 would be the object of intense scrutiny by the party adversely affected thereby, they would be likely only to communicate orally and/or conclusionally. The cost of such an eventuality in terms of efficiency and quality of decision-making could be great indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the government met its burden of proving that it has accurately described the withheld materials, and that those materi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ais fit within Exemption 5. The judgment of the District Court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">.
