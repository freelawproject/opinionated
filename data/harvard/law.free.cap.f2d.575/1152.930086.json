Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., </em>C.A. Nos. 4935 and G293-71 (W.D.Mich. Sept. 15, 1975), adopting, with an unpublished opinion, the report of the special master awarding plaintiff, as dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>ages for patent infringement, a reasonable royalty of <em>2</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>A%. </em>We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Litigation Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">In 1964 plaintiff Panduit Corp. (Panduit) sued defendant Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc. (Stahlin) for infringement of Panduit\u2019s Walch patent No. 3,024,301, covering duct for wiring of electrical control systems. In 1969, the district court found claim 5 valid and infringed by the \u201cLok-Slot\u201d and \u201cWeb-Slot\u201d ducts made and sold by Stahlin, enjoined Stahlin from further infringement, and ordered an accounting. 298 F.Supp. 435, 162 USPQ 114 (W.D.Mich.1969). That judgment was affirmed on appeal. 430 F.2d 221,166 USPQ 524 (6th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. </em>denied, 401 U.S. 939, 91 S.Ct. 932, 28 L.Ed.2d 218, 168 USPQ 673 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Thereafter, the district court adjudged Stahlin in contempt of the court\u2019s injunction, because of Stahlin\u2019s making and selling the \u201cTear Drop\u201d duct, a colorable imitation of the infringing \u201cLok-Slot,\u201d 338 F.Supp. 1240, 172 USPQ 650 (W.D.Mich. 1972). That judgment was also affirmed on appeal. 476 F.2d 1286, 178 USPQ 12 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">In 1971, the district court appointed a master to determine Panduit\u2019s damages pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to take evidence, and render a report on the issues of treble damages, interest, costs, and attorney fees. The district court, in adopting in toto the master\u2019s report, considered the master\u2019s findings of fact not clearly erroneous, and stated that \u201cthe Master had correctly applied the law to the circumstances of this case.\u201d The report recommended $44,709.60 in damages, based on a royalty of 2V2% of gross sales price, the percentage being calculated on Stahlin\u2019s testimony that its normal profit on all of its products was 4.04% and the concept that a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d entailed some level of profit to the \u201clicensee.\u201d <em>Horvath v. McCord Radiator and Mfg. Co., </em>100 F.2d 326 at 335, 40 USPQ 394 at 403 (6th Cir. 1938), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 U.S. 581, 60 S.Ct. 101, 84 L.Ed. 486, 43 USPQ 520 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">Fact Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">The duct manufactured by Panduit was invented by its president, Jack Caveney. Panduit began to make and sell the duct in 1955, and Caveney applied for a patent in 1956, In an interference proceeding in the Patent Office, it was determined that Walch, an employee of General Electric, was the first inventor of the duct. A patent issued to General Electric, as Walch\u2019s assignee, on March 6, 1962. Panduit then acquired the Walch patent from General Electric and established a firm policy of exercising its right to that patent property, 1. e., of the right to exclude others from making and selling the patented duct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-18\">Stahlin began to manufacture and sell the \u201cLok-Slot\u201d and \u201cWeb-Slot\u201d ducts in 1957, and continued to do so after issuance of the Walch patent and its sale to Panduit in 1962. On January 1, 1963, Stahlin introduced a price cut of approximately 30% on its \u201cLok-Slot\u201d and \u201cWeb-Slot\u201d ducts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-20\">Panduit seeks $808,003 as damages for lost profits on lost sales over the period March 6, 1962, the date of first infringement, to August 7, 1970, the effective date of the initial injunction;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, alternatively, a 35% reasonable royalty rate yielding $625,940. In addition, Panduit seeks $4,069,000 in profits lost on Panduit\u2019s own sales because of Stahlin\u2019s price cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-21\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-22\">The dispositive issue is whether the master\u2019s determination of a reasonable royalty was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, requires that the patent owner receive from the infringer \u201cdamages adequate to compensate for the infringement.\u201d In <em>Aro Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Convertible Top Replacement Co., </em>377 U.S. 476 at 507, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 1543, 12 L.Ed.2d 457, 141 USPQ 681 at 694 (1964), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-5\">But the present statutory rule is that only \u201cdamages\u201d may be recovered. These have been defined by this Court as \u201ccompensation for the pecuniary loss he [the patentee] has suffered from the infringement, without regard to the question whether the defendant has gained or lost by his unlawful acts.\u201d <em>Coupe v. Royer, </em>155 U.S. 565, 582, 15 S.Ct. 199, 39 L.Ed. 263. They have been said to constitute \u201cthe difference between his pecuniary condition after the infringement, and what his condition would have been if the infringement had not occurred.\u201d <em>Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Sargent, </em>117 U.S. 536, 552, 6 S.Ct. 934, 29 L.Ed. 954. The question to be asked in determining damages is \u201chow much had the Patent Holder and Licensee suffered by the infringement. And that question [is] primarily: had the Infringer not infringed, what would Patent Holder-Licensee have made?\u201d [Citing <em>Livesay Window Co. v. Livesay Industries, Inc., </em>251 F.2d 469, 471, 116 USPQ 167, 168 (5th Cir., 1958).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">Panduit argues that the district court erred (1) in denying Panduit its lost profits due to lost sales, or, in the alternative, a 35% reasonable royalty; and (2) in denying Panduit its lost profits from its own actual sales due to Stahlin\u2019s price cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Lost Profits Due to Lost Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">To obtain as damages the profits on sales he would have made absent the infringement, i. e., the sales made by the infringer, a patent owner must prove: (1) demand for the patented product, (2) absence of acceptable noninfringing substitutes, (3). his manufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the demand, and (4) the amount of the profit he would have made. 3 R. White, <em>Patent Litigation: Procedure and Tactics </em>\u00a7 9.03[2]. <em>See, e. g., Bros. Inc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., </em>320 F.2d 594 at 598, 138 USPQ 357 at 358 (5th Cir. 1963) and <em>Electric Pipe Line, Inc. v. Fluid Systems, Inc., </em>250 F.2d 697, 116 USPQ 25 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">It is not disputed that Panduit established elements (1) and (3). Regarding (2), the master found that: \u201cThe evidence clearly shows the existence of acceptable non-infringing substitute ducts which would have permitted the defendant to retain its customers.\u201d That finding, as discussed below, was in error. However, Pan-duit is not entitled to its lost profits on lost sales in this case because of its failure to establish element (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">The district court upheld as not clearly erroneous the master\u2019s finding that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence from which a fair determination could be made as to the amount of profit plaintiff would have made on such sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">Panduit\u2019s Achilles heel on element (4) is a lack of evidence on its fixed costs. Panduit alleges that its omission is overcome by other evidence and by <em>General Electric Co. v. Sciaky Bros., Inc., </em>415 F.2d 1068, 163 USPQ 257 (6th Cir. 1969). <em>Sciaky </em>is distinguishable and therefore not controlling on fixed costs. The accounting presented by Sciaky\u2019s expert witnesses included some overhead expenses, but omitted others which those witnesses testified were general and \u201cpaid by Sciaky during the years in question and would not have been greater if these additional machines had been produced and sold by Sciaky.\u201d 415 F.2d at 1075, 163 USPQ at 262. General Electric (the infringer) disputed that theory, but offered no testimony to contradict it. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-13\">Whether Sciaky\u2019s accounting method was accurate or not was a matter to be decided on the basis of testimony in the hearing before the Master. This was the specific function of that hearing. We do not believe that this issue can properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>decided as a matter of law before this court on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">415 F.2d at 1075, 163 USPQ at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">In the present case, Stahlin did dispute Panduit\u2019s accounting theory, presenting its own expert witnesses to contradict it. Under <em>Sciaky, </em>the accuracy of the patent owner\u2019s accounting method is \u201ca matter to be decided on the basis of testimony in the hearing before the Master.\u201d The master here found, on the basis of the evidence before him, and the district court agreed, that Panduit\u2019s accounting theory was deficient. As was said in <em>Sciaky:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-7\">[WJhere the District Court adopts the Master\u2019s findings of fact, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) provides that such findings \u201cshall be considered as the findings of the court\u201d which cannot be set aside unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">415 F.2d at 1073, 163 USPQ at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">We realize, as noted in <em>Sciaky, </em>that Pan-duit\u2019s theory is \u201cby no means novel in patent damage cases.\u201d 415 F.2d at 1075, 163 USPQ at .262. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of record sufficient to support a conclusion that the master\u2019s findings respecting Panduit\u2019s omission, whether of certain fixed costs or of certain variable costs, were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">Panduit\u2019s argument that the master was required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(d)(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to require a statement taking into account its omitted costs is without merit. The rule is discretionary, not mandatory, and it was not an abuse of the master\u2019s discretion to refuse the requested statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">On the issue of Panduit\u2019s lost profits on lost sales, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">Stahlin\u2019s Price Cut</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-16\">The district court upheld as not clearly erroneous the master\u2019s finding that: \u201cAny loss in [Panduit\u2019s] profits due to the price reduction was more than compensated by the gain in profits due to the increase in plaintiff\u2019s sales volume because of the price reduction. Thus, the price reduction resulted in a net increase in profit to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-17\">The right to damages caused by price reduction stands on the same ground as that to damages caused by lost sales. <em>McSherry Mfg. Co. v. Dowagiac Mfg. Co., </em>163 F. 34 at 35 (6th Cir. 1908). Having accepted the master\u2019s evaluation, that the testimony of Stahlin\u2019s accounting and economic experts was more credible and persuasive than that of Panduit\u2019s, we are bound, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, to accept as not clearly erroneous the master\u2019s finding that the price reduction in this case produced a net increase in Panduit\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-18\">We affirm, therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to award damages on the basis of Stahlin\u2019s price cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-19\">Reasonable Royalty</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-20\">When actual damages, e. g., lost profits, cannot be proved, the patent owner is entitled to a reasonable royalty. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284. <em>See also Enterprise Mfg. Co. v. Shakespeare Co., </em>141 F.2d 916 at 920, 61 USPQ 201 at 204 (6th Cir. 1944); <em>Egry Register Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Register Co., </em>23 F.2d 438 at 442 (6th Cir. 1928); <em>Wm. Bros Boiler and Mfg. Co. v. Gibson-Stewart Co., Inc., </em>312 F.2d 385 at 386, 136 USPQ 239 at 240 (6th Cir. 1963). A reasonable royalty is an amount \u201cwhich a person, desiring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>manufacture and sell a patented article, as a business proposition, would be willing to pay as a royalty and yet be able to make and sell the patented article, in the market, at a reasonable profit.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. v. Overman Cushion Tire Co., </em>95 F.2d 978 at 984, 37 USPQ 479 at 484 (6th Cir. 1937) (citing <em>Rockwood v. General Fire Extinguisher Co., </em>37 F.2d 62 at 66, 4 USPQ 299 at 303 (2d Cir. 1930)), <em>appeal dismissed on motion of counsel for petitioners, </em>306 U.S. 665, 59 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed. 1061 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">The key element in setting a reasonable royalty after determination of validity and infringement is the necessity for return to the date when the infringement began. In the present case, that date is March 6, 1962. On that date, Panduit possessed the particular property right found to have been infringed by Stahlin. On that date, Panduit had a particular profit margin, and the property right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented product. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that point Stahlin chose to continue the making and selling of the patented product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">As a result of Stahlin\u2019s election to infringe its property right, Panduit has suffered substantially. <em>See United States Frumentum Co. v. Lauhoff, </em>216 F. 610 (6th Cir. 1917). Though unable to prove the actual amount of lost profits or to establish a damage figure resulting from Stahlin\u2019s price cut, Panduit was clearly damaged by having been forced, against its will, to share sales of the patented product with Stahlin. Further, Panduit has been forced into thirteen years of expensive litigation, involving $400,000 in attorney fees, a trial, a contempt proceeding to enforce the court\u2019s injunction, a hearing on damages, and three appeals. For all this, the \u201cdamages adequate to compensate for the infringement,\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, have thus far been found to total $44,709.60.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">Having elected to continue the manufacture and sale of the patented duct after the patent issued, and having elected to manufacture and sell a second infringing product in the face of the court\u2019s injunction, Stahlin was able to make infringing sales, as found by the master, totalling $1,788,384.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">The setting of a reasonable royalty after infringement cannot be treated, as it was here, as the equivalent of ordinary royalty negotiations among truly \u201cwilling\u201d patent owners and licensees. That view would constitute a pretense that the infringement never happened. It would also make an election to infringe a handy means for competitors to impose a \u201ccompulsory license\u201d policy upon every patent owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">Except for the limited risk that the patent owner, over years of litigation, might meet the heavy burden of proving the four elements required for recovery of lost profits, the infringer would have nothing to lose, and everything to gain if he could count on paying only the normal, routine royalty non-infringers might have paid. As said by this court in another context, the infringer would be in a \u201cheads-I-win, tails-you-lose\u201d position. <em>Troxel Mfg. Co. v. Schwinn Bicycle Co., </em>465 F.2d 1253 at 1257, 175 USPQ 65 at 68 (6th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 939, 94 S.Ct. 1942, 40 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">On the date a patent issues, a competitor which made no investment in research and development of the invention, has four options: (1) it can make and sell a non-infringing substitute product, and refrain from making, using, or selling a prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>uct incorporating the patented invention; (2) it can make and sell the patented product, if the patent owner be willing, negotiating a license and paying a reasonable (negotiated) royalty; (3) it can simply take the invention, running the risk that litigation will ensue and that the patent will be found valid and infringed, or (4) it can take a license under option (2) and thereafter repudiate its contract, challenging the validity of the patent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Determination of a reasonable royalty, after election of option (3) , cannot, without injustice, be treated as though the infringer had elected option (2) in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">Determination of a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d after infringement, like many devices in the law, rests on a legal fiction. Created in an effort to \u201ccompensate\u201d when profits are not provable, the \u201creasonable royalty\u201d device conjures a \u201cwilling\u201d licensor and licensee, who like Ghosts of Christmas Past, are dimly seen as \u201cnegotiating\u201d a \u201clicense.\u201d There is, of course, no actual willingness on either side, and no license to do anything, the infringer being normally enjoined, as is Stahlin, from further manufacture, use, or sale of the patented product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">The amount of a reasonable royalty after infringement turns on the facts of each case, as best they may be determined. Among the relevant facts are: \u201cwhat plaintiff\u2019s property was, to what extent defendant has taken it, its usefulness and commercial value as shown by its advantages over other things and by the extent of its use,\u201d <em>United States Frumentum, </em>216 F. at 617, and the commercial situation, <em>Egry, </em>23 F.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">In determining that a reasonable royalty rate here was 2V2%, the master found: (1) there were present in the market on the date of first infringement acceptable nonin-fringing substitutes and competing duct producers, (2) Panduit could not have maintained a high price differential in the face of competition from the substitute ducts, (3) on the hypothetical negotiation date, both Panduit and Stahlin would have been aware of the competitive state of the market, and of the probability of future price cuts, including Stahlin\u2019s, (4) the testimony of Stah-lin\u2019s patent law expert, Scofield, was \u201cmore credible and persuasive and more in line with the factual realities of this case\u201d than the testimony of Panduit\u2019s patent law expert, and (5) Stahlin\u2019s profit on gross sales of all its products for the relevant period was 4.04%, and there was \u201cno evidence to indicate that the profit on its duct sales was significantly higher than the profit on its total sales generally.\u201d The district court held those findings not clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">In adopting the master\u2019s report, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-12\">The Master based his finding that non-infringing substitutes were available principally upon the additional finding that defendant was markedly successful in switching its customers to noninfringing products when that became necessary. The latter finding is not clearly erroneous, and although defendant was not actually selling the principal noninfringing substitute . . . during the relevant time period, it is not erroneous to conclude that the substitute was available. Cf. <em>Hughes Tool Co. v. G. W. Mur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number><em>phy Indus., Inc., </em>491 F.2d 923, 930-931 (5th Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The district court also found the master correct in defining an acceptable nonin-fringing substitute as \u201ca product which customers are willing to buy in place of the infringing product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">In concluding that error occurred with respect to substitutes, we are mindful of the comments of this court in <em>Enterprise Mfg., </em>141 F.2d at 920, 61 USPQ at 205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abu-dedup-0\">The appellee, by infringing use, has paid tribute to the utility of the device infringed. As was said by Judge Hicken-looper for this court, in <em>Seymour v. Ford Motor Company, </em>6 Cir., 44 F.2d 306, 308 [7 USPQ 182, 184]: \u201cThe patent is itself evidence of such utility, and the use of the patented device by the defendant has long been recognized as an admission of this fact, and as creating an estoppel upon the defendant to deny such utility. [Citing numerous cases.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-6\">There can be no doubt that, as found by the District Court, the substantial value of the Case patent was recognized by the infringer in its catalogues and other advertisements. The advantages proclaimed in these advertisements carry more forceful recognition of the value of the patent infringed than belated denial of its value rejects. Compare <em>Cugley v. Bundy Incubator Company, </em>6 Cir., 93 F.2d 932, 934 [36 USPQ 524, 526].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">Also pertinent are the comments of the court in <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>U.S. Plywood-Champion Papers, </em>318 F.Supp. 1116 at 1123, 166 USPQ 235 at 241 (S.D.N.Y.1970), <em>aff\u2019d </em>446 F.2d 295, 170 USPQ 369 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 870, 92 S.Ct. 105, 30 L.Ed.2d 114 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-11\">Noteworthy is the fact that, despite the allegedly fierce competition between the Weldtex [the patented goods] and other decorative plywoods, GP [plaintiff-in-fringer] deliberately decided to duplicate Weldtex notwithstanding the caveat of GP\u2019s own counsel that an expensive infringement suit was inevitable. GP\u2019s calculated infringement of Weldtex is an admission by conduct that it regarded Weldtex as occupying <em>a uniquely favorable position </em>in the market. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">In the present case, the master\u2019s finding that Panduit had competitors was not erroneous, but the implication drawn therefrom was. At the time the patent issued, there were four competitors, but they were recognized as making and selling not substitutes but <em>infringing </em>ducts. Competition between those selling infringing ducts was admittedly fierce. Infringer Stahlin, however, cannot expect to pay a lesser royalty, as compensation for its infringement, on the ground that it was not the only infringer. <em>Cf. Bros Inc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., </em>320 F.2d at 598, 138 USPQ at 358-59 (patent owner awarded lost profits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">Illustrative of the absence of acceptable substitutes is Stahlin\u2019s inability to avoid infringement, even if it had ever wanted to. Having begun manufacture of the duct in 1957, Stahlin continued after the patent issued in 1962, after Panduit instituted its infringement suit in 1964, and after the district court\u2019s injunction in 1969.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>At the time of the first injunction, virtually <em>all </em>of Stahlin\u2019s sales of electrical duct were of the infringing type. Stahlin\u2019s early-but-grudging recognition of the unique advantages of Panduit\u2019s patented duet was evidenced by an intra-company memo. Dated June 21, 1957, it was issued in the earliest stages of Stahlin\u2019s manufacture of the \u201cLok-Slot:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-4\">It seems that some of our customers have preferred a full-slotted channel; one that permits slipping the wire in place rather than threading the end through an opening. It\u2019s advantages are questionable but we always try to give our customers even more than they want. Thus, we have developed the Lok-Slot construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-5\">Lok-Slot construction is evident in the name. Like any slot, Lok-Slot permits easy entry of wires. <em>Unlike </em>any other slot, Lok-Slot keeps the wires from readily popping up all over the place while connections are being made. The reason is Lok-Slot\u2019s slim throat construction which allows single wires in and out easily enough but \u201cchokes up\u201d on \u201cmass exits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-6\">Using Panel Chanel with Lok-Slot construction, wires don\u2019t have to be threaded through the channel openings. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-7\">The Lok-Slot construction is not a cure-all. Frankly, it is not quite as easy to remove and put on the covers with this construction. In any event, there are some customers who prefer the full-slotted construction . . . and Lok-Slot is the best design approach yet to this form of channel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-9\">In other words, don\u2019t push this construction . . . but if there is customer preference in this direction, you have the best design to offer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">The district court opinion following the infringement trial recognized the same advantages over non-infringing ducts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-15\">General Electric produced a steel grille which had perforated round roles through which wires were threaded (PX 63A). This device was patented in the 1930\u2019s (PX 67-6A and PX 62, at 50-53). Another product in use in the early 1950\u2019s was a U-shaped wiring duct (PX 2) which incorporated multiple openings in the side walls through which wires were threaded and then connected to the electrical components.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-16\">However, ducts with holes also had shortcomings. When these ducts were filled with wires, the wires were rather inaccessible a\u00f1cl.it was difficult to trace individual wires or to revise the wiring. For example, to remove any wire from the duet, it was necessary to disconnect the wire and thread it back through the hole. If the wire was not near the top of the duct, it was frequently necessary to remove a number of wires to gain access to the wire being traced or rerouted. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-17\">Mr. Walch, in 1953 as a senior advance engineer at General Electric, was given a broad assignment to improve wiring practices, including the improvement of wiring duct design. Four desirable functions or results were stressed by Mr. Walch in his work on the design of an improved wiring duct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-18\">(1) Easy insertion of wires in the duct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-19\">(2) Prevention of accidental removal of wires from the duct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>(3) Provision of maximum useful space for leading wires out of the duct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-4\">(4) Facilitation of intentional removal of wires from the duct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">298 F.Supp. at 437-38,162 USPQ at 116-17. That evaluation was affirmed on appeal by this court. 430 F.2d at 225, 166 USPQ at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Proof of the absence of noninfringing substitutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-7\">[Ijnvolves some of the same evidence as that which was introduced in support of the validity of the patent. The patent owner who had proved a long-felt need for a particular invention has a lighter burden in establishing that his customers, as well as the infringer\u2019s customers, were in fact seeking to obtain the patented solution to such need or problem. The other side of the coin involves a strong showing by the infringer that although the patent may have embodied some trifling improvement which was patentable to a narrow extent, such improvement did not create any preference for the patented product rather than a nonin-fringing substitute. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">3 R. White, \u00a7 9.03[2]. The prior district and appellate court opinions leave no doubt that the patented product filled a waiting need and met with commercial success due to its merits. Stahlin\u2019s own intra-company memo (PX 58), and its $1,788,384 sales of infringing ducts during the period when allegedly acceptable noninfringing substitutes are now said to have been available, leave no doubt that the patented improvement created a substantial customer preference. A product lacking the advantages of that patented can hardly be termed a substitute \u201cacceptable\u201d to the customer who wants those advantages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The post-hoc circumstance that Stahlin, when finally forced to obey the court\u2019s injunction, was successful in \u201cswitching\u201d customers to a noninfringing product, does not destroy the advantage-recognition attributable to the patent over the prior 15 years. Those preferred advantages were recognized by Stahlin itself, by other infringers, by customers, by the district court, and by this court. That Stah-lin\u2019s customers, no longer <em>able </em>to buy the patented product from Stahlin, were willing to buy something else from Stahlin, does not establish that there was on the market during the period of infringement a product which customers in general were, in the master\u2019s words, \u201cwilling to buy in place of the infringing product.\u201d Moreover, Stah-lin\u2019s \u201cswitching\u201d occurred years <em>after </em>the date on which the determination of available substitutes must focus, i. e., the date of first infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">Hence, the 2Va% royalty rate recommended by the master and adopted by the district court is clearly erroneous on its face, the master\u2019s recommendation having been based in large part on erroneous finding (1), that there were \u201cacceptable\u201d noninfringing substitutes during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">The master\u2019s finding (2), that Panduit could not have maintained its high price differential (allegedly 30%) because of competition from substitutes, and his finding (3) that in March 1962 the parties were aware of the probability of a future price cut, must also fall. Evidence is lacking, as we have said, that acceptable substitutes were on the market on the focus-date of first infringement. For some five years after Stahlin began manufacture of its \u201cLok-Slot\u201d duct, purchasers of the patented product were willing to pay a substantial differential. It was not until January 1, 1963, some nine months after the hypothetically \u201cwilling\u201d licensor and licensee are supposed to have negotiated a royalty, that( Stahlin made its price cut. We find no evidence in the record to support the mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>ter\u2019s supposition that the parties would have had that future price cut in mind in March 1962. On the contrary, the hypothesis is that Stahlin was a royalty-paying licensee on January 1, 1963, and nothing of record indicates an expectation that a licensee would cut its price or that any particular room existed to accommodate both a price cut and royalty payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">Section 284 of the statute authorizes the use of experts in determining a reasonable royalty. However, the master\u2019s reliance on Scofield\u2019s testimony, and the district court\u2019s acceptance thereof, were clearly erroneous. That testimony was in substantial conflict with case law established in this circuit and elsewhere. Scofield testified that a reasonable royalty could be equated to the average value of all negotiated royalties, which in his experience was \u201cbetween 1 and 5 per cent of the net selling price of the products,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and concluded that a reasonable royalty in this case would be 2V2%. He specifically testified that his experience was in the negotiation of licenses generally, and that he had no experience in the determination of a reasonable royalty after infringement under \u00a7 284. Scofield specifically assumed, for purposes of his testimony, that there existed in the present ease acceptable non-infringing substitutes. He further ignored evidentiary facts considered relevant by this and other circuits. The analysis of this court in <em>Egry, </em>23 F.2d at 443, is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azi\">In fixing a reasonable royalty, the primary inquiry, often complicated by secondary ones, is what the parties would have agreed upon, if both were reasonably trying to reach an agreement. This must be modified by the commercial situation, and when the result is to interfere with a patent monopoly, which the patentee was in position to and desired to keep, by retaining the entire market himself, his compensation for parting against his will with that opportunity must take due account of the loss to him of anticipated profits on the business which the licensees will thus get away from him. It is a step further, and we think a necessary one, to say that, when the patentee\u2019s business scheme involves a reasonable expectation of making future profits by the continuing sale to the purchaser of the patented machine, of supplies to be furnished by the patentee, which future business he will lose by licensing a competitor to make the machine, this expectant loss is an element to be considered in retroactively determining a reasonable royalty; and this is so even though the expectation of such future business was not the result of any system of contract obligations, but was only expectation reasonably based on established business methods and customs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">In <em>Georgia-Pacific, supra, </em>the appellate court affirmed the analysis made by the district court at 318 F.Supp. at 1127, 116 USPQ at 243-44:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-8\">The amount of profits that USP [patent owner] was making and could (in February 1955 [when the infringement commenced]) reasonably expect to continue to make on its sales of Weldtex by licensing no one to sell Weldtex in the United States is of major relevance to the determination of the amount of royalty that USP would accept from GP and that GP would offer. USP was enjoying the profits of a readily salable product. USP was in a position to retain the entire market on striated fir plywood for itself. The result of GP\u2019s infringement was to interfere \u25a0 with that monopoly and, as planned, to put GP in direct competition with USP\u2019s Weldtex throughout the period of infringement. The hypothetical license would have been one whereby GP would have been permitted to market striated fir plywood through the United States (as GP infringingly did).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-10\">In the hypothetical negotiations, USP would have been reasonable in taking the position that it would not accept a royalty significantly less than the profit it was making by its policy of licensing no one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>to sell striated fir plywood in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Attorney Scofield may well have been \u201cpersuasive,\u201d but his testimony was based on general experience and invalid assumptions. There was clear error therefore in finding (4), that Scofield\u2019s testimony was \u201cin line with the factual realities of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Finding (5) was erroneously based on Stahlin\u2019s actual overall profit in all its products and on absence of proof of Stahlin\u2019s actual profit on its infringing sales. The infringer\u2019s profit element, in the post-judgment \u201creasonable royalty\u201d equation, is not related to the infringer\u2019s actual profit; nor is it designed to insure the anomalous result of guaranteeing an actual profit to an infringer (or the profit it would have made if there had been no infringement). The licensee-profit element is but one of the measures applicable in March 1962, and should be based on the customary profit allowed licensees in the industry at that time. Whether, as events unfurled thereafter, Stahlin would have made an actual profit, while paying the royalty determined as of March 1962, is irrelevant. If there had been no infringement, and if Stahlin had actually agreed to pay a royalty in March 1962, and if that royalty rate had then proven onerous, Stahlin might have renegotiated the royalty rate or canceled the license. But those options are no longer available to Stahlin, and their consideration in a formula for setting the royalty rate which would have been reasonable in March 1962 was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">Elements necessary to the determination of a reasonable royalty in the present case \u2014 Panduit\u2019s actual profit margin in March 1962, and the customary profit allowed licensees in the electrical duct industry,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 were not determined by the master in his report and cannot be discerned from the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They therefore must be determined on remand. On remand, the following factors must also be considered: (1) the lack of acceptable noninfringing substitutes, (2) Panduit\u2019s unvarying policy of not licensing the Walch patent, (3) the future business and attendant profit Pan-duit would expect to lose by licensing a competitor, and (4) that the infringed patent gave the entire marketable value to the infringed duct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the district court\u2019s determination of a reasonable royalty, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-10\">Upon finding for the claimant the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-23\">The court may receive expert testimony as an aid to the determination of damages or of what royalty would be reasonable under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1227-24\">.

Only particular physical embodiments, i. e., particular \u201cuses,\u201d of ideas are subject to patenting. Hence, one physical embodiment of an idea may be patentable, while a second embodiment of the same idea may not, because the first embodiment met the statutory requirements of novelty, usefulness and nonobviousness, and the second did not. Similarly, two physical embodiments of the same idea, if each meets the statutory requirements, may each be patented. Before a patent issues, throughout its life, and after it expires, the idea embodied, never having left the public domain, remains alive and well and may find itself reembodied in other physical embodiments which, if they be new, useful and nonobvious, may themselves be patented.
