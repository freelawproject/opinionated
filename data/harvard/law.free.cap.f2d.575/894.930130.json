The certificates were, however, conditioned to limit the percentage of offshore gas reserves which could be sequestered to twenty percent. Additional conditions were also imposed. The producers ultimately rejected the certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">In light of this development, we believe the case no longer presents a continuing controversy. Consequently, it is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
