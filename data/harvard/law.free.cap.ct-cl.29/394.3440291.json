A claim for injury to the franchise of a turnpike company by removing a tollgate and forbidding the collection of tolls is a claim <em>\u201cgrowing oitb of the destruction or damage to property\u201d </em>within the intent of the Bowman Act, section 3, and is thereby excluded from the jurisdiction of the court.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>The Reporters\u2019 </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">The allegations of the petition demurred to, and the grounds of the demurrer are stated in the opinion of the court:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-5\"><em>Mr. G.

The grant of jurisdiction in the first clause of the statute is broad, but as to claims founded upon acts which occurred during the late war, there is a substantial limitation in the third section, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The jurisdiction of said court shall not extend to or include any claim against the United States growing out of the destruction or damage to property by the Army and Navy during the war for the suppression of the rebellion, or the use and occupation of real estate by any part of the military or naval forces during said war at the seat of war.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Tliis section has been brought before us several times for interpretation. In <em>Beasely\u2019s Case </em>(21 C. Cls. R., p. 225) it appeared that to protect themselves from a threatened attack the Government forces in Tennessee had torn down a blacksmith shop, had used the material and some cord wood in the erection of temporary breast-works, the blacksmith\u2019s tools disappearing in the event. That case we dismissed for want of jurisdiction, holding that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><em>\" </em>Congress did not intend [by the Bowman Act] to recognize in the remotest degree any liability on the part of the United States growing out of the prosecution of belligerent operations against the public enemy. * * * The very acts complained of were acts of war on the part of the forces of the United States, to wit, the erection of temporary breastworks or fortifications made necessary by the proximity of the enemy and his threatened attack. * * * The facts of the taking in this case * * * in effect establish a damage or destruction of property by the Army of the United States as a part of its belligerent operations against the Confederate forces. If, in the absence of actual or threatened hostilities, the military forces of the United States used the materials of a building for. purposes of use not incident to actual or threatened hostilities, then such material might be denominated supplies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In <em>Heflebower\u2019s Case (ibid., </em>p. 228) the court held (p. 239) that (under the Bowman Act) it was prohibited from exercising jurisdiction in the instance <em>a </em>of claims growing out of the destruction of or damage to property, real or personal, by the Army or Kavy, wherever situated * * * and whether by the depredation of soldiers or the authority of officers, it being understood that this applies to all property where the taking, user, or occupancy was incident to the ravages of war and worked no benefit or saving to the Government from which a contract ought in equity and good conscience to be implied.\u201d Also <em>(ibid.) </em>\u201cof cases for the use and occupation of real property by the military and naval forces of the United States where at the time of the user and occupancy the territory was hostile, that is to say, where at the time of the user and occupancy the Army was operating, in the judgment of the President, in enemy\u2019s country, and no means being authorized by the statute for ascertaining whether the owner adhered to the United States or to their enemies, no obligation of contract arises or can be implied.\u201d Also <em>(ibid., </em>p. 240) <em>u </em>of cases for the use and occupation of real property on loyal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>territory where the user or occupancy was caused by battles or marches, or was transitory in its nature and incident to the movement and operation of hostile forces, and was not for the prolonged camping, housing, or dwelling of troops.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The \u201c <em>Overton Hotel\u201d Case </em>(23 C. C1s. R.,p.l86) decides \u201c that Congress, in the passage of the Bowman Act, intended to exclude from the jurisdiction of this court claims for the use and occupation of real estate begun by the military forces of the United States in their operations during the war at the seat of war and continued thereafter so long as said forces were engaged in military operations for the suppression of the rebellion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">This court decided in the case of the <em>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company </em>v. <em>The United States </em>(19 C. Cls. R., p. 300) that Virginia <em>\u201c </em>engaged in war against the United States,\u201d April 17, 1861. (See also <em>Carter\u2019s </em>Case, 23 C. Cls. R., p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">From the acts of the Government in relation to this turnpike, no contract arose by implication, for the seizure was by force for military purposes, and without intent or purpose to compensate the owners for any loss they might sustain. Nor was the use of the road (as the claim is nowmade) one for \u201c the use or occupation of real estate by any part of the military or naval forces of the United States in the operation of said forces during the said war at the seat of war.\u201d On the contrary, the demand now made is for tolls, which but for the seizure would have been collected; that is for seizure of the franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The distinction, however, is not important. Virginia was the seat of Avar May 24,1861, as Ave have already held, and as, in substance, the petition admits when it alleges that on that day \u201cthe Union army marched into and took possession of the county and city of Alexandria, under the authority of the United States.\u201d So, if the claim were for the use and occupation of real estate, it would be excluded from our jurisdiction, as the real estate Avas at the seat of war when it Avas seized, and the road being thereafter used for military operations, the doctrines of the cases above cited apply. The claim, however, is nowmade for injury to the franchise; it is founded upon loss of profits, and therefore grows out of a damage to property by the Army during the war. This being so, the third section of the Bowman Act excludesit from our jurisdiction, and the cas\u00e9-is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
