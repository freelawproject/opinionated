The claimant duly made his election on the 1st day of June, 1892, to accept the amount allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, and at the same time filed his request for judgment; but the defendants did not within sixty days, nor at any time since until the present motion, file any defense, and did not have the time for making a defense extended before the lapse of said sixty days. Consequently no motion on the part of the defense can now be entertained, and nothing remains to be done but for the court to enter judgment for the amount allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance with the claimant\u2019s election and request for judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">Inasmuch as the claimant has elected to accept the amount allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, the defendants can not interpose any defense by raising a question of jurisdiction or any other question without first reopening the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\">The statute is clear and explicit. It extends the jurisdiction of this court \u201c to all cases which have been examined and allowed by the Interior Department,\u201d and provides that such claims \u201c shall have priority of consideration by the court,\u201d and that judgments for the amounts therein found due shall be rendered, unless either the claimant or the defendant shall elect to reopen the case and try the same before the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">Further, in <em>Hyne </em>v. <em>United States and Chippewa </em>Indians, decided by this court January 11, 1892, the court says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-11\">\u201cThe finding and allowance of the Interior Department, unless disputed by the claimant or the United States, becomes in this court an award upon which it is the duty of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to render' a judgment, affirming to tbe claimant tbe amount allowed by tbe action of tbe Department.

L., 979), cited in claimant\u2019s reply to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss election, together with what- is known as tbe Intercourse Act of 1834, shows conclusively tbat tbe Apache Indians were chargeable under tbat treaty for tbe depredations alleged to have been committed in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">1. Tbe treaty applies to all Apache Indians situate and living within the United States:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">2. It provides for pepetual peace and amity. (Art. 2.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-8\">3.

Tbe <em>Intercourse Act of 1834 </em>(4 Stat. L., 749), as well as other legislation on tbe subject, all of which were iu force at tbe date this treaty was concluded, and also at tbe time of tbe alleged depredation, imposed upon tbe Indians an obligation to pay for losses suffered on account of property taken or destroyed by them. (See particularly Eeport of Commissioner of Indian Affairs of the year 1890, p. 127.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">Lastly, under tbe <em>Intercourse Act of June 30,1834 </em>(4 Stat., 749), tbe claimant has a valid claim against the United States, which is also a defendant in this case. Though the act of 1834 was partially repealed by the act of February 28,1859, yet by the joint resolution of June 25,1860, Congress declared that this repeal should not be so construed as to destroy any right to indemnity which existed at the date of said act approved February 28,1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-11\">In this case tbe depredations were committed in 1853 and 1855.

Upon the 1st day of June, 1892, the claimant filed an amended petition, expressing a willingness to accept the said sum of $900 in full satisfaction of the claim: Inasmuch as the claimant did not desire to reopen the said allowance, and as the defendants had not done so, the said claimant moved for a judgment upon the alleged finding of said Department and the failure of either party to reopen the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The allowance of the motion is resisted by the defendants upon the ground that it is not an \u201c examined, approved, and allowed case\u201d within the meaning of the act of March 3, 1891, s\u00f3 as to bring it within the terms' of s\u00e9ction 4, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\"><em>\u201c * </em>* <em>* Provided-, </em>That all unpaid claims which have heretofore been examined, approved, and allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, or under his direction, in pursuance of the act of Congress making appropriations for the current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes for the year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, and for other purposes, approved March third, eighteen hundred and eighty-five, and subsequent Indian appropriation- acts, shall have priority of consideration by such court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYP\">\u201cAnd judgments for the amounts therein found'due shall be rendered, unless either the .claimant or the United States shall elect t\u00f3 reopen the case and try the same before the court, in which event the testimony in the case given by the witnesses and the documentary evidence, including reports of \u00abDepartment agents therein, may be read as depositions and proofs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On January 4,1894, the defendants filed the following motion to dismiss election:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u201c Come the defendants, by the Assistant Attorney-General, and move the court to dismiss the election to accept the allowance and award made by the Secretary of the Interior October 25,1886, and for grounds of motion sbow as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201c (1) That said case is not an allowed and preferred case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201c (2) That the allowance made by the Secretary of the Interior is null and void;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201c (3) That said claim was not one authorized by law to be examined and allowed by the Secretary of the Interior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201c (4) That the Secretary of the Interior had no authority to find said defendant Indians liable for said alleged depredation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201c (5) The defendant Indians are not liable for said alleged depredations under the treaty referred to by the Secretary of the Interior of 1852 (10 Stat. L., p. 979).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">The claimant, in electing to abide by the alleged allowance of the Secretary, claims to do so under the foregoing provisions of the fourth section of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The defendants, although they intend to reopen the case, do not want to be subject to that clause of the law which provides \u201cthat the party electing to reopen the case shall assume the burden of proof;\u201d and hence have filed this motion, raising the question whether the action of the Department was such as to give the claimant the right to elect and thereby subject the defendants to the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The burden of proof is often of great importance in a judicial controversy, and the result is frequently determined by the decision of the question as to who has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u201cWhoever seeks to be benefited by any fact is bound to establish it, and the burden of proof is accordingly said to be upon him.\u201d (Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary, 172.) It is alleged, with other reasons in the motion of the defendants, \u201c that <em>this </em>case is-not an allowed and preferred case.\u201d That said claim was not one authorized by law to be examined and allowed by the Secretary of the Interior. . The other objections to the claim alleged in the motion of defendants are in substance and law the same as the objection stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">If the claim is not examined, approved, and allowed within the meaning of the law, then the claimant has no right to. elect, but must establish his claim by sufficient and competent evidence; and the defendants are not subjected to the responsibility of having opened the case within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The following are the proceedings incident to this claim by the officers of the United States:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The Indian agent submitted the claim to a council of the Indians, who denied all knowledge of the depredation, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>.bis report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, bearing date of September 1, 1875, says: \u201c Owing to tbe length of time that has elapsed since the depredation was committed, find it impossible to obtain any further evidence than contained in the affidavit accompanying this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">On the 1st day of October, 1886, special agent of the Interior Department made the following report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\u201c1. In conclusion, the evidence heretofore alluded to \u2014 and it is all that could be gathered in the neighborhood of said depredations, for I went up to Mora in search of information with regard to the same \u2014 while it is altogether unsatisfactory as to said second depredation, appears to me to be sufficient to prove that the first depredation was committed as alleged in said petition: that by it the said Juan de Jesus Mares lost about seventy-five Mexican beef cattle; that none of said seventy-five cattle were ever recovered; that private satisfaction or revenge was not sought; that the average value of said cattle was $12.00 per head, making the sum of nine hundred dollars ($900.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Bespectfully submitted. \u201c S.

That the Charge in the petition of the depredation in June, 1855, is not sustained by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">\u201c 2. That on the 13th of June, 1853, at Agua Negro, in the Territory of New Mexico, Jaccarilla Apache Indians committed a depredation on claimant\u2019s property, whereby claimant lost 75 head of cattle, of Mexican breed, of the value of $12 per head, aggregating the sum of $900.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">\u201c 3. That claimant is not chargeable with any contributory negligence in said loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">\u201c 4.

Belt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\"><em>11 Acting </em>Commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">It is insisted by the defendants that there was no jurisdiction in the Secretary of the Interior to.consider the claim; and if he made an allowance, as contended for by claimant, it was without authority of law, and is not an \u2022 allowed case within the meaning of the statute, so as to give the right of election and adoption on the part of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The contention of the defendants is, that there being no express stipulation in the treaty to pay for depredations, no responsibility can arise from a general obligation to keep the peace and to treat honestly and humanely all citizens of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The act of 1885 requires that the Secretary, in his allowance of a claim, shall designate \u201c the date and clause of the treaty creating the obligation of payment.\u201d The general agreement to keep the peace would ordinarily make the parties responsible for all damages arising from a failure to perform that general duty; but is it such an obligation as will constitute a basis upon which the Secretary may predicate an allowance and a report to Congress'? While Congress might be willing to trust the Department with the decision of the question of fact, whether a depredation had been committed and the application of a plain provision of a treaty agreeing to pay for such depredation, it does not follow that they would submit to the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>of tbe Department tlie question of allowance founded upon the general provision of the treaty and arising from construction, and not from express stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In the case of <em>Marks, et al </em>vs. <em>The United States and the Bannock Indians </em>(28 C. Cls. R., 146) the court had occasion to consider the question of Indian liability under a treaty where there was a want of amity. In that case the treaty provided that in case certain conditions were complied with upon the part of the party suffering from the depredation, the amount of it was to be taken from the annuities or other monies due the Indians from the United States. In this case, there is no such treaty, and the question arises can the Secretary of the Interior deduce a liability from the general provisions of the treaty, so as to confer jurisdiction under the act of 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The act provides that the Secretary shall cause a complete list of claims t\u00f3 be made, showing the name and address of the claimant, the date of the alleged depredation, by what tribe committed, the date and clause of the treaty creating the obligation of payment to be made and presented to Congress at its next session. The Secretary in this case has referred to Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the treaty (10 Stat. L., 979) as the ground of the liability of the Indians, but it is, if any, a general liability without any undertaking in terms upon the .part of the Indians to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The act of 1891 recognizes as an allowed claim such a claim as the Secretary \u201cexamined, approved, and allowed\u201d in pursuance to the act of Congress,* and if the Secretary had no jurisdiction of a claim unless there is an express provision of a treaty providing for payment and annuities applicable to such payment, then his action in allowing the claim is without authority of law. The obligation of the Indians in the treaty .of July 1,1852, is a general obligation, and while the terms of the treaty are broad, there is no specific and express agreement for the payment of the damages of Indian depredations. The Secretary of the Interior had no power to examine and allow the claim, inasmuch as there was no undertaking upon the part of the Indians, and being without authority, the finding is not an allowed case within the meaning of the statute, and the claimant has no power to elect, so as to shift the burden of proof to the defendants. The motion of the defendants is allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
