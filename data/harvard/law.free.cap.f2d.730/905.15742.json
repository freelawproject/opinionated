Plaintiff Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) appeals from a decision of the Eastern District of New York, Circuit Judge George C. Pratt, sitting by designation, 510 F.Supp. 908, denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court ruled that the relevant RICO provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>sion, \u00a7 1964(c), permits an attorney\u2019s.fee to be awarded only to a plaintiff who obtains a judgment for damages on the merits; since Aetna settled its claim before trial, he denied the motion for fees and costs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Aetna filed this suit under, <em>inter alia, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 in August 1981, claiming that defendant Stuart Liebowitz, an insurance broker, illegally converted to his own use money paid to him as insurance premiums by applicants for automobile insurance through New York\u2019s assigned risk pool. The premiums belonged to Aetna and other insurers and were required to be deposited in a trust account for their benefit. Instead, Liebowitz kept the applicants\u2019 payments, and sent his own checks on to the insurers; those checks were returned for insufficient funds. Aetna alone received 321 bad checks with a total face value of $51,006.55 and it represented only 8.7% of the plan\u2019s business. Thus Liebowitz\u2019s practice bore all the earmarks of deliberate fraud. Aetna alleged that his activities violated the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which is specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(B) as a predicate offense for a RICO violation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aetna also alleged several state law causes of action, including conversion and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">In October 1981 Aetna moved for a preliminary injunction that would require Liebowitz to pay insurers by certified check or money order. On December 8, 1981, after three days of live testimony Judge Pratt found a likelihood of success on the merits, a probability of irreparable harm to the plaintiff, and a balance of hardships in Aetna\u2019s favor. Accordingly he granted the injunction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65. In doing so, Judge Pratt expressly stated that he was not acting on the state law claims: \u201cI view my function as simply enforcing federal law as it is set forth in the Civil RICO statute and the mail fraud statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOq\">After further discovery Aetna moved in April 1982 for summary judgment. On April 29, 1982, however, the parties agreed to settle the action. Under the terms of the settlement agreement Liebowitz would be permanently enjoined from participating in the insurance business, he would be liable to Aetna for $160,000, and Aetna would apply to the district court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The agreement also provided, however, that Aetna would not seek to enforce the $160,000 judgment or to collect any fees it might be awarded, provided Liebowitz 'paid Aetna $100,000 by October 21, 1982. Judgment in accordance with the settlement was filed on May 7, 1982. The record indicates that Liebowitz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>has defaulted on the $100,000 payment and that Aetna has instituted proceedings to enforce the $160,000 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Aetna moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in May 1982, arguing that such an award was allowed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). After affirming his authority to grant the previously-issued preliminary injunction Judge Pratt denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. He ruled that in the absence of statutory language authorizing an award of such fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and in view of the close parallel between the language of \u00a7 1964(c) and that of previously-construed identical language of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, from which it was borrowed, an award of attorney\u2019s fees must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Appellant\u2019s right to an attorney\u2019s fee turns on the construction to be given to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-8\">\u201c(c) Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Unless this language may be construed to permit an attorney\u2019s fee award, the judgment of the district court must be affirmed, <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 269-71, 9o S.Ct. 1612, 1627-28, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) (with few exceptions the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d requires each party to bear his attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Even when the foregoing language is liberally construed to effectuate RICO\u2019s purpose, as the statute expressly commands us to do, see \u00a7 904(a) of Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 947,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as would in any event be required in construing a fee-shifting provision, <em>see Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 415-17, 98 S.Ct. 694, 697-98, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>Carey v. New York Gaslight Club, Inc., </em>598 F.2d 1253, 1256 (2d Cir.1979), <em>aff'd, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980), it appears on its face to require a civil RICO plaintiff, in order to qualify for an attorney\u2019s fee, first to prove that he has suffered injury to his business or property as a result of the RICO violation and to recover the damages sustained and the cost of the suit, of which the attorney\u2019s fee would be deemed part. Nothing in the statute\u2019s language indicates an intent to authorize an attorney's fee award for obtaining injunctive relief, as distinguished from damages, or for a plaintiff\u2019s successfully negotiating a settlement of his claim. No general or flexible terms permitting such a construction are to be found; the statute says treble damages \u201cand\u201d attorney\u2019s fees, not \u201cor\u201d attorney\u2019s fees. Absent legislative history or other evidence to the effect that Congress meant something other than what it provided in plain language, we are powerless to change the statute\u2019s terms. <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980); <em>Burns v. Alcala, </em>420 U.S. 575, 580-81, 95 S.Ct. 1180, 1184-85, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">Turning to the legislative history of \u00a7 1964(c), we find nothing indicating a Congressional intent to authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees when there has been less than a final recovery of damages and costs. Indeed, the history on the subject is completely silent. RICO was enacted in 1970, several years before Congress undertook a program of widespread encouragement of private enforcement of certain laws through enactment of provisions authorizing attorney\u2019s fee awards to a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d a term considerably broader and more flexible than that found in \u00a7 1964(c). The fee-award terms of RICO, in contrast, appear to have been borrowed almost verbatim from \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15. <em>See </em>113 Cong.Rec. 17,999 (1967) (Statement of Senator Hruska). Section 4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>\u201cAny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">At the time when Congress imported this language from \u00a7 4 into RICO, the Clayton Act had long been construed by federal courts as not authorizing an attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded to a plaintiff who only obtained injunctive relief, as distinguished from one who successfully prosecuted his antitrust claim to a judgment for damages. <em>See, e.g., Ring v. Spina, </em>84 F.Supp. 403, 408 (S.D.N.Y.1949); <em>Alden-Rochelle, Inc. v. ASCAP, </em>80 F.Supp. 888, 899 (S.D.N.Y. 1948); <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, </em>51 F.Supp. 36, 40 (S.D.N.Y.1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The general interpretation of \u00a7 4 was summarized by the court in <em>Byram Concretantes, Inc. v. Warren Concrete Prods., </em>374 F.2d 649, 651 (3d Cir.1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-6\">\u201cIn a long line of cases the courts have interpreted this section of the Clayton Act not to permit plaintiffs to recover attorneys\u2019 fees unless treble damages are awarded, regardless of whether injunctive relief is granted. <em>Clabaugh v. Southern Wholesale Grocers Association, </em>181 F. 706 (C.C.Ala.1910); <em>Decorative Stone Co. v. Building Trades Council of Westchester County, </em>23 F.2d 426 (2nd Cir.1928); <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, I.B. of E. Workers, </em>51 F.Supp. 36 (D.C.N.Y.1943); <em>Alden-Rochelle, Inc. v. American Soc. of C., A. and P., </em>80 F.Supp. 888 (D.C.N.Y.1948); but compare <em>Finley v. Music Corp. of America, </em>66 F.Supp. 569 (D.C.Calif. 1946).\u201d 374 F.2d at 651.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">In view of this settled interpretation of \u00a7 4, of which Congress was presumptively aware, it is unlikely that it would have used the identical language in \u00a7 1964(c) if it intended that statute to authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees for enforcement efforts short of full recovery. As Congress later demonstrated, when it desired to permit attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to a plaintiff who does not litigate his claim through to trial, it knew how to say so, using such broad terms as \u201csubstantially prevails\u201d or the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is this broad language, nowhere to be found in civil RICO, that permits one who has not obtained a final decision on the merits to be eligible for a fee award. <em>See Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980); <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Foster v. Boorstin, </em>561 F.2d 340, 342-43 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Watt, </em>554 F.Supp. 36, 39 (E.D.N.Y.1982); <em>Parker v. Matthews, </em>411 F.Supp. 1059, 1061-64 (D.D.C.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>561 F.2d 320 (D.C.Cir.1977). Defendant\u2019s argument that the \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d notion did not arise until after 1970, when RICO was enacted, only confirms our view that Congress did not intend to adopt that concept in RICO. In construing the statute we can look only to Congress\u2019 intent when it passed the legislation and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>to unverifiable guesses as to what its intent would be today.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Aetna argues that the foregoing restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act is neither binding nor relevant to the interpretation of \u00a7 1964(c) of RICO for the reason that the Clayton Act contained two remedy provisions, one authorizing recovery of damages (\u00a7 4) and the other injunctive relief (\u00a7 16), whereas RICO contains only one section (\u00a7 1964(c)) which does not refer to injunctive relief. Section 16 of the Clayton Act did not (prior to its amendment in 1976) authorize an attorney\u2019s fee award to a plaintiff who succeeded in obtaining injunctive relief. Since RICO, on the other hand, does not have any equivalent to \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act, Aetna argues that \u00a7 1964(c) should be construed liberally to permit a fee award for obtaining injunctive relief. The argument, being a <em>non sequitur, </em>must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The existence or non-existence in RICO of a provision comparable to \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act cannot provide the basis for changing the language of \u00a7 1964(c) of RICO. Indeed, once the Supreme Court handed down <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946), which postdated the enactment of the Clayton Act, a specific statutory provision authorizing preliminary injunctive relief to maintain the status quo was no longer necessary, for in <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>the Court stated that \u201cwhere legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u201d 327 U.S. at 684, 66 S.Ct. at 777. <em>See also SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 1082, 1103-04 (2d Cir.1972). More importantly, when Congress enacted RICO in 1970 the unavailability of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act was well settled. Yet Congress took no steps in enacting RICO to expressly authorize attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff obtaining preliminary or any other kind of injunctive relief. Indeed, it was not until 1976, in response to <em>Alyeska, </em>that Congress amended \u00a7 16 to allow for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in an action for injunctive relief. Pub.L. 94-435, Tit. Ill, \u00a7 302(3), 90 Stat. 1396. In so doing, Congress expressly authorized a grant of fees to an antitrust plaintiff who \u201csubstantially prevails.\u201d It could have made the same amendment to civil RICO but did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We do not dispute that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs who obtain injunctive relief against violations of RICO or who successfully settle damage suits under that law would encourage enforcement of the statute by private attorneys general. Indeed, a plaintiff who recovers treble d\u00e1mages may have less need for the incentive of an attorney\u2019s fee award than one who obtains injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">If Congress were enacting RICO <em>de novo </em>today it could adopt a broad fee-shifting provision of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d or \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d-type that has been the hallmark of scores of more recently-enacted laws. But Congress is not passing RICO today. We are called upon to interpret a statute passed back in 1970 before the nuances and scope of private enforcement were fully recognized. We cannot change the law to shift attorney\u2019s fees because it might be in the public interest; that is the teaching of <em>Alyeska. </em>We are bound by the legislative intent that existed when RICO was passed. Congress is free to change that law if it desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\">. \"\u00a7 1962.
