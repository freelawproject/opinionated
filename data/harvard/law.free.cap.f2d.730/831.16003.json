Since November, 1981 Marshfield was allowed an open account. It paid monthly, before the 10th of the month following, in order to receive a discount, usually by check drawn on defendant South Shore Bank. According to plaintiff\u2019s complaint Marshfield\u2019s check drawn on April 9, 1982, in the amount of $44,-166.75, in payment for March deliveries, was deposited by plaintiff in its Connecticut bank on April 19, and was returned on April 28, stamped Insufficient Funds. Plaintiff telephoned Marshfield and was told that there were funds and that the check would be honored, and, accordingly, redeposited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">On, May 3 plaintiff\u2019s bank received the check back, again marked Insufficient Funds. Plaintiff telephoned defendant and was told that there always had been funds, but that they were tied up by Marshfield\u2019s agreement with certain creditors, and that the check would not be honored. Plaintiff alleges that, as a non-party, it should not have been affected by this agreement. Marshfield shortly ceased doing business, and later that month was petitioned into bankruptcy. Defendant claimed as a secured creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding. It was not asserted that plaintiff\u2019s cement was part of the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">During April, but prior to April 28, plaintiff had shipped additional cement to Marshfield, to the value of $45,136.36. For this it did not receive a check; nor is there any allegation that there would have been funds to cover one. Plaintiff, however, seeks to recover $89,302.11 from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>In count one plaintiff alleges that, \u201cby its maintenance of a checking account on behalf of Marshfield, the Bank agreed to make payment on all of [Marshfield\u2019s] checks ... to the intended beneficiaries, <em>i.e., </em>payees, of said checks,\u201d unless \u201crightfully\u201d dishonored; that defendant\u2019s \u201cknowing and wrongful failure\u201d to pay plaintiff\u2019s check \u201cbreached its obligation to Marsh-field, and to Atlantic as the intended payee of that check.\u201d Count two repeated the allegations of count one, and alleged that non-payment of the check was a \u201cwillful and deliberate\u201d violation of Mass.G.L. c. 93A \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, and was \u201cfor the single purpose of continuing in wrongful possession of funds deposited by Marshfield into its checking account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">On motion, the court dismissed both counts, with a memorandum opinion fully explaining their lack of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">After these counts were dismissed, plaintiff sought to amend by adding what we will call count three, for \u201cmoney had and received,\u201d asserting that defendant refused to honor \u201cthe check ... because its release of any funds maintained by Marshfield ... [Marshfield being insolvent at the time] would have reduced the likelihood that Marshfield could discharge its indebtedness to defendant.\u201d With commendable forthrightness the court denied the amendment as being without merit, rather than as a matter of discretion. We will, accordingly, consider its merits, if any, as being before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">We find all counts to be singularly devoid of merit. The relationship of depositors (drawers), banks (drawees) and payees of checks is fully determined by the Uniform Commercial Code, Mass.G.L. c. 106. For present purposes, the controlling section is 3-409(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\"><em>Draft not an Assignment </em>(1) A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of any funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until he accepts it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">This statute is a clear rejection of plaintiff\u2019s third party beneficiary \u201ccommon law\u201d conception that a payee should be allowed to sue the drawee if the drawee violated an obligation to the drawer. This was not even the common law, and this is not the type of common law change effected by <em>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart v. SCA Services Corp., </em>378 Mass. 535, 392 N.E.2d 1045 (1979). <em>See Continental Bronze Co. v. Salvo &amp; Armstrong Co., </em>8 Mass.App. 799, 397 N.E.2d 1143, 1146 (1979); <em>Carr v. National Security Bank, </em>1871, 107 Mass. 45. There are many reasons for this rule, but one basic reason has long been to permit an unaccepting drawee to avoid disputes with other than the drawer. <em>See, e.g., Bullard v. Randall, </em>1 Gray 605 (67 Mass.) (1854).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">A payee of a check must be presumed to know the statute. Plaintiff, however, precisely contrary thereto, alleges that the \u201cchecks\u2019 explicit representation that their full amounts were \u2018Payable at South Shore Multibank\u2019 \u201d \u201cacknowledged an agreement\u201d effected by the \u201cmaintenance of a checking account,\u201d creating an \u201cobligation to Marshfield, and to Atlantic as the intended payee,\u201d to pay if there were funds available and the drawer had not stopped payment. It adds, as an admittedly \u201cextraordinary\u201d special reason for this, that Marsh-field was indebted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">We find nothing extraordinary about the facts. The statute speaks for itself. Plaintiff alleges no special agreement by the bank to accept its checks, nor does it advance possible consideration for such an agreement. Passing, for the moment, the matter of the special reason\u2019s relevancy, it must be an everyday occurrence for depositors to be indebted to their banks in some connection. That this should contradict the statutory provision is little short of preposterous.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">What would seem to us extraordinary are not the facts, but that plaintiff should claim a substantial exception in a clear and unambiguous statute. In some 40 pages of brief, reply brief, and uninvited post-argument letter, plaintiff furnishes nothing even suggesting such a result, other than its ipse dixit assertion that the court\u2019s \u201cstrict application of the UCC was unsup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>portably myopic,\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily unfair.\u201d It was neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">As to count two, Mass.G.L. c. 93A requires an unfair or deceptive act, plus reliance and injury. Plaintiff would have it that there were \u201cheinous deceptions;\u201d that it was \u201clured____into relying on an established course of usual and legitimate business conduct,\u201d and that \u201cin reliance on the Bank\u2019s continued performance of its obligation to Marshfield under their checking account agreement,\u201d \u201cupon which Atlantic had come to rely,\u201d it extended credit and fell victim to \u201cthe Bank\u2019s deliberately unfair and deceptive trade practices,\u201d \u201ca full-blown scheme of extraordinary deceit and breach of duty.\u201d When the smoke is blown away, this is simply that plaintiff would regard a defendant\u2019s honoring checks in the past as constituting a representation that it would continue to do so. Millions of cheeks clear every day; are the banks thereby setting themselves up as guarantors to their depositors\u2019 future creditors? This cannot be possible. Barring something other than the mere act of acceptance, there is no representation to a payee except that the bank will pay the check it has accepted. Chapter 93A cannot convert the mere act of honoring a check into a representation as to the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Plaintiff asserts that it was a misrepresentation to mark the check Insufficient Funds when in fact there were funds and the creditors\u2019 agreement, allegedly, did not foreclose payment. To the extent that Insufficient Funds was a misrepresentation, as distinguished from a more general assertion that the bank was declining to pay, it was an irrelevant one. Plaintiff has not suggested how any other expression would have improved its position. Reliance and injury being necessary Chapter 93A ingredients, it points to no conceivable detrimental action it took as a result of, let alone in reliance upon, any of the bank\u2019s \u201cdeceptions.\u201d If Chapter 93A may ever apply to conduct that is strictly in accord with the U.C.C., <em>but cf. Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>Mass.App.1979, 396 N.E.2d 149, 153, this could not be such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">As to count three, which we reach on the assumption that plaintiff has no case under counts one and two, plaintiff would have it that a creditor who has a fund out of which it may satisfy a debtor\u2019s indebtedness to itself, is \u201cwrongful and inequitable\u201d if it declines to turn it over to some other creditor whose rights are no higher. Alternatively, if we understand this count, plaintiff reasons that by delivering goods to Marsh-field on credit, it benefited all of Marsh-field\u2019s other creditors; that this benefited defendant as one of these creditors \u2014 not, of course, to the full amount, and how at all, if it was secured? \u2014 and that therefore defendant was accountable, as for \u201cmoney had and received,\u201d for the full amount. For nonpayment thereof defendant is a \u201cjackal,\u201d guilty of \u201cmanifest ... rascality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Conveying goods to Marshfield on credit was solely plaintiff\u2019s choice. Nothing the bank did caused plaintiff\u2019s November 1981 shift to an open account, or merits its fulsome derogatory language. Plaintiff's words may be a welcome change from some we hear on the street, but they are otherwise of no consequence. The judgment is affirmed and, because appellee was required to defend this totally frivolous appeal, it is awarded double costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> F.R. A.P. 38.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\">. One member of the panel is of the opinion that counsel fees should also be awarded, and believes that the court\u2019s increasing caseload will call for such response in the future. It is a burden on everyone to take the court\u2019s time with appeals with no conceivable substance behind them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
