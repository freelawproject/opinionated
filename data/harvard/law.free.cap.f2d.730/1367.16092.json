McKay alleges that defendants unconstitutionally deprived him of his liberty without due process by causing him to be wrongfully arrested, and that after the arrests the Colorado defendants harrassed him to prevent him from filing this lawsuit. McKay also asserts state law claims for relief based on common law false imprisonment. The district court, 542 F.Supp. 972 (D.C.Colo.1982), granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that all claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. The court alternatively held that the action properly could be dismissed for failure to state a claim under the authority of <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-21\">THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AXv\">The district court held that McKay\u2019s causes of action accrued on July 5, 1979, at the end of the alleged wrongful confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This suit was filed on September 17, 1981, a little over two years and two months later. The court found that the applicable state statute of limitations is the one-year period for false imprisonment provided by Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-80-102 (1973), and that this period was extended to two years for actions on a liability created by a federal statute under Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-80-106 (1973). Accordingly, the court held that the state common law claims are barred by the one-year statute and the constitutional claims are barred by the two-year statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-22\">Because Congress has not enacted a statute of limitations expressly applicable to section 1983 claims, the court must adopt the most analogous limitations period provided by state law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976); <em>Board of Regents v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 483-84, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-95, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). In <em>Garcia v. Wilson, </em>731 F.2d 640 (10th Cir.1984) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>banc), decided this day, we considered the method by which an appropriate state statute is to be selected for section 1983 actions. We concluded as a matter of federal law that all section 1983 claims should be characterized as actions for injury to the rights of another. <em>See id. </em>at 650-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Colorado has no statute of limitations expressly applicable to injuries to the rights of another. Although the Colorado Code of Civil Procedure has abolished the distinctions between the old common law forms of action, <em>see McKenzie v. Crook, </em>110 Colo. 29, 129 P.2d 906, 907 (1942), those differences are still reflected in the state limitations scheme. Thus, the \u201cantiquated language\u201d of the limitations statutes compels the court \u201cto determine what the action would have been in terms of early common law pleading.\u201d <em>Uhl v. Fox, </em>31 Colo.App. 13, 498 P.2d 1177, 1178 (1972); <em>Hayden v. Patterson, </em>39 Colo. 15, 88 P. 437, 437-38 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">The Colorado limitations statutes embody the common law distinction between trespass actions, which involve injury by the direct and immediate application of force, and actions on the case, in which the injury is committed without direct force. <em>See, </em>W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 7, at 28-30 (4th ed. 1971); <em>see also, e.g., Zuniga v. AMFAC Foods, Inc., </em>580 F.2d 380, 386-87 &amp; n. 8 (10th Cir.1978). Under Colorado law, actions for assault and battery and false imprisonment are subject to the one-year period provided by Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-80-102 (1973), and actions on the case are subject to the six-year period provided in Colo.Rev. Stat. 13-80-110 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">Section 1983 claims may or may not involve the direct application of force. That distinction rests on factors irrelevant to the elements of a section 1983 cause of action and requires an analysis of the facts underlying a particular claim, an approach we rejected in <em>Garcia. </em>Under the rationale in <em>Garcia, </em>state limitations periods that make such an irrelevant distinction determinative are not applicable to a section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">It is thus apparent that no one Colorado limitations statute is applicable to an action for injury to the rights of another, as we have now defined section 1983 claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the appropriate statute of limitations for all such claims brought in federal court in Colorado is the residuary statute, Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13 \u2014 80\u2014108(l)(b) (1973), which applies a three year period to \u201c[a]ll other actions of every kind for which no other period of limitation is provided by law.\u201d Under this statute, McKay\u2019s section 1983 claims are timely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">THE ARRESTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-14\">Having determined that McKay\u2019s constitutional claims were timely filed, we next address the district judge\u2019s alternate holding that McKay failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The court stated that McKay\u2019s \u201c\u00a7 1983 and 14th Amendment claims fall within the Supreme Court\u2019s proscription in <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>(1979),\u201d rec., vol. I, at 119, but did not set out the facts and analysis upon which this conclusion was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">In <em>Baker, </em>the plaintiffs brother had been arrested, booked, and released on bail in Potter County, Texas, while masquerading as the plaintiff and using his driver\u2019s licence. Bail subsequently was revoked, and an arrest warrant was issued for the plaintiff\u2019s brother in the plaintiff\u2019s name. When the plaintiff was stopped in Dallas for a traffic violation, a routine check revealed the warrant in the plaintiff\u2019s name and he was arrested despite his protests of mistaken identity. The plaintiff was held by the Dallas police four days, and then transferred to the Potter County jail, where he was held another four days before officials recognized the error and released him. The plaintiff brought a section 1983 claim against the Potter County sheriff for \u201c \u2018the intentional failure to investigate and determine that the wrong man was imprisoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>443 U.S. at 143, 99 S.Ct. at 2694 (quoting Brief for Respondent at 12). The plaintiff did not challenge the initial arrest but only the subsequent continuing incarceration. Moreover, the plaintiff did not allege that the state officials intentionally had continued to detain him knowing that the arrest warrant named the wrong man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">The Fifth Circuit concluded that the plaintiff had stated a claim under section 1983 \u201ceven though the evidence supported no more than a finding of negligence on the part of Sheriff Baker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 99 S.Ct. at 2692. In reversing the Court of Appeals decision, the Supreme Court did not address whether simple negligence may be the basis for liability in a section 1983 cause of action. Instead, the Court held that the plaintiff had failed to establish the threshold requirement of section 1983, the deprivation of a constitutional right. The Court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s eight day confinement had not denied him liberty without due process, basing this conclusion primarily upon the propriety of the initial arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">In view of the factually specific language employed by the Court in <em>Baker, </em>the extent to which that case provides precedential value beyond closely analogous circumstances is unclear. Subsequent cases have found the holding in <em>Baker </em>inapposite when the arrest warrant itself was invalid, <em>see, e.g., Garris v. Rowland, </em>678 F.2d 1264, 1270 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 864, 103 S.Ct. 143, 74 L.Ed.2d 121 (1982); <em>Powe v. City of Chicago, </em>664 F.2d 639, 647-48 (7th Cir.1981), or when the injury was inspired by improper motive rather than the result of carelessness or honest mistake. <em>See, e.g., Shillingford v. Holmes, </em>634 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Whitley v. Seibel, </em>613 F.2d 682, 686 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Reeves v. City of Jackson, </em>608 F.2d 644, 650-52 (5th Cir.1979). We must examine the record before us bearing in mind both the considerations the Court found determinative in <em>Baker, </em>and any factual distinctions that would make those considerations inapplicable in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">On a motion for summary judgment, the pleadings and the evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the opponent of the motion. <em>Otteson v. United States, </em>622 F.2d 516, 519 (10th Cir.1980). Viewed in this light, the following facts and allegations describe the circumstances giving rise to McKay\u2019s claims and provide a framework for determining whether <em>Baker </em>controls our consideration of McKay\u2019s request for relief under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">In April 1979, Officer Pfeffer swore out a criminal complaint against McKay in New Mexico for issuing worthless checks and for forgery. A New Mexico judicial official issued a valid warrant for McKay\u2019s arrest, and Pfeffer entered the arrest warrant in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">On June 21, 1979, Deputy Sheriff Hammock arrested McKay in Routt County for being in possession of an automobile listed as stolen by Texas authorities. Although the Texas authorities eventually decided not to prosecute, McKay apparently was held in Routt County on the Texas charges until June 29, 1979. During this time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Routt County officials discovered the existence of the New Mexico warrant through the NCIC computer. \u2022 Hammock notified Pfeffer, and learned that Pfeffer wanted to extradite McKay. Hammock then had a warrant of commitment on the New Mexico charges filed in Routt County on June 29, 1979. Under Colorado law, McKay could only be held for 72 hours after this warrant was filed unless Colorado officials filed a fugitive complaint. The Routt County district attorney\u2019s office failed to file a fugitive complaint within that time. On July 2, 1979, a Colorado district judge released McKay on bond on the New Mexico charges. Under this bond, McKay was free to travel anywhere in the state of Colorado until July 27, 1979, when he was required to appear in court in Routt County on the New Mexico charges. McKay has not alleged that any of the above acts violated his constitutional rights or were otherwise improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">As McKay was leaving the Routt County jail on July 2, he told Hammock that he was going to take the bus to Denver and then on to Buena Vista to catch up with the carnival with which he worked. That same day, Hammock called Pfeffer and told him that McKay had been released on bond because the district attorney had not filed the proper papers on time. Hammock told Pfeffer, erroneously, that McKay\u2019s bond was not valid outside the judicial district in which it was issued. Hammock also told Pfeffer, erroneously, that McKay\u2019s bond covered \u201clocal\u201d charges only and was unrelated to the New Mexico warrant. Hammock informed Pfeffer that McKay would be traveling through Denver and Buena Vista, and that although McKay could not be rearrested in Routt County, he could be arrested in those cities. Hammock gave Pfeffer the names of Denver and Buena Vista police officers so Pfeffer could contact them to arrange for McKay\u2019s arrest. Hammock himself called both Denver and Buena Vista officials, and told them McKay would be traveling there. He also told them McKay was wanted on New Mexico charges, had been released on bond by mistake, and could be rearrested outside Routt County. Pfeffer also contacted both cities to arrange for McKay\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">When McKay stepped off the bus in Denver in the early morning of July 3, 1979, he was arrested by Denver police. They held him twelve hours while they verified the validity of his bond and then released him. The Denver police attempted to send a teletype message to Pfeffer telling him that McKay was on bond and could not be rearrested in Colorado. Pfeffer never received the message because the New Mexico teletype was down at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">Meanwhile, on July 4, McKay traveled on to Buena Vista where he was arrested again. When the Buena Vista police notified Pfeffer of McKay\u2019s arrest, Pfeffer was still unaware that McKay was bonded on the New Mexico charges or that the bond was valid state-wide. Therefore, Pfeffer confirmed that the New Mexico warrant was outstanding and that New Mexico would extradite. McKay was held until the next day, when he was released after local officials once again verified the validity of his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">The present case is factually distinguishable from Baker in significant respects. Although the rationale supporting its decision is elusive, the Court in <em>Baker </em>concluded that due process had been satisfied there because, while the plaintiff \u201cwas indeed deprived of his liberty for a period of days, ... it was pursuant to a warrant conforming, for purposes of our decision, to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 443 U.S. at 144, 99 S.Ct. at 2694. The Court pointed out that \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not protect against all deprivations of liberty. It protects only against deprivations of liberty accomplished \u2018without due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2695. Although the instant case involves a valid arrest warrant, it also includes the subsequent issuance of a valid bond. The facts supporting a finding of due process in <em>Bakei </em>\u2014 a judicial determination that the plaintiff was properly subject to arrest \u2014 were superseded in the instant case by a subsequent judicial determination that McKay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>was entitled to temporary release. McKay allegedly was deprived of his liberty without due process because his arrests occurred in violation of the valid bond. Accordingly, <em>Baker </em>is not authority for concluding that McKay failed to state a claim under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">We nevertheless must determine whether McKay has satisfied the requirements for asserting a cause of action under section 1983 against all defendants. Defendants argue that the allegations and evidence establish at most mere negligence, and that negligence alone is insufficient to support a section 1983 claim. We conclude that a plaintiff need not necessarily address a defendant\u2019s state of mind to successfully articulate a section 1983 cause of action because \u201c[sjection 1983, unlike its criminal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, has never been found by [the Supreme Court] to contain a state-of-mind requirement.\u201d <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 534, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-6\">\u201cBoth <em>Baker v. McCollan </em>[443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)] and <em>Monroe v. Pape </em>[365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961) ] suggest that \u00a7 1983 affords a \u2018civil remedy\u2019 for deprivations of federally protected rights caused by persons acting under color of state law <em>without any express requirement of a particular state of mind. </em>Accordingly, in any \u00a7 1983 action the initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements to a \u00a7 1983 action are present: (1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\"><em>Id. </em>451 U.S. at 535, 101 S.Ct. at 1913 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">However, the Court has noted that some constitutional violations may by their very nature incorporate an element of intent. <em>See Baker, </em>443 U.S. at 140 n. 1, 99 S.Ct. at 2692 n. 1. Commentators generally agree that because section 1983 does not itself contain any intent requirement, the relevant inquiry should focus on what state of mind, if any, is imposed by the particular constitutional provision at issue. <em>See generally </em>S. Nahmod, Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Litigation, \u00a7 3.01-02 (1979); Kirkpatrick, <em>Defining a Constitutional Tort Under Section 1983: The State-of-Mind Requirement, </em>46 Cin.L.Rev. 45 (1977); Comment, <em>Actionability of Negligence Under Section 1983 and the Eighth Amendment, </em>127 U.Pa.L.Rev. 533 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-10\">The Supreme Court has not specifically articulated what intent, if any, is embodied in the due process clause. In <em>Parratt, </em>the Court indicated that an act of simple negligence by a state official may result in a constitutional deprivation of due process. 451 U.S. at 536-37, 101 S.Ct. at 1913-14. Subsequent to <em>Parratt, </em>the Court significantly has suggested that a denial of due process can arise in the absence of any element of intent where the denial results from the implementation of an established state procedure that is deficient. <em>See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 435-36, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1157-58, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (\u201c[I]t is the state system itself that destroys a complainant\u2019s property interest, by operation of law ... whether the Commission\u2019s action is taken through negligence, maliciousness, or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">The Court has most often addressed the intent issue indirectly in establishing the standards under which the conduct of a particular type of defendant rises to a denial of due process. In effect, the Court has built in an intent requirement in setting out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>the various standards of proof under which local governing bodies or supervisors may be held liable, as well as in defining the defense of qualified immunity. <em>See, e.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980); <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">With the above considerations in mind, we must examine the particular defendants and the capacity in which they are sued to determine whether the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of any of them can be affirmed despite the court\u2019s erroneous reliance on <em>Baker v. McCollan. </em>McKay has alleged that he was deprived of his liberty without due process by Hammock\u2019s efforts to have him arrested despite Hammock\u2019s full knowledge of the validity of the bond. This allegation of denial of due process by intentionally causing false arrests is clearly sufficient to state a claim against Hammock. <em>See Lessman v. McCormick, </em>591 F.2d 605, 609-611 (10th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">McKay also alleges that Pfeffer participated in the false arrests by the various acts described above. Although the evidence is weak that Pfeffer engaged in a sufficient abuse of power to constitute a substantial deprivation of liberty without due process, <em>see id, </em>neither the parties nor the trial court addressed the summary judgment issue on these grounds, having focused on the statute of limitations and <em>Baker v. McCollan </em>questions. Moreover, although Pfeffer pleaded qualified immunity below as an affirmative defense, he did not urge that ground as a basis for summary judgment and the record on this issue was therefore not developed. We decline to perform Rule 56 functions for the parties and the trial court, and we therefore remand as to Pfeffer, as well as Hammock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">Construing the complaint most favorably to McKay, he alleges that the sheriff of Routt County, DeLuea, was involved knowingly in Hammock\u2019s deprivation of McKay\u2019s liberty without due process. The complaint does not state whether DeLuea was sued in his individual or representative capacity, or both. However, as a supervisor, DeLuea is not liable in any capacity unless an \u201caffirmative link\u201d exists between the constitutional violation and either DeLuca\u2019s personal participation, his exercise of control or direction, or his failure to supervise. <em>See Rizzo, </em>423 U.S. at 371, 96 S.Ct. at 604; <em>see also Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694 n. 58, 98 S.Ct. at 2037 n. 58, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>McClelland v. Facteau, </em>610 F.2d 693, 695-96 (10th Cir.1979). Here DeLuca\u2019s personal participation is alleged. In addition to denying participation, DeLuea pleaded the defense of qualified immunity. The existence of qualified immunity is clearly material if DeLuea is being sued individually; however it is not relevant if he is named only in a representative capacity because a local governing unit may not assert the immunity of its officials as a defense to liability under section 1983. <em>See Owen, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980). Because the summary judgment record was not developed on the merits of the claim against DeLuea other than with respect to the <em>Baker v. McCollan </em>issue, we reverse as to this defendant as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-8\">McKay alleges that DeLuea acted for the Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which has been separately sued as a defendant. In <em>Monell, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the circumstances under which local governing bodies may be sued directly pursuant to section 1983. The Court concluded that such an entity is liable when \u201cthe action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d 436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. at 2035. Liability may also arise for \u201cconstitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decision-making channels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>at 2035-36. However, the Court pointed out that a governing body is not liable \u201cunless action pursuant to official ... policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort\u201d and that an entity \u201ccannot be held liable <em>solely </em>because it employs a tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036 (emphasis in original). DeLuca, as Sheriff, was the official responsible for the policies and procedures of the Routt County Sheriffs Office. Therefore, the Sheriffs Office will be liable under <em>Monell </em>for implementing an unconstitutional act if DeLuca knowingly was involved in an intentional constitutional deprivation. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. City of Mission, </em>705 F.2d 368, 374-75 (10th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we also reverse as to defendant Routt County Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">The Ruidoso City Police Department is another matter. There are no allegations in the complaint that would bring this defendant within the guidelines of <em>Monell. </em>Therefore we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim against the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">Our reversal does not, of course, indicate any opinion on the merits of McKay\u2019s claims. As discussed above, in the summary judgment proceedings below the parties and the court focused their attention on the applicable statute of limitations and on whether McKay had stated a claim for relief under <em>Baker v. McCollan. </em>Consequently, they did not reach the issues that we have concluded are controlling, and the record on those issues has not been developed. We remand to allow the parties and the lower court an opportunity to pursue these matters further.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-8\">THE HARASSMENT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"AlL\">McKay ultimately pleaded guilty to the New Mexico charges and was sentenced to probation on the condition that he make restitution and perform public service. At McKay\u2019s request he was allowed to perform his probation in Routt County, under the supervision of the Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office. In his complaint and in his opposition to the Colorado defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, McKay alleged that Hammock, DeLuca, and other agents of the Routt County Sheriff's Office threatened to see that his probation was revoked if he filed a civil rights action based on the arrests discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">The right of access to the courts is constitutionally protected. Thus, conduct under color of law which interferes with that right gives rise to a cause of action under section 1983. <em>See Ryland v. Shapiro, </em>708 F.2d 967, 971-72 (5th Cir. 1983); <em>Lamar v. Steele, </em>693 F.2d 559, 562 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 86, 78 L.Ed.2d 95 (1983). Moreover, a plaintiff need not successfully be prevented from filing his suit to state a claim. \u201cThe contrary rule would result in the anomaly of protecting only those individuals who remain out of court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-14\">The district court dismissed McKay\u2019s complaint without addressing the alleged denial of access to the courts. We remand for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">AFFIRMED as to defendant Ruidoso City Police Department. REVERSED as to the remaining defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-16\">. McKay's complaint also asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976). However, McKay conceded below that he failed to state a claim under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1437-17\">. McKay disputes this finding and argues that the action did not accrue until after August 20, 1981, when the alleged police harassment stopped. Given our disposition of the statute of limitations issue, which renders McKay\u2019s claim timely even if his causes of action accrued on the earlier date, we need not decide this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">. The Colorado statute of limitations provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-7\">\"13-80-102. <em>Actions barred in one year. </em>All actions for assault and battery, false imprisonment, slander, and libel shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues, and not afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-8\">\u201c13-80-110. <em>Actions barred in six years. </em>(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 4-2-725, C.R.S.1973, the following actions shall be commenced within six years after the cause of action accrues, and not afterwards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-15\">\"(d) All actions of assumpsit, or on the case founded on any contract or liability, express or implied.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1438-16\">. The court did not specifically address McKay\u2019s allegation that, subsequent to the wrongful arrests, members of the Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office violated his constitutional rights by harrassment to prevent him from filing this lawsuit. Under our resolution of the statute of limitations issue, this section 1983 claim is timely. However, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that McKay's state law claims are barred by the one-year Colorado statute for false imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">. Thus, an intent requirement is not part of a section 1983 action unless the action is based on a constitutional provision which itself incorporates an element of scienter. Of course, in any section 1983 action, whether a defendant should be relieved of liability for a constitutional violation because he proceeded in good faith is an issue that can be fully determined within the context of the affirmative defense of immunity. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>see also, e.g., Tuttle v. City of Oklahoma City, </em>728 F.2d 456, 458, Nos. 82-2165, 82-2175, slip op. at 2-3 (10th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">. Relying on the analysis in <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 543-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1916-17, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), defendants also argue that the state provides adequate tort remedies for plaintiff\u2019s claims and that plaintiff therefore is furnished ail the process he is due. The district court rejected this argument summarily. Given the incomplete state of the record, we decline to decide the extent to which <em>Parratt </em>is applicable, if at all, to the type of liberty deprivation or to some or all of the various defendant actors alleged in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 545-46, 101 S.Ct. at 1917-18 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
