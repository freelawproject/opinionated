Portnoy appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its diversity suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court held that the personal representative of the estate of a non-resident is not entitled to invoke the benefit of the Mississippi long-arm statute to effect service of process, and that, in any event, the defendant, Cessna Aircraft Company, does not have sufficient contacts with the State of Mississippi, so that subjecting it to a lawsuit there violates its due process rights. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s decision on the basis of our reading of the applicable Mississippi statutes, including the long-arm statute, we do not reach the due process issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The defendant, Cessna Aircraft Company, is a Kansas corporation with its principal place of business in Wichita. The plaintiffs decedent, David L. Portnoy, was a twenty-five-year-old Pennsylvania resident and a staff sergeant in the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. In November of 1976, while participating in a training mission, the Cessna plane he was flying crashed in the waters near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. All heirs and beneficiaries of Portnoy\u2019s estate in 1976 were, and still are, Pennsylvania residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The Gulfport, Mississippi, law firm of Hopkins, Logan and Vaughn represented Portnoy\u2019s parents before this litigation began. At the request of one of the partners, a secretary for the firm, Jerri Bridges, agreed to serve as administratrix of the estate. In February of 1982 a state chancery court duly appointed her to serve in that capacity. In April of 1982 she filed this diversity action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, seeking damages from Cessna under theories of strict liability and breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Because Cessna is not registered to do business in Mississippi, the plaintiff effected service of process by serving the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi, pursuant to MISS.CODE ANN. 13-3-57 (1972 &amp; Supp.), the Mississippi long-arm statute. Cessna moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted Cessna\u2019s motion. We affirm the district court because the plain wording of the applicable Mississippi statutes creating the state cause of action and its mechanisms of enforcement, as well as the case law interpreting those statutes, do not allow the administratrix to obtain personal jurisdiction over Cessna.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\"><em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) requires us to apply state substantive law to this suit. Unfortunately, no state statute or case unequivocally disposes of the issues presented. Consequently, we begin our analysis by looking to the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">The Mississippi wrongful death statute that creates the plaintiff\u2019s substantive cause of action allows the personal representative of a deceased person to bring an action for damages caused by \u201carticles or commodities intended for human consumption\u201d that, had death not ensued, would \u201chave entitled the person injured or made ill or damaged thereby, to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, the Mississippi statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that defines the kinds of actions the executor of an estate may prosecute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Executors, administrators, and temporary administrators may commence and prosecute any personal action whatever, at law or in equity, <em>which the testator or intestate might have commenced and prosecuted. </em>They shall also be liable to be sued in any court in any personal action which might have been maintained against the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">MISS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 91-7-233 (1972) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Mississippi courts have interpreted these statutes as creating two distinct causes of action, one in favor of the decedent\u2019s estate and maintainable only by the administrator or executor, and one in favor of the decedent\u2019s survivors and maintainable by any personal representative. An executor or administrator may prosecute both causes of action in one suit provided that he pleads them in separate counts. <em>Thornton v. Insurance Company of North America, </em>287 So.2d 262 (Miss.1973). Notwithstanding the fact that the causes of action accrue to the estate and to the survivors, however, the statutes by their plain terms allow the person who prosecutes the action the same rights as the decedent would have had. Only if the decedent \u201ccould maintain an action and recover damages,\u201d or \u201cmight have commenced and prosecuted\u201d the suit will Mississippi law permit the plaintiff in the wrongful death action to proceed. The plaintiff, then, stands in the shoes of his decedent. <em>See Rainey v. Horn, </em>221 Miss. 269, 72 So.2d 434, 436-38 (1954) (wrongful death statute). <em>Cf. Scott v. Munn, </em>245 Miss. 120, 146 So.2d 564 (1962) (personal representative cannot prosecute a cause of action for loss of consortium if decedent could not).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">The Mississippi long-arm statute in effect at the time of Portnoy\u2019s accident deems nonresidents \u201cwho shall commit a tort in whole or in part in this state against a resident of this state\u201d to be doing business in Mississippi for the purposes of allowing a plaintiff to obtain personal jurisdiction over them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the statute, by its own terms, operates only in favor of Mississippi residents. Further, cases decided pursuant to the statute also hold that the statute is not available to nonresidents. <em>E.g., C.H. Leavell &amp; Co. v. Doster, </em>211 So.2d 813 (Miss.1968). <em>See also American International Pictures, Inc. v. Morgan, </em>371 F.Supp. 528, 532 (N.D.Miss.1974). In their restrictive interpretation of the long-arm statute, courts rely not only on the clear wording of the statute, but also on the proposition that Mississippi has no obligation to open the doors of its courts to allow residents of other states to bring actions against nonresident defendants. <em>E.g., McAlpin v. James McKoane Enterprises, Inc., </em>395 F.Supp. 937, 941 (N.D.Miss.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Thus, our review of the long-arm statute together with the wrongful death statute and the executors\u2019 cause of action statute reveals that Jerri Bridges did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>obtain personal jurisdiction over Cessna. Because the long-arm statute was not available to nonresidents, neither Portnoy nor his survivors, all of whom were or are Pennsylvania residents, could have prosecuted a cause of action for wrongful death in Mississippi courts against Cessna. Because Jerri Bridges has only those rights that the decedent would have had if he had survived the accident, she likewise may not prosecute an action for wrongful death, either on behalf of the estate or on behalf of the survivors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That she is a resident of Mississippi is irrelevant, because her substantive rights are the same as the decedents regardless of her own residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Portnoy\u2019s estate argues vigorously that Jerri Bridges, a Mississippi resident, is the \u201creal party in interest\u201d against whom the tort was committed, and that Portnoy\u2019s status as a Pennsylvania resident is irrelevant. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">If Cessna committed a tort at all, it did so not against the estate, but against Portnoy, a non-resident. As this court recognized in <em>Prejean v. Sonatrach, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1260, 1270 (5th Cir.1981), a tort occurs when and where the actual injury or accident takes place, and not at the place of the economic consequences of that injury. Thus, the tort did not occur \u201cagainst a resident of this state\u201d as the long-arm statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Additionally, the estate relies heavily on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a), which provides that the executor or administrator of an estate is the real party in interest for purposes of prosecuting an action in federal court. Rule 17(a), however, cannot expand the jurisdiction of federal courts, and the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, which makes state substantive law applicable to this action, places substantive limitations on the application of Rule 17(a). Fed.R.Civ.P. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">As explained, state substantive law requires us to hold as a matter of statutory construction that the estate did not obtain personal jurisdiction over Cessna. Further, as this court previously noted, \u201cit is well established that under Mississippi law the administrator is not an interested party in a wrongful death action, even though he is a \u2018real party in interest\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 17 of the Federal Rules for the purposes of determining federal [diversity] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bush v. Carpenter Brothers, Inc., </em>447 F.2d 707, 711 (5th Cir.1971) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">We are also unimpressed with the estate\u2019s second argument that it has a substantive right created by Mississippi law but that its rights simply are unenforceable because of a procedural bar. The Supreme Court laid that argument to rest in <em>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949), in which it interpreted a Mississippi statute prohibiting foreign corporations not qualified to do business in the state from bringing actions in state courts. In holding that a federal court in Mississippi likewise could not entertain a suit in which the plaintiff was an unqualified foreign corporation, the Court said that \u201ca right which local law creates but which it does not supply with a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement in a federal court in a diversity case.\u201d The Court further explained that if the plaintiff is barred in state court, \u201che likewise should be barred in federal court.\u201d \u201cThe contrary result,\u201d said the Court, is inconsistent with <em>Erie </em>because it \u201cwould create discriminations against citizens of the State in favor of those authorized to invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 69 S.Ct. at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Finally, the estate relies heavily on the district court case of <em>McAlpin v. James McKoane Enterprises, Inc., </em>395 F.Supp. 937 (N.D.Miss.1975). <em>McAlpin </em>addressed facts almost identical to those of the present case. The plaintiff was the resident administrator of a nonresident decedent\u2019s estate, suing for damages allegedly suffered when the decedent\u2019s aircraft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>crashed in Mississippi territory. None of the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries was a Mississippi resident. In <em>McAlpin </em>the court held that the plaintiff estate could invoke the Mississippi long-arm statute to obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Having determined that the nominal plaintiff was a Mississippi resident, and that the estate was the legally injured party, the court did not look to the Mississippi law that created the substantive cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 941-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><em>McAlpin, </em>of course, is not binding precedent on this court, and to the extent that its reasoning is contrary to our own in this case, we disagree with it. As discussed, what is crucial is that a tort be committed against a Mississippi resident. Whatever \u201clegal injury\u201d an estate may suffer, the tort in this case, if it occurred at all, was committed at the time the plane crash killed Portnoy, a Pennsylvania resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In conclusion, we note that we are sympathetic to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that Mississippi is the most logical state in which to pursue this lawsuit. The tort occurred in Mississippi. Mississippi law will govern the substantive rights of the parties. Witnesses and evidence, if they exist, probably are located in Mississippi. We, however, have more compelling considerations of federalism to uphold, as well as the requirements of the <em>E\u00f1e </em>doctrine. We also note that in this case, more than the average diversity case, we are truly \u201cwriting on the wind.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>714 F.2d 581, 538 (5th Cir.1983) (Gee, J.). Mississippi recently amended its long-arm statute to make it available to nonresidents. The issue of retroactivity of that amendment not being before this court in the present case, we emphasize that the particular point of law decided in this appeal is not likely to have a lasting effect on Mississippi law or dictate inequitable results in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">.
