Specifically, ISCC challenges that part of OFI\u2019s final rate base determination which included profit realized by Northern Engineering International Co. (NEICO) as part of project management costs paid by Northern Border. ISCC also challenges the OFI denial of a rehearing on the same issue. As grounds for its challenges, ISCC alleges that (1) the OFI denied it an evidentiary hearing to which it was entitled under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (1982), (2) the OFI decision was unsupported by substantial evidence, and (3) the OFI failed to enter findings and conclusions on all material issues of fact and law in contravention of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-8\">Because we find that our review of the OFI orders is governed by section 10 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act (ANGTA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h (1982), the scope of that review is severely limited: We may only consider whether the OFI orders denied ISCC\u2019s constitutional rights, or were \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(b)(2) (1982). Under this standard of review, we affirm the OFI\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-13\">This controversy is over an OFI determination of Northern Border\u2019s rate base for the eastern leg of the ANGTS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This determination will later be used by FERC in deciding whether Northern Border\u2019s filed rate tariffs are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (1982); <em>see also, e.g., Northern Border Pipeline Co., </em>Docket No. CP 78-124-008 (Dec. 30, 1983) (Order Accepting for Filing and Suspending Proposed Tariff Sheets, Subject to Refund and Conditions, and Granting Waiver). In setting the rate base OFI proceeded according to its \u201cStatement of Policy on General Standards and Procedures for Rate Base Audit and Approval for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System.\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. 51726 (1981) [hereinafter cited as Policy Statement]. The Policy Statement says that \u201cOFI will establish procedures [for rate base determinations] which comport with both the mandate for expedition (under section 9 of [ANGTA] ...) and also basic principles of procedural fairness (under the Natural Gas Act and other relevant authority).\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. 51728 (1981) (footnotes omitted). The Policy Statement also explains that, since OFI exercises more direct planning and construction oversight as to ANGTA than FERC ordinarily does as to its licensees, OFI will therefore be familiar with the cost pipeline operators incur, and \u201cmost disputes [will] be resolvable on the basis of pleadings alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Policy Statement goes on to provide a three-step proceeding for the rate base determination: (1) The Director of OFI\u2019s Audit and Cost Analysis will issue a tentative determination based on quarterly audit and management systems assessment reports, informal comments by the sponsor companies, and internal comments by the OFI staff; (2) the tentative decision will be publicly noticed, and all interested parties given an opportunity to comment on it. A protesting party will be required to (i) state clearly its position and specify any errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>of material fact or law; (ii) file a brief supporting statement of its position; and (iii) provide sworn affidavits substantiating any counter-statements of material fact; (3) under ordinary circumstances, the Federal Inspector will render a final determination on this record. If the Federal Inspector finds that extenuating circumstances warrant additional information, he may call for further documentation, and even hearings on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-4\">The Tentative Rate Base Determination regarding Northern Border Pipeline Company\u2019s costs during the period January 1, 1980, through March 31, 1982, was issued December 3, 1982. Letter from J. Richard Beuman, Director, Office of Audit and Cost Analysis, OFI, to John T. Rhett, Federal Inspector [hereinafter cited as Tentative Determination], Joint Appendix at 315-26 [hereinafter cited as J.A.]. It recommended inclusion in the rate base of all payments made to NEICO for project management services (including NEICO\u2019s profit). Tentative Determination, J.A. at 317-23. NEICO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of InterNorth, as is Northern Plains Natural Gas Company (Northern Plains), which owns 22.75% of Northern Border. In addition, Northern Plains is the managing partner of Northern Border, and its directorate is interlocking with those of both Inter-North and NEICO. Noting these facts, the Tentative Determination explained its conclusion that NEICO did not \u201ccontrol\u201d Northern Border, and therefore that the \u201cno profits to affiliates\u201d rule of FERC, which usually prevents profits from being allowed for ratemaking purposes when services are rendered by companies in a control relationship with the applicant, did not apply in this case. It further explained that, under a market test the profits paid to NEICO were reasonable. <em>Id. </em>The ISCC filed comments disagreeing with the Tentative Determination\u2019s treatment of NEICO profits. These comments focused on the finding of \u201cno control\u201d and on the proper reading of precedent regarding the reasonableness of profits included in a rate base. Approximately six months later, the Federal Inspector issued his Final Determination affirming the Tentative Determination. Final Determination Approving in Part and Disallowing in Part Expenditures Claimed for Inclusion in Rate Base by Northern Border Pipeline Co. [hereinafter cited as Final Determination], J.A. at 356. The Final Determination responded to ISCC\u2019s comments by noting that ISCC had alleged no basic facts contrary to those considered in making the Tentative Determination. It concluded that the Tentative Determination had been correct in finding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akp\">that [Northern Border] and NEICO are not affiliated companies; that NEICO\u2019s profit should be judged on the basis of a market test; that the tests employed by the Director were adequate; and that payments under the contract ... should be considered reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1637-6\">J.A. at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-7\">ISCC applied for a rehearing, claiming that the OFI\u2019s Final Determination was legally faulty because it failed to: (1) disclose the basis and reasons for its results in findings of fact and conclusions of law; (2) apply or distinguish existing precedent; (3) support its conclusion by substantial evidence; and (4) accord interested parties an opportunity to dispute material inferences of fact underlying the Determination. The Federal Inspector denied ISCC\u2019s application for rehearing. He found that \u201ccontentions 2 and 3 [were] totally untenable and warranted] no further response.\u201d Denial of Rehearing, J.A. at 372. He also found that ISCC raised no genuine issue of materia] fact about the NEICO contract\u2014 that the only issue raised was purely \u201ca question of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>J.A. at 373. Finally, the Federal Inspector was satisfied that the Final Determination had taken \u201ca hard look at the issue\u201d raised by ISCC as required by this court in <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>444 F.2d 841 (D.C.Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). <em>Id. </em>After denial of its request for a rehearing, the ISCC filed its petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>II. Standard of Review for Rate Base Determinations Under ANGTA</p>\n<p id=\"A2U\">Before proceeding to the merits of ISCC\u2019s claims, we must determine the standard under which we will review the OFI Final Determination and Denial of Rehearing. In particular, if the rate base determination comes within agency action reviewable under section 10 of ANGTA, the scope of our review is severely restricted to issues of constitutionality, jurisdiction, and denial of statutory rights. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(b)(2) (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1638-4\">Two kinds of agency action are reviewable under section 10. First, section 10 \u201cprovides the exclusive avenue of judicial review for actions taken pursuant to section 9 of the Act.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(a) (1982). Section 9 actions include any \u201ccertificate, right-of-way, permit, lease or other authorization\u201d that is required for \u201caction which is necessary or related to the construction and initial operation of [ANGTS].\u201d Second, enforcement of any \u201cstatutes ..., regulations ... [or] terms, conditions and stipulations of grants, certificates, permits, and other authorizations issued by Federal agencies with respect to pre-construction, construction and initial operation\u201d of ANGTS \u201cconstitutes \u2018action\u2019 for purposes of Section 10.\u201d Sections 102, 201(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979, 44 Fed.Reg. 33663, 93 Stat. 1373 (1979) (establishing the OFI).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We turn now to see if the Northern Border rate base determination was either such an authorization or enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-14\">We begin by looking at the basis of OFI\u2019s obligation to make a rate base determination. Ordinarily, a pipeline\u2019s rate base determination is scrutinized by FERC under the Natural Gas Act only as part of its review of filed rates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (1982); 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 154.1-154.67 (1983). FERC\u2019s obligation (which it has transferred to the OFI) to make special, separate rate base determinations with respect to operators of ANGTS arises under President Carter\u2019s Decision on ANGTS,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which Congress explicitly adopted as part of ANGTA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That Decision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1638-15\">The applicant [for a FERC certificate] shall ... submit to [FERC] for approval on a timely basis all components of construction work in progress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1638-16\">Decision, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 37. <em>See </em>45 Fed. Reg. 85511 (1980) (interpreting this section of the Decision to mandate \u201capprovfal] of rate base inclusions on a timely basis\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>The Decision characterized this cost approval as a \u201cterm ... and condition ... appropriately incorporated into any certificate, right-of-way, lease, permit or authorization\u201d to ensure \u201cthe proper management and the timely completion of the construction of [ANGTS].\u201d Decision, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 26. In short, by approving President Carter\u2019s Decision, Congress mandated that periodic rate base inclusion determinations be made for pipeline companies holding FERC certificates of public convenience and necessity under ANGTA in order to facilitate cost control of ANGTS construction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1639-4\">The periodic rate base inclusion approvals are an intimate part of the Decision\u2019s framework for ANGTS, which calls for the pipeline to be privately financed. The Decision recognized that ANGTS would involve enormous outlays of capital. Decision, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 100 (report accompanying Decision) (ANGTS is \u201clargest privately financed energy project ever undertaken\u201d). Because \u201c[t]he traditional tool for cost control in pipeline construction, [i.e. retrospective] regulatory oversight ... [through] cost disallow[ance],\u201d was deemed insufficient to both assure cost control and minimize the uncertainty of investors about future revenues in these unique circumstances, Incentive Rate of Return for ANGTS, No. RM 78-12, 43 Fed.Reg. 45596 (1978) (FERC proposed rule), the Decision provided for timely approval of outlays on an ongoing basis for incorporation into the project\u2019s rate base. Decision, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 103 (report accompanying Decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-7\">Clearly, rate base determinations are thus part of the OFI\u2019s responsibilities to monitor cost control and to effectuate cost control incentives. As such, they are actions to enforce ANGTA, and FERC\u2019s regulations pursuant to ANGTA. In addition, since the President\u2019s Decision explicitly makes rate base approval a condition of pipeline operators\u2019 certificates of public convenience and necessity, rate base determinations are also actions to enforce this condition. Thus, according to section 202(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979, OFI\u2019s rate base determinations may be reviewed only under section 10 of ANG-TA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-8\">Even if the rate base determination were not a means of enforcement, it would be an \u201cauthorization\u201d pursuant to section 9 of ANGTA. This court previously has broadly interpreted section 9\u2019s definition of an authorization that is required for \u201caction which is necessary or related to the construction or initial operation of [ANGTS].\u201d <em>See Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>589 F.2d 603 (D.C.Cir.1978). In <em>Midwestern Gas, </em>we held that conditional authorization to import Canadian gas to be transported through a portion of ANGTS was covered by section 9 because \u201cimports were a material element in the overall desirability of [ANGTS].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616. Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>timely cost approvals, which facilitate the raising of capital, were a material element in the Decision\u2019s choice that ANGTS be privately funded, and hence in the overall desirability of the pipeline system. As we said in <em>Midwestern Gas, </em>\u201c[t]he critical statutory language is \u2018necessary or related to\u2019 \u201d construction or initial operation, <em>id. </em>at 614, and timely approval of construction costs falls within this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-4\">The dissent argues that the presumption in favor of judicial review precludes any inference, in the absence of explicit language, that Congress viewed rate base determinations as either an \u201cauthorization\u201d or \u201cenforcement,\u201d to be expedited under the special review provision of ANGTA. Diss.Op. at 1579, 1580, 1581. It thus disagrees with our interpretation that the President\u2019s Decision itself provides the explicit mandate by requiring that pipelines submit construction costs for approval in a timely manner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Diss.Op. at 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-5\">This submittal and approval requirement \u2014 we emphasize \u2014 is a vital part of the Decision\u2019s mechanism for facilitating the raising of capital for ANGTS by reducing the risks for ANGTS investors without shifting the risks of cost overruns to the consumer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Decision, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 100. We thus find the dissent\u2019s reading of the submittal and approval requirement to require only timely submissions but not expedited approval of these submissions to be senseless. There would be no rational purpose for such a half-a-loaf condition from anyone\u2019s point of view, investor or consumer. We believe that the dissent\u2019s position would undermine the envisioned security for investors\u2019 return by allowing the rate base, on which a reasonable return is permitted, to remain uncertain while FERC ratemaking proceedings and judicial review went on for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-10\">Nor does the dissent\u2019s foray into the legislative history convince us that Congress intended that rate base determinations be subject to full judicial review. The pre-Decision ANGTA simply did not speak to the application of section 9 to rate base determinations but the Decision, which has the force of statutory law, did \u2014 and it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>so specifically, in our view.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In short, we believe that the Decision, which was explicitly approved by Congress <em>after the enactment of ANGTA, </em>envisioned that rate base determinations for ANGTS construction costs would be made on an expedited basis, and judicial review of such determinations would be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-4\">III. Procedural Requirements for Section 10 Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">Section 10 of ANGTA precludes us from substantively reviewing the Final Determination and Denial of Rehearing for reasonableness or substantial evidentiary support. <em>See Earth Resources Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>617 F.2d 775, 777 (D.C.Cir.1980); H.R.Rep. No. 1658 Part 1, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 6643. We may only review claims that agency action is a \u201cdenial of constitutional rights,\u201d or \u201cin excess of statutory ... authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(b)(2) (1982). ISCC expressly disavows that it is claiming a deprivation of constitutional rights, <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioner at 36 n. 1, and does not argue that rate base determinations are outside of OFI\u2019s authority. ISCC does contend, however, that OFI acted \u201cshort of statutory right\u201d in denying it a hearing and failing to include explicit findings of fact and conclusions of law in the controversial Final Determination and Denial of Rehearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1641-8\">ISCC bases its procedural claims on requirements mandated by the Natural Gas Act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717-717z (1982), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552-59, 701-06 (1982). Since these Acts govern rate base determinations made by FERC as part of its rate reviewing function and since ANGTA does not explicitly preempt these statutes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ISCC contends that they govern OFI\u2019s rate base determinations as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-9\">To the extent that these procedural requirements are explicitly written into these statutes, ISCC is correct. <em>See, e.g., Earth Resources, </em>617 F.2d at 779. But apart from the ever-present consideration that courts must be wary not to engraft onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>statutes their own procedural panaceas for agency proceedings, <em>see Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>435 U.S. 519, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978), we must be especially cautious here because ANG-TA explicitly and significantly limits judicial review in order to expedite OFI\u2019s authorizations under section 9. Hence, we should not require the OFI to follow those procedures that courts have read into the Natural Gas Act principally to facilitate substantive judicial review. With this concern in mind, we turn to ISCC\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">A. <em>Right to a Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">ISCC claims that the OFI procedures used in determining Northern Border\u2019s rate base denied its statutory right to an adjudicatory hearing under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d (1982). This court has previously held that, <em>where a determination of just and reasonable rates is reviewable under a substantial evidence test, </em>notice and comment procedures are statutorily insufficient and \u201csome sort of adversary, adjudicative-type procedures [are] ... necessary.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>483 F.2d 1238, 1259 (D.C.Cir.1973). Under ANGTA, however, we cannot infer such a broad hearing requirement as an aid for our review, since ANGTA itself precludes review of the OFI\u2019s decision on either reasonableness or evidentiary grounds. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1658 Part 1, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 6657 (\u201c[i]t is not intended that the Court would have jurisdiction to look behind the agency decision to examine its reasonableness or determine whether it is adequately supported by the record of any proceedings as may have occurred before the agency\u201d). We thus conclude that hearing requirements beyond \u201cnotice and comment\u201d are not required by the Natural Gas Act or the APA for section 10 pipeline rate base determinations. We recognize that this holding leaves the OFI wide discretion in its rate base determinations; nonetheless, this is what Congress apparently wanted. It still requires, however, that the Federal Inspector carefully consider submitted comments. Even where, as here, the agency\u2019s discretion is great, \u201cif [the] agency simply ignores issues whose relevance to the public interest is obvious, the agency\u2019s decision may be reversed.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>613 F.2d 939, 944 (D.C.Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Union Mechling Corp. v. United States, </em>566 F.2d 722, 724 (D.C.Cir.1977)). We must satisfy ourselves at least that ISCC had a meaningful opportunity to comment and that the OFI actually dealt with the comments presented to it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1642-7\">ISCC raises three particular issues on which it believes no adequate hearing was provided. It contends first that NEI-CO controls Northern Border so that FERC\u2019s normal \u201cno profits to affiliates\u201d rule should apply, second that the profits allowed by the NEICO contract were not reasonable in their own right, and third that the NEICO contract was unnecessary since it duplicated another contract Northern Border had with Northern Plains. Under the limited scope of ANGTA hearing requirements we find ISCC was not denied its hearing rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-8\"><em>NEICO control of Northern Border. </em>The Tentative Determination, which essentially plays the role of notice under OFI\u2019s procedures, explicitly addressed the affiliation of NEICO and Northern Border. It clearly stated the evidence upon which it relied, and found that \u201ca \u2018control\u2019 situation does not exist.\u201d Tentative Determination, J.A. at 318. Based on this finding, the Tentative Determination decided to apply a market test rather than a strict \u201cno profits to affiliates\u201d rule. In doing so, it claimed to follow <em>Florida Gas Transmission Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>362 F.2d 331 (5th Cir.1966), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>391 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1968), which it read to preclude application of that rule unless the affiliates were so close that they constituted, in effect, a single entity. ISCC commented extensively on this finding and the application of <em>Florida Gas Transmission. See </em>Letter from Diane L. Mclntire, Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>for ISCC, to John T. Rhett, Federal Inspector (Mar. 11, 1983) [hereinafter cited as ISCC Comments], J.A. 341-345. In his Final Determination, the Federal Inspector explicitly addressed ISCC\u2019s comments on control. Final Determination, J.A. at 362. He noted that the evidence upon which ISCC relied to question the Tentative Determination was precisely that which the Tentative Determination had considered. <em>Id. </em>Finally, he agreed with the Tentative Determination that <em>Florida Gas Transmission </em>applied to this case and that it allowed reasonable profits paid to NEICO to be included in Northern Border\u2019s rate base. Thus, ISCC certainly got a \u201chearing\u201d that satisfied the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982). Its remaining discontent must be attributed to the reasonableness of the Federal Inspector\u2019s decision on control, which, for good or for ill, Congress has decided we cannot review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-4\"><em>Reasonableness of the NEICO contract. </em>ISCC\u2019s claim that OFI denied it a hearing on the reasonableness of the NEICO contract is equally unfounded. Essentially it took issue with the OFI\u2019s decision that a market test could be used to determine the reasonableness of the terms and profits in a project management contract to be performed during Northern Border\u2019s construction phase. <em>See </em>Tentative Decision, J.A. at 318 (market test \u201craises difficult issues\u201d but is applicable). ISCC did in fact argue this point of view at length in its comments. The Federal Inspector rejected ISCC\u2019s arguments and held that \u201c[c]ontraets for services of a similar nature on the Alaskan Leg of ANGTS and a previous contract on the Eastern Leg provided a reasonable \u2018market\u2019 basis for evaluating the basic compensation terms.\u201d Final Determination, J.A. at 360. He went on to find that under this test \u201cthe payments to NEICO (and the terms of the NEICO eon-tract ...) were ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>ISCC is statutorily entitled to no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-7\"><em>The need for the NEICO contract. </em>On appeal, ISCC also contends that it had a right to a hearing on the issue of whether Northern Plains was already obligated to provide, without profit, the services for which NEICO was paid a profit under the project management contract. Certainly, if its allegations were true then exclusion of NEICO\u2019s profit from Northern Border's rate base would have been appropriate, since such profit would be an unnecessary cost for Northern Border. Thus, such allegations would raise a material issue of fact, in which case the OFI\u2019s procedures acknowledged that a fuller hearing might be appropriate. In its Final Determination, moreover, the OFI never referred to or commented on this factual contention, thus apparently denying to ISCC even its statutory due of consideration by the decision-maker.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> J.A. at 372-74. At first blush, this would seem to contravene ISCC\u2019s right to any kind of hearing under the Natural Gas Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-8\">A closer look at the record, however, persuades us that ISCC never identified this specific issue with sufficient particularity to fairly apprise the Federal Inspector that it was a contested fact. In its original submission to the OFI, the allegation that the NEICO contract was duplicative appeared as a single sentence effectively buried in several pages of ISCC\u2019s general comments on the issue of control and the applicability of a market test to determine reasonable profits. <em>See </em>ISCC Comments, J.A. at 343. This one sentence gave no indication that ISCC meant to raise an entirely distinct factual issue about the duplication. ISCC thus failed to set out this allegation in a clear statement of issues of disputed fact supported by affidavits as OFI\u2019s Policy Statement requires. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. 51726 (1981). Even in its petition <em>for </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>hearing, ISCC never isolated this contested issue of fact from its general control and profits arguments. <em>See </em>Rate Base Determination \u2014 Northern Border Pipeline Co., ISCC Application for Rehearing (filed September 22, 1983), J.A. at 365-70. In light of OFI\u2019s mandate to expedite rate base determinations, ISCC could not reasonably expect the OFI to entertain a \u201crehearing\u201d on an issue that was not clearly highlighted in the first place. Thus, ISCC cannot now contend that the OFI acted improperly in not providing an evidentiary hearing or addressing an issue it failed to properly identify as substantial or contested. On all these points, we find ISCC received the only \u201chearing\u201d rights Congress, and by delegation the OFI, provided it under ANG-TA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">B. <em>Ex Parte Contacts and Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1644-5\">ISCC contends that even if it is entitled to a mere paper hearing complying only with notice and comment procedures, such a hearing still must comply with standards of basic fairness, <em>i.e., </em>ISCC must be able to identify and challenge the evidence on which the decision is being made. Brief for Petitioner at 26. ISCC claims that the OFI\u2019s reliance on ex parte contacts and its refusal to afford ISCC any discovery prevented ISCC from \u201cdeveloping a record\u201d to contest the bases of the OFI\u2019s rulings. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-6\">ISCC says first that the OFI depended in part on reports from pipeline operators to the OFI Director of Audit and Cost Analysis \u2014 reports ISCC labels ex parte communications \u2014 to reach its Tentative Determination. ISCC thus considers the OFI process here to be fatally flawed in the same way as the ex parte contacts and secret decisionmaking in <em>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 9, 54-57 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. 111, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-7\">We note at the outset that this court has not interpreted <em>Home Box Office </em>to apply to all informal rulemaking proceedings. <em>See Sierra Club v. Costle, </em>657 F.2d 298, 401-02 (D.C.Cir.1981) <em>(Home Box Office </em>not applicable to informal rulemaking of \u201cgeneral policy-making sort\u201d); <em>see also United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall, </em>647 F.2d 1189, 1218 (D.C.Cir.1980) (suggesting same), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 3149, 69 L.Ed.2d 997 (1981). One certainly may argue plausibly, based on prior statements of this court, that rate-making is a special type of \u201crulemaking\u201d to which <em>Home Box Office </em>should apply. <em>See, e.g., National Small Shipments Traffic Conference v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>590 F.2d 345, 350-51 (D.C.Cir. 1978) (\u201cadjudication contemplated in this [particular ratemaking] case lies near the core described by the [ex parte communications] rationale\u201d) (dicta). But even if we accept this proposition, ISCC\u2019s attack on the disputed contacts here fails. <em>Home Box Office </em>recognized that \u201cinformal contacts between agencies and the public are the \u2018bread and butter\u2019 of the process of administration,\u201d and barred ex parte contacts only after the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. <em>Id. </em>at 57. In this case, OFI explicitly used required reports and audits from the pipeline companies only to enable OFI\u2019s Director of Audit and Cost Analysis to issue a tentative decision \u2014 a rough equivalent of the notice of proposed rulemaking. Once that decision was issued no further ex parte contacts were allowed. Furthermore, at oral argument, counsel for the OFI stated, and ISCC did not appear to contest, that the information on which the Tentative Determination was based was available to the public upon request. The Final Determination made by the Federal Inspector was thus based on the publicly available information which led to the Tentative Determination, and on subsequent public comments. This process, while departing somewhat from usual rate-making proceedings, is a far cry from the \u201csecret decision-making\u201d that <em>Home Box Office </em>condemned. The contacts about which ISCC complains occurred only before the Tentative Determination was published; their contents were apparently open to public scrutiny, therefore OFI hearing procedures did not violate basic tenets of fair-</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>ness derived from the applicable statutes or our prior holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-5\">ISCC also takes issue with OFI\u2019s procedures on the grounds they provide no opportunity for discovery, thereby rendering ISCC impotent to develop support for its factual contentions, and effectively emasculating its right to intervene. This lack of discovery, according to ISCC, along with the OFI reliance on pipeline operator reports to reach a tentative determination, led to a lopsided record. ISCC asserts that \u201c[s]uch a state of affairs was clearly not intended by Congress when it passed the Natural Gas Act (or even ... ANGTA).\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-6\">Many of ISCC\u2019s criticisms of the process are well taken \u2014 in the context of ordinary judicial review of administrative action. But under ANGTA, the reviewing court can monitor the decisionmaking process only to assure there has been no abrogation of a specific constitutional or statutory right. Congress, by approving expedited rate base determinations and limiting judicial review so drastically, has purposefully invested the OFI with very broad latitude to assess what evidence it needs to make rate base determinations, and what procedures will efficiently allow it to collect that evidence. Unless these procedures violate the most fundamental notions of fairness or a specific statutory guarantee, we have no authority to interfere.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the case of denial of discovery rights, we find no such explicit violation of a statutorily guaranteed right. Discovery can add months or even years to proceedings, and Congress apparently desired these proceedings to be expedited at the expense of more traditional guarantees of full and fair hearings. We therefore reject ISCC\u2019s suggestion that we read into ANGTA a requirement that parties be allowed discovery in section 10 expedited proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-3\">C. <em>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1645-8\">ISCC\u2019s final procedural attack focuses on the cursory nature of the Final Determination\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It first contends that the failure of the Federal Inspector to include explicit findings and conclusions violates the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3). Brief for Petitioner at 39-40. The section of the APA that ISCC cites, however, applies only to \u201con the record\u201d adjudications and rulemakings, <em>see United States v. Florida East Coast Realty Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973), and not to ratemaking under the Natural Gas Act. <em>See Mobil Oil, </em>483 F.2d at 1251. Still, the ISCC argues that an adequate statement of findings and conclusions is required as the basis of any agency decision. Brief for Petitioner at 40. The traditional rationale for such a requirement has been its necessity as a basis for substantive judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-9\">[Tjhere must be sufficient indication in the agency decision of the basis for the Commission\u2019s action, so that the court may ascertain whether the agency action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, as outlined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1645-10\"><em>Estate of French v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>603 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1979). That consideration is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-11\">Nevertheless, we believe that the OFI does have an obligation to state sufficient findings and reasons supporting its decision to permit the limited judicial review authorized here, <em>i.e., </em>to ensure that the OFI contravened no statutory rights. As Judge Augustus Hand said many years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-12\">\u201cThe basic findings essential to the validity of a given order will vary with the statutory authority invoked and the context of the situation presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>[But i]t is ... necessary that the essential basis of the Commission\u2019s order appear in the report so that a court can satisfy itself that the Commission has performed its function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1646-4\"><em>Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, </em>122 F.Supp. 824, 828 (S.D.N.Y.) (quoting <em>Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 216, 71 S.Ct. 264, 95 L.Ed. 225 (1951)), <em>aff'd, </em>347 U.S. 984, 74 S.Ct. 850, 98 L.Ed. 1120 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-5\">In addition, a statement of findings and reasons \u201chas a rationale of its own, quite separate from facilitating judicial review on the merits____ [A] \u2018reasons\u2019 requirement promotes thought by the decision-maker and \u2018compels him to cover the relevant points and eschew irrelevances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Pipeline Co. v. United States, </em>725 F.2d 1467 at 1473 (1984) (quoting <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975)) (holding that in light of reasons requirement, court\u2019s review should assure that reasons are relevant to statutorily prescribed inquiries). A \u201creasons\u201d requirement also permits a pipeline to fathom what costs it may include in its rate base, and thereby to avoid future problems due to unrecovered costs and resulting difficulties in obtaining capital for further construction and operation. <em>Cf. id. </em>(statement of reasons allow pipeline to plan for delays in filed rates taking effect). Finally, a statement of findings and reasons helps maintain public accountability. Even if the courts cannot review the OFI\u2019s decision for rationality, the public should be able to do so. A statement of facts found and reasons for agency action is included in the minimal criteria of administrative due process, and we have no evidence that Congress meant to push expedition to the extreme of eliminating even this most fundamental protection against official abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-8\">Although we cannot assure that the Final Determination meets traditional notions of logic or evidentiary support, we should require on review that the OFI, in a final rate base determination, address all significant issues of fact and policy that are raised by comments and are obviously pertinent to the decision. This requirement (1) guarantees that the parties submitting comments will get their statutorily prescribed hearing,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (2) encourages the OFI to think about all pertinent issues, (3) gives the pipelines some direction regarding future costs, and (4) ensures the opportunity of public review for reasoned and consistent decisionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-11\">In this case we find that the Final Determination did address all pertinent issues raised by ISCC, and therefore comports with the requirement of essential findings and conclusions. The Final Determination found: (1) NEICO did not control Northern Border, (2) a market test can ascertain the reasonableness of a contract for management service provided to a pipeline operator constructing a section of ANGTS, and (3) the rates charged in the NEICO contract were reasonable. It included the following legal conclusions: (1) the \u201cno profits to affiliates rule\u201d is inappropriate in this case, and (2) the market test for reasonableness is appropriate under <em>Florida Gas Transmission, </em>362 F.2d 331. We find that these findings and conclusions address all contentions explicitly raised in ISCC\u2019s comments, and that therefore the Final Determination is not faulty for lack of findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-12\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-13\">In sum, we hold that rate base determinations for costs incurred by the operator of a segment of ANGTS, prior to the in-service date of that segment are reviewable only under section 10 of ANGTA. Under that section\u2019s circumscribed standard of review, the OFI did not deny ISCC any right to which it was statutorily entitled. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>these reasons, the decision of the Federal Inspector is</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1636-9\">.

ANGTA required the President to issue a decision on the desirability of ANGTS and, if approval of ANGTS was recommended, to designate \u00e1 transportation system for congressional approval. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719e (1982). ANGTA provided for the President\u2019s decision to take effect upon enactment of a joint resolution of Congress. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719f(a) (1982). President Carter\u2019s Decision was approved by joint resolution, and thereby became law, on November 8, 1977. Pub.L. No. 95-158, 91 Stat. 1268 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1639-5\">. After the Federal Inspector approves a rate base for a segment of ANGTS, FERC reviews filed rates for that segment under the usual procedures provided by the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (1982). <em>See, e.g., Northern Border Pipeline Co., </em>Docket No. CP 78-124-008 (Dec. 30, 1983). It is not clear, however, if subsequent modifications of the rate base are covered by ANGTA or the Natural Gas Act. The OFI\u2019s position is that its responsibility under ANGTA ends when the whole pipeline is complete and gas is flowing from Alaska. We note that originally no tariff was to be charged until the whole pipeline was complete and commissioned and, at that time, OFI\u2019s responsibilities under ANGTA were to end. <em>See </em>Decision <em>supra </em>note 5, at 37-38. But pursuant to section 8(g)(1) of ANG-TA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719f(g)(l), President Reagan allowed charges to be levied for transporting gas through completed segments of the pipeline even if Alaskan gas was not yet flowing. <em>See </em>Waiver of Law Pursuant to ANGTA, <em>reprinted in, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 350, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981), approved by Congress, Pub.L. No. 97-93, 95 Stat. 1204. In light of this waiver, it is unclear if costs for a particular segment, incurred after the segment is already approved and operational, are related to initial operation and construction of that segment. We need not answer this question, since this case involves the construction costs of Northern Border that were <em>incurred prior to the date its segment went into service. See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 16 (noting that in-service date of Northern Border segment was September 20, 1982, while rate base determinations covered costs only through March 31, 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1640-6\">. In interpreting the Decision, we must give \"deference to the interpretation given [a] statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Both the OFI and FERC have consistently interpreted the Decision as we have \u2014 to mandate \"timely\u201d <em>{i.e., </em>ongoing and expedited) rate base approvals. <em>See </em>OFI Policy Statement, 46 Fed.Reg. 51726 (1981); FERC Delegation Order to the OFI, 45 Fed.Reg. 85511 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-7\">The dissent places great weight on the fact that FERC delegated its authority to the OFI under the voluntary provision of the Reorganization Plan, section 202(b), rather than viewing the delegation as automatic under the mandatory \"enforcement\" provision of section 202(a). Diss.Op. at 1580. This does not mean, however, as the dissent implies, that FERC considered rate base approval as something other than enforcement, reviewable only under section 10 of ANGTA. In fact, FERC cites with approval the following OFI position;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1640-8\">[Given] the ...

FERC delegated responsibility for rate base determinations under \u00a7 202(b), rather than viewing it as automatically delegated under \u00a7 202(a), only because \"all uncertainty as to responsibility for [their] performance should be eliminated.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1640-13\">.

Even so, rate base determinations affect the ultimate just and reasonable price which Northern Border may obtain in gas transported prior to rate base approval. When Northern Border commenced operations, its tariff was based on unaudited costs of construction. <em>See </em>Order No. 31, 7 FERC (CCH) \u00b6 61,237 at 61,446. But to the extent particular amounts are excluded from the rate base by the OFI, Northern Border must refund any overcharges with interest. <em>See id. </em>at 61,470-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1641-6\">. As the dissent points out, the legislative history of the original ANGTA mentions ratemaking only once, stating that regulation of rates would be governed by the Natural Gas Act. Diss.Op. at 1582. That mention, however, is part of an explanation of a section of the Senate bill which Congress did not ultimately adopt, explicitly stating that the Natural Gas Act applies to the extent it is consistent with ANGTA. In addition, the statement may have meant only that the substantive provisions of the Natural Gas Act\u2014 <em>e.g., </em>that rates be just and reasonable \u2014 were to apply, but that its procedural protections would be superseded by the special procedures that the bill authorized FERC to promulgate for ANGTS. Other portions of the Senate debates that address the preemption of statutory law by ANG-TA support this reading by focusing on the procedural nature of the Act\u2019s expedition and limited review provisions. <em>See </em>122 Cong.Rec. 22,023 (1976) (\u201d[t]his is a procedural bill which, unless otherwise explicitly stated therein, does not modify existing rights and obligations of affected persons\u201d) (statement of Senator Jackson); 122 Cong.Rec. 22021-22 (in issuing expedited permits, agency \"is to comply with its own substantive law ...

Northern Border responded to this factual contention in its brief on appeal, arguing that the Northern Plains contract was for services rendered before receipt of FERC\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity while the NEI-CO contract is for services after receipt of the certificate.

We reiterate that we are not deciding here whether the procedures used by the OFI would pass constitutional muster if ISCC challenged them on due process grounds, claiming that the rate base determination deprived them of a property interest. The issue of whether ISCC has such an interest has not yet been decided by the federal courts. <em>See Metzenbaum v.

If, as the majority concludes, section 10 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act (ANGTA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h (1982), governs our review of the rate base determinations at issue in this case, we are precluded from reviewing the Federal Inspector\u2019s (OFI) determinations for reasonableness or for substantial support on the record. <em>See Earth Resources Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>617 F.2d 775, 777 (D.C.Cir.1980). Under such circumstances, the result reached by the majority is clearly appropriate. If, on the other hand, section 10 of ANGTA is inapplicable, and OFI rate base determinations may be scrutinized under a substantial evidence standard, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b) (1982), it is clear that the procedures afforded petitioner in this case cannot withstand review. <em>See Mobil Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>483 F.2d 1238, 1259 (D.C.Cir.1973). The majority concedes as much. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 1574, 1577. Because I find the majority's analysis with respect to the statute\u2019s applicability strained, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-9\">Agency rate determinations have traditionally been subject to judicial review. I cannot agree with my colleagues that in section 10 of ANGTA, Congress <em>sub silentio </em>deviated from this common practice. The majority\u2019s decision today has dramatic implications for consumers of natural gas. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, OFI rate base determinations on all segments of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) \u2014 determinations that will affect the rates paid by consumers throughout the lifetime of the Alaskan pipeline \u2014 are insulated from all but the most perfunctory review. In reviewing costs for inclusion in a rate base, agencies with rate-setting authority are directed to approve only such costs as will result in a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c(a) (1982). To prohibit judicial review of the reasonableness of such decisions, as the majority does in this case, is tantamount to eliminating any review. Such a result is not favored in the law. The Supreme Court in <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), held that \u201conly upon a showing of \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 87 S.Ct. at 1511 (citation omitted). <em>See also Harper v. Levi, </em>520 F.2d 53, 67 (D.C.Cir. 1975). Paradoxically, the majority is willing to impute such an intent to Congress in this case on the slimmest of evidence; I am not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-11\">It is beyond peradventure that Congress wanted a \u201churry-up\u201d procedure to govern the regulatory aspects of the <em>construction </em>of ANGTS. Section 10 of ANGTA and its legislative history make it clear that Congress did not want the courts to be used to slow down the pipeline\u2019s construction; it wanted the pipeline built \u201cfull speed ahead.\u201d Congress did not, however, throw out the baby, the bath water, and the bathtub of natural gas rate regulation. It did not intend that natural gas be exempt from normal ratemaking and review processes merely because it happened to flow through ANGTS\u2019 pipelines. This is my point of tension with the majority\u2019s analysis of section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-13\">The majority correctly notes that section 10 of ANGTA applies to two kinds of agency action: (1) actions taken pursuant to section 9 of the Act, and (2) enforcement decisions of the Federal Inspector made pursuant to section 202(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979, 44 Fed.Reg. 33,663, 93 Stat. 1373 (1979) (reprinted in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719e (1982)). Majority Opinion at 1570. The majority concludes that OFI rate base determinations qualify as agency action under both of these provisions. Consonant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>with the majority opinion, I will examine these provisions in inverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-4\">A. <em>Enforcement Activities Under the Reorganization Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-5\">Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, President Carter, with the approval of Congress, created the Office of the Federal Inspector and transferred to it \u201cexclusive responsibility\u201d for the <em>enforcement </em>of \u201cFederal statutes ..., regulations and ... terms, conditions, and stipulations of grants, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by Federal agencies with respect to pre-construction, construction, and initial operation\u201d of ANGTS. Reorganization Plan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 102. The majority concludes that the ratemaking functions performed by OFI in this case qualify as \u201cenforcement activities\u201d under the Reorganization Plan. This conclusion unduly stretches the plain meaning of the word \u201cenforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-6\">The importance of the designation of an OFI action as an \u201cenforcement activity\u201d is demonstrated by section 202 of the Plan. Under section 202(a), OFI decisions on \u201cenforcement matters\u201d are explicitly characterized as \u201c \u2018action\u2019 for purposes of Section 10\u201d of ANGTA. Section 202(b), in contrast, makes OFI \u201cresponsible for coordinating the expeditious discharge of nonenforcement activities by Federal agencies\u201d and authorizes, \u201c[u]pon agreement between the Federal Inspector and the head of any agency,\u201d the delegation \u201cto the Federal Inspector [of] any statutory function vested in such agency related to the functions of the Federal Inspector.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 202(b). OFI actions taken pursuant to section 202(b) are not characterized as \u201caction\u201d for purposes of section 10. Importantly, despite conflicting interpretations by OFI, the ratemaking authority exercised by OFI in this case was delegated to it from FERC under section 202(b) \u2014 a section applicable only to <em>nonenforcement </em>functions. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 8511-12 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-7\">In concluding that rate base determinations qualify as enforcement activities under the Reorganization Plan, the majority relies entirely upon a decision and report issued by President Carter in 1977, two years before the issuance of the plan itself. <em>See </em>Executive Office of the President, Energy Policy and Planning, Decision and Report to Congress on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (1977) (hereinafter cited as Decision). The majority reasons that, since the President\u2019s Decision makes the timely submittal of construction costs for approval a \u201cterm or condition\u201d of the applicant\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity, any action taken by FERC, or its delegatee, to approve or disapprove those costs is an action to \u201cenforce\u201d that submittal requirement. Majority Opinion at 1570, 1571. Based on this assumption, the majority concludes that \u201csince the President\u2019s Decision explicitly makes rate base approval a condition of pipeline operators\u2019 certificates of public convenience and necessity, rate base determinations are also actions to enforce this condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1571. The assumption and the conclusion are equally unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-9\">The President\u2019s Decision does not, explicitly or otherwise, make rate base <em>approval </em>a condition of the pipeline operator\u2019s certificate; it merely requires operators to <em>submit </em>their costs in a timely fashion. When the regulatory authority acts to approve or disapprove the submitted cost it is not \u201cenforcing\u201d the submittal requirement within any common understanding of the meaning of the word; rather, it is making a determination as to the reasonableness of the submitted item. That the President\u2019s Decision does not support such a strained definition of the word \u201cenforcement\u201d is evidenced by its description of the transfer of authority contemplated in the subsequent Reorganization Plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1648-10\">This plan will propose a limited, single-purpose transfer of field-level supervisory authority over enforcement of terms and conditions for the duration of the preconstruction and construction phases of the Alcan project. No other transfer of existing authority, or transfer of any coordination function, will be proposed in the reorganization plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>Decision at 204. <em>See also id. </em>at 198-99. Rate base determinations hardly qualify as \u201cfield-level supervisory\u201d functions. Neither the President\u2019s Decision, nor the Reorganization Plan, support the majority\u2019s interpretation. Ratemaking is not an enforcement activity within the meaning of the Reorganization Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-4\">B. <em>Section 9 Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuWz\">Independent of the enforcement function analysis criticized above, the majority concludes that the rate base determinations at issue in this case are subject to review only under the terms prescribed in section 10 of ANGTA because the determinations qualify as actions taken pursuant to section 9. Majority Opinion at 1571. I find my colleagues\u2019 reasoning here equally unpersuasive. Section 9 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1649-5\">To the extent that the taking of any action which is necessary or related to the construction and initial operation of the approved transportation system requires a certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization to be issued or granted by a Federal officer or agency, such Federal officer or agency shall ... issue or grant such certificates, permits, rights-of-way, leases, and other authorizations at the earliest practicable date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1649-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719g(a) (1982). Thus, in order for the action of a federal officer or agency to qualify as an action \u201ctaken pursuant to [section 9],\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(a), that action must involve (1) the issuance or granting of a certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization that is (2) required by the operator of the approved transportation system in order to (3) take an action which is necessary or related to the construction or initial operation of that approved system. Each aspect of this definition must be satisfied in order to invoke the limited review provisions of section 10. I conclude that OFI rate base determinations do not satisfy this three-part definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-7\">The majority argues that OFI rate base determinations fit within the \u201cor other authorization\u201d language of section 9 \u2014 finding support for its broad interpretation of the word \u201cauthorization\u201d in this court\u2019s decision in <em>Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>589 F.2d 603 (D.C.Cir.1978). Majority Opinion at 1571. That reliance is misplaced. <em>Midwestern Gas </em>involved challenges to FERC orders granting import applications permitting the importation of natural gas from Canada through the prebuilt portion of ANGTS. It was uncontested that the sought after import permits qualified as certificates, rights-of-way, per-, mits, leases, or other authorizations within the meaning of section 9; the only dispute was whether the importation of Canadian gas was \u201cnecessary or related to the construction and initial operation of\u201d ANGTS. 589 F.2d at 614. The court ruled that it was. <em>Midwestern Gas </em>is precedent for the adoption of a broad interpretation of what is \u201cnecessary or related to the construction and initial operation\u201d of ANGTS; however, it provides no support for the strained interpretation of \u201cauthorization\u201d adopted by the majority. Although one may concede that the obtaining of a permit for the importation of Canadian gas through ANGTS is a requirement for the taking of an action necessary or related to the construction and initial operation of the pipeline, it does not follow that the setting of a rate base which will affect the pricing of that imported gas is also a required \u201cauthorization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-9\">I find it beyond comprehension that Congress intended to include OFI rate base determinations within section 10\u2019s limited judicial review provisions. Agency rate-making decisions are frequent subjects of judicial review. In delegating ratemaking functions to administrative agencies, Congress has traditionally provided for judicial review of the reasonableness of rate decisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717c &amp; 717r (1982); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824d &amp; 825Z (1982); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1976). If Congress had intended to deviate from this common practice in ANGTA, I submit, it would have done so explicitly. No such intent is evident. Ratemaking, even if arguably an authorization, is not of the same kind as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>certificates, rights-of-way, permits, and leases. In section 9, Congress demonstrated its ability to list specifically the agency actions it intended to expedite and subject to truncated judicial review. That it omitted ratemaking activities, the most obvious component of pipeline regulation, is not without significance. The congressional reports issued in reference to ANGTA indicate that the delays Congress sought to avoid through ANGTA\u2019s expedited procedures were construction-related, not rate-related. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 94-1020, at 7 (1976); H.R.Rep. No. 94-1658, at 23 (1976). There is simply no basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that Congress intended ratemaking functions, the largest and most obvious component of pipeline regulation, to be included within the generic category of \u201cother authorizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">In fact, the available legislative history is at odds with the majority\u2019s interpretation. The legislative history evidences a recognition on the part of Congress of the seriousness of limiting judicial review and a concern that ANGTA\u2019s limitations be narrowly construed. For example, Senator Jackson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUu\">The limitations on judicial review deserve special attention. Under section 10 of S. 3521 as reported, the actions of Federal officers and agencies in issuing necessary authorizations and approvals pursuant to the act may be judicially reviewed only under certain conditions and under certain time limitations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1650-7\">These limitations are intended to be narrowly construed. Moreover, section 9(b) [9(c) ] makes it clear that the existing body of law pursuant to which any authorization is issued must be complied with. This is a procedural bill which, unless otherwise explicitly stated therein, does not modify existing rights and obligations of affected persons. The provisions of the Natural Gas Act apply, for example, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1650-8\">122 Cong.Rec. 22,023 (1976). The Senate Report on an earlier version of ANGTA evidences Congress\u2019 intent on the precise issue before this court. It notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aum\">the provisions of the Natural Gas Act are to apply to the extent that they are not inconsistent, as determined by the Commission, with this Act. <em>Thus, for example, Commission regulation of the rates and charges for natural gas transportation through the Alaska natural gas transportation system will be subject to the Natural Gas Act just as any other natural gas company would be subject to the Natural Gas Act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1650-10\">S.Rep. No. 94-1020, at 14 (1976) (emphasis added). Although the quoted language refers to a specific section of the Senate-reported bill that was not included in the version ultimately adopted, there is nothing in the subsequent legislative history of ANGTA, or in ANGTA itself, to suggest that the cited example is not equally applicable to the enacted version. In fact, the Senate floor manager of ANGTA, Senator Stevenson, in urging adoption of the House amendments to the bill, enumerated his concerns regarding the substantive changes made in the Senate bill by the House amendments. None of these concerns involved ANGTA\u2019s judicial review provision. <em>See </em>122 Cong.Rec. 34,574 (1976) (statement of Senator Stevenson).</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-11\">The majority dismisses this clear evidence of congressional intent as irrelevant because it occurred prior to the issuance of the President\u2019s Decision. Blind to the explicit references in the legislative history concerning the appropriate scope of section 10\u2019s judicial review provisions, the majority asserts that \u201c[t]he pre-Decision ANGTA simply did not speak to the application of section 9 to rate base determinations.\u201d Majority Opinion at 1572. The majority chooses, instead, to rely on President Carter\u2019s 1977 Decision. The majority opinion does not, however, articulate any line of reasoning, other than that criticized above, or cite to any portion of the Decision which identifies rate base approval as an \u201cauthorization\u201d \u201cnecessary or related to the construction and initial operation\u201d of ANGTS. As noted above, the President\u2019s Decision did not make rate base <em>approval </em>a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>tion on the construction or initial operation of the pipeline. Any conclusion to the contrary is belied by the fact that intervenor Northern Border had been operating the pipeline, under a valid FERC certificate issued in April 1980, for several months prior to the issuance of the rate base determinations involved in this case. <em>See Northwest Alaskan Pipeline Co., </em>11 FERC (CCH) \u00b661,088 (April 28, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-5\">Without any evidence of congressional intent, today\u2019s majority takes a position which eviscerates any meaningful review of agency rate base determinations \u2014 determinations which, as noted above, will have dramatic and long-term effects on the rates paid by consumers of natural gas, and which traditionally have been subject to plenary judicial review. An agency directed by statute to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates is insulated from any judicial review as to the justness and reasonableness of its determinations. In addition, what little review the court is entitled to conduct, must be performed, and a final decision entered, within 90 days. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 719h(c)(2) (1982). Consumers may take little solace in the majority\u2019s statement that this non-review will be of limited duration, that \u201c[a]fter the Federal Inspector approves a rate base for a segment of ANGTS,\u201d subsequent review of rates filed for that segment will be conducted by FERC \u201cunder the usual procedures provided by the Natural Gas Act.\u201d Majority Opinion at 1570-1571 n. 7. These future rates will be based on a rate base arrived at under defective procedures. The rate base will never again be subject to agency or judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-7\">The majority apparently recognizes that its decision today authorizes procedures which are anathema to the normal procedures required for ratemaking. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1574 (\u201cWe recognize that this holding leaves the OFI wide discretion in its rate base determinations; nonetheless, this is what Congress apparently wanted\u201d), 1575 (\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] remaining discontent must be attributed to the reasonableness of the Federal Inspector\u2019s decision on control, which, for good or ill, Congress has decided we cannot review\u201d), 1577 (\u201cCongress apparently desired these proceedings to be expedited at the expense of more traditional guarantees of full and fair hearings\u201d). I do not believe that Congress deserves the culpability for this aberrational result. Rate base determinations are neither \u201cdecision^] on enforcement matters\u201d under the Reorganization Plan, nor \u201cauthorization[s] ... issued or granted by a Federal officer or agency\u201d which are necessary or related to the construction and initial operation of ANGTS. For the reasons set forth above, I would vacate the challenged orders of the Federal Inspector and would remand this matter to the OFI for further proceedings consistent with the procedures required under the Natural Gas Act. <em>See Mobil Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>483 F.2d 1238 (D.C.Cir.1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
