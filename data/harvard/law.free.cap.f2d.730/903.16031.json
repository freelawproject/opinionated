We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-23\">On May 7, 1981, Leninger and Gibbs &amp; Hill, Inc. entered into a contract in which they agreed that Leninger would work in Taiwan as a Senior Design Engineer for G &amp; H\u2019s Taiwan subsidiary, Gibsin Engineers, Ltd., for a two-year period commencing May 11, 1981. Leninger resigned from his existing employment and moved with his family to Taiwan where he worked for Gibsin until April of 1982. On April 8, 1982, Leninger received written notice of his termination, effective April 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-24\">Paragrah 17 of appellant\u2019s employment contract, which bears the heading \u201cTermination\u201d, contains two subparagraphs, \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. Subparagraph A is entitled \u201cFor Cause or Resignation\u201d, and sets forth in detail the \u201ccauses\u201d which would justify the termination of appellant\u2019s employment. These include such things as absenteeism, incompetence, intoxication, drug abuse, and insubordination. Appellee does not contend that Leninger was discharged for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">Subparagraph B, which is entitled \u201cCompletion of Work\u201d, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-26\">G &amp; H may terminate this agreement and your employment hereunder at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>time for GIBSIN\u2019s or G &amp; H\u2019s convenience or in the event that, in GIBSIN\u2019s or G &amp; H\u2019s judgement, the work for which you were hired or assigned under this agreement has been completed, indefinitely suspended or terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8i\">Appellee\u2019s April 8, 1982 memo stated that appellant was being discharged for a \u201cbusiness reason, which results in a planned reduction in the number of G <em>&amp; </em>H expatriates at GIBSIN.\u201d It concluded with the request, \u201cWill you please make such arrangements as necessary to complete the work you are currently assigned to.\u201d Despite this specific language in the notice of discharge, both the Rule 3(g) statement and the affidavit of appellee\u2019s vice president, submitted in support of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stated that appellant\u2019s employment was terminated because the work he was to perform had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">On June 3, 1983, Leninger submitted an affidavit opposing appellee\u2019s motion, in which he stated that he had been engaged in five engineering projects at the time of his termination, none of which had been completed as of the date of the affidavit. Leninger also swore that other American engineers continued to arrive in Taiwan and still were working on projects that appellee claimed had been completed a year before. Notwithstanding the obvious factual dispute thus created, the district court granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion with the simple notation on the motion cover \u201cSo ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Our review of the district court\u2019s judgment has been frustrated somewhat by the court\u2019s failure to indicate its reasons for granting appellee\u2019s motions. <em>See Van Bourg, Allen, Weinberg &amp; Roger v. NLRB, </em>656 F.2d 1356, 1357 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Hanson v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, </em>625 F.2d 573, 575-76 (5th Cir.1980). However, we are satisfied that the motion should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We find no merit whatever in appellee\u2019s contention that Leninger\u2019s \u201cattempt\u201d to create an issue of fact concerning the status of his work \u201cis of no consequence\u201d because the contract gave appellee the right to say that appellant\u2019s work had been completed even if, in fact, the work had not been completed. In the first place, \u201ccompletion of the work\u201d, was not given as the reason for appellant\u2019s discharge in the April 8, 1982 notice. In the second place, appellee\u2019s argument overlooks the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implied in every contract. <em>See Filner v. Shapiro, </em>633 F.2d 139, 143 (2d Cir.1980). Accepting, as we must, appellant\u2019s allegations that his assigned work had not been completed and that appellee\u2019s assertions to the contrary were made in bad faith and were completely false, the issues thus raised cannot be disregarded as \u201cof no consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">We also disagree with appellee\u2019s contention that, as a matter of law, the phrase \u201c[a]t any time for GIBSIN\u2019s or G &amp; H\u2019s convenience\u201d in subparagraph B gave appellee the unrestricted right to discharge appellant at any time it chose, with or without reason to do so. In interpreting contracts, New York courts understandably seek constructions that fairly and equitably impose mutuality of obligation, rather than interpretations that place one of the parties at the mercy of the other. <em>Moran v. Standard Oil Co., </em>211 N.Y. 187, 195-96, 105 N.E. 217 (1914); <em>Schoellkopf v. Coatsworth, </em>166 N.Y. 77, 84, 59 N.E. 710 (1901). In applying this canon of construction to an employment contract, one New York court aptly stated, \u201cif this employment contract is to be read as one terminable at will, it may just as well never have been written.\u201d <em>Vogel v. Pathe Exchange, Inc., </em>234 A.D. 313, 317, 254 N.Y.S. 881 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">If the contract in the instant case was to be terminable at the unfettered discretion of appellee, it made no sense for appellee to set forth in subparagraph A of paragraph 17 the numerous grounds warranting a discharge for cause. <em>See Yazujian v. J. Rich Steers, Inc., </em>195 Misc. 694, 701, 89 N.Y.S.2d 551 (1949). Moreover, it would be deceptive or, at best, meaningless to include a clause permitting termination at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>will in a subparagraph headed \u201cCompletion of Work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">For the reasons above expressed and in the light of the well-established rule that contractual ambiguities should be construed most strongly against the draftsman, <em>Alland v. Consumers Credit Corp., </em>476 F.2d 951, 956-57 (2d Cir.1973), we conclude that the district court\u2019s \u201cSo ordered\u201d grant of appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
