Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e. The plaintiffs, Elodie Jochum and her husband, Carmelo Pagano, now appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Pico Credit Corporation of the Westbank (\u201cPico\u201d), dismissing their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-17\">The Act requires, with an exception not here claimed to be applicable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a creditor must notify an applicant for credit of \u201cadverse action\u201d taken against his application and, in so doing, must give a written statement of the specific reasons therefor. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(1), (2), and (3) (\u201cSection 1691(d)\u201d). In dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the district court (without assigning reasons) apparently accepted the defendant Pico\u2019s argument that the refusal of a creditor to fund a pending loan application, upon its discovery of undisclosed priming judicial mortgages, is not an \u201cadverse action\u201d under the Act that requires written notification of the reasons for refusing to extend the requested credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-18\">We reverse, finding that a denial of credit is statutorily defined to be \u201cadverse action,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(6), and that under the showing made the creditor\u2019s refusal to fund the loan application was a denial of credit and an \u201cadverse action\u201d within the meaning of the Act, <em>id., </em>and of the administrative regulations, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 202.1 <em>et seq., see </em>\u00a7 202.2(c), prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, pursuant to authority legislatively conferred by the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-19\">Before adverting to the facts and particular issues of this appeal, we discuss the statutory context in which they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">\n<em>Statutory Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-20\">Section 1691(d), requiring a creditor to give written notice of adverse action on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>credit application, was added by a 1976 amendment, Pub.L. 94-239, as one of the broadening amendments to the Act as originally enacted in 1974, Pub.L. 93-495, Title V, \u00a7 503, 88 Stat. 1525. Section 1691(d), as thereby adopted, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-5\">(1) Within thirty days (or such longer reasonable time as specified in regulations of the [Federal Reserve] Board for any class of credit transaction) after receipt of a completed application for credit, a creditor shall notify the applicant of its action on the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-6\">(2) Each applicant against whom adverse action is taken shall be entitled to a statement of reasons for such action from the creditor. A creditor satisfies this obligation by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-7\">(A) providing statements of reasons in writing as a matter of course to applicants against whom adverse action is taken; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-8\">(B) giving written notification of adverse action which discloses (i) the applicant\u2019s right to a statement of reasons within thirty days after receipt by the creditor of a request made within sixty days after such notification, and (ii) the identity of the person or office from which such statement may be obtained. Such statement may be given orally if the written notification advises the applicant of his right to have the statement of reasons confirmed in writing on written request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-9\">(3) A statement of reasons meets the requirements of this section only if it contains the specific reasons for the adverse action taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-10\">s}: &gt;}: # sfc &amp; *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-13\">The Senate Report explained the purpose of these new notification requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ato\">The requirement that creditors give reasons for adverse action is, in the Committee\u2019s view, a strong and necessary adjunct to the anti-discrimination purpose of the legislation, for only if creditors know they must explain their decisions will they effectively be discouraged from discriminatory practices. Yet this requirement fulfills a broader need: rejected credit applicants will now be able to learn where and how their credit status is deficient and this information should have a pervasive and valuable educational benefit. Instead of being told only that they do not meet a particular creditor\u2019s standards, consumers particularly should benefit from knowing, for example, that the reason for the denial is their short residence in the area, or their recent change of employment, or their already over-extended financial situation. In those cases where the creditor may have acted on misinformation or inadequate information, the statement of reasons gives the applicant a chance to rectify the mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-14\">Senate Report No. 589, 94th Cong., <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 403, 406.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-15\">The plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Section 1691e of the Act, which affords a cause of action against any creditor \u201cwho fails to comply with <em>any </em>requirement\u201d imposed by the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e. The defendant does not question that an aggrieved credit applicant may bring an action under the Act against a creditor who fails to provide a written statement of reasons, for adverse action taken against that applicant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but rather contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>facts as alleged by the plaintiffs do not establish that \u201cadverse action\u201d, as defined by the Act and its implementing regulations, was taken by Pico on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a loan. For the reasons stated below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">\n<em>Context Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Viewing the facts shown in the depositions and admissions most favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, as required, <em>see, e.g., Walters v. City of Ocean Springs, </em>626 F.2d 1317, 1322 (5th Cir.1980), they show, for present summary-judgment purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">The plaintiffs contracted with a home improvement firm (\u201cOak Home\u201d) to make certain improvements on their home, provided that credit could be obtained. Oak Home referred them to the defendant Pico for financing. On August 10, 1981, the plaintiffs completed their credit application at Pico and executed a second mortgage, the latter not to become effective unless the loan was approved. Included in the documents executed by the plaintiffs was a \u201cconsummation of loan\u201d agreement, by which the loan was made contingent upon the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to grant Pico a \u201cvalid\u201d second mortgage on their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Oak Home informed the plaintiffs that their loan was approved, whereupon Oak Home commenced and completed the contracted-for work between August 12 and 14. In the meantime, Pico discovered three recorded judgments (totaling about $6,000) against the plaintiffs, which under Louisiana law are judicial mortgages affecting immovable (real) property of the judgment debtor. On August 17, after the work was done, the plaintiffs were informed by Oak Home that their credit had not been approved and that they must make immediate payment for the work done. The plaintiffs claim that this is the first they knew that Pico had disapproved their loan application, and their depositions deny that Pico ever informed them of the reasons for the denial of credit to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">Pico\u2019s factual showings are to the effect that the plaintiffs were informed by telephone of the reasons for the refusal to complete the loan. However, Pico\u2019s factual showing seems to admit that it never furnished the plaintiffs any written statement of the specific reasons for nonconsummation of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">\n<em>\u201cAdverse Action\u201d Against an Applicant for Credit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">The Equal Credit Opportunity Act requires a creditor to notify a credit applicant of the specific reasons for its action when it takes \u201cadverse action\u201d against the applicant\u2019s request for credit. Section 1691(d)(1), (2), (3), quoted <em>supra. </em>Section 1691(d)(6) defines \u201cadverse action\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-13\">For purposes of this subsection [\u00a7 1691(d)], the term \u201cadverse action\u201d means a <em>denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. </em>Such term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">In addition, as authorized by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691b(a) of the Act, the Federal Reserve Board has prescribed regulations in aid of the statutory purposes. One of them, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defines \u201cadverse ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>tion\u201d; it also specifically notes creditor actions with regard to an applicant that are <em>not </em>included within that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">Pico claims that it did not violate the Act by failing to give notice to the plaintiffs of nonconsummation of their loan because its conduct falls within the administrative exclusions from the definition of \u201cadverse action\u201d provided by (1) 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.-2(c)(2)(i) or by (2) 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(iii), and (3) it further contends that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit under the Act is precluded by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.6(c) as authorized by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">We address each of these arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">(1) <em>Applicants\u2019 Expressly Agreed to a Condition That Was Not Met</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANu\">The defendant Pico relies upon 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(i), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-8\">The term [adverse action] does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-9\">(i) A change in the terms of an account expressly agreed to by an applicant;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(i). Pico contends that the plaintiffs expressly agreed to a condition in their loan agreement stating that their loan would be contingent upon their ability to grant Pico a \u201cvalid\u201d second mortgage on their home. Since the three previously-filed judicial mortgages would prime any second mortgage, Pico reasons that an agreed-upon condition of the loan was not fulfilled, and thus the change in the account (the denial of the loan) was expressly agreed to by the applicant. Hence, the defendant argues, no \u201cadverse action\u201d was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-19\">The defendant\u2019s argument on this ground cannot withstand scrutiny. The word \u201caccount\u201d is defined by the Board\u2019s regulations as \u201can extension of credit.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(a). Under the undisputed facts, Pico refused to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a loan. It did <em>not </em>extend \u201ccredit\u201d to them. Since no \u201caccount\u201d was established between the parties, no change in an \u201caccount\u201d could occur to which the plaintiffs could agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (The plaintiffs, through their loan application, were seeking to establish an \u201caccount\u201d with Pico.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-20\">(2) <em>Refusal to Authorize an Account Transaction at the Point of Sale or Loan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-23\">The defendant next contends that its refusal to approve the plaintiffs\u2019 loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>application fell within a second administratively-defined exclusion from an \u201cadverse action\u201d by the creditor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-4\">A refusal or failure to authorize an <em>account transaction at a point, of sale or loan, </em>except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or a substantial portion of a classification of the creditor\u2019s accounts or when the refusal is a denial of an application to increase the amount of credit available under the account. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(iii). Pico claims that since it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 credit \u201cat a point of loan,\u201d its action does not constitute an adverse action by the express language of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">To fall under the exclusion, the credit relationship between Pico and the plaintiffs must be characterized as an \u201caccount transaction.\u201d As noted in (1) above, the relationship between the two parties had not ripened into an \u201caccount\u201d <em>[i.e., </em>an \u201cextension of credit\u201d] by the regulatory definition, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(a), and, for reasons to be stated, we find that \u201can account transaction\u201d refers to an action between the creditor and the debtor <em>after </em>an \u201caccount\u201d has been established between the two. Read in this manner, this regulation refers only to transactions that later occur in an established credit account and exempts from \u201cadverse action\u201d an isolated refusal to authorize a transaction on such an account, as opposed to a refusal to establish a credit account altogether. Since Pico did not extend credit to the plaintiffs, the denial of their loan application cannot be construed as a refusal to authorize some <em>further </em>account transaction at the point of loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">We reach this meaning of \u201caccount transaction\u201d (a) on the basis of statutory and regulatory history applicable to this administrative regulation, and (b) because a broader meaning of the term \u201caccount transaction\u201d would flout the legislative intent and undermine the statutory purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">\n<em>As to (a):</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The current C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(iii) was prescribed in 1978, replacing and elaborating on an earlier version of this regulation. The type of credit relationship contemplated as excluded from \u201cadverse action\u201d by this regulation is more clearly delineated by the earlier version, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.-2(c)(2)(iii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-10\">A refusal to extend credit at a point of sale or loan <em>in connection with the use of an account </em>because the credit requested would exceed a previously established credit limit on the account. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">As initially prescribed by the Board (not long after the 1976 statutory amendment to the Act), the regulation was designed to express a purpose reflected by the legislative history. While the refusal to approve an application for a credit card, or an increase in its limits, or its revocation, would be an \u201cadverse action,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(6), 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(c)(1), Congress did not intend, as impracticable, to require that written notice be required for every refusal to authorize credit for any single credit-card sale-transaction in the use of a credit card or other revolving credit relationship. As stated in the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-12\">Similarly, there is not adverse action taken within the meaning of this section when a credit card issuer refuses to authorize new credit under a revolving credit plan for a customer who seeks such credit in a point-of-sale transaction where that new credit would exceed the established limit for that customer. This would hold true even where a particular creditor would treat an attempted purchase as an implied request for an increased credit line. The formalized statement of reasons called for in this section is appropriate, in the Committee\u2019s view, only where there is an equally formalized application for credit, and not for inexplicit requests for increased limits on open end credit plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">Senate Report No. 589, 94th Cong., <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin.News 403, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The version of the regulation in effect prior to March 13, 1978, above-quoted, was designed to effectuate this legislative purpose by excluding from an \u201cadverse action\u201d the <em>\u201crefusal to extend credit </em>at a point of sale or loan <em>in connection with the </em>use<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>of an account.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The elaboration of the provision reflected by the present version of the regulation in terms narrowed the exclusion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but its substitution of <em>\u201crefusal or failure to authorize an account transaction </em>at point of sale\u201d (emphasis added) does not reflect, in our opinion, any intent to derogate from the previous meaning of the exclusion. Under its previous wording, written notice simply was not required of the specific reasons for any single refusal to permit a credit purchase in the course of a previously established \u201caccount\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>previously established extension of credit) relationship.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">\n<em>As to (b):</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">To construe the term \u201caccount transaction\u201d (as if ambiguous) as argued by Pico would, moreover, thwart the statutory purpose and be inconsistent with the express terms and legislative history of the Act. Section 1691(d)(6) expressly defines an adverse action, that requires written notice, as including \u201ca denial or revocation of credit\u201d and \u201ca refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount ... requested.\u201d It would be most difficult, as a matter of law or of common sense, to characterize Pico\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs\u2019 loan application as not included within these statutorily-assigned meanings of a creditor\u2019s \u201cadverse action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Although the plain language of an administrative regulation controls judicial construction of it, <em>Oliver v. United States Postal Service, </em>696 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1983), a regulation should be interpreted in a manner that effectuates its central purposes, <em>Columbia Gas Development Corp. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>651 F.2d 1146, 1151 (5th Cir.1981). The courts should not interpret an agency regulation to thwart the statutory mandate it was designed to implement. <em>Insurance Company of North America v. Gee, </em>702 F.2d 411, 414 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">Pico\u2019s argument ignores these interpretative principles. Pico argues that we should construe the term \u201caccount transaction\u201d (as if it were ambiguous) so as to include any pre-\u201caccount\u201d denial of credit at point of loan \u2014 that is, that no adverse action requiring notice occurs when a creditor denies an applicant\u2019s application at point of loan before an extension of credit <em>(i.e., </em>\u201caccount\u201d) relationship has been created between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">If \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(iii) in its present form, as quoted above, is so read to except pre-account denials of loans and credit from the definition of \u201cadverse action,\u201d creditors would be freed from the notification requirements of the Act whenever credit was denied at \u201ca point of sale or loan.\u201d So construed, the regulation would exempt even the most standard denials of an application for a loan or credit, such as the one present here. This result is clearly contrary to the stated purpose of \u00a7 1691(d) of the Act, which expressed the intention that \u201cadverse action\u201d requiring notification of reasons should include \u201cdenials\u201d and \u201crevocations\u201d of credit, as well as refusals to grant credit. The defendants\u2019 construction of \u00a7 202.2(c)(2)(iii) of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s regulations would undermine the very purpose of the notification requirement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>In summary, the present creditor\u2019s denial or refusal to extend credit is not excluded from the definition of \u201cadverse action\u201d under either the language or the intended purpose of that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">(3) <em>Application of State Property Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Pico\u2019s third and final contention is that 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.6(c) expressly authorizes the action it took against the plaintiffs, and thus precludes the plaintiffs\u2019 suit under the Act. \u00a7 202.6(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-6\"><em>State Property Laws. </em>A creditor\u2019s consideration or application of State property laws directly or indirectly affecting credit worthiness shall not constitute unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the Act or this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Pico argues that its decision to deny the loan was based entirely upon its inability to obtain a \u201cvalid\u201d second mortgage \u2014 in Pico\u2019s estimation, a second mortgage that was primed only by the first mortgage \u2014 on the plaintiffs\u2019 home, and thus was merely \u201can application of State property laws\u201d exempted from the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">This contention fails in its own premise. \u00a7 202.6(c) states that the application of state property laws will not constitute \u201cunlawful discrimination.\u201d It does not provide any exception to the notification requirements of \u00a7 1691(d), and thus cannot excuse the creditor\u2019s failure to provide notice of the specific' reasons for the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 loan application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">For the reasons stated, we REVERSE the summary judgment as improvidently granted, since we find that under the disputed issues of material fact the defendant creditor Pico\u2019s conduct in refusing to consummate the loan for which the plaintiffs had applied was an \u201cadverse action\u201d for which th\u00e9 statute required written notice to the applicants of the specific reasons therefor. Costs to be paid by the defendant-appellee. We REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1110-15\">. Section 1691(d)(5) of the Act exempts small creditors, i.e., those who did not act upon more than 150 credit applications in the preceding calendar year, from the requirement of <em>written </em>notice of the specific reasons for the adverse action. These creditors may satisfy the notification requirement by \"verbal statements or notifications\u201d of the specific reasons for adverse action. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">.
