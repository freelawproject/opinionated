The first order (appealed from in No. 82-1250) entered judgment in favor of appellees, the National Urban League and its employee, Napoleon Johnson, following a bench trial on appellant\u2019s initial complaint, containing a Title VII claim of sex discrimination. The second order (appealed from in No. 82-1130) granted summary judgment dismissing her second complaint, containing claims for defamation and \u201csexual extortion\u201d under District of Columbia law. Because all the claims arise from the same set of circumstances, and were indeed originally joined in a single complaint, we have consolidated these actions on appeal. They present the issues, among others, whether jurisdiction over pendent state claims requiring a jury trial, which jurisdiction may have required common factual issues in the equitable Title VII claim to be governed by the jury determination, was properly declined; whether the District of Columbia\u2019s one-year or three-year statute of limitations applied to the state claims; whether that statute is tolled by the pendency of a suit that is subsequently dismissed without prejudice; and whether the evidence in the Title VII suit adequately supported the District Court\u2019s judgment. Preliminary to all these, and perhaps most difficult of all, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>presents the issue \u2014 recurrently wasteful of the efforts of the judges of this court and of the District Court \u2014 of what was the basis for an unexplained order of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The National Urban League, Inc., is a non-profit civil rights and social service organization many of whose projects are funded by the United States government. On November 23, 1977 Napoleon Johnson, Director of the League\u2019s Economic Development Department with an office in New York City, hired appellant Margo Bouchet, an attorney, as an employee of the League. Johnson was appellant\u2019s first contact with the League, having met her at a social function in Los Angeles in March 1977, and he remained appellant\u2019s immediate supervisor throughout her period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Bouchet was hired to administer the National Youth Participation Observer Committee (\u201cNYPOC\u201d) project that was being financed by the Department of Labor. According to the findings of the District Court, it became painfully obvious within a matter of months that she was not qualified to handle her responsibilities. Officials of the Department of Labor became extremely dissatisfied with her performance, notified Johnson twice by letter of that dissatisfaction, and finally demanded, as a condition of continued funding of the NYPOC project that appellant improve her performance or be replaced. Although attempts were made by the League to assist her, the situation did not improve and appellant\u2019s employment was terminated on May 22, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Appellant saw things differently. According to her version of the facts, it was not her incompetence, but rather Johnson\u2019s sexual interest in her, combined with her steadfast refusal to favor his advances, that was responsible for the problems she encountered with her co-workers and Department of Labor officials, and for the eventual loss of her job. She alleged that Johnson conspired with Labor officials to make things difficult for her with the NY-POC project and then promised to resolve her difficulties if she would accede to his sexual advances. Early in 1978, appellant began to complain about Johnson\u2019s behavior. She first complained to the Deputy Director of the League in Washington, D.C., and then filed a written Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint on April 11, 1978. On November 13, 1978, after exhausting her administrative remedies, appellant filed her initial complaint in District Court against the League and Johnson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The history of the litigation that followed is complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Paragraph 1 of' appellant\u2019s complaint stated that \u201c[tjhis action is brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ... for unlawful discrimination in employment on the basis of sex____ Equitable and other relief are sought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g).\u201d Civil No. 78-2138, Complaint at 1 (filed Nov. 13, 1978). The complaint subsequently explained that \u201c[\u00bfjurisdiction <em>as to certain other claims </em>is predicated on the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Various paragraphs of the complaint expressly alleged defamation, sexual harassment, assault, and malicious interference with contractual relationship. The relief sought included compensatory _and punitive damages, an order directing the League to expunge all material relating to the matters complained of from appellant\u2019s personnel file, and other unspecified \u201cappropriate\u201d relief. Appellant also demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">Appellees moved to strike the claim for legal damages and the demand for a jury trial, arguing that appellant had based her complaint solely on Title VII, under which only equitable relief and never a jury trial is available. Appellant opposed their motion, explaining that her complaint included additional causes of action which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201cinvolve[] rights and remedies of the sort typically enforced in an action at law ... [and] require a jury trial on demand.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike at 1 (filed Jan. 22, 1979). Judge Hart granted appellee\u2019s motion on March 7, 1979, stating no basis for his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Shortly after that order was issued, appellant filed a motion to certify the case for interlocutory appeal. That motion was denied by Judge Hart on March 30, 1979. Appellant then filed a petition with this court on April 12, 1979, seeking permission to appeal Judge Hart\u2019s first order. She abandoned that course of action because the pleading was not authorized by the applicable rules of appellate procedure. On April 23,1979, appellant properly filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus with this Court seeking to review Judge Hart\u2019s order. After changing counsel, however, she voluntarily withdrew that petition on the ground that she intended to file an amended complaint that \u201cmight well moot the issues presented by the petition.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief (No. 82-1130) at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">On July 20, 1979, appellant moved to file an amended complaint which clarified her claims by reorganizing them in separate counts and requesting specific relief for each. The proposed amended complaint opened with the explanation that \u201c[t]his action is brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ... <em>and the common law,\u201d </em>Civil No. 78-2138, First Amended Complaint at 1 (filed Feb. 29, 1980) (emphasis added). Judge Penn, to whom the case was reassigned, initially granted the amendment, but later denied it, having concluded, upon appellees\u2019 request for reconsideration, that the amended complaint presented issues which were identical to those before Judge Hart when he had granted the Motion to Strike, and that it was therefore barred by the doctrine of law of the case. The order also relied upon the alternative ground of the statute of limitations, reasoning that since all the claims had arisen on or before May 31, 1978, and appellant had filed the Motion to Amend on July 20, 1979, the District of Columbia\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for defamation and sexual extortion, D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(4) (1981), barred her allegedly \u201cnew\u201d claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Following the denial of her motion to amend, appellant filed a second complaint, which in two separate counts requested relief for alleged defamation and sexual extortion. Appellees immediately moved to dismiss this complaint, arguing that the previous orders barred these claims under the doctrine of law of the case and the statute of limitations. On January 29, 1982, Judge Penn granted appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment with regard to this second complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Trial went ahead on appellant\u2019s original complaint without a jury. After nine days of testimony, Judge Penn entered judgment for defendants. <em>Bouchet v. National Urban League, </em>Civil No. 78-2138 (D.D.C. Mar. 3, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">We must first consider appellant\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in striking her jury-trial demand and denying her motion to file an amended complaint. This action had potential significance beyond its effect of ultimately terminating her state-law claims. As a general rule, when a case contains claims triable to a jury and claims triable to the court that involve common issues of fact, the jury\u2019s resolution of those issues governs the entire ease. <em>See Dairy Queen v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962); <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959). If, as appellant asserts, this rule is applicable with respect to Title VII (non-jury) claims, then the alleged erroneous disregard of her state-law claims and the consequent denial of her demand for jury trial would infect the disposition of her Title VII claim as well, since most if not all of its elements would have been presented to the wrong trier of fact. Not only would a jury trial on her tort claims be required, but the Title VII judgment \u2014 even if otherwise valid \u2014 would have to be vacated, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>whole case retried, giving preclusive effect to all findings of fact by the jury. <em>See Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>532 F.2d 674, 690 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 940, 97 S.Ct. 355, 50 L.Ed.2d 309 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The validity of appellant\u2019s jury-trial argument hinges on whether she was entitled to try her legal and equitable claims joined in one federal action. Certainly she attempted to do just that. Judge Hart offered no explanation of his order striking the demand for jury trial and the request for compensatory and punitive damages, so we are left entirely to speculate as to what he had in mind. Since his reason was presumably the correct one, it would have facilitated our task \u2014 as, we shall shortly see, it would have facilitated the task of his colleague Judge Penn \u2014 if he had set forth even briefly the basis of his analysis. Even if his reason had been the wrong one, however, we would affirm his action if it had a proper basis in the record. <em>Langnes v. Green, </em>282 U.S. 531, 538-39, 51 S.Ct. 243, 246, 75 L.Ed. 520 (1931). We proceed, then, to consider what that basis might be. Four possibilities exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">First, and perhaps most plausibly, the decision may have been based on the opening language of the Complaint: \u201cThis action is brought pursuant to Title VII____\u201d That prologue cannot reasonably be interpreted, however, as an expression of the exclusive claim for relief, since the Complaint states later in the same paragraph that \u201c[\u00a1jurisdiction as to certain other claims is predicated on the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.\u201d Paragraphs 30-37 of the Complaint clearly set forth claims under District of Columbia law for defamation, tortious interference with contractual relations, and what appellant later referred to as \u201csexual extortion.\u201d Appellant claimed violations of other federal statutes as well \u2014 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (Supp. V 1981) (conspiracy to interfere with civil rights) and \u00a7 1986 (1976) (\u201caction for neglect to prevent\u201d a violation of \u00a7 1985). These latter claims have not been pursued on appeal, but their presence in the Complaint further demonstrates that the prologue could not reasonably be interpreted as an expression of the exclusive basis for relief. Even without reference to the doctrine that pleadings are to be liberally construed, <em>see Jenkins v. McKeithen, </em>395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 1848-49, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969); Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(f), the Complaint could not properly be regarded as setting forth only a Title VII equitable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Second, as vigorously argued by appellees, Judge Hart may have concluded that appellant\u2019s tort allegations were \u201cidentical to, indistinguishable from, and wholly subsumed within [her] Title VII cause of action.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief (No. 82-1250) at 33-34. It is clear, however, that the \u201cincidental\u201d nature of legal claims does not deprive them of their entitlement to separate relief and jury consideration, <em>see Ross v. Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. 531, 537-38, 90 S.Ct. 733, 737-38, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970), and that Title VII does not \u201csubsume\u201d other claims based on the same set of facts, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7; <em>see Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, </em>421 U.S. 454, 461, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1720, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Third, Judge Hart may have stricken the jury trial demand because he concluded that the tort allegations, though intended to be separate claims, were insufficient to state causes of action. Of course state-law causes of action pleaded in a Title VII case should be dismissed if frivolous; and a plaintiff should not be permitted to \u201cpyramid her possible recovery\u201d by \u201ccasting and recasting the same basic facts in a number of different ways to sustain allegedly different claims____\u201d <em>Clark v. World Airways, </em>24 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 305, 307 n. 6 (D.D.C.1980). Thus, Judge Hart may have treated appellee\u2019s motion to strike under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f) as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). However, although dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) might have been proper with regard to some of plaintiff\u2019s state-law claims, including the claims of \u201csexual extortion\u201d and tortious interference with contract, <em>see Clark v. World Airways, supra, </em>24 Fair Empl.Prac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Cas. at 306, it was unquestionably not proper with regard to at least one \u2014 the claim of defamation. Judge Penn, in his order of February 18, 1981, found that plaintiff had set out an allegation of defamation. Appellees\u2019 assertion that publication was not alleged in the original complaint is not correct. <em>See </em>Complaint, para. 35. Nor can we rely on Judge Penn\u2019s finding that the alleged defamatory statements were truthful, since his authority to make such a finding, instead of leaving the issue to a jury, is the very point ultimately at issue. Based upon the pleadings, we cannot assure ourselves, as we must when addressing a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, that \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (footnote omitted). Therefore, we hold that plaintiff did set forth a state-law claim for relief and that Judge Hart would have erred had he based his order on a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The fourth possible explanation of Judge Hart\u2019s order \u2014 and one which evidently occurred to appellant, since she later filed an amended complaint setting forth new bases for jurisdiction \u2014 is that he dismissed the state-law tort claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. A federal court has the duty to determine whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 152 (1908); 13 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 3522 at 48 &amp; n. 12 (cases) (1975). Thus, in ruling on appellees\u2019 Motion to Strike Judge Hart was obliged to consider the jurisdictional basis for appellant\u2019s state-law tort claims, even though \u25a0 neither party argued the point. No independent basis for federal jurisdiction over the state claims was asserted in the original complaint. Of course a federal court has the power to entertain state claims that are brought jointly with federal claims and derive from \u201ca common nucleus of operative fact,\u201d so that the plaintiff \u201cwould ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). That power, however, is a discretionary one, and need not be exercised when dismissal of the pendent state claims will better serve the interests of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to the litigants. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">[10] A number of courts have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over related state claims when the only substantial federal claim arose under Title VII. <em>See, e.g., Lazic v. University of Pennsylvania, </em>513 F.Supp. 761, 769-70 (E.D.Pa.1981) (state claim of tortious interference with right to contract); <em>Jong-Yul Lim v. International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit, Inc., </em>510 F.Supp. 722 (E.D.Mich.1981) (unspecified state claim); <em>Kiss v. Tamarac Utilities, Inc., </em>463 F.Supp. 951, 954 (S.D.Fla. 1978) (state claims for defamation, interference with employment relationship and assault); <em>Silverman v. Lehigh University, </em>19 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 983, 990 (E.D. Pa.1976) (state civil-rights act claim); <em>Brown v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>15 Fair Empl. Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1055, 1059 (D.Kan.1976) (state civil-rights act claim); <em>Van Hoomissen v. Xerox Corp., </em>368 F.Supp. 829 (N.D. Cal.1973) (state claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress). A similar disposition was appropriate in the circumstances of this case. There is a great discrepancy between the relatively limited equitable relief available under Title VII (reinstatement and back pay) and the much broader relief sought under this appellant\u2019s state causes of action (full compensatory and punitive damages), so that the pendent claims might well become the predominant element of the lawsuit. <em>See Kiss v. Tamarac Utilities, Inc., supra, </em>463 F.Supp. at 954; <em>Van Hoomissen v. Xerox Corp., supra, </em>368 F.Supp. at 840; <em>see also United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 726-27, 86 S.Ct. at 1139 (\u201cif it appears that the state issues substantially predominate, whether in terms of proof, of the scope of the issues raised, or of the comprehensiveness of the remedy sought, the state claims may be dismissed\u201d). They would be pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>dent to this Title VII litigation much as a dog is pendent to its tail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that it was proper to decline pendent jurisdiction over the tort claims, and that Judge Hart\u2019s order striking the jury-trial demand is sustainable on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">That is not, however, the end of the jury-trial issue. For as we have noted, after several unsuccessful attempts to have Judge Hart\u2019s order reversed appellant tried to remedy the defects in her original pleading with an amended complaint. The latter not only carefully set out the torts of \u201csexual extortion\u201d and defamation as separate counts, but also asserted, for the first time, diversity of citizenship as an independent jurisdictional basis for the state-law tort claims. Judge Penn, to whom the case had been reassigned, ultimately denied the motion to amend, ruling alternatively that Judge Hart\u2019s order was law of the case or that the amended complaint was barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We agree with appellant that the former ground was error. \u201cThe doctrine of law of the case comes into play only with respect to issues previously determined.\u201d <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 347 n. 18, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1148, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). Questions that merely <em>could </em>have been decided do not become law of the case, 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 4478 at 788-89 (1981); only when an issue not expressly addressed must have been decided by \u201cnecessary implication\u201d will the doctrine be applied, <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1290 (5th Cir.1978). Judge Hart necessarily decided only that pendent jurisdiction would not lie. He did not face the new issue presented to Judge Penn on appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint: whether claims for defamation and \u201csexual extortion\u201d could properly be joined with a Title VII claim where jurisdiction over the former was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">On the other hand, Judge Penn\u2019s alternate ground of the one-year statute of limitations seems to us valid. Appellant admits that she presented her tort causes of action with a \u201ccorrect jurisdictional basis\u201d for the first time in the amended complaint. Civil No. 81-0584, Transcript of Proceedings at 10 (May 28, 1981). However, she argues (1) that the statute of limitations was tolled by the filing of the original complaint, and (2) that the applicable limitations period was three years rather than one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> District of Columbia law, which unquestionably governs these issues, <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, </em>326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945), unequivocally provides a one-year period for appellant\u2019s defamation claim. D.C.Code \u00a7 12-301(4); <em>see Universal Airline v. Eastern Air Lines, </em>188 F.2d 993, 996 (1951). We reject as frivolous appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe period is equitably tolled by Johnson\u2019s continuing iteration of the defamatory material [as a witness at the Title VII trial].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief (No. 82-1130) at 13-14. An absolute privilege attaches to statements made during the course of a judicial proceeding. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>Brown v. Collins, </em>402 F.2d 209, 212-13 (D.C.Cir.1968); <em>Barnes v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>466 F.Supp. 907, 909-10 (D.D. C.1979). With regard to appellant\u2019s self-styled \u201csexual extortion\u201d claim, we find no basis for appellant\u2019s argument that this sounds primarily in negligence, and is therefore subject to the District\u2019s three-year limitations period governing suits for negligent personal injury, <em>see Canterbury v. Spence, </em>464 F.2d 772, 793 n. 126 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1064, 93 S.Ct. 560, 34 L.Ed.2d 518 (1972). \u201cExtortion\u201dassumes coercive intent rather than negligence. A more likely possibility is that the claim comes within the District\u2019s three-year statute governing actions \u201cfor which a limitation is not otherwise specifically prescribed,\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 12-301(8). To the extent, however, that the claim of \u201csexual extortion\u201d rests upon activities such as disrupting Bouchet\u2019s work and threatening her with the loss of her job unless she provided sexual favors, we have not found, and have not been cited by appellant, any precedent in D.C. cases rendering such activities actionable, or any indication that the D.C. courts are moving in that direction. We cannot create a new tort on behalf of the District in this diversity action. <em>See Clark v. World Airways, supra, </em>24 Fair Empl.Prae.Cas. at 306. In any case, even if such activities were independently actionable, the extortion alleged in the present case involved substantial elements of assault and defamation, for which tortious conduct a one-year statute is specifically provided, which might well govern the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The only remaining question is whether the statute of limitations was tolled by the assertion of the tort claims in the original complaint, which was filed within the one-year period. Again, we must look to the law of the District of Columbia to determine whether the pendency of a claim that is later involuntarily dismissed without prejudice operates to interrupt the running of the limitations period. <em>Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc., </em>554 F.2d 1165, 1171 (D.C.Cir.1977). Although there is no District of Columbia law directly on point, Chief Judge Robinson\u2019s opinion in <em>Dupree v. Jefferson, </em>666 F.2d 606 (D.C.Cir.1981) (which relied upon the reasoning of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>York &amp; York Construction Co. v. Alexander, </em>296 A.2d 710, 712 (D.C.1972)), resolved the issue: \u201c[UJnder District of Columbia law the pendency of an action involuntarily dismissed without prejudice does not operate to toll the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Dupree, supra, </em>666 F.2d at 611. Since appellant\u2019s earlier attempt to join the state-law tort claims to her Title VII action was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a dismissal without prejudice, the District of Columbia statute was not tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Just as the statute of limitations ground we have just discussed supports Judge Penn\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to amend the first complaint, it also supports his grant of summary judgment dismissing the second complaint, which was filed 21 days later. That complaint was virtually identical to the portion of the amended complaint dealing with the state-law tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Having decided that appellant is not entitled to prevail on her jury-trial claims, we address briefly her substantive challenges to Judge Penn\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law on the Title VII claim. After nine days of trial, Judge Penn found that, while the evidence suggested that \u201cJohnson was attracted to\u201d the appellant and that \u201che flirted with her on several occasions,\u201d it did not establish that any sexual advances or demands were made and \u201cfailed to prove that she was the victim of sexual harassment by Johnson or any other member or official of NUL.\u201d Civil No. 78-2138, Memorandum, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 9 (Mar. 3, 1982). Judge Penn also found specifically that appellant was not fired because of her refusal to accede to Johnson\u2019s sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>advances, but because her performance was entirely unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Findings of fact by the trial court shall not be set aside on appeal unless \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and \u201cdue regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We must also affirm the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding on the existence of discrimination \u201cif the so-called \u2018subsidiary facts\u2019 are not clearly erroneous, if the inferences drawn from them are reasonable, and if the findings and inferences reasonably support the \u2018ultimate\u2019 factual finding on discrimination.\u201d <em>Bundy v. Jackson, </em>641 F.2d 934, 950 (D.C.Cir.1981). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that those standards were met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We have also considered and also find meritless appellant\u2019s other contentions, some of which raised theories of liability not argued to the trial court, which do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. Other employees were initially joined in the complaint as defendants but later dismissed because they had not been served or named in the complaint submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\">. In light of these factors, we do not rely upon, and do not consider the validity of, the ground relied upon by some courts, that joinder of a state tort claim is incompatible with a congressional intent to exclude jury trial in Title VII cases. <em>See Jong-Yul Lim v. International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit, Inc., supra, </em>510 F.Supp. at 725; <em>Kiss v. Tamarac Utilities, Inc., supra, </em>463 F.Supp. at 954; <em>see </em>Catania, <em>State Employment Discrimination Remedies and Pendent Jurisdiction Under Title VII: Access to Federal Courts, </em>32 Am.U.L.Rev. 777, 807 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-9\">. Neither by moving for reconsideration of Judge Penn\u2019s statute of limitations holding on the amended complaint, nor in connection with her second complaint, did appellant raise before the District Court the objection that the amendment related back to the date of filing of the original complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). Nor was the point made on appeal. The issue is not without its complexities, <em>see Walker v. Arm-co Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980); <em>Ringrose v. Engelberg Holler Co., </em>692 F.2d 403 (6th Cir.1982), and we decline to consider it on our own motion, at this late point in the proceedings, as a basis for overturning the outcome of a nine-day trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
