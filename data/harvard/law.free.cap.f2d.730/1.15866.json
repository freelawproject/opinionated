In October 1977, the probation office of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts prepared Crooker\u2019s presentence report for use in Crooker\u2019s sentencing before that court. Pursuant to Rule 32(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court permitted Crooker to read his entire presentence report prior to sentencing. Crooker was not permitted to keep a copy of the report. After sentencing, the report was transferred to the United States Parole Commission, pursuant to the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976 (Parole Act), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(e), which requires the courts\u2019 probation officers to furnish \u201cinformation available to such officers]\u201d to the Commission upon request. Prior to his parole determination proceeding, in March 1980 Crooker again read his presentence report, which the Parole Commission had provided to Crooker under the mandate of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b)(2), which requires the Commission to grant the prisoner \u201creasonable access\u201d to a report to be used by the Commission in making a parole determination. The Parole Commission, like the sentencing court, did not permit Crooker to keep a copy of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">In January 1983, Crooker filed a FOIA request with the Parole Commission, seeking release of his presentence report and other documents. After Crooker commenced this FOIA action in federal district court, the Parole Commission released many documents, but withheld copies of his presentence report and medical (drug detoxification) records the Parole Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>had obtained from the Elmcrest Psychiatric Institute. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted the Parole Commission\u2019s motion and denied Crooker\u2019s. In a brief memorandum and order, the district court held that the Parole Commission had properly withheld the presentence report on the basis of an order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on the basis of \u201cthe Parole Commission\u2019s power to make independent judgments concerning the identification of exemptable material.\u201d The district court also held that a presentence report is a court document, not an agency document, and is therefore not subject to the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The court further ruled that the Parole Commission had properly withheld the medical records, because, according to the court, the Parole Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(2), provides a specific statutory exemption from FOIA disclosure, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), for \u201cmaterial obtained upon the promise of confidentiality\u201d. The court ordered the Parole Commission to furnish Crooker with a summary of the contents of the medical records pursuant to the Parole Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c). The Parole Commission complied with this order, and plaintiff appealed from the remainder of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">I. The Presentence Report</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">An agency need disclose only \u201cagency records\u201d under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). Unfortunately, the FOIA contains no definition of \u201cagency records\u201d, the crucial term in this case. <em>See Forsham v. Harris, </em>445 U.S. 169, 178, 100 S.Ct. 977, 983, 63 L.Ed.2d 293 (1980). Nor does the FOIA\u2019s legislative history shed any helpful light on this issue. <em>See McGehee v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>697 F.2d 1095, 1106 &amp; n. 48 (D.C.Cir.), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>711 F.2d 1076 (D.C.Cir. 1983) (per curiam). The difficulty in deciding whether presentence reports are \u201cagency records\u201d arises from the hybrid function of the presentence report. The probation service of the United States courts creates the presentence report, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1), and the courts are not agencies within the meaning of the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)(B). However, after the court has used the presentence report in sentencing a defendant, the probation officer must, upon request from the Parole Commission, transmit a copy of the presentence report to the Parole Commission for use in parole determinations. After transmittal, the report is jointly possessed by a FOIA-controlled agency (the Parole Commission), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4218(a), and a FOIA-exempt entity (the courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">In attempting to divine whether Congress intended presentence reports to be agency records under the FOIA, other courts have examined the relative degree of control exercised by the FOIA agency and the FOIA-exempt body over the contested documents. Of course \u201ccontrol\u201d is a protean term, and courts have not adhered to a single variant of the control test for determining whether a document is an agency record for FOIA purposes. In <em>Carson v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>631 F.2d 1008 (D.C.Cir.1980), in which the court held that a presentence report is an agency record within the FOIA, the court applied the control test set out in an earlier opinion from that circuit, <em>Goland v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>607 F.2d 339, 346-47 (D.C. Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980). In <em>Go-land, </em>the court decided that the FOIA\u2019s applicability to a document generated by an expressly exempted non-agency (in that case, Congress) depended on \u201cwhether under all the facts of the case the document has passed from the control of Congress and become property subject to the free disposition of the agency with which the document resides\u201d. <em>Carson, </em>631 F.2d at 1010 (quoting <em>Goland, </em>607 F.2d at 347); <em>accord Ryan v. Department of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781, 785 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Warth v. Department of Justice, </em>595 F.2d 521, 523 n. 7 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The <em>Carson </em>court premised its decision on analysis of Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended in 1975, and the Parole Act of 1976. Prior to the 1975 amendment to Rule 32(c), the sentencing court enjoyed unfettered discretion to withhold any or all of the presentence report from the defendant. The <em>Carson </em>court noted that the amendments to Rule 32(c) substantially diluted the sentencing court\u2019s control over the presentence report, because Rule 32(c) now requires the court to disclose the contents of a presentence report to a defendant prior to sentencing. The court may withhold material that contains diagnostic opinions, confidential sources, or information which, if disclosed, might result in harm, physical or otherwise, to the defendant or other person, but the sentencing court must summarize the factual information contained in withheld portions to be relied on in determining sentence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A) &amp; (B); <em>see Carson, </em>631 F.2d at 1011-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The <em>Carson </em>court also held that the Parole Act indicated that the Parole Commission controlled presentence reports in its possession. The Parole Act expressly requires the Parole Commission to consider presentence reports, \u201cif available and relevant\u201d, in making its parole determinations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207(3). The Parole Act also requires the probation officers of the courts to furnish \u201cinformation available to such officer[s]\u201d to the Parole Commission upon request. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(e). Finally, the Act requires the Parole Commission to grant to requesting prisoners \u201creasonable access\u201d to their presentence reports prior to parole determination hearings, subject to exemptions that are practically identical in substance to the exemptions provided by Rule 32(c)(3). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b) &amp; (c); <em>see Carson, </em>631 F.2d at 1012-15. The <em>Carson </em>court concluded that because \u201c[t]he presentence report is, after all, central to the Parole Commission\u2019s primary function\u201d, it should constitute an agency record for FOIA purposes. 631 F.2d at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled directly on the control test employed in <em>Carson, </em>the Court gave implicit approval to that standard in <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 157, 100 S.Ct. 960, 972, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980). In <em>Kissinger, </em>the Court held that transcripts of telephone conversations recorded by Henry Kissinger while he was National Security Adviser to the President (and thus exempt from the FOIA, 445 U.S. at 156, 100 S.Ct. at 971) did not become agency records merely by their relocation to the State Department during Kissinger\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State. In rejecting the argument that mere possession could be determinative of agency record status, the Court noted that the State Department (a FOIA agency) did not control, generate, or use the documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>445 U.S. at 157, 100 S.Ct. at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">More recently, the D.C. Circuit has attempted to refine the <em>Goland/Carson </em>control test in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kissinger. </em>Whereas cases decided under the <em>Goland </em>standard had focused on the control retained by the creator of the document, <em>Kissinger </em>focused on the degree of control exercised by the agency that has received the document. In <em>Paisley v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>712 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>F.2d 686, 693 (D.C.Cir.1983), the court reconciled the cases as \u201cstanding for the general proposition that the agency to whom the FOIA request is directed must have <em>exclusive control </em>of the disputed documents\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Rather than attempt further to parse the labels \u201ccontrol\u201d, \u201cexclusive control\u201d and \u201cfree disposition\u201d, we admit that \u201ccontrol\u201d for FOIA purposes has no precise definition and may well change as relevant factors assume varying importance from case to case. The key factor in this inquiry is congressional intent: Did Congress give the Parole Commission sufficient control, relative to control given to the courts, over presentence reports to make such reports agency records under the FOIA? Perhaps wisdom lies in recognizing that where Congress has sought to make one report serve two uses, each of the two users obviously exercises some \u201ccontrol\u201d. This is not really a \u201cjoint venture\u201d situation as the Court briefly contemplated in <em>Forsham, </em>445 U.S. at 180, 100 S.Ct. at 984, but rather a dual venture situation. The inquiry is not merely to see which of the two users has more numerous indicia of control, but to inquire more deeply as to whether the completeness of the agency\u2019s dominion over and the centrality of its reliance upon the report are such as to outweigh the compelled surrender by the non-agency (the court) of its traditional and statutorily authorized discretion to withhold distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We begin by disavowing reliance on two factors that might ordinarily be thought controlling. The fir!:t is the order issued by the judges of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Since an expression of intent by a court to retain control over a presenfence report is valid only insofar as the court\u2019s expression of intent does not contravene the intent of Congress, to say that the intent of the originating court illuminates the intent of Congress would involve circular reasoning. We therefore find that the judges\u2019 order has no relevance to our inquiry into whether the court or the Parole Commission controlled the presentence report in this case. <em>Cf. Lykins, </em>at 1460.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">A second factor is the weight of authority, i.e., the fact that opposed to the decisions we have cited from the District of Columbia circuit stand three courts of appeals cases (from two circuits) and one district court case. We distance ourselves from these cases, however, because they devoted little or no analysis to the control issue or antedated the statutory changes on which <em>Carson </em>placed so much stress. These cases are: <em>United States v. Charmer Industries, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1164, 1170 n. 6 (2d Cir.1983) (presentence report is a court document not within purview of the FOIA, notwithstanding use or retention of report by Parole Commission); <em>United States v. Dingle, </em>546 F.2d 1378, 1381 (10th Cir.1976); <em>Cook v. Willingham, </em>400 F.2d 885, 885-86 (10th Cir.1968) (per curiam) (presentence report remains in exclusive control of sentencing court despite any joint utility it may eventually serve); <em>Smith v. Flaherty, </em>465 F.Supp. 815, 819 (M.D.Pa.1978) (same). The most recent case, <em>Charmer Industries, </em>did not mention <em>Carson. </em>The other three cases were decided before <em>Carson, </em>and <em>Cook, </em>which the Tenth Circuit reaffirmed without discussion in <em>Dingle, </em>was decided before the passage of the statutes (Parole Act and amended Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)) that <em>Carson </em>found determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>To begin our inquiry, we look at the court\u2019s power over and use of the presentence report. A probation officer acting as an arm of the court creates the presentence report for the purpose of informing the court\u2019s discretion prior to sentencing. <em>See United States v. Charmer Industries, Inc., </em>711 F.2d at 1170 (\u201cprincipal function of the presentence report is to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Burton, </em>631 F.2d 280, 282 (4th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Krause, </em>78 F.R.D. 203, 204 (E.D.Wis.1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Congress has empowered the courts to decide in which situations a presentence report is needed. The probation officer need not create a presentence report if the court finds that the record contains sufficient information to enable the meaningful exercise of sentencing discretion, and the court explains this finding on the record. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1); <em>see Hazelwood v. Arnold, </em>539 F.2d 1031, 1033-34 (4th Cir. 1976) (per curiam) (ordering of presentence investigation and report is discretionary with court); <em>United States v. James, </em>528 F.2d 999, 1023 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 383, 50 L.Ed.2d 326 (1976). If a court determines that a presentence report would not aid <em>the court </em>in its sentencing function, no presentence report exists for the Parole Commission to obtain. Although the Parole Act requires the Parole Commission to consider available and relevant presentence reports in making parole determinations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207(3), and requires probation officers to furnish the Commission with \u201cinformation available\u201d to them, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(e), both of these provisions have effect only in situations in which the report is \u201cavailable\u201d. If Congress had believed that presentence reports were more important to the Parole Commission than to the courts, Congress might have ordered probation officers to create a presentence report to be forwarded to the Parole Commission in every case, regardless of whether the sentencing court needed a presentence report. But Congress did not do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Rule 32(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that prior to sentencing, the court shall upon request permit the defendant or his counsel to read the presentence report, exclusive of any recommendation as to sentence. The court may exclude from disclosure \u201cdiagnostic opinion which might seriously disrupt a program of rehabilitation, sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality, or any other information which, if disclosed, might result in harm, physical or otherwise, to the defendant or other persons\u201d. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">If the court withholds any of the presentence report, the court must provide an oral or written summary not of <em>all </em>of the withheld information, but only \u201cof the <em>factual </em>information contained therein <em>to be relied on in determining sentence...\u201d </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(B) (emphasis added). The sentencing court may in its discretion withhold, without summarizing, any portion of the presentence report merely by not relying on that portion of the report in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>E.g., United States v. Long, </em>411 F.Supp. 1203, 1206 (E.D.Mich.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>We find additional significance in the court\u2019s statutorily granted discretion to release the presentence report into the permanent possession of the defendant. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) directs the defendant to return his copy of the presentence report following the imposition of sentence, \u201cunless the court, in its discretion otherwise directs\u201d. Although the mandatory disclosure requirements and exemptions in the Parole Act trace many features of the mandatory disclosure requirements and exemptions of Rule 32(c), <em>compare </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A) <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(1)-(3), <em>see </em>H.Conf.Rep. No. 94-838, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 335, 361, the Parole Act contains no provision analogous to Rule 32(c)(3)(D). The Parole Act does not permit the Parole Commission to allow a prisoner to retain a copy of his presentence report. This difference provides evidence of greater court control relative to Parole Commission control over the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Next, we examine the Parole Commission\u2019s power over and use of presentence reports. The use of the presentence report by the Parole Commission clearly does not suffice to convert the presentence report from a court document into an agency record. <em>See United States v. Charmer Industries, Inc., </em>711 F.2d at 1170 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (presentence report remained court document despite use by Parole Commission); <em>Smith v. Flaherty, </em>465 F.Supp. at 819 (Bureau of Prisons\u2019 possession and use of presentence report did not transform it into agency record).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the presentence report may in some cases be central to the Parole Commission\u2019s primary function of making parole determinations, <em>see, e.g., </em>Fennell &amp; Hall, <em>Due Process at Sentencing: An Empirical and Legal Analysis of the Disclosure of Presentence Reports in Federal Courts, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. 1613, 1617 &amp; n. 13 (1980); Note, <em>A Proposal to Ensure Accuracy in Presentence Investigation Reports, </em>91 Yale L.J. 1225, 1234 &amp; n. 56 (1982), the presentence report\u2019s primary function is not that of aiding the Commission. The Parole Commission may gain access to the presentence report only if it is \u201cavailable\u201d, that is, if the sentencing court had decided that a presentence report would aid the court\u2019s sentencing discretion. In some cases, the report may simply not exist. Even where the report does exist, it is current and therefore fully relevant when the court considers it; it may well have become out of date, perhaps very old, when the Commission considers it. The longer a convicted offender\u2019s term of incarceration \u00e1nd/or parole, the less relevant the presentence report will tend to be to a parole determination. Whether a prisoner has substantially observed the rules of the institution to which he has been confined serves as an important criterion for a parole determination, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(a) &amp; (d), and common sense suggests that reports of behavior during incarceration will assume greater importance relative to presentence behavior the longer the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In addition, the presentence report constitutes only one of five sources of information that the Commission \u201cshall consider, if available and relevant\u201d, in making a parole determination. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207. The other sources of information include reports and recommendations from prison staff, the prisoner\u2019s prior criminal record, any parole recommendations made by the sentencing judge, and reports of physical, mental, or psychiatric examinations of the prisoner. The statute also requires the Commission to consider \u201csuch additional relevant information concerning the prisoner (including information submitted by the prisoner) as may be reasonably available\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In addition, Congress gave the Parole Commission less discretion than Congress gave the courts concerning the summariza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tion of withheld information. The exemptions from disclosure under the Parole Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c), resemble those listed in Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A), which governs exemptions from disclosure of presentence reports before sentencing. However, the statutes differ regarding the degree of discretion vested in the entity (the Commission or the courts) that must summarize withheld material for the defendant/prisoner. The Parole Act requires the Commission \u201cto summarize the basic contents of the material withheld, bearing in mind the need for confidentiality or the impact on the inmate, or both, and furnish such summary to the inmate\u201d. The Commission, unlike the sentencing court, may not withhold without having to summarize nonfactual information (such as opinions or predictions) or information on which the Commission will not rely in making a parole determination. The court, by contrast, need only summarize \u201cfactual information ... to be relied on in determining sentence\u201d. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(B). The Parole Act\u2019s command that the Commission \u201cbear[ ] in mind the need for confidentiality or the impact on the inmate\u201d in summarizing withheld information provides the Commission with no greater discretion than is already provided by the Commission\u2019s power to decide whether given material falls within the disclosure exceptions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Finally as stated above, Congress denied the Parole Commission the discretion to permit the prisoner to retain a copy of his presentence report. Rule 32(c)(3)(D) expressly grants such discretion to the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In sum, a document created by and for the court, subject to the discretion of the court to release, is now made available (if it exists) to the Parole Commission, as a more marginal document, supplemented by more recent and perhaps more relevant data, but without discretion to release.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We come now to the critical question: is the possible effect on the sentencing process such that it can be said that Congress intended the compelled release of presentence reports under the FOIA? If so, the FOIA would permit a quick end run around the court\u2019s discretion to refuse release of the report to the defendant after sentencing. In this case, we deal with a request by a convicted offender, the subject of the presentence report, but a holding that presentence reports constitute agency records and therefore come within the mandatory disclosure requirements of the FOIA would make copies available (shortly after sentencing) not only to the subject of a presentence report, but also to any third-party requester. Journalists might want hearsay statements about the crime never used in evidence. Police departments might want details about suspected criminal activity. Scholars, researchers, and authors might want information about family background, personal relationships, and community ties. Associates of defendant might want to know if defendant or anyone else implicated them in criminal activity. The report contains in addition such items as defendant\u2019s official arrest and conviction record, any recorded contacts with the military, schools, banks, and credit bureaus, and the results of interviews with social service agencies, present and former employers, family members, friends, and neighbors. The report also typically contains medical and clinical evaluations of defendant\u2019s physical and mental health. <em>See </em>Fennell &amp; Hall, <em>supra, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. at 1624-25. Both the sources and subjects of information in the presentence report may fear significant adverse consequences from disclosure of the report to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">A convicted offender and his family may well feel jeopardized by retrospective accounts in newspapers; the offender\u2019s credit, chances of employment, reception in a given community, and personal and family morale can generally only be harmed rather than helped by open disclosure of his presentence report. Knowledge that anyone could obtain verbatim copies of the report to use (a) to obtain retraction or counterstatement or (b) to be a basis for impeaching action or (c) a basis for vindictive action would only tend to impede the free flow of information \u2014 from the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and from sources independent of the accused \u2014 to probation officers who compile presentence reports. <em>See United States v. Dingle, </em>546 F.2d at 1381; <em>United States v. Greathouse, </em>484 F.2d 805, 807 (7th Cir. 1973). There can be debate as to the gravity of the results of publicity. But there can be no dispute that the net effect on the ability of a probation officer to develop a complete presentence report is to diminish that ability and that completeness, making the reports less useful to the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">We are mindful that a holding that presentence reports are agency records would not automatically result in FOIA-compelled disclosure of presentence reports to third parties. Such a holding would merely require the Parole Commission to process FOIA requests for presentence reports. The Commission could then perhaps rely on one of the <em>nine </em>exemptions, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(l-9), to the FOIA\u2019s disclosure requirements to withhold all or part of the report. For instance, the Parole Commission\u2019s statutory authority to withhold certain categories of information from the prisoner, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c), might provide a basis for withholding such information under FOIA exemption 3. <em>Cf. Lovell v. Alderete, </em>630 F.2d 428, 434 (5th Cir.1980) (justifying withholding of parole recommendation report under FOIA exemption 3). However, exemption 3, like all FOIA exemptions, must be narrowly construed, and much sensitive material could fall on the margins of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(l)-(3) and thus might not be protected from FOIA-compelled disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">A prisoner\u2019s tax or banking history contained in a presentence report might be protected from disclosure under exemption 4, but only if such information was \u201cobtained from a person and privileged and confidential\u201d. <em>See, e.g., 9 to 5 Organization for Women Office Workers v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>721 F.2d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.1983) (information considered confidential under exemption 4 only if government shows that disclosure \u201cwill harm an identifiable private or governmental interest which the Congress sought to protect by enacting exemption 4\u201d); <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Veterans Administration, </em>301 F.Supp. 796, 802-03 (S.D.N.Y. 1969) (information obtained from inside the government not exempt), <em>appeal dismissed as moot, </em>436 F.2d 1363 (2d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">One court has suggested that an entire presentence report might be exempted from disclosure as a predecisional consultative document under exemption 5. <em>See Smith v. Flaherty, </em>465 F.Supp. at 819 n. 12. However, most courts have limited the scope of exemption 5 to protect from disclosure only those documents that reflect inter- or intra-agency \u201cgive and take\u201d during policy development. <em>See, e.g., Parke, Davis &amp; Co. v. Califano, </em>623 F.2d 1, 6 (6th Cir.1980); <em>Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, </em>617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C.Cir.1980). Presentence reports may well not fit within this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The entire report or portions thereof, if considered similar to \u201cpersonnel and medical files\u201d and if disclosure \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d, might be exempt from disclosure under exemption 6. <em>Cf. Malloy v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>457 F.Supp. 543, 545 (D.D.C.1978) (criminal history records of third parties protected under exemption 6 from disclosure). However, exemption 6 would apply only if presentence reports were considered to be similar to personnel or medical files and if the privacy interest <em>clearly </em>outweighed the-public interest in disclosure. <em>E.g., Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. United States Department of Justice, </em>405 F.Supp. 8, 11 (E.D.Pa.1975) (permitting disclosure of letters from private persons to federal parole board, despite exemption 6, because of public\u2019s interest in factors that prompted early parole of former public official).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Portions of the report that, if released, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or would divulge the identity of a confidential source might be withheld under exemptions 7(C) or 7(D), respectively. While the 7(C) \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sonal privacy\u201d exemption would at first glance appear to provide an obvious bulwark against disclosure to third parties of information in presentence reports, disclosure may nonetheless be required if the public interest in disclosure \u2014 which is significant in matters relating to crime \u2014 outweighs the prisoner\u2019s privacy interest. Exemption 7(C) only prevents <em>unwarranted </em>invasions of personal privacy. <em>E.g., Columbia Packing Co. v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>563 F.2d 495, 499-500 (1st Cir.1977); <em>see New England Apple Council v. Donovan, </em>725 F.2d 139, 143 (1st Cir.1984) (exemption 7(C) requires balancing privacy interest against public interest in disclosure). And to invoke exemption 7(D), the government must show that the source provided information to the probation officer under an express or implied assurance of confidentiality. <em>See id. </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Crooker\u2019s attorney asserted for the first time at oral argument that the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, would bar FOIA disclosure to third parties of the contents of presentence reports unless the prisoner consented to such disclosures. However, the Privacy Act by its terms cannot justify withholding information where the FOIA requires disclosure. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b)(2) (Privacy Act\u2019s consent requirement does not apply to disclosures required by the FOIA); <em>see Porter v. United States Department of Justice, </em>717 F.2d 787, 794 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Greentree v. U.S. Customs Service, </em>674 F.2d 74, 79 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Antonelli v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, </em>553 F.Supp. 19, 22-23 (N.D.Ill.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Although one or more of the FOIA exemptions <em>might </em>apply in any given case, uncertainty surrounding their scope might inhibit the free flow of information to probation officers who compile presentence reports. The likely chilling or congealing effect on the probation officer \u2014 presentence report \u2014 judicial sentencing system cannot be dissipated by any such catalogue of exceptions. The fact remains that litigation is possible following the withholding of any FOIA-covered document. Given that the exemptions should be narrowly construed to promote the FOIA\u2019s \u201cdominant objective\u201d of \u201cthe fullest responsible\u201d disclosure, <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 361-62, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1599, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976), facial applicability of an exemption cannot guarantee nondisclosure of sensitive information. The burden of proving that an exemption justifies nondisclosure remains on the agency, while the person(s) who could be adversely affected by the disclosure may not even know of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Congress has already decided that the goal of ensuring accuracy at sentencing and at parole determinations justifies at least partial disclosure of the presentence report to the defendant/prisoner, notwithstanding any concomitant reduction in the completeness of information contained in the reports. However, when Congress permitted the sentencing court and the Parole Commission to withhold certain enumerated types of information from the defendant/prisoner, Congress evidenced its desire to maintain the competing interest in completeness while requiring partial disclosure at specific times for limited durations. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c); <em>see also United States v. Woody, </em>567 F.2d 1353, 1360-61 (5th Cir.) (amended Rule 32(c) balances competing interests), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 2241, 56 L.Ed.2d 406 (1978); Fennell &amp; Hall, <em>supra, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. at 1634 (Rule 32(c)(3) represents \u201csophisticated compromise\u201d between interests in reliability and completeness). Disclosures to third parties might well sacrifice the interest in completeness without providing any compensating benefit in terms of promoting accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We therefore hold that it is inappropriate to deem presentenee reports to be agency records and thereby not only to override the judicial discretion over release given by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) and to add to the statutory discretion given the Parole Commission, but to change the longstanding rules governing the sentencing process and to threaten to erode the integ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>rity, completeness, and usefulness of the presentence report. The limited disclosure requirements that apply to the courts and the Parole Commission represent a carefully tailored compromise that evolved from many years of full debate. Any further change should come from Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Our holding does not necessarily bar Crooker from receiving a copy of his presentence report. Although Crooker may not compel disclosure of his presentence report from the Parole Commission under the FOIA, he may still request a copy of his presentence report from the sentencing court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">II. Disclosure of Medical Records</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Crooker also made a FOIA request to the Parole Commission for medical records that the Commission had obtained from the Elmcrest Psychiatric Institute, where Crooker had taken part in a drug detoxification program. The district court approved the Commission\u2019s decision to withhold these medical reports under FOIA exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), in light of the specific statutory exemption from disclosure contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(2), but ordered the Commission to provide Crooker with a summary of the Elmcrest records. Section 4208(c)(2) states that the Parole Act requirement that the Commission provide a prisoner with \u201creasonable access\u201d to documents used by the Commission in making parole determinations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b)(2), \u201cshall not apply to ... any document which reveals sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality\u201d. This confidentiality provision in the Parole Act satisfies the FOIA exemption 3 requirement that the statutory prohibition on disclosure \u201cestablishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In support of its attempt to withhold Crooker\u2019s medical records, the government submitted to the district court an affidavit and letter from Parole Commission Regional Counsel Henry Sadowski, stating that Elmcrest Psychiatric Institute had provided the records to the Parole Commission under a promise of confidentiality and that Elmcrest did not consider the records disclosable to Crooker. Based on these representations and on an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the medical records, the district court found that Elmcrest released the report to the Parole Commission only upon a promise of confidentiality. The court then held that the FOIA disclosure requirements would be satisfied by the provision of a summary of the contents of the Elmcrest records, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c) prior to parole determination hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">We have examined the <em>in camera </em>submissions. While release of the entire medical record to Crooker would clearly reveal some confidential sources, the FOIA nonetheless requires disclosure of all reasonably segregable, nonexempt portions of a record. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b); <em>County of Madison v. United States Department of Justice, </em>641 F.2d 1036, 1043 (1st Cir.1981). The summary of the medical records that the Commission provided to Crooker on September 23, 1983, pursuant to court order provides an accurate, albeit somewhat elliptical outline of the contents of the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The district court ordered the Commission to prepare the summary pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c). This subsection of the Parole Act requires the Commission to provide a summary of the contents of any material withheld from the prisoner prior to a parole determination hearing. That subsection should not govern required disclosures of partially exempt documents under the FOIA. The FOIA requirement that the requester receive all reasonably segregable data may well provide the requester with more information than he would receive if the Commission, in processing a FOIA request, had only to \u201csummarize the basic contents of the material withheld\u201d from a document that came within the \u00a7 4208(c) exemption. The latter provision governs the extent of partial disclosure in the parole pre-hearing context, not the FOIA context.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>On the record before us, it appears that the court could perhaps order the release of more of the Elmcrest records without revealing the source of confidential information contained therein. FOIA exemption 3 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c)(2) protect from disclosure only \u201csources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality\u201d, not the <em>substance </em>of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality. We recognize that in some cases the disclosure of information would implicitly disclose its source. We remand this issue to the district court to determine if no more information from the Elmcrest records could be released without disclosing the source of the information. <em>See Church of Scientology v. United States Department of the Army, </em>611 F.2d 738, 743-44 (9th Cir.1979) (remanding to district court for specific findings regarding segregability). We realize that our decision to remand may be overly formal, given that the Commission has already given Crooker much of the disclosable content of the Elmcrest records. However, since it appears that the district court applied an incorrect yardstick to measure disclosure of portions of a document that came within a FOIA exemption, only further- \u2014 and in all likelihood brief\u2014 consideration by the district court will ensure that the Parole Commission has fully complied with the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The district court may wish to seek further assistance from the parties in determining the permissible extent of further disclosure. Unless nonexempt portions are inextricably interwined with portions that explicitly or implicitly reveal a confidential source, all nonexempt information in the Elmcrest medical report should be disclosed to Crooker.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, and vacated and remanded in part; parties to bear their own costs on appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">. The order, signed on April 13, 1981, by all 10 active district court judges for the District of Massachusetts, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\"Any copy of a presentence report which the court makes available, or has made available, to the United States Parole Commission or the Bureau of Prisons constitutes a confidential court document and shall be presumed to remain under the continuing control of the court during the time it is in the temporary custody of these agencies. Such copy shall be lent to the Parole Commission and the Bureau of Prisons only for the purpose of enabling those agencies to carry out their official functions, including parole release and supervision, and shall be returned to the court after such use, or upon request. Disclosure of a report is authorized only so far as necessary to comply with Title 18, U.S.C., Section 4208(b)(2). Copies of presentence reports shall be stamped with an appropriate legend consistent with this order.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">. In <em>Forsham v. Harris, supra, </em>the Court held that an agency must \"create or obtain\u201d a record as a prerequisite to it becoming a FOIA \"agency record\u201d. 445 U.S. at 182, 100 S.Ct. at 985. The Court explained further that creation or possession was a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition. <em>Id. </em>445 U.S. at 185 n. 16, 100 S.Ct. at 987 n. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\">. The <em>Paisley </em>\"exclusive control\u201d standard has not, however, established itself as the accepted test for agency record status. The \"exclusive control\u201d test stands at odds with the D.C. Circuit's recent reaffirmation that presentence reports are agency records under the FOIA. <em>See Lykins v. United States Department of Justice, </em>725 F.2d 1455, 1458-1460 (D.C.Cir.1984). Judge Wright, who authored both <em>Paisley </em>and <em>Lykins, </em>did not mention <em>Paisley </em>in <em>Lykins </em>and instead applied the <em>pre-Paisley </em>control test of <em>Goland </em>and <em>Carson. See supra </em>at 1455. Given the joint possession of presentence reports by the courts and the Parole Commission, the creation of the reports by the courts, and the far from unambiguous allocation of control over the reports established by relevant federal statutes, it seems to us that the \"exclusive control\" test of <em>Paisley </em>is incompatible with the subsequent confirmation in <em>Lykins </em>of <em>Carson\u2019s </em>holding that presentence reports are agency records for FOIA purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\">. In deciding whether a document is an agency record, courts have considered the originating entity\u2019s role and the agency\u2019s role, if any, in creating the document. <em>E.g., Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 157, 100 S.Ct. at 972; <em>Paisley, 712 </em>F.2d 692.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. Of course, in this case the probation officer in fact prepared a presentence report and forwarded it to the Parole Commission as required. These facts do not diminish the probative value of evaluating the overall congressional scheme for treatment of presentence reports. <em>See, e.g., Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 650, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 2436, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\">.
