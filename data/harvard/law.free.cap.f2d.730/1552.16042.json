(\u201cAnchor\u201d), against the National Shopmen Pension Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fund cancelled certain employee service credits of members of the class, which resulted in a reduction of pension benefits to the class members. The district court found that the Fund\u2019s actions violated provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). <em>Stewart v. National Shopmen Pension Fund, </em>563 F.Supp. 773 (D.D.C.1983). We reverse the district court and remand the decision for consideration of other issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-23\">The National Shopmen Pension Fund is a multi-employer pension fund as defined by ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 3(2), 3(37)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Its board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>trastees is made up of three representatives of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers (the \u201cUnion\u201d) and three representatives of participating employers. The Fund was in existence prior to the enactment of ERISA, and has been modified to comply with the relevant provisions of that statute. The Internal Revenue Service has certified that the Fund is in compliance with applicable ERISA standards (J.A. 203-05).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-4\">Most of the facts are stipulated. In 1969, Anchor entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Union at Anchor\u2019s plant in Baltimore, Maryland. The agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that Anchor would begin making pension contributions to the Fund on behalf of its employees, who prior to 1969 had not been enrolled in the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-5\">As was its usual practice, the Fund, in computing pension benefits, granted full credit to all Anchor employees for the years they spent with Anchor prior to enrollment in the pension plan. These pre-enrollment credits are known as \u201cpast\u201d or \u201cprecontributory\u201d service credits. Service credits earned <em>after </em>an employer has begun contributing are known as \u201cfuture\u201d or \u201ccontributory\u201d service credits. Ordinarily, precontributory and contributory service credits are added together to determine the amount of the individual employee\u2019s pension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1622-11\">Anchor continued to make contributions to the Fund until 1979, when it closed its Baltimore plant. The closing terminated Anchor\u2019s obligations under its collective bargaining agreement. Anchor stopped making contributions to the Fund and withdrew from all participation in it. To assess the impact of Anchor\u2019s withdrawal, the Fund authorized an actuarial study by the Martin E. Segal Company (\u201cSegal\u201d). The Segal study showed that Anchor had, over the ten-year period, contributed $337,129 to the Fund. Its allocated share of Fund assets at termination was $298,912. The total vested liability of the Fund to Anchor employees was $1,049,181. Thus, the total \u201cunfunded liability\u201d \u2014 the amount of pension liability for which no one had paid anything into the Fund \u2014 was $750,268, or about 1.8 percent of the total assets of the Fund (J.A. 121,207).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">A provision of the Fund\u2019s 1976 plan permits the Fund, in cases where unfunded liability is \u201cdumped\u201d into it by an employer, to cancel the precontributory service of present and former employees of that employer. This provision, \u00a7 2.09, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1622-13\">(a) If an Employer\u2019s participation in the Fund with respect to a bargaining unit or group terminates, the Trustees are empowered to cancel any obligation of the Trust Fund that is maintained under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>Trust Agreement with respect to that part of any pension for which a person was made eligible on the basis of employment in such bargaining unit or group prior to the Contribution Period with respect to that unit or group. Neither shall the Trustees, the Employers who remain as Contributing Employers, nor the Union be obligated to make such payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1623-4\">(J.A. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">On the basis of its study, Segal recommended that the Fund use \u00a7 2.09 to cancel the precontributory service credits of the Anchor employees. The Segal report concluded that even if all precontributory service were cancelled, the Fund would <em>still </em>face an unfunded liability of $154,728, which it would have to absorb (J.A. 207). (As of 1980, the Fund had total assets of $40,700,919 (J.A. 121).) The report\u2019s recommendation was unanimously adopted by the trustees in March, 1980 (J.A. 210). All precontributory service of Anchor employees was cancelled for purposes of determining benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-6\">George Stewart and Lee Roy Warren are two of the affected Anchor employees. Stewart had been an employee of Anchor since 1940. When Anchor joined the Fund, he was granted 23 years of precontributory service for his work prior to 1969. He continued to work for another 2.7 years after Anchor joined the Fund, and then retired. His initial pension, calculated on 25.7 years of total service, was $80 per month (J.A. 114-18). Warren began working for Anchor in 1959. He had earned 10.6 years of precontributory service prior to 1969. He continued working for Anchor until the Baltimore plant closed in 1979, earning 10.4 years of contributory service. He applied for early retirement when the Anchor plant closed (J.A. 119-20), and his pension, if calculated on his 21 years of total service, would have been $89 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-8\">When the Fund cancelled the precontributory service, both Stewart and Warren suffered significant pension cuts. Stewart\u2019s pension, now calculated solely on his 2.7 years of contributory service, came to only $9 per month. Warren had his pension cut to $45 per month, calculated solely on his 10.4 years of contributory service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-9\">Stewart and Warren brought this class action, seeking to have the Fund\u2019s application of \u00a7 2.09 declared invalid and to have their full pension benefits restored. The district court held that the trustees\u2019 actions violated ERISA. There are two issues. First, as a threshold matter, is the Fund collaterally estopped from arguing the validity of its actions by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Fentron Industries v. National Shopmen Pension Fund, </em>674 F.2d 1300 (9th Cir.1982)? Second, did the action of the Fund\u2019s trustees in cancelling the precontributory service of Anchor employees violate specific procedural requirements of ERISA?</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) claim, which the district court rejected,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> depends upon the effect of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s <em>Fentron </em>decision. The plaintiffs argue that the court in <em>Fentron </em>passed on the <em>same </em>section of the <em>same </em>plan, and found it invalid. Hence, they assert, the Fund should be precluded by the <em>Fentron </em>adjudication from arguing here that the provision is valid. The plaintiffs were not parties to the <em>Fentron </em>decision. They seek to use collateral estoppel offensively under the doctrine of <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 329-31, 99 S.Ct. 645, 650-52, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-12\">Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of issues that were <em>\u201cactually </em>and <em>necessarily </em>determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973, 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) (emphasis added). The <em>Restatement </em>phrases it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-4\">When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, <em>and the determination is essential to the judgment, </em>the determination is conclusive ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982) (emphasis added). The Fund thus is precluded only from litigating issues that were actually and necessarily decided in <em>Fentron. </em>The plaintiffs assert flatly that <em>\u201cFentron </em>fully evaluated the identical rule at issue in this case and found it illegal.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 36. On the contrary, the <em>Fentron </em>court specifically refrained from holding that \u00a7 2.09 was \u201cinvalid on its face,\u201d holding only that \u00a7 2.09 <em>as applied in that case </em>violated ERISA. 674 F.2d at 1306. We therefore must determine the extent to which the acts of the trustees were held to be violations by the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">In <em>Fentron, </em>the Fund relied on \u00a7 2.09 to cancel precontributory service credits of employees whose employer had effectively withdrawn from the Fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Fund can-celled the benefits for purposes of both vesting <em>(i.e., </em>the employee\u2019s <em>right </em>to receive a pension) and calculation of benefits <em>(i.e., </em>the <em>amount </em>of the pension to which the employee has a right). Thus, if an employer in <em>Fentron </em>had 20 years of precontributory service, and 9 years of contributory service, he would be denied <em>any </em>pension because the Fund requires a minimum of 10 years of service for vesting. <em>All </em>of the employees in <em>Fentron </em>had less than 10 years of contributory service. 674 F.2d at 1306. The Fund\u2019s cancellation of benefits for all purposes thus completely divested employees of their vested right to a pension, and deprived them of pension benefits even for their contributory service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-9\">The Ninth Circuit held that such benefit divestiture, although authorized by the Fund\u2019s plan, amounted to a \u201cvesting schedule amendment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-10\">Before the cancellation of Past Service Credits, the benefits of all members of the class were vested under the 1969 Plan. The effect of cancelling Past Service Credits was to diminish the pension credits of all members, each of whom at that time had to have Past Service Credits to qualify for pension vesting under the 1969 Plan. The cancellation thus divested previously vested employees, who then would only be eligible for vesting in the future, if at all. The trustees\u2019 use of section 2.09 was therefore a <em>vesting schedule amendment </em>and, in the absence of the option to compute benefits under the 1969 Plan, is prohibited by ERISA \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). According to the <em>Fentron </em>court, the use of \u00a7 2.09 to fully divest participants changed their vested status, and hence required the Fund to use a statutory procedure that the trustees had not followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1624-12\">In the case at bar, the Fund has not attempted to <em>divest </em>the plaintiffs completely of their right to a pension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All of the class members will receive pensions,' although such pensions will be based solely on the years of contributory service. The issue in this case is whether <em>accrued benefits </em>can be reduced, not whether an employee may be completely divested. The distinction is between the <em>right to receive </em>a pension and the <em>amount </em>of the pension. We do not believe that the <em>Fentron </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>reached the question of reduction of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">There is language in <em>Fentron </em>which arguably is broad enough to cover the issue in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But to the extent that such language goes beyond the issue decided in the case, it will not bar subsequent litigation of related issues. <em>Brown v. Felsen, </em>442 U.S. 127, 139 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2205, 2213 n. 10, 60 L.Ed.2d 767 (1979); <em>Montana v. United States, supra, </em>440 U.S. at 153, 99 S.Ct. at 973. <em>See Segal v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>606 F.2d 842, 845 n. 2 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (\u201crelitigation of an issue ... is not foreclosed if the decision of the issue was not necessary to the judgment reached in the prior litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-6\">That the <em>Fentron </em>holding did <em>not </em>cover situations in which only accrued benefits are <em>reduced </em>can be seen clearly from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Elser v. I.A.M. National Pension Fund, </em>684 F.2d 648 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 67, 78 L.Ed.2d 82 (1983). <em>Elser, </em>which was decided only seven months after <em>Fentron, </em>held that a pension fund <em>could </em>use a provision substantially similar to \u00a7 2.09 to cancel precontributory service for purposes of <em>reducing </em>benefits, although the court held that such action could not be taken arbitrarily or capriciously. The <em>Elser </em>court cited <em>Fentron </em>in passing, but apparently did not consider that it addressed the issue involved in this case since it did not mention <em>Fentron </em>in connection with that issue. <em>Elser, </em>in fact, cited with approval a district court case from this circuit, <em>Central Tool Co. v. International Association of Machinists National Pension Fund, </em>523 F.Supp. 812 (D.D.C.1981), <em>appeal docketed, </em>Nos. 81-2047 &amp; -2056 (D.C.Cir. Sept. 25, 1981), which held that in an appropriate case pension funds <em>could reduce </em>benefits by cancel-ling precontributory service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-15\">In sum, we do not interpret the <em>Fentron </em>decision as holding that \u00a7 2.09 could never be applied to <em>reduce </em>benefits to employees with vested pension rights. The Fund is therefore not collaterally estopped from litigating the validity of the benefit cancellation involved in this case to the extent that they were reduced,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">We come then to the main issue in this case. Does a pension fund have the right under ERISA to use a preexisting plan provision to cancel unilaterally, for purposes of benefit computation, the precontributory service credits of employees whose employer has withdrawn from the fund? The district court relied on two grounds in holding that such cancellation violated ERISA. First, the court held that the resulting change in pension benefits to the affected employees was a \u201cvesting schedule amendment\u201d that did not comply with \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) of ERISA because the employees were not given the chance to have their benefits calculated under the pre\u201camendment\u201d formula. Second, the court found that the benefit reduction violated \u00a7 204(g) of ERISA because it had not been submitted to the Secretary of Labor for his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-6\">ERISA \u00a7 203 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is the statutory provision that sets forth the minimum vesting standards that private pension plans must meet. Generally, plans will satisfy \u00a7 203 if vested benefits become \u201cnonforfeitable\u201d upon the occurrence of certain conditions spelled out in this section.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If benefits are found to be \u201cforfeitable\u201d the pension fund does not comply with ERISA. But there are exceptions to the strict nonforfeitability requirements. Section 203(a)(3) provides that a benefit will not be considered \u201cforfeitable\u201d on the sole ground that it can be divested or reduced in certain specified circumstances. For example, subsection (a)(3)(A) allows a pension fund to terminate benefits on the death of the employee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Subsection (a)(3)(B) permits termination of benefits if the employee who is receiving the pension goes back to work under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Subsection (a)(3)(D) allows benefits to be withheld to the extent that an employee who has contributed his own money to a pension fund withdraws money from his account.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Most importantly, for purposes of this case, subsection (a)(3)(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-11\">A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>multiemployer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that benefits accrued as a result of service with the participant\u2019s employer before the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan may not be payable if the employer ceases contributions to the multiemployer plan.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adk\">Benefit reductions or cancellations carried out under \u00a7 203(a)(3) do not violate ERISA\u2019s nonforfeitability requirements. Thus, a provision permitting cancellation of precontributory service credits does not, in itself, violate the vesting requirements of \u00a7 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">The district court, however, did not believe that \u00a7 203 created an automatic right to cancel precontributory service credits. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on two other provisions of ERISA. First, the court examined \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1627-6\"><em>A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan </em>shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of [the vesting provisions] ... unless each participant having not less than 5 years of service is permitted to elect, within a reasonable period after adoption of such amendment, to have his nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan - without regard to such amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">Under this section, when a plan is <em>amended </em>to change the <em>vesting schedule, </em>employees who have more than 5 years of service must be given a choice: they may choose to have their benefits calculated under the pre-amendment or post-amendment plan formulas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">The district court found that the trustees\u2019 action in <em>cancelling </em>the service credits was an \u201camendment\u201d to the plan. The court apparently believed that any reduction in the amount of benefits paid to employees who were vested would be \u201c[a] plan amendment\u201d to the \u201cvesting schedule\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1627-11\">A plan\u2019s vesting schedule delineates the timetable by which a participant\u2019s benefits will become vested i.e. nonforfeitable. The vesting schedule in the National Shopmen Pension Plan provided that benefits were to be nonforfeitable after 10 years of service. The Trustees contend that because they did not officially change this schedule, the action they took pursuant to \u00a7 2.09 was not a vesting schedule amendment. However, because <em>the effect of defendants\u2019 actions was to alter the vested benefits of the plaintiffs, </em>the Court holds that these actions do constitute a change in vesting schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1627-12\">563 F.Supp. at 776 (emphasis added). The court quoted with approval from <em>Fentron: </em>\u201cThe Fund and its trustees cannot be permitted to do indirectly what would be prohibited if done directly by changing the vesting schedule without changing the vesting provisions of the plan.\u201d <em>Fentron, </em>674 F.2d at 1306. The district court held that the change in benefits was an \u201camendment\u201d to the vesting schedule, and the plaintiffs were entitled to have their benefits computed under the pre-\u201camendment\u201d <em>plan </em>\u2014 i.e., to receive full credit for their precontributory service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-13\">The district court also read the \u00a7 203 exemptions in light of another ERISA provision. Section 204(g) provides: \u201cThe accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section [302(c)(8) ].\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Application of the \u201camendment\u201d described in \u00a7 302(c)(8) is specifically limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1627-14\">No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary [of Labor] notifying him of such amendment and the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>retary has approved such amendment or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary unless he determines that such amendment is necessary because of a substantial business hardship (as determined under section [303(b) ]) and that waiver under section [303(a)] is unavailable or inadequate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Api\">The district court again viewed the benefit reduction resulting from the cancellation of precontributory service credits as an \u201camendment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1628-4\">It is indisputable that the Trustees\u2019 action here decreased the accrued benefits of all members of the plaintiff class. Further, the Court holds, pursuant to the same reasoning employed to find an amendment in the vesting schedule, that this reduction in benefits was the result of a plan \u201camendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">563 F.Supp. at 777 (footnote omitted). Since the trustees never submitted their \u201camendment\u201d for approval to the Secretary, the district court held the reduction of credits invalid under \u00a7 204(g). Just as in its decision under \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B), the district court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 204(g) depends entirely on its conclusion that any reduction in benefits to pension recipients is a \u201cplan amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">The plaintiffs vigorously support this interpretation. They argue that \u00a7 203(a)(3) (E) is <em>not </em>an unqualified exemption that would allow plan trustees to cancel benefits whenever unfunded liability is present, but rather a <em>substantive </em>provision, which may only be carried out through the <em>procedures </em>outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1628-14\">That ERISA may permit plans not to count past service credits, and may permit plans to cancel past service credits previously provided, does not answer the question of <em>how </em>those cancellations can be effected____ Sections 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) speak to that issue, and establish precise guidelines which must be followed when trustees seek to effect certain substantive changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1628-17\">Brief of Appellees at 25. The plaintiffs\u2019 basic position is that the exemptions listed in \u00a7 203(a)(3) \u2014 at least, the exemption in subsection (a)(3)(E) \u2014 can be exercised <em>only </em>if (1) plan participants are given a choice as to whether they are willing to have their benefits cut, <em>and </em>(2) the Secretary of Labor determines that such cuts are necessary for the survival of the plan. It is clear that the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation would severely circumscribe the ability of a multiemployer fund to cancel such credits, since it is likely that only the benefits of those employees with less than 5 years of service could <em>ever </em>be affected,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and then only if necessary to save the Fund from serious financial jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-18\">For several reasons, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-19\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-20\">We begin by examining the plain language of the provisions in question. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>infrequently, the best guide to what a statute <em>means </em>is what it <em>says. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 construction of \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) does violence to the plain language of both sections. Section 203(c)(1)(B) applies only to \u201cplan amendment[s] changing any vesting schedule\u201d; \u00a7 204(g) applies only to \u201camendment[s] of the plan.\u201d In both sections, the word \u201camendment\u201d is used as a word of limitation. Congress did <em>not </em>state that any change would trigger the two provisions; it stated that any change <em>by amendment </em>would do so. The district court found, and the plaintiffs admit, that there was no \u201camendment\u201d to the plan in the \u201ctechnical\u201d <em>sense- </em>\u2014 i.e., an actual change in the provisions of the plan. True. All that happened was that \u00a7 2.09, a provision already incorporated into the plan, was <em>applied. </em>Actions authorized by the plan were carried out by the persons authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 construction would stretch the term \u201camendment\u201d nearly to the breaking point. Under their construction, reducing <em>any </em>benefits, authorized by the plan, of persons whose rights are vested, would constitute an \u201camendment.\u201d While speculation regarding why Congress chooses specific language is not always fruitful, it should be noted that had Congress <em>meant </em>either subsection to apply to \u201cany <em>reduction </em>in benefits to vested participants,\u201d it could easily have said so. The phrases it chose, \u201c[a] plan amendment\u201d which \u201cdecrease[s]\u201d benefits or \u201cchange[es] any vesting schedule,\u201d are curious ways of saying \u201cany reduction in benefits.\u201d A resort to the legislative history does not help the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. Nothing in the history lends any credence to the construction they advocate; what history there is, though not particularly helpful, is consistent with the clear language of the subsection.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1629-8\">But we do not simply rely on the plain language of particular subsections in interpreting this statute. As the Supreme Court has noted, ERISA is a \u201ccomprehensive and reticulated statute,\u201d <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 361, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980), and each interrelated provision must be read in conjunction with other provisions to determine its meaning. It is important to read each section of this complex statute in its proper context. Analyzing \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) in light of the remainder of ERISA also indicates that the construction of the two sections advocated by the plaintiffs is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-9\">To begin with, the plaintiffs fail to distinguish between the concepts of \u201cvested rights\u201d and \u201caccrued benefits,\u201d a distinction drawn by Congress in writing the statute. The two principles are related, but different. An employee is \u201cvested\u201d in a .portion of his benefit when he has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>nonforfeitable<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> right to a given percentage of his <em>accrued benefit</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The \u201cvesting schedule\u201d specifies the time at which an employee obtains his nonforfeitable right to a particular percentage of his accrued benefit. <em>It does not provide any formula or schedule for determining the amount of the accrued benefit. </em>Thus, \"vesting\u201d governs when an employee has a <em>right </em>to a pension; \u201caccrued benefit\u201d is used in calculating the <em>amount </em>of the benefit to which the employee is entitled. The distinction between the two terms was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Nachman, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZO\">[T]he term \u201cforfeiture\u201d normally connotes a total loss in consequence of some event rather than a limit on the value of a person\u2019s rights. Each of the examples of a plan provision that is expressly described as not causing a forfeiture listed in \u00a7 203(a)(3) ... describes an event\u2014 such as death or temporary re-employment \u2014 that might otherwise be construed as causing a forfeiture of the entire benefit. It is therefore surely consistent with the statutory definition of \u201cnonforfeitable\u201d to view it as describing the quality of the participant\u2019s <em>right </em>to a pension rather than a limit on the <em>amount </em>he may collect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">446 U.S. at 372-73, 100 S.Ct. at 1731-32 (emphasis added). In its subsequent decision in <em>Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981), the Court reemphasized the difference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-10\">[T]he statutory definition of \u201cnonforfeitable\u201d assures that an employee\u2019s claim to the protected benefit is legally enforceable, <em>but it does not guarantee a particular amount or a method for calculating the benefit. </em>As we explained last Term, <em>\u201cit is the claim to the benefit, rather than the benefit itself, that must be \u2018unconditional\u2019 and \u2018legally enforceable against the plan. \u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 512, 101 S.Ct. at 1900 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Nachman, supra, </em>446 U.S. at 371, 100 S.Ct. at 1731). Under the ERISA scheme, a reduction in benefits to employees whose right to a pension in some amount remains vested is not a \u201cforfeiture.\u201d A reduction in accrued benefits, standing alone, does not affect the right to obtain benefits and thus does not affect vesting. It changes only the amount of benefits a pensioner receives, <em>not </em>his vested status. It cannot be construed as an amendment to the vesting schedule.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1630-12\">Section 203(c)(1)(B) is specifically limited to <em>amendments </em>to the <em>vesting schedule. </em>It does not purport to govern all reductions in accrued benefits. Since the reduction in accrued benefits involved in this case does not affect the vested status of any employee, \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) does not require that employees be offered a choice in benefit calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>Unlike \u00a7 203(c)(1)(B), \u00a7 204(g) is not limited to vesting schedule amendments. It <em>does </em>apply to <em>amendments </em>which affect only accrued benefits. But \u00a7 204(g) does not apply to every reduction in benefits. Congress did <em>not </em>provide: \u201cThe accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased except as prescribed in section 302(c)(8).\u201d Instead, it provided: \u201cThe accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased <em>by an amendment of the plan, </em>other than an amendment prescribed in section [302(c)(8) ]\u201d (emphasis added). The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that any reduction in benefits should be considered a plan amendment would require us to ignore the italicized language in the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-5\">That language is not surplusage. The reason for the limitation is apparent, and is entirely consistent with the remainder of the statutory scheme. Congress\u2019s chief purpose in enacting ERISA was to \u201cmak[e] sure that if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement \u2014 and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit \u2014 he actually will receive it.\u201d <em>Nachman, supra, </em>446 U.S. at 375, 100 S.Ct. at 1733. Plan trustees have fiduciary duties not only to persons like Stewart and Warren, who have retired, but to those who are now paying into the fund and will receive their promised benefits in the future. The trustees\u2019 twin obligations \u2014 distributing benefits while protecting the fund \u2014 must be balanced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1631-6\">The trustees of a pension plan have a fiduciary duty to preserve the financial security of a pension fund and to apply the assets of the fund for the benefit of the employees to the greatest extent possible. We recognize that these respective obligations are often conflicting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aol\"><em>Adams v. New Jersey Brewery Employees\u2019 Pension Trust Fund, </em>670 F.2d 387, 397 (3d Cir.1982) (footnote omitted). To give trustees the flexibility necessary for efficient operation of pension funds, Congress has recognized and provided for several situations in which plans can reduce or eliminate benefits to participants by implementing preexisting plan provisions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If Congress had drafted \u00a7 204(g) the way the plaintiffs would have us construe it, the subsection would have restricted severely the ability of the trustees to protect the fund in routine situations. In its present form, \u00a7 204(g) is specifically limited to <em>actual amendments, </em>not otherwise approved by ERISA, which would change benefit amounts. As such, it is entirely consistent with the remainder of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-9\">Our interpretation also is consistent with the apparent interpretations made by the agencies charged with administering ERISA, and with the decisions of other courts which have faced the issue. It does not appear that either the Secretary of Labor (whose approval the plaintiffs claim is <em>vital </em>to Congress\u2019s statutory scheme) or the Internal Revenue Service (which is charged with approving or disapproving plans for tax purposes) has challenged the Fund\u2019s action in this case. Neither the Secretary nor the Commissioner is claiming that \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) apply to any of the nonforfeitability exceptions under \u00a7 203(a)(3). The Secretary has not indicated that he believes that it is his duty to evaluate and approve benefit reductions made under provisions such as \u00a7 2.09 of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-10\">The Internal Revenue Service has not denied favorable tax treatment to plans which include or exercise precontributory service cancellation clauses. The I.R.S. does not treat a benefit as forfeitable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApP\">merely because an employee\u2019s accrued benefit which results from service with an employer before such employer was required to contribute to the plan is forfeitable on account of the cessation of contributions by the employer of the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.411(a)-4(b)(5) (1983).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Examples provided in the regulations discuss the limitations on cancellations of precontributory service, and they do not suggest that \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) are applicable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-4\">The courts have also interpreted the statute in this manner. In <em>Alessi, supra, </em>the Supreme Court considered pension plan provisions which permitted the fund in question to reduce benefits to a participant by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation received by the participants. Just as in this case, the <em>effect </em>of the fund\u2019s action in <em>Alessi </em>was to reduce benefits to vested participants, so this would have been \u2014 under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory \u2014 an \u201camendment\u201d to the plan. The participants in <em>Alessi </em>were not given the chance to keep their pre-\u201camendment\u201d benefit amounts, nor was the benefit reduction presented to the Secretary of Labor for his approval. But the unanimous Supreme Court held that the fund\u2019s action in reducing the benefits did not violate ERISA. <em>Alessi, </em>451 U.S. at 516-17, 101 S.Ct. at 1902-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-5\">In <em>Harm v. Bay Area Pipe Trades Pension Plan Trust Fund, </em>701 F.2d 1301 (9th Cir.1983), a pension plan enforced its rule cutting off benefits to a retired worker who took new employment. Under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, this too would be an \u201camendment\u201d which decreased benefits to an individual whose rights were vested under the plan. Authority to curtail benefits upon reemployment \u2014 like authority to cancel precontributory service credits \u2014 is found in ERISA \u00a7 203(a)(3). Like the plaintiffs in this case and in <em>Alessi, </em>the participant in <em>Harm </em>was not given the option to take his pre-\u201camendment\u201d benefits, and the Secretary of Labor did not review the fund\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, the court held that the fund\u2019s denial of benefits was proper. 701 F.2d at 1305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-9\">Other courts have construed ERISA to permit cancellation of precontributory service when necessary to avoid the dumping of unfunded liability, without suggesting that \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) were implicated. In <em>Central Tool, supra, </em>the district court invalidated the benefit cancellation at issue, but on the ground that the fund had not demonstrated th\u00e1t such cancellation was necessary to avoid the dumping of unfunded liability. The court found \u201cunexceptionable\u201d the goal of \u201cprotect[ing] the fund from the dumping of unfunded liability as a result of an employer\u2019s termination of participation after past service credits have been granted to its employees.\u201d <em>Central Tool, </em>523 F.Supp. at 816. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1632-10\">It remains for the Court to attempt to harmonize the vested status of plaintiff\u2019s employees with achievement of defendants\u2019 legitimate objective of preserving the fund from unfunded liability. The controlling guideline for effecting this reconciliation is to validate the provision to the maximum extent possible consistently with the constraint that the provisions not cause a divestment of any vested employee. This objective is best achieved by allowing the forfeiture of past service credit, pursuant to the provisions, for benefit accrual purposes, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>not for the purpose of determining vested status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1633-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 818 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1633-6\">Similarly, the Ninth Circuit in <em>Elser, supra, </em>noting that it \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the holding in <em>Central Tool, </em>found the fund\u2019s cancellation of credits to be arbitrary and capricious \u2014 the fund presented <em>no </em>evidence of <em>any </em>actuarial reason for its actions \u2014 but did <em>not </em>apply \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) to impose additional procedural requirements. The court, after quoting <em>Central Tool </em>on the importance of avoiding unfunded liability, noted that precontributory service could be cancelled to the.extent \u201cnecessary or reasonable to protect the financial stability of the fund.\u201d <em>Elser, </em>684 F.2d at 658.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1633-7\">Finally, the weakness of the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is demonstrated by its logical consequences. Since the right to cancel precontributory service credits is included in the list of exceptions in \u00a7 203(a)(3), the plaintiffs must necessarily maintain that powers granted under that section may only be exercised if \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g) are complied with.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, for example, a pension fund would have the right to cancel benefits paid to a participant with 5 or more years of service when that participant dies, \u00a7 203(a)(3)(A) \u2014 but <em>only </em>if (1) the dead participant (or, perhaps, his estate) is given the right to elect to continue receiving full benefits, <em>and </em>(2) the Secretary of Labor finds that the cancellation is necessary to assure the financial soundness of the pension fund. There is no evidence that Congress intended such an unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-11\">From our review of the provisions of ERISA and the applicable authorities, we conclude that actions which are specifically permitted by ERISA \u00a7 203(a)(3), and which are carried out under authority reserved by the pension plan without actual <em>amendment </em>of the plan, are not subject to the procedures outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1633-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-13\">Our conclusion does not dispose of this litigation. It has been held that cancel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>lations of preeontributory service, while permissible, are nevertheless subject to review to ensure that the trustees did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in cancelling benefits. <em>Elser, supra, </em>684 F.2d at 658; <em>Central Tool, </em>523 F.Supp. at 816. The plaintiffs argued in the alternative in the district court that the trustees acted arbitrarily and capriciously in cancelling the preeontributory service credits of Anchor employees. The district court, which decided the case on the basis of \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) and 204(g), did not reach this contention. At oral argument, the Fund\u2019s representatives conceded that the case should be remanded to consider whether the Fund\u2019s cancellation of credits was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-4\">We note, however, that avoiding the dumping of unfunded liability is a permissible goal of multiemployer pension funds. When a fund is obligated to pay out more money than has been paid in, and it is unable to recoup the difference, \u201c[tjhese excess benefits would have to come largely from the stepped-up contributions of current participants.\u201d <em>Harm, supra, </em>701 F.2d at 1305. Thus, to the extent that cancellation is necessary to avoid the dumping of substantial unfunded liability, it is presumptively reasonable. On remand, the district court should evaluate the evidence to determine whether there was a reasonable actuarial basis for the action of the trustees.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1634-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1634-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1621-13\">.

The Fund provides a schedule by which individual employees can calculate their expected benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1622-9\">. This \"unfunded liability\u201d results from the system under which multiemployer pension funds collect contributions and calculate benefits. Typically, when a new employer joins a fund, its employees receive precontributory service credits for the years they spent with the employer prior to joining the fund. For example, a particular employee who had worked for the employer for 20 years before the employer joined the fund would immediately receive 20 years of service credit. His pension would be based on 20 years of service even though his employer, at the time it joined, had contributed nothing to pay for that pension. This initial liability is totally unfunded. To pay for this unfunded liability, the pension fund collects on a regular basis from the employer an amount in excess of the actual cost of pension coverage for the <em>contributory service. </em>This excess amount is used over time to amortize the unfunded liability. The unfunded liability gradually is reduced by the stream of employer payments. This continuing stream is necessary to make the system work; when, as in this case, an employer withdraws after a relatively short time, its payments into the fund have not completely reduced the unfunded liability, and the fund is left with liabilities for which it has received no payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1623-7\">.

In that situation, we think that it would be unfair to the Fund to bind it forever to a decision on a question of law that the issuing court rejected only seven months later.

While employees under these circumstances <em>might </em>(at least conceivably) choose to receive benefits based on the post-\"amendment\u201d plan, it is difficult to imagine that rational employees would voluntarily give up their precontributory service credits and accept lower benefits.

Subsection (a)(3)(E) was added to the remainder of (a)(3) in the 1980 ERISA Amendments. <em>See </em>94 Stat. 1208, 1292 (1980). The various legislative materials relating to the Amendments discuss \u00a7 203(a)(3)(E).

At the same time that ERISA was amended, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to conform it to the changes in ERISA. The language of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3)(E) (1982), which is identical to ERISA \u00a7 203(a)(3)(E), was discussed in the Report of the House Ways and Means Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-6\">Under the bill, a multiemployer plan does not fail to meet the vesting requirements of ERISA merely because the plan provides for the forfeiture of accrued benefits attributable to service with a participant\u2019s employer before the employer was required to contribute to the plan in the event that the employer ceases making contributions to the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1629-11\">H.R.Rep.

In neither report is this right qualified by reference to any limitations in \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) or 204(g). Since, as noted above, such a limitation would have curtailed drastically the usefulness of subsection (a)(3)(E), that omission is suggestive. It is also significant that the provision in subsection (a)(3)(E) was put in (a)(3), which provides for routine cancellations like death and reemployment. Nothing in the legislative history of those other exceptions to the general vesting rules indicates that Congress intended to have \u00a7\u00a7 203(c)(1)(B) or 204(g) apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1630-5\">.

In 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.414(f)-1 (1983), an example is given of how a multiemployer plan could properly reduce precontributory service credits without violating ERISA. In the example, the Service would permit cancellation of precontributory service credits for an employee who had 15 years of precontributory service and 15 years of contributory service, if his employer withdrew from the plan. The I.R.S. found that the plan would not violate ERISA so long as benefits for <em>contributory </em>service are not forfeited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">[I]n order for the plan to meet the [nonforfeitability] requirements ... the plan must provide for [the employee\u2019s] accrued benefit after [the employer] ceased to be a member of the plan to be at least ...

To some extent, the unfunded liability problems that pension funds face have been eased by the 1980 ERISA Amendments, which permit pension funds to recover unfunded liability directly from withdrawing employers. (The present case is not covered by these amendments, since A.nchor withdrew in 1979.) It is true that the new provisions make it \"significantly less likely that forfeiture provisions ... will be invoked.\" Brief for Appellants at 46. But these provisions are useful only to the extent that the withdrawing employer has sufficient assets to cover the unfunded liability. If an employer is insolvent \u2014 and insolvency is, of course, a common reason for withdrawing from a fund \u2014 the pension fund will be in the same position as the Fund in this case. Thus, there will certainly be situations, even under the new provisions, where unfunded liability can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>minimized only through cancellation of precontributory service credits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1634-6\">. The plaintiffs also argued in the alternative that the cancellation of service credits violated other provisions of the plan itself. They rely on \u00a7 7.09 of the plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1634-7\">The benefits <em>to which a Participant is entitled under the terms of this Plan </em>upon his attainment of Normal Retirement Age are Vested (nonforfeitable), subject, however, to retroactive amendment made within the limitations of Section 411(a)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0K\">(J.A. 193) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs argue that \"once the participant has become eligible for a certain amount of benefits, the Trustees cannot unilaterally forfeit <em>any </em>of those benefits without violating [the plan's] nonforfeitability provision\u201d (J.A. 301). But cancellations of preeontributory service credits upon employer withdrawal do not violate ERISA\u2019s nonforfeitability provisions, and the plan specifically provides for cancellation of such credits when an employer withdraws. Section 7.09 provides that only benefits to which a participant is \u201centitled under the terms of [the] plan\u201d are nonforfeitable. Since \u00a7 2.09 specifically removes the entitlement of participants to benefits for precontributory service with a withdrawing employer, participants are not \"entitled\u201d to those benefits under the plan. There is no violation of the plan's nonforfeitability provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1634-22\">.
