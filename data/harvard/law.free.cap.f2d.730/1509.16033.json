SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">This ease involves the unsuccessful efforts of the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District (NCWCD), a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, to reopen a preliminary permit proceeding of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 7, 1981 FERC issued to a private developer, Energenics Systems, Inc., a preliminary permit to study the feasibility of and to prepare a license application for construction and operation of a hydroelectric power project on the St. Vrain Canal in Boulder County, Colorado. NCWCD, which had not participated in the proceeding, has responsiblity under Colorado law for operating and maintaining a number of water distribution facilities that provide water to the cities, towns, and agricultural irrigation interests of northeastern Colorado. The St. Vrain Canal is one of those facilities. On December 10, 1981 NCWCD petitioned FERC to reopen the proceeding, reconsider its award of the permit to Energenics, and allow NCWCD to compete for the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-12\">The bases of NCWCD\u2019s petition were NCWCD\u2019s contentions that FERC had sent it no written notice of Energenics\u2019 permit application and that Section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f) (1982), gave it a statutory right to such a written notice. NCWCD contended that, because no notice had been sent, FERC was required to reopen the permit proceeding even though the petition for reopening was filed over four months after the award of the permit and 72 days after NCWCD had learned of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-13\">FERC, without holding a hearing, rejected the petition as untimely. In a very brief and conclusory opinion FERC held that NCWCD had had sufficient \u201cactual notice\u201d to make the lateness of the petition unjustified. Because we hold that the facts, as alleged by NCWCD, show that the lateness of the petition for reconsideration was probably justified, we reverse FERC\u2019s rejection of NCWCD\u2019s petition. Our decision is based on both the clear language and the clear legislative history of Section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> FERC\u2019s failure to give written notice to NCWCD was an indisputable violation of that provision. While NCWCD\u2019s subsequent behavior was not exemplary, both its failure to quickly learn of the proceeding and its failure to quickly ascertain and act on its interests were reasonably foreseeable results of FERC\u2019s statutory violation. Indeed, the Congress that passed the written notice provision of Section 4(f) did so because it fully expected that public entities like NCWCD, if not given direct written notice, would frequently behave as NCWCD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>seems to have behaved. FERC cannot first ignore a statutory mandate that was designed to assist municipalities in their competition for permits and then declare that a municipality loses its rights for acting as Congress expected it would act without the mandate\u2019s assistance. In light of this we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">I. Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-5\">To understand this controversy, one must first understand the Federal Power Act\u2019s licensing scheme and the importance to that scheme of the preliminary permit and the statutory preference for public development and operation of hydroelectric projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-6\">To promote development of hydroelectric power and to assure that that development would serve the public interest, Congress created a licensing scheme, administered by the Commission, for construction, operation, and maintenance of hydroelectric projects. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(e) (1982). Licenses may have a duration of up to 50 years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 799. Although Commission licensing decisions are generally to be based on the policy of best \u201cdevelop[ing], consenting], and utilizing] in the public interest the water resources of the region[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 800(a), the licensing process is also structured to account for at least two related policy goals: promoting extensive data collection by applicants prior to their receipt of licenses and promoting public development and operation of hydroelectric projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-7\">Congress wanted license decisions to be made on the basis of detailed submissions that would include as much relevant data as possible. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 802. And it believed that parties would only be willing to invest in collecting extensive data if there was some likelihood of a return. Congress thus empowered the Commission to issue preliminary permits for durations of up to three years that would entitle the holder to a priority at the license application stage and would thus give the prospective applicant sufficient security to invest in data collection and arrange financing. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 797(f), 798. Permit holders would be preferred over other license applicants so long as their plans are \u201cat least as well adapted * * * to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(h)(1) (1983). Indeed, even where a competing applicant has a superior plan the permit holder is entitled to be informed of \u201cthe specific reason why its plan is not as well adapted\u201d and to be given \u201ca reasonable period of time\u201d to bring its plan up to the level of the competitor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.33(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-9\">Congress also adopted a policy favoring public ownership of hydroelectric power projects. It required the Commission to give a preference to \u201cStates and municipalities\u201d over private developers in all preliminary permit proceedings, license proceedings in which there is no prior permit, and license proceedings after the expiration of an earlier license. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 800(a) (1982). In any such proceeding a state or municipality must receive the permit or license if its plan is at least as well adapted to serving the public\u2019s water resource interests as the plan of the private parties. <em>Id. </em>Where a private party\u2019s plan is superior, a state or municipality is entitled to be informed of the specific deficiencies and to be given a reasonable period of time to make its plan \u201cat least as well adapted as the other plans.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(h)(4) (1983). But in spite of the preference for public ownership, once a permit is issued, whoever has the permit has priority at the licensing stage over all competitors, be they public or private. <em>See Washington Public Power Supply System v. FPC, </em>358 F.2d 840, 847 (D.C.Cir.1966), <em>rev\u2019d and vacated on other grounds sub nom. Udall v. FPC, </em>387 U.S. 428, 87 S.Ct. 1712, 18 L.Ed.2d 869 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">As one might expect, this scheme focuses attention on the issuance of preliminary permits. At that stage a government entity entitled to a statutory preference must use that preference to get a permit or forever lose its statutory advantage to a private permit holder. Congress designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>the written notice requirement of Section 4(f) to assure public entities\u2019 ability to participate in the permit stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-4\">Section 4(f) of the Act authorizes the Commission to award permits, provided that it first issues two kinds of notices. First, the section mandates \u201c[t]hat upon the filing of any application for a preliminary permit * * * the Commission, before granting such application, shall at once give notice of such application in writing to any State or municipality likely to be interested in or affected by such application!!]\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f). Second, the section mandates that the Commission \u201cshall also publish notice of such application once each week for four weeks in a daily or weekly newspaper published in the county or counties in which the project or any part thereof or the lands affected thereby are situated.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Both provisions seem to reflect a congressional desire to facilitate interested parties\u2019 knowledge of and possible participation in Commission proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first notice provision, however, was primarily intended to allow states and municipalities to assert and thus protect their statutory preferences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This case examines the consequences of FERC\u2019s failure to provide that required written notice to a municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">On February 10, 1981 Energenics filed an application with FERC for a preliminary permit to study the feasibility of developing a hydroelectric project on the St. Vrain Canal at Station 497 + 30. The Canal, which transports water from Carter Lake, is 9.8 miles long and is part of an elaborate transmountain water diversion project known as the Colorado-Big Thompson (CBT) System. The CBT System was constructed and is primarily operated by the United States Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) and serves to transport water from the western slope of the Rocky Mountains to the more arid eastern slope and plains of Colorado. The Bureau owns the St. Vrain Canal, but the Canal is operated and maintained entirely by NCWCD under a 1957 agreement with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-11\">On May 6, 1981, almost three months after Energenics filed its application, FERC issued two types of notices of the application. First, FERC entered a notice in the Federal Register. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. 36156 (May 11, 1981). That notice announced and described Energenics\u2019 proposal and it stated that the application was on file with the Commission for public inspection. It also gave the address of Energenics\u2019 president, explained that a copy of the application could also be obtained from him, and specified the procedure to be followed by those desiring to file comments, protests, petitions to intervene, or competing applications. The deadline for receipt of these filings was set as July 9, 1981, although those desiring to file competing applications could protect their rights by filing a simple \u201cnotice of intent\u201d by July 9, to be followed by a competing application no later than September 9, 1981. <em>Cf. </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(a)-(d) (1983). The location of the project was given simply as \u201con the St. Vrain Canal.\u201d No more specific location was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-12\">Also on May 6, 1981 FERC sent letters to state and municipal entities. The content of these notices was the same as that published in the Federal Register, but a map was attached to specify exactly where on the Canal the project was to be located. It is unclear who received these letters, but it is undisputed that one was not sent to NCWCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>On May 19, 1981 FERC also published a notice, identical to that published in the Federal Register, in a local newspaper. It was republished on May 26, June 2, and June 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">On August 7, 1981 FERC ordered that a preliminary permit be issued to Energenics. No competing applications had been filed, and \u201c[n]o party or agency commenting on the application objected to issuance of the permit.\u201d Order Issuing Preliminary Permit, Record (R.) at 28, Joint Appendix (JA) 19. FERC also stated that the order would be final unless appealed within 30 days. R. 31, JA 22. No timely appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">We should briefly discuss what NCWCD did learn and do prior to its December 10, 1981 petition to reconsider. NCWCD first learned that Energenics had filed an application for a permit relating to a project on the St. Vrain Canal when a member of NCWCD\u2019s Board of Directors saw the notice published in a local newspaper on June 9, a little more than one month after notices to other government entities were issued and one month prior to the deadline for comments and notices of intent to file competing applications. NCWCD responded to this published notice by trying to ascertain the exact location of the proposed project, and to do this it contacted the United States Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation, which owned the Canal and with which NCWCD had an established working relationship. Unfortunately, the Bureau gave NCWCD an incorrect location. After examining that location, NCWCD concluded that it was not a feasible site and thus decided not to challenge Energenics\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-6\">After Energenics received its permit, it began to contact various government entities as part of its feasibility study. One of the entities contacted was NCWCD. On September 29, 1981, at a meeting with Energenics, NCWCD for the first time realized the correct location of the proposed project. This realization prompted NCWCD to begin investigations into the feasibility of and its interests in a project at that location, and into its legal rights with respect to the matter. On November 13, 1981 NCWCD\u2019s Board of Directors resolved to petition FERC to reopen the proceeding and to submit a competing permit application. On December 10, 1981 NCWCD filed its petition for reconsideration and reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-11\">After receiving a response from Energenics and a reply memorandum from NCWCD, but without holding hearings or making findings of fact, FERC, on February 8, 1982, issued a short order rejecting NCWCD\u2019s petition. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-12\">No good cause has been shown why Northern Colorado's petition[,] filed four months after issuance of the Director\u2019s order, should now be considered. Northern Colorado complains that it did not receive direct notice of the proposed project, but admits it received actual notice through a local newspaper that Energenics\u2019 application was pending. Northern Colorado claims that it did not take action to protect its interests because it received from the Bureau of Reclamation erroneous information pertaining to the location of the proposed project. However, after determining the proper location of the proposed project, Northern Colorado waited 72 days before filing its petition for reconsideration. Northern Colorado\u2019s petition for reconsideration is therefore rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-13\">Order Rejecting Petition for Reconsideration, R. 81, JA 65, <em>reprinted at </em>18 FERC (CCH) \u00b6 61,098.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 26, 1982 NCWCD petitioned for rehearing, and on March 25 FERC rejected that petition. FERC stressed that it had rejected the earlier petition as untimely and would adhere to its practice of not entertaining petitions for the rehearing of an order denying reconsideration. Notice Rejecting Petition for Rehearing, R. 284, JA 79. NCWCD then petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>III. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-4\">FERC first raises questions regarding this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Section 313 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825/ (1982), provides that this court has jurisdiction over the orders of the Commission when a petition for review has been filed with us by \u201cany party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 825l (b). The section also provides, however, that this court shall not consider a petition unless the party had previously raised the objections in an application to the Commission for rehearing or \u201cunless there is reasonable ground for failure to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the statute, a party may apply for a rehearing by the Commission \u201cwithin thirty days after the issuance\u201d of a Commission order. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 825l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">FERC argues that because NCWCD was not a party to the permit proceedings, and because it filed no application for rehearing within 30 days of the permit issuance, NCWCD\u2019s petition to this court is improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-6\">Although not literally \u201ca party,\u201d NCWCD\u2019s inability to become a party is precisely the basis of its objection. It would be grossly unfair to deny judicial review to a petitioner objecting to an agency\u2019s refusal to grant party status on the basis that the petitioner lacks party status. Such a petitioner must obviously be considered a party for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s basis for denying party status. <em>See Public Service Comm\u2019n of N.Y. v. FPC, </em>284 F.2d 200 (D.C.Cir. 1960). Similarly, it would be unfair to declare the denial of an untimely effort to reopen a proceeding to be unreviewable, when the basis of the effort is the contention that, because a required notice was not given, a timely objection was infeasible. As Judge Wilkey wrote for this court in <em>City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d 927, 938 (D.C.Cir.1979), where \u201ca complainant was not a party to the agency proceeding, and * * * [where] a complainant objects to the agency\u2019s failure to give notice[,] ' * * the proper course is to seek reconsideration by the agency. If the matter is reopened, any ensuing final order then may be reviewed in accordance with the review statute. If[,] on the other hand, the agency for any reason declines to reopen the matter, that decision itself would be a statutorily reviewable order.\u201d <em>See also Investment Co. Institute v. Board of Gov. of FRS, </em>551 F.2d 1270, 1280-1283 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Gardner v. FCC, </em>530 F.2d 1086 (D.C.Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-8\">In this case NCWCD followed the procedure set out in <em>City of Rochester. </em>It petitioned for reopening and its petition was rejected. That rejection is a statutorily reviewable order under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825l, and NCWCD met all statutory prerequisites to review with respect to that order. The issue we review is therefore \u201cthe agency\u2019s reasons for not reconsidering its earlier order.\u201d <em>City of Rochester, supra, </em>603 F.2d at 938. The standard, of course, is whether the Commission\u2019s \u201caction was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Investment Co. Institute, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 1281, <em>quoting </em>Section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-9\">IV. FERC\u2019s Statutory Obligation to Give NCWCD Written Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-10\">At the center of this controversy is the contention that FERC breached its statutory obligation to give NCWCD individualized written notice of Energenics\u2019 permit application. Obviously, if FERC had no such duty, NCWCD\u2019s untimeliness cannot be excused. FERC and Energenics both contend that no breach of statutory duty occurred. In our view this is clearly wrong. FERC ignored the statute. Indeed, from its representations in its brief and at argument it appears that a conscious refusal to obey the statute\u2019s clear language has been a longstanding, though previously unannounced, policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-11\">A. <em>NCWCD\u2019s Status Under the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">The statutory command that \u201cthe Commission * * * shall at once give notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>of [a permit] application in writing to any * * * municipality likely to be interested in or affected by such application!]]\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f), was intended to benefit government entities like NCWCD. In Section 3(7) the statute defines \u201cmunicipality\u201d as \u201ca city, county, irrigation district, drainage district, or other political subdivision or agency of a State competent under the laws thereof to carry on the business of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(7). NCWCD was, at the time notices were given, a \u201cmunicipality\u201d under the Act. Although Colorado law had not granted NCWCD authority to generate electricity for wholesale sales until just after FERC\u2019s notice of Energenics\u2019 permit application, NCWCD had long since been granted authority to generate, distribute, and sell electricity for operation of its own works and facilities. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 37-45118(1)(k) (1973 &amp; 1981 pocket part), as amended by Act of May 18, 1981 known as Senate Bill No. 105. While its status as a municipality also might conceivably be based on its similarity to an \u201cirrigation\u201d or \u201cdrainage\u201d district, it is clear that its authority to \u201cdevelop, transmit, utilize, and distribute\u201d hydroelectric power places NCWCD within the literal language of Section 3(7).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">Assuming the correctness of NCWCD\u2019s allegations of fact, it also seems clear that NCWCD was \u201ca municipality likely to be interested in or affected by [Energenics\u2019] application.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f). Since 1938 NCWCD has operated under an agreement with the United States which empowers it to distribute water from the CBT System, and the St. Vrain Canal is an important part of NCWCD\u2019s system for distributing that water. Moreover, under an amendment to that agreement NCWCD took over the St. Vrain Canal in 1957 and is responsible for operating and maintaining the Canal. Especially since NCWCD\u2019s right to operate the Canal is revocable should it not adequately maintain it, NCWCD would certainly have an interest in any construction of a hydroelectric project on the Canal. Finally, its interest could adequately be based on its own authorization to develop and utilize electric power.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-8\">B. <em>FERC\u2019s Refusal to Follow the Act\u2019s Clear Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-9\">FERC\u2019s decision not to send written notice to NCWCD was not the result of any specific determination regarding NCWCD\u2019s status under the Act. Instead, FERC asserts that, pursuant to a reasonable and consistently followed interpretation of Section 4(f), it has never given written notice to \u201cirrigation districts], drainage district^],\u201d or similarly specialized political entities. FERC\u2019s interpretation of Section 4(f), we are told, has always been that the provision required no more than the procedure described by the Commission\u2019s Executive Secretary in 1921, when he appeared as a witness before the House Select Committee on Water Power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-10\">We advertise in a newspaper, the newspaper with the largest circulation in every county affected by the project. We notify by letter the governor of the State and the head of every State department that is interested in waterpower development. We notify authorities and the mayor of any municipality in reach of the project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\"><em>Proposed Amendments to the Federal Water-Power Act: Hearing Before the Select Committee on Water Power of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number><em>House of Representatives on H.R. 14469, H.R. 14760, and H.R. 15126, </em>66th Cong., 3d Sess. 89 (1921) (statement of O.C. Merrill, Executive Secretary, Federal Power Commission). FERC argues that Mr. Merrill\u2019s statement should be treated as a contemporaneous agency interpretation of the statute, and FERC asserts that it has consistently followed Mr. Merrill\u2019s interpretation. FERC also explains that \u201c[i]n referring to mayors, Mr. Merrill thus drew a distinction between governments on the local level which typically have mayors <em>{e.g., </em>towns, cities, and villages) and those which typically do not <em>{e.g., </em>water authorities, drainage districts, irrigation districts). Only the former group received written notice.\u201d Brief for respondent at 21. The latter group, in FERC\u2019s view, would have to rely on the newspaper notices or the Federal Register notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">FERC supports its position by citing to \u201cthe general proposition that considerable respect is due the interpretation given [a] statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d Brief for respondent at 19, <em>quoting Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, 100 S.Ct. 790, 797, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As FERC argues, a \u201cconsistent and longstanding interpretation by the agency charged with administration of the Act, while not controlling, is entitled to considerable weight.\u201d Brief for respondent at 20, <em>quoting United States v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, </em>422 U.S. 694, 719, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 2442, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975). For a number of reasons, however, this well established principle of administrative law cannot validate what the Commission has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">We stated in <em>Obremski v. OPM, </em>699 F.2d 1263, 1269 (D.C.Cir.1983), that the limit placed on the judicial role by an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute \u201cassumes an adequately articulated administrative decision interpreting the relevant statutory law within a range of reasonableness.\u201d FERC\u2019s interpretation of Section 4(f) fails both for its unreasonableness in light of the statutory language and legislative history and for the inadequacy of its articulation by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-8\">1. <em>The Act\u2019s language.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-9\">The Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.

GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). In this case the statute first provides that the Commission \u201cshall at once give notice of [a preliminary permit] application in writing to any State or municipality likely to be interested in or affected by such application)!]\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f) (1982). Second, it defines \u201cmunicipality\u201d as \u201ca city, county, irrigation district, drainage district, or other political subdivision or agency of a State competent under the laws thereof to carry on the business of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 796(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-10\">The statutory definition of \u201cmunicipality\u201d thus expressly includes those entities that FERC now contends it can expressly exclude in interpreting the notice provision. Moreover, although a requirement of written notice is generally understood to mean personal notice, <em>see NLRB v. Vapor Recovery Systems Co., </em>311 F.2d 782, 785 (9th Cir.1962), FERC argues that certain types of municipalities should have to rely on general public newspaper and Federal Register notices, even though the statute specifically states that they are entitled to \u201cnotice[s] * * in writing.\u201d In addition, although the statute is unambiguous and, using the word \u201cshall,\u201d is written in \u201cthe language of command))]\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of American Railroads v. Costle, </em>562 F.2d 1310, 1312 (D.C.Cir.1977), FERC views itself as free to exercise broad flexibility in deciding what meets its obligation to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-11\">2. <em>The legislative history.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-12\">The statute says \u201cshall,\u201d but FERC argues that two statements from the brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>House of Representatives debate on the provision show that great flexibility was intended. FERC first cites to a statement made by Representative Sinnott, the provision\u2019s sponsor. Responding to a suggestion that the Commission be required in each permit proceeding to demand proof that proper notices were mailed and published, Representative Sinnott stated that he did not want things to become \u201ctoo complicated,\u201d that he preferred that the provision be \u201cdirectory rather than jurisdictional,\u201d and that the matter should \u201crest with the Commission.\u201d 56 Cong.Rec. 9763 (August 30, 1918). FERC\u2019s second citation is to a comment by Representative McLaughlin, who criticized the proposed provision by arguing that \u201cto require notice to the counties interested or affected by\u201d a project would present problems because \u201c[i]t would be difficult for anyone at the beginning of a project to know what counties are affected or may later be affected.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\">For a number of reasons these quotes from legislative floor debate do not persuade us to deviate from the statute\u2019s clear language. Neither statement is unambiguous. Representative Sinnott was responding to a suggestion that the Commission, in its proceedings, should, as a jurisdictional prerequisite, have to demand and receive proof that proper notices were sent. The discussion may thus have only concerned the issue of whether proof of the notices should be required; it was not necessarily concerned with whether the sending of the notices should be required. Similarly, Representative McLaughlin\u2019s complaint, which was never directly answered or discussed, may have been directed at the newspaper publication requirement as contained in the initial proposal. Indeed, an amendment on that subject was immediately offered and adopted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-7\">In any case, the significance of such comments from legislative floor debates is limited, not only because of such clear statutory language, but also because \u201c[t]he remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history. [Even the sponsor\u2019s] statement must be considered with the Reports of both Houses and the statements of other Congressmen.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1722, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-8\">In this case material from the Conference Report supports the statute\u2019s plain meaning. One difference between the Senate and House versions of the Federal Power Bill was over whether public notice and notice to government entities should be provided when there were license applications. The Conference Report spoke in \u201cthe language of command.\u201d It stated that the final bill \u201cprovides that upon the filing of any application for a license which has not been preceded by a preliminary permit under [16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f) (1982)], notice <em>shall be given and published as required </em>by the proviso of said subsection.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 910, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1920) (emphasis added). State<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>ments in a conference report, because commended to the entire Congress, carry greater weight than comments from floor debates by individual legislators. <em>See American Jewish Congress v. Kreps, </em>574 F.2d 624, 629 n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>see also Vitrano v. Marshall, </em>504 F.Supp. 1381, 1383 (D.D.G.1981) (\u201cPerhaps the most useful document illuminating Congressional purpose is a Conference Report which bears on the final draft that is used by the conferees in explaining to the entire Congress why the bill should pass.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\">Although there are very few comments on the notice provision in the general legislative debate, at least one supports the clear meaning of the language and the interpretation of the Conference Report. Senator Phipps, concerned that the bill gave too much preference to municipalities, made clear that his understanding was that the provision was a mandatory directive to the Commission. <em>See </em>59 Cong.Rec. 1173 (January 7, 1920) (\u201cit is not only the privilege but the duty of the commission in case of a filing to call the attention of a municipality which might be interested therein to that filing\u201d). No one disputed this understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-5\">3. <em>The Merrill statement\u2019s inadequacy as a contemporaneous agency interpretation consistently applied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1587-6\">Just as we must reject FERC\u2019s reliance on legislative history to justify its practice with respect to the municipal notice provision, we must also reject its assertion that the 1921 comment by the Commission\u2019s Executive Secretary while testifying to a House committee amounted to the type of contemporaneously articulated and consistently followed agency interpretation to which we would owe deference. It has long been accepted that an important factor to be considered in giving weight to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it enforces is \u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all of those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). Where the agency has shown little evidence of the reasoning that went into its contemporaneous position, that position has been accorded little deference. <em>See Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 287 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. 566, 573 n. 5, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978). Here, not only is there no reasoning contained in the statement offered by the agency as its contemporaneous understanding of the statute, there is no clear evidence of the statement\u2019s meaning, its completeness, or even its status as an authoritative construction of the statute in the view of the agency or, indeed, in the view of the official who made it. In fact, the Commission has not even been able to show this court any evidence that it has so much as referred to this statement, much less relied on it as policy, at any point in the more than 60 years since the statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-8\">The 1921 statement contained no reasoned interpretation, or even a mention, of the statute\u2019s notice provision. It was a brief and general, matter-of-fact description of then-current agency practice. The reason for the statement\u2019s brevity and generality is clear from the statement\u2019s context. The hearing was simply not focused on the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s particular parts. It was concerned with the personnel needs of the Commission and with the question of how extensive the Commission\u2019s authority to hire personnel should be. Specifically, the hearing was on a bill to authorize the Commission to hire personnel for the first time. The statement cited as authoritative by the Commission was in response to a general question that was directly concerned with neither the notice provision nor the Commission\u2019s personnel needs; it was concerned with whether the Commission had sufficient statutory power to conduct permit and license hearings and to open them to all interested parties. The statement was simply a part of a short answer that generally described the Commission\u2019s then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>current practices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such a statement was not likely to have been intended or understood as an authoritative construction of a statute\u2019s meaning, nor could it serve as such. <em>Cf. SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 117-119, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 1711-1712, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); <em>Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 287 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. at 574 n. 5; <em>Robzen\u2019s Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Housing, </em>515 F.Supp. 228, 235 n. 12 (M.D.Pa.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\">Even if we were willing to view the statement by Executive Secretary Merrill as an authoritative statement of the Commission\u2019s contemporaneous understanding of its statutory responsibility, the statement would not necessarily help FERC\u2019s position. Apart from the fact that FERC seems never to have publicly stated its subsequent adherence to the statement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the statement itself is unclear and easily understood as far more in conformity with the statute\u2019s plain meaning than is FERC\u2019s present position. Merrill stated that he sent letters to \u201cthe head of every State department that is interested in water power development,\u201d a vague classification that would not obviously exclude specialized \u201cmunicipalities\u201d like NCWCD. Whatever the Commission practice may have been, Merrill\u2019s statement of that practice revealed nothing approximating the Commission's current cavalier willingness to ignore the statute\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-9\">4. <em>The Merrill statement\u2019s inadequacy as an indication of legislative acquiescence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-10\">FERC\u2019s other argument that relies on the Merrill statement can similarly be rejected. FERC argues that the statement put Congress on notice of the Commission\u2019s interpretation and thus Congress, by not amending the statute, acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>See </em>brief for respondent at 21. This theory is unpersuasive for all the reasons discussed above, and also because there is no reason to believe that Congress was generally aware of the statement. The Supreme Court has said: \u201cWe are extremely hesitant to presume general congressional awareness of the Commission\u2019s construction based only upon a few isolated statements.\u201d <em>SEC v. Sloan, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 121, 98 S.Ct. at 1713. And the <em>Sloan </em>statement was made in a case where the argument for congressional knowledge and approval was somewhat better than it is here. In <em>Sloan </em>a congressional committee had apparently recognized and approved of the commission practice at issue. <em>See id. </em>at 119-120, 98 S.Ct. at 1712-1713.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-11\">5. <em>The Merrill statement\u2019s inadequacy as a reasonable rule of procedure necessitated by practical considerations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-12\">FERC\u2019s last argument is somewhat different. The Commission argues that prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>tical considerations of limited resources and administrative feasibility require that the agency be given the latitude necessary to pursue the statutory scheme. In effect, it argues that strict adherence to the statute\u2019s language would be administratively impossible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-4\">[N]otice to municipalities is an area which necessarily requires administrative flexibility. For example, in administering the statute, even with regard to cities and towns, the Commission must define what constitutes a potentially \u201cinterested or affected\u201d municipality, language which on its face may include [a] large number of governmental units. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdG\">Brief for respondent at 21-22. Given this need for flexibility, FERC contends, its practice of failing to notify \u201cspecialized municipalities\u201d is reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-5\">There exist in the United States an estimated 50,000 specialized local governmental units performing a myriad of services. Unlike states, counties and cities, many of these governments, such as water, utility or drainage districts, are not readily identifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-7\">Although we sympathize with FERC\u2019s practical concerns, we must reject its contention that those concerns can justify the Commission\u2019s practices. Any administrative approach developed would have to be adequately articulated and within a range of reasonableness with respect to Congress\u2019 instruction. <em>Cf. Obremski v. OPM, supra, </em>699 F.2d at 1269. We have already discussed the unreasonableness of current FERC practices in relation to Congress\u2019 language and goal, and the inadequacy of the Merrill statement as an interpretation of congressional intent. When offered as a rule of administrative practice demanded by practical necessity, the statement suffers from the same flaws as well as an additional deficiency. \u201c[I]n such a case the agency must, at a minimum, let the standard be generally known so as to avoid both the reality and the appearance of arbitrar[iness].\u201d <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1072, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Those relying on the procedures set out in a statute have a right to know that those procedures are being given less than their clear meaning. Here, FERC seems never to have made a public statement that clearly purports to explain its notice policies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-10\">V. The Consequences of FERC\u2019s Failure to Give NCWCD the Required Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">Having established FERC\u2019s statutory obligation to NCWCD, we still need to determine the consequences of FERC\u2019s breach of that obligation. In its rejection of NCWCD\u2019s petition for reconsideration, and more emphatically in its arguments to this court, FERC emphasized two points. First, the Commission argues that on June 9, 1981, prior to the close of proceedings, NCWCD received \u201cactual notice\u201d when one of its Directors saw the last of the newspaper notices. In FERC\u2019s view this was sufficient to negate NCWCD\u2019s challenge. Second, and more important, FERC argues that NCWCD admits having received all relevant information by September 29, 1981, and yet it waited until December 10 to seek reopening. FERC argues that that delay alone would merit rejection of the reopening petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>A. <em>The Assertion That NCWCD Received \u201cActual Notice\u201d Through the June 9 Newspaper Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">We reject the argument that the observation by one member of NCWCD\u2019s Board of Directors of the June 9 newspaper notice gave NCWCD sufficient \u201cactual notice\u201d of Energenics\u2019 application. It is undisputed that that notice did not contain the precise location of the proposed project and that NCWCD called the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior to find that information. It is also undisputed that the Bureau gave NCWCD incorrect information and that as a result NCWCD chose not to pursue the matter. FERC, however, argues that it certainly had no statutory obligation to give in its municipal notices more information than it actually gave in its published notice, and thus any statutory violation was harmless. Moreover, FERC argues that the published notices directed that inquiries be made either to the Commission or to Energenics \u2014 and not to the Bureau \u2014 and thus it cannot be held responsible for NCWCD\u2019s receipt of incorrect information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">We need not decide whether the notice published in the newspaper and the Federal Register would have been sufficient to fulfill FERC\u2019s Section 4(f) municipal notice obligation had it been sent out as a direct municipal notice. The fact is that FERC did mail a notice to some government entities pursuant to the municipal notice provision and that that notice, unlike the published version, did specify the exact location of the project. FERC implicitly made a determination that that information was appropriate for government entities, and NCWCD was statutorily entitled to that same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">We also need not go into great detail analyzing the degree of clarity of the published notice or the degree of reasonableness of FERC\u2019s response. It is enough to note that the notice did not unequivocally direct inquiries to either FERC or Energenics. At various points the notice stated: first, that Energenics\u2019 application was on file and available for public inspection \u201cwith the Commission\u201d; second, that \u201c[cjorrespondence with the [ajpplicant should be directed to\u201d Energenics\u2019 president, whose address was listed; third, that \u201c[aj copy of the application may be obtained directly from the [ajpplicant\u201d; and fourth, that any filings should be sent, in the required form, to the Commission and to the applicant. NCWCD responded by contacting the Bureau of Reclamation, which owned the relevant land and with whom NCWCD had an established relationship. Its goal was not to obtain a copy of the application, but only a very basic and simple piece of information. On its face, it does not seem unreasonable to have expected Bureau to have known it. We can thus conclude that the reading of the June 9 notice did not make harmless FERC\u2019s failure to fulfill its statutory obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-8\">A legislature, in order to take into account the particular circumstances and protect the particular interests of certain potential parties, may surely mandate that an administrative agency give them notices in a specific manner. That legislative power would be made meaningless if an agency could freely ignore the mandated manner to the recipient\u2019s harm. Because here NCWCD did not receive the same actual knowledge from the published notice that it would have received from the direct municipal notice, and because that deficiency may have made a difference in its failure to participate in the proceedings, FERC\u2019s failure to comply with the statute was not clearly made harmless by any \u201cactual notice\u201d received by NCWCD before the permit was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-9\">B. <em>FERC\u2019s Contention That NCWCD\u2019s 72-Day Delay Made the Petition Untimely</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-10\">All parties agree that on September 29, 1981 NCWCD learned the actual location of Energenics\u2019 proposed project from Energenics itself. This knowledge prompted NCWCD to begin the process of, first, evaluating that location to decide if it had the interest and capacity to compete with Energenics for the right to construct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>and operate a project there; second, determining its legal rights and strategies concerning such competition; and third, preparing the legal papers for its petition to reconsider and reopen. At its monthly meeting on November 13, 1981 the NCWCD Board of Directors authorized NCWCD to file a competing application, and on December 10, 1981 (72 days after learning of the location) NCWCD petitioned for reconsideration of the permit issuance and for reopening to permit filing of a competing application. Without a hearing, FERC rejected the petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">Because this case comes to us lacking any factual findings, we cannot decide the issue of whether the 72-day delay was reasonably excusable, but for a number of reasons we must reverse FERC\u2019s decision that, assuming the truth of all facts alleged by NCWCD, the petition was still inexcusably untimely. In reaching this conclusion we are not holding that waiting such a long period of time is generally acceptable in efforts to reopen an administrative proceeding. That is clearly not the case. But this case involves a number of special circumstances. We are influenced by the time limits contained in FERC\u2019s own practice, by the legislative history of the Federal Power Act\u2019s notice provision, and by the particular facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-6\">The significance of NCWCD\u2019s 72-day time period should in part be evaluated in light of the time periods given to parties in FERC\u2019s own proceedings. We assume that those periods reflect FERC\u2019s views of how long various tasks and decisions should reasonably take. In this case FERC first issued notices of Energenics\u2019 application on May 6, 1981 and listed July 9,1981 (64 days later) as the last date for comments, protests, or petitions to intervene. The notices also explained that anyone interested in filing a competing application could, under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(b) &amp; (c) (1983), protect that interest by filing, on July 9, a relatively simple notice of intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission would then give them until September 8, 1981 (126 days after the initial notice) to prepare and file the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-11\">In evaluating the significance of the 72-day time period, it is relevant to ask what sort of behavior Congress deemed foreseeable in the absence of proper notice. Thus it is relevant that Congress\u2019 passage of the municipal notice provision seems to have been motivated by the belief that it was needed because the types of entities within the statute\u2019s definition of municipality would be unable to easily recognize their interests and quickly act on them. This seems to have been the point of the provision\u2019s sponsor as he explained its purpose to the House of Representatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-12\">It is well known * * * that municipalities and public officials are often very dilatory and that they sleep upon their rights. It seems to me it is wise to provide that as soon as an application is filed by any person or corporation that notice shall be at once given to the various municipalities, which mean the county, city, irrigation district, drainage district, or other political division of the State * * *. This will bring knowledge directly home to the * * * officials and give them an opportunity to present their application if they desire public or municipal ownership, where otherwise the matter would be entirely overlooked and snap judgment would be taken against them * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A92B\">56 Cong.Rec. 9762 (August 30, 1918) (statement by Representative Sinnott). Of course, this recognition by Congress cannot mean that once notice is deficient a municipality can learn the relevant information and then freely sleep on its rights. But it should influence the evaluation of a municipality\u2019s behavior, since a municipality should not lose its rights if its response was within congressional expectations. Congress seems not to have expected .municipalities to be able to file competing applications with exemplary promptness after casually or informally coming upon the nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>essary information, and this factor should at least lead us to look at the issue with some flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">Given these factors, we must conclude that the decision to reject NCWCD\u2019s petition for reopening, reached as it was without a hearing or any fact-finding, was an abuse of discretion. For a number of reasons the passage of 72 days, in and of itself, cannot sustain FERC\u2019s conclusion. FERC\u2019s own procedures allow a municipality which receives proper notice to take more than 60 days to reach a decision on whether it wants to compete. At that point it need only file a simple notice of intent to gain approximately 60 more days for preparing its application. Most important, the notice sets out the exact procedure to follow, the exact due dates, the option of protecting interests with a notice of intent, etc. Thus potential parties need not expend time and effort determining what is expected of them. The facts here, in contrast, presented NCWCD with the information in a piecemeal fashion and placed it in the situation of having to argue a theory of reopening that appeared never to have publicly arisen before. FERC\u2019s regulations did not explain what constituted proper notice, nor did they explain what a municipality in NCWCD\u2019s position was expected to do. Although FERC here argues that all NCWCD would have had to do was file the simple notice of intent, no public statement by the Commission stated that this would have been appropriate. Given the fact that the petition was less than two weeks late, as compared with FERC\u2019s normal period for requiring the short notice of intent, given that this sort of delay and confusion was what Congress expected and thus sought to avoid by requiring direct, unambiguous, written notice, and given that FERC placed NCWCD in a position in which neither FERC\u2019s stated procedures nor its piece-dents gave NCWCD any clear guidance, we find it an abuse of discretion to have denied the petition on the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-8\">We reverse FERC\u2019s conclusion that 72 days was so untimely that, even if the explanation offered was true and complete, it would not be reasonable. FERC may of course hold hearings at which NCWCD may be required to prove the facts in its allegations. And, of course, at such hearings NCWCD\u2019s allegations may be examined, impeached, or cast in a different light by new facts, and as a result NCWCD\u2019s behavior may be found to have been unreasonable. But such a finding would have to be based on NCWCD\u2019s failure to prove its factual contentions or on the presentation of significant new facts not currently before us. On the facts contained in the record before us, FERC could not have validly reached that determination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxL\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">.

Representative McLaughlin initially phrased his critique in terms of the requirement of \"notice to the counties interested in or affected by\u201d a project. This left the object of his critique ambiguous: <em>i.e., </em>was it the municipal or the newspaper notice provision? The former notice provision included the word \"interested\u201d but did not mention \"counties,\u201d and the latter referred to \"counties\" but only used the word \"affected.\u201d Representative McLaughlin\u2019s principal concern, however, was in requiring the Commission to predict which counties would ultimately be affected by a project. He felt that many projects might affect distant counties and that predicting a project's ultimate effect would be hard. These concerns would have been less pressing with respect to the municipal notice provision since that provision, written in less absolute terms, applied only to those entities \"likely\u201d to be affected. In any case, the matter was disposed of when Representative Anderson responded by offering an amendment making the newspaper notice provision only applicable to counties \"in which the project or any parts thereof or the lands affected thereby are situated.\" 56 Cong.Rec. 9762 (Aug. 30, 1918).

We have been directed to no published Commission statements purporting to explain general municipal notice policies, or even to any prior Commission references to the Merrill statement. The only statement of municipal notice policy seems to be a recent FERC opinion \u2014 issued after the proceeding in this case\u2014 which rejected the appeal of a town located one mile from the proposed project. FERC simply stated that its policy has been to notify towns only if they had at least 5,000 population and were located within 15 miles of a proposed project. The appellant was a town of less than 5,000. <em>City of Idaho Falls, </em>20 FERC \u00b661,066 (1982). Although the validity of the policy followed in <em>Idaho Falls </em>is not before us, we note that it runs counter to at least the literal wording of the Merrill statement. That, combined with the fact that no reference was made to the Merrill statement (or any other prior Commission statement of policy), makes us doubt that the Merrill statement has been as consistent a policy guide as the Commission contends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1591-7\">.

Intervenor Energenics has raised the issue of prejudice, arguing that the equities favor not reopening because it had relied on its receipt of the permit and so expended significant amounts of time and money during the 72-day period. But the simple fact of Energenics' losses cannot prevent a reopening. NCWCD is asserting a right given by statute and undermined by the Commission. Any prejudice that resulted from delays that followed reasonably or foreseeably from the Commission\u2019s misdeeds cannot be a basis for denying reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\">Energenics\u2019 contention, however, does point out the importance of rapidly resolving this dispute. Because of FERC\u2019s refusal to take seriously a provision of its underlying statute, the development of a worthwhile water project has been needlessly delayed and the interests of both Energenics and NCWCD have been injured and kept in a state of uncertainty. Moreover, because of FERC\u2019s behavior, there is a chance of further litigation as rights are disposed of with finality prior to even the issuance of a license <em>(i.e., </em>if NCWCD is once again denied the ability to reopen or, if the proceeding is reopened, when one party is denied the permit on the merits).

In reaching that conclusion, however, I disagree with much of the majority\u2019s analysis \u2014 primarily its apparent eagerness to decide several substantial issues in the complete absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>of any factual record. I agree that the Conservancy District\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true for purposes of this appeal, but I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s apparent determination to decide some of the underlying substantial issues as if the facts asserted by the Conservancy District in its brief were facts developed on a record after a hearing. It is elementary that \u201c[n]o court should decide an issue that has not been properly clarified and no court should decide any question without needed facts.\u201d 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 25:11 (2d ed. 1983). This restraint is designed to \u201cprevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to <em>protect the agencies from judicial interference.\u201d Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (emphasis added). Accepting allegations as true for purposes of deciding this appeal and remanding the case is one thing, but accepting them as true for purposes of deciding how the Commission should decide the case on remand after hearing is something else entirely. We have no authority to do the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">I concur generally that <em>for purposes of this appeal </em>the Conservancy District can <em>now </em>be considered a \u201cmunicipality <em>likely </em>to be interested ... or affected\u201d (emphasis added) by the Energenics project. But I cannot agree that this necessarily can be transformed into a decision that on <em>May 6, 1981, </em>when the Commission sent out the notices, the District was \u201clikely to be interested\u201d in a project the size and character of Energenics\u2019 proposal. May 6, 1981, was <em>before </em>the Colorado statute was amended to permit Conservancy Districts to <em>wholesale </em>power, and there is strong circumstantial evidence that the passage of the amendment may have been the <em>only </em>event that placed the District in the \u201clikely\u201d status. When the Commission sent out the notices the District did not have authority to wholesale power, and this is a fact from which it might be inferred that the District was <em>not </em>a municipality likely to be interested. Insofar as it might be likely to be \u201caffected,\u201d the published notice, by designating the \u201cSt. Vrain Canal,\u201d might be considered as giving all the notice that was necessary to alert the District that operated the St. Vrain Canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-9\">It is not clear that the Conservancy District was, in fact, a \u201cmunicipality likely to be interested\u201d in Energenics\u2019 petition <em>on the date </em>that the Commission\u2019s notices were sent out to municipalities. As of that date, Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 37 \u2014 45\u2014118(j) provided that the District had the authority to \u201cconstruct, operate, and maintain ... power plants.\u201d But \u00a7 37 \u2014 45\u2014118(k) specifically provided that this was a power limited to its own \u201cworks and facilities\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-10\">Nothing provided in this article shall be construed to grant to the district or board the power to generate, distribute, <em>or sell </em>electric energy, except for the operations of the works and facilities of the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">(Emphasis added.) The Conservancy District did not receive \u201cauthority to generate electricity for wholesale sales\u201d until May 18, 1981 \u2014 just after FERC had mailed its notices of Energenics\u2019 permit application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Majority at 1516. The majority and the parties agree that the Conservancy District had authority before that date to \u201cgenerate, distribute, and sell electricity for operation of its own works and facilities,\u201d Majority at 1516, but there is nothing in this record to support a conclusion one way or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>the other that with such limited authority it was \u201clikely to be interested\u201d in constructing, for its own purposes, a project of the character or size proposed by Energenics. In fact, the present application, which seeks to wholesale the power developed, may be <em>some </em>indication that it was <em>not </em>interested in producing power within the limitations of the prior statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\">Assuming that it had some limited authority before the May 18 legislative amendment, it does not follow inexorably that the Conservancy District was therefore a municipality \u201clikely to be interested\u201d in building a 2.1 MW power plant, the only apparent purpose of which would be the generation of electricity for wholesale. The majority points out that the Conservancy District has been treated as a municipality in two other proceedings, but does so without admitting that <em>both </em>of these permits were granted <em>after </em>the May 18 legislative amendment, which was passed <em>after </em>the notices were sent to municipalities in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">In fact, the first recorded instance of the Conservancy District\u2019s interest in building facilities of this magnitude came on May 5, 1981, the day before notice of Energenics\u2019 application was issued. Perhaps aware of the likely passage of the pending amendment by the Legislature, the Conservancy District applied on that date for a permit to \u201cutilize an existing dam\u201d to build a generating unit at another location for <em>wholesale use. Mitchell Energy Co., </em>16 FERC \u00b662,180 (Aug. 5,1981). The proposed facility was a 2 MW generating plant with an annual output of 4,000,000 kWh, but the \u201cplan [was not] based on detailed studies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Conservancy District announced that it planned to sell the power to Public Service Company of Colorado or another retail utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-8\">The next year, the Conservancy District filed for another permit in <em>Energenics Systems, </em>19 FERC 11 62,573 (1982). The permit in that case involved a 5.2 MW facility, with an annual capacity of 7,000,000 kWh. The Conservancy District stated that it would sell the power to Public Service Company of Colorado. Both permits were eventually awarded to the Conservancy District well after the effective date of the 1981 amendment of the Colorado statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-9\">The Conservancy District\u2019s sudden interest in developing facilities for the <em>outside </em>sale of power \u2014 after having apparently applied for no such permits in the first 40 years of its existence \u2014 might be considered as implicit proof that it had neither the authority nor the interest to build such facilities prior to May 18, 1981. But it is impossible, on the record before us, to reach that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">On remand, it is my view that the <em>Commission, </em>which now has the benefit of this court\u2019s construction of the notice provision, should decide whether or not the Conservancy District was a \u201cmunicipality likely to be interested\u201d in competing for Energenics\u2019 permit at the time the notices were sent out.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If not, the Commission\u2019s failure to give notice would be harmless, unless it had an affirmative duty to sent notice <em>after </em>learning of the 1981 amendment by the Colorado Legislature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-4\">The majority dismisses out of hand the argument that the Conservancy District\u2019s admitted actual knowledge of the contents of the published notice on June 9 was sufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s notice requirement: \u201cWe can thus conclude that the reading of the June 9 notice did not make harmless FERC\u2019s failure to fulfill its statutory obligation.\u201d Majority at 1522. The majority is willing to concede that at <em>some </em>point actual knowledge renders the provision of written notice superfluous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The question then becomes <em>when </em>did the Conservancy District\u2019s board have sufficient knowledge of the Energenics\u2019 application that it should have begun taking steps to protect its interest? Did it have sufficient knowledge\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1595-5\">1. When the board became aware of the published notice on June 9?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1595-6\">2. When the board received a letter from Energenics in late August pinpointing the exact location of the proposed facility at a specific station on the 9-mile canal?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1595-11\">3. When the board met with Energenics on September 29 and was told again the exact location of the proposed facility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1595-12\">Or was it on some other date? The majority, without the necessary <em>facts </em>before it, apparently makes the substantive holding that notice was plainly insufficient as of the first date. That, however, is a fact that must be the subject of determination at the hearing. (The minutes of the meetings of the District\u2019s board of directors might cast some light on this issue and others.) The majority ignores the second date, which should not be done. It selects September 29 as the date on which the Conservancy District received the actual notice required by the statute, holding that the failure to specify exactly <em>where </em>on a 9-mile canal the project would be located rendered the published notice fatally defective, at least as applied to the Conservancy District. Majority at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>The majority relies on the fact that the Commission <em>did </em>send maps to other municipalities; from this, the majority extracts an \u201cimplicit[ ] ... determination\u201d that a map was necessary to properly advise governmental units of the project\u2019s location. Majority at 1522. The majority offers no support for the proposition that notice to <em>A </em>is defective if notice to <em>B </em>contains extra information not included in the notice to <em>A. </em>On the contrary, <em>A </em>is entitled to such notice as will reasonably apprise it of the nature and location of the project in question, regardless of what information <em>B </em>gets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-4\">By incorporating this implicit determination \u2014 which the Commission strenuously denies making \u2014 the majority rather neatly avoids a problem that simply cannot be resolved on this deficient record: how much information was it necessary to include in the notice to inform the Conservancy District of its rights? That question is the key to whether or not the board\u2019s <em>actual knowledge </em>of the published notice was sufficient. It requires a hearing and determination of relevant facts. It cannot be evaded by reliance on an entirely unsupported proposition such as that A\u2019s notice is defective because <em>A </em>did not get the map that <em>B </em>received.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1596-5\">The statute in question requires that the Commission \u201cat once give notice of such application in writing\u201d to interested municipalities that qualify. It does <em>not </em>specify how specific the notice must be. Ordinarily, in administrative procedures where personal notice is necessary, administrative agencies \u201care governed by the same basic requirements of fairness and notice,\u201d including \u201cspecificity of notice and opportunity to respond,\u201d as are courts. <em>Hess &amp; Clark v. FDA, </em>495 F.2d 975, 984 (D.C.Cir. 1974). \u201cThe basic principle [is] that a party is entitled to such notice as will provide reasonable opportunity to prepare .... \u201d 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 14:11 (2d ed. 1980). \u201cThe notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1596-9\">The notice received by the Conservancy District was either sufficient to apprise it of the necessary facts, or it was not. Notice sent to other interested parties is irrelevant. Under <em>Mullane, </em>the adequacy of notice requires a factual inquiry. On remand, the Commission should be permitted to determine at what point the Conservancy District had sufficient notice of the Energenics application. Contrary to the implication discerned by the majority, the Commission has <em>not </em>done so. In that investigation the August letter should not be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-11\">Finally, with regard to the Conservancy District\u2019s admitted 72-day delay, even after it had all possible knowledge, I agree with the majority that the absence of factual findings makes it impossible to tell \u201cwhether the 72-day delay was reasonably excusable.\u201d Judging by the District\u2019s knowledge of Commission procedure demonstrated in its <em>Mitchell Energy </em>application prior to May 5, 1981, it may be doubted that the District has any justifiable excuse for the delay here. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>As for the majority\u2019s discussion of the delay issue, it is simply gratuitous advice to the agency that exceeds our appellate authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>In sum, I would remand to the Commission for a hearing to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1597-4\">1. Whether or not the Conservancy District, in view of its statutory inability to wholesale power and in light of this court\u2019s construction of the notice provision, was entitled to personal notice at the time the notice was sent out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1597-5\">2. At what point the Conservancy District had sufficient actual knowledge of all the information to which it was entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1597-6\">3. Whether the Conservancy District\u2019s delay after it received all of the knowledge to which it was entitled was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1597-7\">4. The proper remedy to be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1597-8\">5. If the District\u2019s application is to be considered timely, whether it is to be required to recompense Energenics for such loss as it suffered through the delay of the District.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1597-9\">In my opinion, this court should not issue substantive rulings on these issues until after the Commission has developed a factual record sufficient to provide a reasoned basis for our decision. At present, the court has ruled substantively on several issues on the basis of <em>mere allegations </em>by the Conservancy District. To rule substantively thereon is improper judicial procedure for an appellate court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">.

The majority states that the Conservancy District might be an \"interested\" municipality merely because it operates the canal in question. Majority at 1516. The purpose of the municipal preference, however, is not to provide notice to municipalities which may generally be interested in keeping informed, but to alert municipalities which may wish to compete for the permit in question. I fail to see how Congress\u2019s avowed purpose \u2014 to encourage municipal power development \u2014 would be furthered by requiring the sending of notices to municipalities which lack authority or desire to develop power, on the sole ground that they might like to know. The notice provision was expressly designed to give notice to municipalities so that they would have \"an opportunity to present their application if they desire public or municipal ownership.\u201d 56 Cong.Rec. 9762 (Aug. 30, 1918) (statement of Rep. Sinnott). I believe that the statute requires notice only to those local entities with the actual authority <em>at the time </em>to compete for the permits in question. The Conservancy District's authority as of the time the Commission sent out notices of the Energenics application thus is critical to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1594-12\">.

Brief of Petitioner at 8 n. 8. The majority ignores this statement, but further development of this point seems necessary in order to judge the reasonableness of the Conservancy District\u2019s delay. Is the applicant to be held responsible not only for the Commission\u2019s failure to give the District notice with a map, but also for the possible negligence of the District in not examining a complete notice that was placed before its very eyes by the applicant? That might be considered as placing a premium on compounding negligence. The Conservancy District in August, 1981, cannot be considered as a novice in such matters, as the record indicates it had filed an application for a preliminary permit, under identical circumstances to the present case, on May 5, 1981, following the application by Mitchell Energy Co. on November 17, 1980. Piggybacking on applications of others and presenting plans after considerable delay was not a new tactic for the District. <em>See </em>Mitchell Energy Co., 16 FERC \u00b662,180 (Aug. 5, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1596-6\">. Relying on the reasoning of the majority, it could be pointed out that the Commission also \"implicitly ... detcrmin[ed]\u201d that notice to the general public, which also is demanded by the statute, did <em>not </em>require greater specificity than that provided by the published notice. The statute can be searched in vain for any indication that municipalities are entitled to more exact or more detailed notice than the general public. I believe the statute provides that municipalities and the rest of the public are entitled to the <em>same </em>information \u2014 but that municipalities are entitled to have it sent to them while the public must read it in the papers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1596-13\">. I would reject any suggestion that the notice required by this particular statute must somehow be more exact or more detailed than the notice required by any other statute in which Congress has provided for personal service on interested parties. The statutory notice requirement at issue in this case is no more specific than the notice requirements that govern adjudications under the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(b) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
