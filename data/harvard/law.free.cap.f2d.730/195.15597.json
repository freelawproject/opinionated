(\u201cVencedora\u201d), a Panamanian corporation and the owner of the vessel M/V KAPETAN MARCOS, N.L., brought this action against defendants Compagnie Nationale Algerienne De Navigation (C.N. A.N.) (\u201cCNAN\u201d), an instrumentality of the Algerian government, and the Republic of Algeria to recover for the loss of its vessel. Vencedora\u2019s claim is brought under Fed.R. Civ.P. 9(h), allowing maritime claims, and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (\u201cFSIA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Vencedora's action against defendants because it lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On October 27, 1980, the KAPETAN MARCOS sailed from the Port of Sidi Kerir, Egypt, laden with a cargo of approximately 70,000 tons of Arabian crude oil en route to Coronna, Spain. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on October 31, 1980, there was a fire in the crews\u2019 quarters of the vessel. With the vessel about 280 miles from Palermo, Sicily and about 170 miles from Bejaia, Algeria, the officers and crew abandoned ship and were rescued by the T/V ESSO CAMBIA, which took the survivors to the Port of Annaba, Algeria. CNAN, an Algerian owned corporation that supervises Algeria\u2019s harbor and coastal tugs, ordered its tugs to render salvage assistance to the KAPETAN MARCOS. Upon the tugs\u2019 arrival at the scene, KAPETAN MARCOS\u2019 managing agent ordered that the ship be towed to Palermo, Sicily. CNAN, however, ordered its tugs to tow the vessel to the Algerian Port of Bejaia, and the tugs complied with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">When the KAPETAN MARCOS arrived in Bejaia, her value in this damaged condition was between $3 and $3.5 million, and her cargo had an estimated value of about $18.5 million. A dispute soon developed between CNAN and the owners of the ship and cargo- over the sum that should be posted in Algeria as security for CNAN\u2019s salvage services. At the request of CNAN, representatives of both hull and cargo, together with their English solicitors, went to Algeria in November 1980 to negotiate the amount of the bond to be posted for release of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">CNAN first demanded $27 million in security for its salvage services, a sum well in excess of the value of the salved property. By the end of the November negotiations, CNAN was demanding that $15.75 million be posted in Algeria as security while the English solicitors offered to post security in the amount of $5 million in Algeria or $15.75 million in a neutral forum, such as France or the United Kingdom. These proposals were rejected and CNAN proceeded with a seizure for security of the KAPETAN MARCOS and her cargo by application to the Bejaia Court, Commercial Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">The Algerian Minister of Transportation and Director General of the Merchant Marine ordered the vessel removed from the port because it constituted a threat to public safety. In late November or early December 1980, pursuant to court order, the KAPETAN MARCOS, together with her cargo, was towed by CNAN tugs from Bejaia, Algeria, to the Port of Arzew, Algeria. On December 21,1980, a storm hit the Port of Arzew. The KAPETAN MARCOS, which had been under the control of the Algerian authorities since she was first brought to Bejaia, Algeria, in November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>1980, went aground. The vessel\u2019s engine room flooded and Vencedora believes that the vessel has sustained additional body damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">On January 14, 1981, Vencedora\u2019s representatives received a telex from the Algerian government stating that the vessel had become a \u201cwreck\u201d within the terms of the Algerian Maritime Code. On March 16, 1981, the Algerian government informed Vencedora\u2019s agent in London that its requests for the removal of KAPETAN MARCOS from the Algerian maritime area had not been honored and that the procedures for the stripping of Vencedora\u2019s rights had commenced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 17, Vencedora replied that CNAN had made it impossible for the owners to remove the vessel and its cargo from the Algerian maritime area. Upon Vencedora\u2019s failure to remove the wreck, its ownership rights in the vessel were declared forfeited under the Algerian Maritime Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, to date, the wreck has not been removed and the sale procedure provided by the Algerian Maritime Code has not commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Vencedora alleges that CNAN and the Algerian government have tortiously deprived it of its vessel and have \u201ccaused and permitted [the vessel] to become a constructive, total loss.\u201d The defendants filed a motion to dismiss (1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction under the FSIA; (2) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and (3) on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The district court granted the 12(b)(1) motion, holding that the defendants were immune from the jurisdiction of the court under the FSIA. Vencedora had argued that the defendants were not shielded by the Act because their conduct had caused them to fall within the \u201cexpropriation\u201d exception to immunity under the FSIA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(3). The court found this sub-section to be inapplicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">There is no question that rights in property allegedly taken in violation of international law are at issue in this action. However, there is no indication that the M/V KAPETAN MARCOS N.L., or any property exchanged for the vessel, is \u201cowned or operated\u201d by the Defendants. Because none of the narrow exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of foreign states delineated in the Act applies to the case, this Court reluctantly determines that it lacks jurisdiction____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">The court later denied Vencedora\u2019s motion for rehearing, holding that the first clause of the \u201ccommercial activities\u201d exception in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>section 1605(a)(2) was also inapplicable. Vencedora now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Vencedora makes two objections to the district court\u2019s decision. First, Vencedora contends that the lower court erred in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cause of action by reason of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) of the Act. Second, Vencedora contends that the district court erred in holding that neither the KAPETAN MARCOS nor property exchanged for it was \u201cowned or operated\u201d by CNAN and Algeria under section 1605(a)(3). We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY The FSIA was enacted to bring a degree of unity to the disposition of legal claims against foreign governments by removing the executive branch as the arbitrator of such claims and entrusting that responsibility to the judiciary. Prior to the enactment of the Act, the federal courts\u2019 power to assert jurisdiction over foreign states was controlled by two theoretically distinct doctrines: absolute sovereign immunity and \u201crestrictive\u201d sovereign immunity. <em>See.generally </em>Cardoza, <em>A Note On Sovereign Immunity, </em>17 Va.J.Int\u2019l.L. 491 (1977); Lauterpacht, <em>The Problem of Jurisdiction Immunities of Foreign States, </em>28 Brit.Y.B. Int\u2019l.L. 220 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Until 1952, the State Department usually requested immunity in all actions against friendly foreign sovereigns:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in the so-called \u201cTate Letter,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the State Department announced its adoption of the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory of sovereign immunity. Under this theory, immunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s pub-lie acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s strictly commercial acts. <em>See Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 1968, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983). In suits where a foreign state attempted to invoke absolute immunity as a defense, the executive branch examined the foreign state\u2019s activity, and the courts\u2019 grant of immunity turned on the outcome of the State Department\u2019s categorization of the conduct giving rise to the complaint. <em>See Victory Transport, Inc. v. Comisaria General de Abastecimientos y Transportes, </em>336 F.2d 354 (2d Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 934, 85 S.Ct. 1763, 14 L.Ed.2d 698 (1965). <em>See also, Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, </em>324 U.S. 30, 65 S.Ct. 530, 89 L.Ed. 729 (1945); <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U.S. 578, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014 (1943); <em>Spacil v. Crowl, </em>489 F.2d 614 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">With its accommodation of diplomatic and political concerns, the State Department often lacked consistency, measured in legal terms, in applying the restrictive theory of immunity. <em>See Verlinden, supra, </em>at 1968. In response, the Departments of State and Justice proposed the FSIA to Congress. Passed in 1976, the FSIA codified the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity and attempted to provide a uniform statutory procedure for establishing subject matter and personal jurisdiction over foreign sovereign entities. Through the FSIA, Congress intended to eliminate the role of the State Department in the determination of the scope of foreign sovereign immunity and provide a regularized remedy against foreign commercial entities. <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6604. <em>See also Verlinden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The FSIA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> grants sovereign immunity to foreign states,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> their agencies and instrumentalities, except as otherwise provided by the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is personal jurisdiction when foreign states are served with adequate notice as specified in the Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and when subject matter jurisdiction is present. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) (1982). Under section 1330(a), subject matter jurisdiction is present whenever the foreign state enjoys no immunity from the claim as provided in sections 1605-1607, the listed exceptions to immunity! These exceptions establish in certain specified types of cases the necessary contacts that must exist before United States courts can exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Vencedora argues that the district court had jurisdiction under section 1605(a)(3), the \u201cexpropriations\u201d clause, providing for jurisdiction over certain cases involving \u201cproperty taken in violation of international law,\u201d and under section 1605(a)(2), providing for jurisdiction over certain cases relating to the commercial activities of a foreign state. We turn to these sections, noting that the party claiming FSIA immunity bears the burden of proving their nonapplicability. <em>See Arango v. Guzman Travel Advisors Corp., </em>621 F.2d 1371, 1378 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\n<em>Section 1605(a)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Vencedora first argues that the district court erred in failing to find subject matter jurisdiction under the first clause of 1605(a)(2). Section 1605(a)(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or the States in any case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">(2) in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">Vencedora contends that the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of the unrelated continuing business CNAN does in the United States. CNAN does not deny that it does continuing business in the United States, but asserts that jurisdiction under this clause results only where the cause of action arises from the business activity carried on in the United States. Because there is no nexus between CNAN\u2019s commercial activity and Vencedora\u2019s claim, we find that the district court properly dismissed Vencedora\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">Despite strong congressional intent to promote uniformity in decision making through judicial application of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2), judicial readings of this clause have not been consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ent. Courts of appeals and district courts have announced widely varying formulations of the jurisdictional scope of this clause, and these formulations may be divided into four categories: (1) a \u201cliteral\u201d approach; (2) a \u201cnexus\u201d approach; (3) a bifurcated literal and nexus approach; and (4) a \u201cdoing business\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">A description of the first category, that favoring a literal approach, is contained in <em>Gibbons v. Udaras, </em>549 F.Supp. 1094 (S.D. N.Y.1982), where the court said: \u201cRead literally, \u2018clause 1\u2019 requires that the cause of action be directly \u2018based upon\u2019 the defendant foreign state\u2019s commercial activity in the United States, not merely \u2018based upon\u2019 an act performed by the defendant \u2018in connection with\u2019 that commercial activity. Thus it is arguable that, where the defendant foreign state has carried on a commercial activity in the United States, clause 1 confers subject matter jurisdiction over a cause of action based upon an act performed <em>in the United States </em>in connection with that activity, but not over a cause of action based upon an act performed <em>abroad </em>in connection with that activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109 n. 5 (emphasis in original). This literal reading of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) was rejected by the <em>Gibbons </em>court, and, on the rare instances where it has been applied by district courts, it has been repudiated by the circuits. <em>See infra Sugarman v. Aeromexico, Inc., </em>626 F.2d 270 (3d Cir.1980). <em>See also Gemini Shipping v. Foreign Trade Organization for Chemical &amp; Foodstuffs, </em>647 F.2d 317, 319 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The test set forth by the D.C. Circuit in <em>Gilson v. Republic of Ireland, </em>682 F.2d 1022 (D.C.Cir.1982), seems to fall between a literal and a pure nexus approach. In <em>Gilson, </em>the court stated that \u201c[sjection 1605\u2019s \u2018based upon\u2019 standard is satisfied if plaintiff can show a direct causal connection between [the foreign entity\u2019s commercial activity in the United States] and the [acts] giving rise to his claims ..., or if he can show that [the commercial activity] is an element of the cause of action under whatever law governs his claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027 n. 22. Although the court made this statement in the context of interpreting the second, rather than the first, clause of section 1605(a)(2), its sweep has led at least one court to hold that the <em>Gilson </em>court\u2019s definition of \u201cbased upon\u201d applies to all three clauses of \u00a7 1605(a)(2). <em>See Gibbons v. Udaras na Gaeltachta, </em>549 F.Supp. 1094, 1109 (S.D.N.Y.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The Third Circuit has adopted a nexus approach more broad than either a literal approach or Gilson\u2019s requirement that the commercial activity in the United States constitutes or directly causes the occurrence of an element of the cause of action. <em>See Velidor v. L/PG Benghazi, </em>653 F.2d 812 (3d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 929, 102 S.Ct. 1297, 71 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982), and <em>Sugarman v. Aeromexico, Inc., </em>626 F.2d 270 (3d Cir.1980). In <em>Sugarman, </em>the plaintiff alleged that an extended delay at the Acapulco airport before the departure of his Aeromexico flight back home to Newark caused him heart problems. The court found jurisdiction under the first clause of section 1605(a)(2), but apparently the fact that \u201cAeromexico operations in New York ... plainly constitute \u2018commercial activity carried on in the United States\u2019 \u201d was not enough. Instead, the court looked for a nexus between Aeromexico\u2019s commercial activity in the United States and Sugarman\u2019s grievance. In finding subject matter jurisdiction, the court found a nexus between the plaintiff's grievance and Aeromexico\u2019s commercial activity from the fact that the delayed flight that was bound for New York City was the return portion of a round-trip flight, and because Sugarman had bought his tickets at a travel agency in New Jersey. 626 F.2d at 272-73. <em>See also Gemini Shipping, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In adopting a \u201cnexus\u201d approach, the <em>Sugarman </em>court specifically rejected the literal reading given to the first clause by the district court in dismissing Sugarman\u2019s claim. The court reasoned that Congress would have been clearer had it wanted to require that \u201cthe particular misconduct complained of take place \u2018in the United States,\u2019 \u201d since Congress had been clear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>adopting such a requirement in the second clause of section 1605(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 273. The second clause excepts from immunity an action \u201cbased ... upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere.\u201d The court also relied on the fact that such a limitation would be expected and perhaps required in light of due process considerations when, as in the second clause, the underlying commercial activity takes place outside the United States. But this would not be the expectation when, as in the first clause, \u201cthe acts complained of, although themselves extraterritorial, grow out of \u2018a regular course of commercial conduct,\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(d), which was \u2018carried on in the United States,\u2019 \u201d for in such a case obviously there are no due process problems. 626 F.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">An example of the remaining category, that applying a \u201cdoing business\u201d test, is <em>Rio Grande Transport, Inc., </em>516 F.Supp. 1155 (S.D.N.Y.1981), although the court did not specifically refer to its interpretation by that name.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Rio Grande </em>involved a collision in the Mediterranean between a vessel owned by CNAN, and an American-owned ship. The CNAN vessel maintained regular service between northern European ports and Algeria, and on this particular voyage was bound from Algeria to West Germany. Since the acts complained of had no particular nexus to the United States, the first clause applied only if jurisdiction could be based on CNAN\u2019s worldwide shipping activities, which had substantial contact with the U.S. The <em>Rio Grande </em>court reasoned that Congress\u2019s broad definition of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d as including a \u201cregular course of commercial conduct\u201d meant that \u201cCongress apparently did not intend to require that the specific commercial transaction or act upon which an action is based have occurred in the United States or have had substantial contact with the United States; only the broad course of conduct must be so connected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1162. The court reasoned that a broad interpretation of \u201cregular course of commercial conduct\u201d was \u201cconsistent with \u2018Congress\u2019 goal of providing access to the courts to those aggrieved by the commercial acts of a foreign sovereign,\u2019 \u201d and therefore found clause one subject matter jurisdiction based on CNAN\u2019s business in the United States. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300, 313 (2d Cir.1981)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We believe that the Third Circuit\u2019s nexus interpretation of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) is sound and therefore adopt it as our own. We note first that this clause cannot mean what it literally says. \u2019 <em>See Sugarman, supra </em>at 273. A literal reading of the clause would require the act complained of to occur in the United States; \u201cthe drafters of the FISA intended no such niggardly construction.\u201d <em>Gemini Shipping v. Foreign Trade Organization for Chemicals &amp; Foodstuffs, </em>647 F.2d 317, 319 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">That clause one is not as restrictive as it literally appears, however, does not force us to read it is broadly as Vencedora urges. We regard a nexus approach simply as a more effective means of carrying out the goal of requiring a connection between the lawsuit and the United States that the language of clause one appears to embody. A \u201cdoing business\u201d test, on the other hand, focuses on the connection between the defendant and the United States; by definition it requires no specific connection between the lawsuit and the United States. Since, as the dissent notes, a \u201cdoing business\u201d test is more controversial internationally than a nexus test, we think it likely that Congress specifically intended not to include \u201cdoing business\u201d as one of the commercial activity exceptions, and did so in part through its restrictive wording of clause one. We note further that section 1605(a)(3), the expropriation exception, clearly embodies a \u201cdoing business\u201d test. That Congress made itself clear there when it meant to include a \u201cdoing business\u201d test helps persuade us that Congress did not clearly include a \u201cdoing business\u201d test among the commercial activity exceptions on purpose.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Our adoption of the nexus approach also implements the congressional intent underlying the passage of the Act. This determination is based in part upon the recognition that the Act \u201cstarts from a premise of immunity, and then creates exceptions to the general principle.\u201d House Report at 17, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6616. By codifying the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity in the Act, the Congress sought to strike a delicate balance between those aggrieved by the acts of governmental entities and the sovereignty of foreign states. To interpret the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) as urged by the <em>Rio Grande </em>court would be to open the floodgates to any controversy around the world, against any foreign entity \u201cdoing business\u201d in the United States. Such an unprecedented assertion of jurisdiction over a foreign state was clearly not the Congressional intent underlying the passage of the Act. As Bruno A. Ristau, Chief of the Foreign Litigation Section of the Civil Division of the Justice Department, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">It should also be stressed that the long-arm feature of the bill will insure that only those disputes which have a relation to the United States are litigated in the courts of the United States and that our courts are not turned into small \u201cinternational courts of claims.\u201d The bill is not designed to open up our courts to all comers to litigate any dispute which any private party may have with a foreign state anywhere in the world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afy\"><em>Jurisdiction of U.S. Courts in Suits Against Foreign States: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>House Comm, on the Judiciary on H.R. 11315, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1976) (statement of Brunon A. Ristau).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">We further believe the Third Circuit\u2019s nexus approach to be superior to the approach arguably adopted by the D.C. Circuit in <em>Gilson. </em>Gilson\u2019s test would make for a tighter connection between the United States and the lawsuit, but we see no reason for requiring a tighter fit under clause one, as opposed to clause two. The Third Circuit\u2019s nexus test better serves the purpose of simply requiring a connection between the lawsuit and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We also find support for our nexus interpretation in <em>Arango v. Guzman Travelers Advisors Corp., </em>621 F.2d 1371, 1373 (5th Cir.1980), where we offered a glimpse of our understanding of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2). In <em>Guzman, </em>the Arangos\u2019 vacation package was aborted prematurely when Dominican Immigration officials denied them entry into that country when they arrived at the airport in Santo Domingo. The officials compelled the Arango\u2019s immediate \u201cinvoluntary-rerouting\u201d back to the United States, which resulted in substantial inconvenience and economic loss in their effort to get back to the United States. The Arangos brought suit in state court for non-performance of the vacation contract against four defendants, including Compagnia Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n (\u201cDominicana\u201d), the national airline of the Dominican Republic. Dominicana removed the action to federal district court and then moved to dismiss the action, arguing first, that as a foreign sovereign it was immune from the jurisdiction of the court under the provisions of the FSIA, and second, that the Arangos' complaint failed to state a complaint upon which relief could be granted because the misconduct complained of was insulated from judicial scrutiny by the \u201cact of state\u201d doctrine. Without specifying the grounds upon which it relied, the district court granted this motion and dismissed the Arangos\u2019 suit against Dominicana. The Arangos appealed, but we dismissed their appeal because their complaint against the remaining defendants was pending; therefore the dismissal against Dominicana had not constituted a final judgment. Although we found it unnecessary to decide whether Dominicana was subject to federal jurisdiction under the FSIA, we offered our interpretation of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) in order to guide the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In construing this clause, we focused on whether Dominicana was immune from suit in federal court for breach of contract based upon miscarriage and non-performance of the vacation tour under the exceptions to the Act. In considering the applicability of the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception under the first clause of section 1605(a)(2), we observed that \u201c[t]he focus of the exception to immunity recognized in \u00a7 1605(a)(2) is ... <em>on whether the particular conduct giving rise to the claim in question actually constitutes or is in connection with </em>commercial activity ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379 (emphasis added). Consequently, we determined that the plaintiff\u2019s action for breach of contract was \u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of airline tickets and tourist cards by Dominicana in the United States and, consequently, was not barred by foreign sovereign immunity. 621 F.2d at 1380. <em>See also Matter of Sedeo, Inc., </em>543 F.Supp. 561, 566 (S.D.Tex.1982). Thus, although we did not label our interpretation of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) as a \u201cnexus test,\u201d our construction of the clause mirrors that of the Third Circuit\u2019s in <em>Sugarman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We note finally that an additional reason for our adoption of the Third Circuit\u2019s test is our desire to promote uniformity among the circuits. As we discussed before, good arguments can be made that the Second<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and D.C. Circuits have not yet adopted tests different than the Third Circuit\u2019s nexus test. For obvious reasons, it is highly desirable to avoid circuit conflicts in the sensitive area of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">It follows from our adoption of the Third Circuit\u2019s nexus test that Vencedora\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of jurisdiction under the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) fails.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>Section 1605(a)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Section 1605(a)(3) provides that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property or any property exchanged for such property ... is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">While it is not clear whether any property was \u201ctaken in violation of international law\u201d here, the district court decided that this exception did not apply because defendants did not own or operate the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Vencedora argues that \u201cown\u201d or \u201coperate\u201d may mean \u201cpossess\u201d or \u201ccontrol,\u201d and that CNAN owned or operated the vessel when it initially towed the vessel to Bejaia and later to the Port of Arzew. We disagree with this interpretation of the statutory language. Although no court has interpreted \u201cowned or operated,\u201d the legislative history of the FSIA indicates that section 1605(a)(3) was intended to subject to United States jurisdiction any foreign agency or instrumentality that has nationalized or expropriated property without compensation, or that is using expropriated property taken by another branch of the state. 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6604, 6618. The vessel in this case thus would have been owned or operated under section 1605(a)(3) if CNAN or some Algerian agency had assumed control of the vessel and had used it to carry oil for the benefit of the Algerian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The record indicates that no act of CNAN resembled this scenario. That CNAN may have disobeyed Vencedora\u2019s request to tow the vessel to Palermo does not render the act of towing akin to owning or operating in the sense contemplated by Congress. Similarly, CNAN towed the vessel to the Port of Arzew only because it had been deemed a threat to safety in the first port. Finally, CNAN\u2019s seizure of the vessel for security falls short of ownership or operation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">We also cannot conclude that the actions of the Republic of Algeria or any of its agencies triggered this exception. The only Algerian agency that possibly can be charged with ownership is the Maritime Administrative Authority, which began forfeiture proceedings against the vessel. Yet there is no question but that the Maritime Administrative Authority did not \u201cen-gag[e] in commercial activity in the United States\u201d as required by section 1605(a)(3). It follows that the district court did not err in concluding that the immunity exception in section 1605(a)(3) was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">We conclude that the FSIA bars Vencedora\u2019s suit against CNAN and the Republic of Algeria, and that the district court correctly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-14\">.

An argument can be made that the Second Circuit approved of the \"doing business\u201d interpretation of clause one as a ground for jurisdiction under the Act in <em>Ministry of Supply Cairo v. Universe Tankships, </em>708 F.2d 80 (2d Cir.1983). In <em>Cairo, </em>the court stated that the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) \"withdraws immunity with respect to claims based not only on acts within the United States but also with respect to acts outside the United States if they comprise an integral part of the state\u2019s 'regular course of commercial conduct\u2019 or \u2018particular commercial transaction\u2019 \u2018having substantial contact with the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. By its literal terms, this rule might be read as establishing \"doing business\" as a jurisdictional basis. The rule requires that the acts complained of be an \"integral part\u201d of the \"regular course of commercial conduct,\u201d as is always the case when \"doing business\u201d is the jurisdictional ground. Yet we believe this reading is too broad since the parties did not raise the \"doing business\u201d issue. The court found jurisdiction because the complaint was \u2018\u201cbased upon\u2019 the [foreign sovereign\u2019s] entire course of activity in arranging in the United States for the purchase of the wheat and its transportation to Egypt,\" where the sovereign had wrongfully halted the discharge of cargo. Thus, when addressing the facts of the case, the court appeared to be focusing on the nexus between the act giving rise to the harm and the sovereign\u2019s commercial activity in the United States. We recognize, however, that the court did cite <em>Rio Grande </em>in support of its holding, thereby perhaps indicating that \"doing business\u201d falls within the confines of its interpretation of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2). Yet we are reluctant to construe <em>Cairo </em>as an adoption of the \u201cdoing business\u201d interpretation of clause one when this interpretation was not before the court, and where the facts of this case meet the nexus test applied by the Second Circuit in <em>Gemini Shipping, Inc. v. Foreign Trade Organization for Chemicals and Foodstuffs, </em>647 F.2d 317 (2d Cir.1981). <em>Gemini </em>was an action by a vessel charterer against the owner of the vessel\u2019s cargo for demurrage incurred as a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>suit of a 115-day delay in a Syrian port. The Second Circuit held that the charterer's suit for demurrage under the first clause was \u201cbased upon\u201d the commercial activity carried on in the United States because the particular act sued upon, <em>i.e., </em>the guarantee (of demurrage) was \"part and parcel\u201d of the purchase of rice in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">.

Comparing the \"based upon\u201d language of the clause to the \"transaction of business\u201d clause language in many long-arm provisions, the <em>Harris </em>court concluded that \u201ceven though the defendants \u2018may be \u201cdoing business\u201d here in the <em>traditional sense,\u2019 </em>there is no 'doing business\u2019 provision in the Act.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1061 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">. <em>See supra </em>note 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">.

This reading is consistent with the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ry language once we acknowledge the implausibility of a literal interpretation. It also has support in the legislative history, and carries out the primary purpose behind the statute. While wary of potential jurisdictional excesses and possibilities for affronts to foreign sovereigns presented by the \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction, I am persuaded that the remedy for such ills is faithful adherence to Congress\u2019 mandate that the business carried on in the United States be \u201csubstantial,\u201d and use of the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine. At the same time our exercise of this jurisdictional ground ought to be limited to cases that would otherwise be cognizable in federal court absent any issue of sovereign immunity. Such a restriction fulfills the congressional purpose of avoiding use of our court system by strangers with foreign disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The FSIA presents a peculiarly twisted exercise in statutory draftsmanship. <em>See Gibbons v. Udaras na Gaeltachta, </em>549 F.Supp. 1094, 1105, 1106 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (characterizing the FSIA as \u201cremarkably obtuse,\u201d \u201ca ... statutory labyrinth that, owing to the numerous interpretive questions engendered by its bizarre structure and its many deliberately vague provisions, has during _ its lifetime been a financial boon for the private bar but a constant bane of the federal judiciary\u201d); <em>Texas Trading v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300, 302 (2nd Cir.1981) (\u201cvaguely-worded statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The interpretive exercise of this panel was anticipated and virtually required. Congress chose to make the exceptions in sections 1605-07 purposefully ambiguous, having \u201cdecided to put [their] faith in the U.S. Courts,\u201d and thus attempted to provide only \u201cvery modest guidance\u201d to the judiciary. <em>Jurisdiction of U.S. Courts in Suits Against Foreign States: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House Comm, on the Judiciary on H.R. 11315, </em>94th Cong.2d Sess. 53 (1976) (testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Department of State).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Act\u2019s structure complicates matters. Rather than hinging personal jurisdiction on a defendant\u2019s contacts with the United States, the FSIA inquires whether there is subject matter jurisdiction. Then rather than mark subject matter jurisdiction by traditional indicia such as the citizenship of the parties or the substantive law under which the claim arises, the FSIA turns the inquiry to whether sovereign immunity exists. Thus, the scant language of the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) must: (1) establish the necessity that the claim somehow relate to a commercial activity, (2) establish subject matter jurisdiction with its traditional focus on the claim instead of the parties, and (3) specify the defendant\u2019s contacts necessary for personal jurisdiction, but (4) be sufficiently malleable to accomodate the shaping wisdom of the case-by-case process. It is not surprising that this \u201cGordian Knot\u201d fails to give concrete guidance to courts. <em>See Texas Trading, </em>647 F.2d at 307. The language of section 1605(a)(2) therefore provides a starting-point for my interpretation, but the primary congressional purpose of subjecting foreign governments acting commercially to jurisdiction like any other commercial entity ultimately serves as my compass. <em>See Gibbons v. Udaras na Gaeltachta, </em>549 F.Supp. at 1106. <em>See also </em>House Report at 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6605 (Act codifies restrictive theory of sovereign immunity); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 (in statute\u2019s \u201cfindings and declaration of purpose\u201d it is declared that \u201cstates are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">No circuit court has ever directly faced the issue of whether the first clause of section 1605(a)(2) includes \u201cdoing business\u201d as a jurisdictional ground. Although several circuit courts have found jurisdiction based on the existence of a nexus, the majority opinion is the first to deny jurisdiction for lack of a nexus where the defendant \u201cdoes business\u201d in the United States, the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201crejection\u201d of a \u201cdoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>business\u201d test being dicta in my view. <em>See Velidor v. L/P/G Benghazi, </em>653 F.2d 812, 820 (3d Cir.1981). Further, as the majority opinion concedes, the Second Circuit arguably recognized \u201cdoing business\u201d as a jurisdictional ground. While the majority is correct in regarding the language in <em>Ministry of Supply, Cairo v. Universe Tankships, </em>708 F.2d 80 (2d Cir.1983), as dicta, because the \u201cdoing business\u201d issue was not directly before it, I would be equally cautious with the interpretation of the Third Circuit\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Our panel then writes on what is essentially a clean slate. And while I share the majority\u2019s concern for uniformity among the circuits, I understand this circuit to be the first to address the \u201cdoing business\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">When the relevant portions of section 1603(d) and (e) are inserted into clause one of section 1605(a)(2), we are left with the task of construing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States or of the States in any case in which the action is based upon a regular course of commercial conduct carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\"><em>See Matter of Rio Grande Transport, Inc., etc., </em>516 F.Supp. 1155, 1162 (S.D.N.Y.1981). Because this language cannot be interpreted literally, courts have been driven to substitutions for the words \u201cbased upon.\u201d The majority\u2019s substitution is \u201chave a nexus with.\u201d While plausible, the search for a nexus between the United States and a claim in the usual case is a search for a specific act or acts in the United States, rather than for a regular course of commercial conduct in the sense of a carrying on of a commercial business in the United States. <em>See </em>House Report at 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6614-15 (\u201cA \u2018regular course of commercial conduct\u2019 includes the carrying on of a commercial enterprise such as a mineral extraction company, an airline or a state trading corporation.\u201d) I would expect a search for a nexus to be a search for an act or series of acts that will be part of the conduct of the business without constituting the entire conduct of the business. It follows that allowing only claims with a nexus to the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d carried on in the United States would not exhaust the full range of clause one when \u201ccommercial activity\u201d is defined as a \u201cregular course of commercial conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The \u201csubstantial contact\u201d language of \u00a7 1603(e) also supports my reading. This language appears to draw upon the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d test of <em>International Shoe v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). That test marks off a \u201cdoing business\u201d ground as involving \u201cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from these activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 66 S.Ct. at 159. The FSIA\u2019s \u201csubstantial contact\u201d language thus does not signal a congressional intent to enact more stringent a test than the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary for \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction. <em>But see Maritime Intern. Nominees v. Republic of Guinea, </em>693 F.2d 1094, 1109 and n. 23 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 71, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983). To the contrary, the phrase could be lifted straight from <em>International Shoe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">Furthermore, reading clause one to embody a \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdictional ground gives a coherent organizational structure to the three clauses of the \u201ccommercial activities\u201d exception. If \u201cdoing business\u201d is allowed as a basis for jurisdiction under clause one, then the three clauses of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) roughly correspond to three jurisdictional categories; personal jurisdiction exists where the defendant (1) does business in the United States, (2) commits an act within the United States but is not \u201cdoing business,\u201d and (3) does not commit a relevant act in the United States, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>causes a direct effect in the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These categories reflect the development of jurisdictional principles, from <em>Pennoyer v.

International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957) (effects can constitute minimum contacts), and beyond. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Effects Jurisdiction Under the Foreign Immunities Act and the Due Process Clause, </em>55 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 474 (1980). Given these three historical grounds of jurisdiction and the appearance of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) as embodying these grounds, it seems reasonable to read clause one as embodying a \u201cdoing business\u201d ground in addition to a \u201cnexus\u201d ground when the language can support this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The legislative history also supports this construction, although the evidence is not conclusive. In discussing \u00a7 1330(b), the \u201cPersonal Jurisdiction\u201d section \u2014 the most significant juncture of the section-by-section analysis for our purposes \u2014 the House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">Section 1330(b) provides, in effect, a Federal long-arm statute over foreign states (including political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities of foreign states). It is patterned after the long-arm statute Congress enacted for the District of Columbia. Public Law 91-358, sec. 132(a), title I, 84 Stat. 549. The requirements of minimum jurisdictional contacts and adequate notice are embodied in the provision. Cf<em>. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 [66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95] (1945), and <em>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 223 [78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223] (1957). For personal jurisdiction to exist under section 1330(b), the claim must first of all be one over which the district courts have original jurisdiction under section 1330(a), meaning a claim for which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity. Significantly, each of the immunity provisions in the bill, sections 1605-1607, requires some connection between the lawsuit and the United States, or an express or implied waiver by the foreign state of its immunity from jurisdiction ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">House Report at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6612. The statement that \u201cthe requirements of minimum jurisdictional contacts\u201d are embodied in the Act, with the citations to <em>International Shoe </em>and <em>McGee, </em>supports a reading of the Act as coextensive with the limits of due process. There are other statements on which one may rely and other inferences one may draw from the legislative history, but this strong statement at the critical juncture is the more potent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">One may point to other statements in the legislative history which seem to emphasize the importance of the claim's relation to the United States as requiring a nexus, such as the above statement that sections 1605\u2014 1607 require \u201csome connection between the lawsuit and the United States____\u201d But in the context of the entire quotation the connection can be equally read to be \u201cdoing business.\u201d Significantly, Congress specifically approved \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction for \u00a7 1605(a)(3) expropriations cases. Thus \u201cdoing business\u201d must equal \u201csome connection between the lawsuit and the United States\u201d for the sentence to make sense. It follows for me that the majority opinion\u2019s reliance on the idea that \u201cdoing business\u201d would not fulfill the goal of clause one in requiring a connection between the lawsuit and the United States is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The focus of the House Report is not on \u201cdoing business\u201d as a jurisdictional ground. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Yet, it does not necessarily follow that Congress\u2019 failure affirmatively to mention \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction evidences a congressional intent that this avenue to jurisdiction be unavailable to the plaintiff suing a foreign sovereign. \u201cDoing business\u201d was an established, basic jurisdictional ground, and it is unlikely that Congress would dismiss it without a clearer indication of its intent to do so. <em>Cf. Texas Trading v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d at 313 (\u201cBefore the FSIA plaintiffs enjoyed a broad right to bring suits against foreign states, subject only to State Department intervention and the presence of attachable assets. Congress in the FSIA certainly did not intend significantly to constrict jurisdiction; it intended to regularize it.\u201d). At the same time it was reasonable for Congress to focus on a nexus ground in its explanations, as the experience before passage of the FSIA was that the vast majority of claims specifically related to the contacts within the forum that gave rise to jurisdiction. <em>See </em>L. Henkin, R.C. Pugh, O. Schacter and H. Smit, <em>International Law </em>514 (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In light of the pre-FSIA history it is then understandable that the focus would be on the dispute\u2019s connection with the United States. In a direct sense a dispute with an entity \u201cdoing business\u201d in the United States does have a relation to the United States, although the simple fact of \u201cdoing business\u201d may not be enough for the suit to survive a motion for dismissal on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds. Finally, if the allowance of \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction meant that all suits between foreigners could get into U.S. courts so long as there was a \u201cdoing business\u201d connection, then the legislative history would most certainly support a construction of the language as rejecting \u201cdoing business.\u201d However, as I explain below, \u201cdoing business\u201d would not alone create jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">My final argument is of the \u201cforest for the trees\u201d variety. We should not, in parsing the legislative history, overlook Congress\u2019 overall purpose. By codifying the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, Congress recognized that those aggrieved by the acts of governmental commercial entities ought to be able to sue those governmental entities just as other, private, commercial entities could be sued. It seems the most probable congressional purpose was to extend \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction to foreign governments\u2019 commercial entities, thus placing those entities in positions to be sued not dissimilar from other foreign-owned companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">At the same time the FSIA\u2019s \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction ought to be strictly limited to what I perceive to be Congress\u2019 purpose in its enactment. I think it self-evident that Congress did not intend to extend \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction to suits between foreigners unless, as in this case, the jurisdiction of the federal courts would extend to cover the case absent sovereign immunity. Notwithstanding that under the FSIA Congress did in general extend federal jurisdiction to suits between foreigners as long as one of the exceptions to immunity is present, <em>see Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>461 U.S. 480, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983), I think Congress would have been explicit had it meant to extend United States jurisdiction to all suits between foreigners and foreign states without any nexus at all between the cause of action and the United States. Extending \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction to any claim arising anywhere in the world between foreigners and foreign states would be an unprecedented and radical extension of United States jurisdiction; surely it was not contemplated by the FSIA. My reading of the FSIA as allowing for \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction allows for \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction only in cases that would otherwise be cognizable in federal courts under this jurisdictional ground absent any issue of sovereign immunity. Congress was unquestionably wary lest our federal courts become international courts of claims. With the interpretive burden Congress has given the courts in administering the statute and the strong congressional purpose pushing toward allowing \u201cdoing business\u201d as a ground, a halfway construction is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Even if we allay the concern that the FSIA could comprehend suits between foreigners whenever a foreign state is \u201cdoing business\u201d in the United States, \u201cdoing business\u201d is a more controversial jurisdictional ground to assert over foreign entities than is a nexus ground. <em>See </em>Carl, <em>Suing Foreign Governments in American Courts: The United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in Practice, </em>33 Sw.L.J. 1009, 1058-61 (1979). <em>But c.f. Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (Revised), </em>Tent.Draft No. 2 \u00a7 403(2)(b) (1981) (suggesting \u201clinks such as nationality, residence, or <em>economic activity, </em>between the regulating state and the persons principally responsible for the activity to be regulated\u201d as considerations recognized by international law that are relevant to a country\u2019s assertion of \u201cjurisdiction to prescribe\u201d (emphasis supplied)). Given some judicial readings of \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction, any queasiness of those at the international bar over our \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction is not without some justification. <em>See, e.g., Bryant v. Finnish National Airline, </em>15 N.Y.2d 426, 260 N.Y.S.2d 625, 208 N.E.2d 439 (1965) (\u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction found on basis that defendant maintained a one-and-one-half room office for publicity purposes in New York). Yet I am confident that U.S. courts could responsibly assert \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction in the FSIA context in such just ways as to avoid affronts to foreign sovereigns. By adhering strictly to the \u201csubstantial contact\u201d standard, and by use of <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissals, our courts could screen out those cases that do not belong here. My construction would thus not threaten to turn our courts into international courts of claims. The power to hear a claim and the willingness to do so are quite different.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Here, although the case would likely succumb to a motion to dismiss on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds, <em>see, e.g., Perusakaan Umum Listrik Negara v. M/V Tel Aviv, </em>711 F.2d 1231 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Veba-Chemie A.G. v. M/V Getafix, </em>711 F.2d 1243 (5th Cir.1983), absent CNAN\u2019s status as an instrumentality of a foreign government the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts over the claim against CNAN would be unquestionably established, notwithstanding that both Vencedora and CNAN are foreigners. Involved are time-worn elements of a complaint charging a salvor with misdeeds: that the salvor without good reason prevented the distressed vessel\u2019s master for rejoining his ship,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the salvor without good reason did not comply with the request of the owner to bring the salved property into a nearby, safe port, and that these misdeeds resulted in the destruction of the vessel. <em>See 3A Benedict on Admiralty </em>\u00a7\u00a7 125, 119 at 8-39 (7th ed. revised 1980); <em>Byrne v. Johnson, </em>53 F. 840 (5th Cir.1893). Absent <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction, all Vencedora would have to establish would be that jurisdiction over CNAN would be consistent with due process. <em>See The Belgenland, </em>114 U.S. 355, 5 S.Ct. 860, 29 L.Ed. 152 (1884). Thus since this case would otherwise be cognizable in our admiralty courts absent a claim of sovereign immunity, the purpose behind the FSIA pushes toward an interpretation that would allow for our exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The majority opinion frets over Vencedora\u2019s foreign status. But the tenuousness of any connection between this particular dispute and the United States is no reason to disallow \u201cdoing business\u201d as a jurisdictional ground in all cases. Had an American company initiated this suit the equities might well lie in favor of U.S. jurisdiction. Disallowing \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction under the FSIA may adversely affect not just foreigners whose suits clearly do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>belong in the U.S., but also U.S. citizens whose suits would otherwise be cognizable in U.S. courts if the defendant was not a sovereign instrumentality. This inquiry is relevant to our central effort of plumbing congressional intent. I am persuaded that had Congress anticipated the issue it would not wish to deny access to U.S. citizens injured abroad by a foreign sovereign entity doing business in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It might be argued that clause three of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) would prevent U.S. citizens in this situation from being denied access to U.S. courts. Clause three allows for jurisdiction over claims based upon acts outside the U.S. in connection with commercial activity outside the U.S. where there are direct effects in the United States. Although there is little precedent on the scope of the \u201cdirect effects\u201d clause, it is doubtful that this clause would avoid the loss caused to U.S. plaintiffs by the disallowance of \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Clause three lays out two relevant limitations on jurisdiction: (1) the effect must be \u201cdirect,\u201d and (2) the effect must be \u201cin the United States.\u201d Though Congress gave little hint of what is meant by \u201cdirect,\u201d a thoughtful commentator points out that not all injuries proximately caused by a tort will amount to a \u201cdirect effect.\u201d <em>See </em>Note, <em>Effects Jurisdiction Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the Due Process Clause, </em>55 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 474, 506 (1980). Thus, the limitation that an injury be \u201cdirect\u201d in all likelihood restricts the reach of U.S. jurisdiction over actions by U.S. plaintiffs based on acts outside our territory, in comparison to \u201cdoing business.\u201d Under \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction, if the defendant \u201cdoes business\u201d in the U.S. the fact that the injury suffered in the United States was not the primary injury would not defeat jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is generally easy to determine whether a personal injury has occurred \u201cin the United States.\u201d Courts have naturally adopted a test of looking to see where the injury occurred, rather than whether or not the injury has occurred to a person who lives in the United States. If section 1605(a)(2) does not include a \u201cdoing business\u201d test, then use of this \u201cdirect effects\u201d test alone would of course cut off a number of U.S. plaintiffs from U.S. courts in suits based on torts occurring abroad where the defendant does business in the U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">It is more problematic to decide whether a financial injury has occurred \u201cin the United States.\u201d Nevertheless, it is likely that U.S. business plaintiffs suffering financial injury would be foreclosed from bringing suit in U.S. courts in a significant number of cases unless U.S. courts took the unlikely and arguably improper course of adopting a test for \u201cdirectness\u201d that went beyond primary injury as well as a broad test for location of injury. In sum, \u201cdirect effects\u201d jurisdiction would not completely mitigate the loss by U.S. plaintiffs of forum selection caused by ridding the courts of \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction over sovereigns. I think this concern is relevant to congressional purpose and supports my view that \u201cdoing business\u201d jurisdiction should be recognized under the FSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Underlying the court\u2019s opinion is the fear of affronts to foreign sovereigns hauled into our courts over disputes having nothing to do with the United States. Undoubtedly many cases over which United States courts could have jurisdiction only because of an FSIA \u201cdoing business\u201d exception ought not be heard in the United States. But an over-broad jurisdictional ban is not the best way to exclude such cases. Perhaps I am more confident in our ability to weed out cases on an individualized basis. But, more importantly, I believe those cases that could survive a motion for <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal \u2014 especially such cases involving U.S. plaintiffs \u2014 ought to be heard because Congress meant for commercial, governmental entities to be subject to suit like any other commercial entity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">. The relevant portion of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) provides: (a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ... (2)[ (i) ] in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; [ (ii) ] or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; [ (iii) ] or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">.

Vencedora states that the port authorities at Annaba led the master of the KAPETAN MARCOS to believe that he would be permitted to board one of the tugs and return to his ship, but that the CNAN tugs left without him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
