The district court granted ABC\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment finding that the purchaser agreements were not securities as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A panel of this court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Villeneuve v. Advanced Business Concepts Corp., </em>698 F.2d 1121 (11th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted rehearing en banc to determine whether the area purchaser agreement in this case is an investment contract and consequently a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-6\">Villeneuve entered into an area purchaser agreement with ABC to become a distributor for the sale of self-watering flower planters. ABC stimulated Villeneuve\u2019s interest in investing through the use of advertisements stating the ease with which profits could be realized in this business. When Villeneuve made his initial investment, ABC provided him with self-watering planters and a display rack in an established store. The agreement required Villeneuve to periodically check and restock the displays with planters ordered from ABC. Under the agreement, Villeneuve and the store each received half of the profits derived from the sale of the self-watering planters. When Villeneuve failed to realize the profits he had expected from his investment, he instituted this action. He alleged in his complaint that the purchaser agreement is an investment contract and therefore a security as defined in section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(l), and section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10). He further asserted that because the area purchaser agreement is a security, ABC is in violation of sections 12(1) and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>77l </em>(1), (2), for selling unregistered securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">In <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the touchstone of an investment contract for purposes of the securities acts is \u201cthe presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852, 95 S.Ct. at 2060. Twenty-nine years earlier, the Court had formulated the test of an investment contract as \u201cwhether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\u201d <em>S.E.C. v. W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 301, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1104, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). The Court used <em>For-man </em>as the occasion to reaffirm the <em>Howey </em>test, observing that \u201c[tjhis test, in shorthand form, embodies the essential attributes that run through all of the Court\u2019s decisions defining a security.\u201d 421 U.S. at 852, 95 S.Ct. at 2060.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-11\">We discern no basis for concluding that the profits which Villeneuve expected to realize were to be derived from ABC\u2019s entrepreneurial or managerial efforts. We therefore affirm the decision of the district court that the area purchaser agreement in this case is not an investment contract and consequently not a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1472-7\">. The granting of the request for en banc consideration, by operation of law, vacated the panel opinion. <em>See </em>11th Cir.R. 26(k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1472-8\">. Because we conclude that Villeneuve's contract does not satisfy the test of an investment contract articulated either in <em>Forman </em>or in <em>S.E.C. v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 473 (5th Cir.1974), this case does not present the opportunity to determine whether the rule adopted in <em>Koscot </em>and the line of cases that followed conflicts with the requirements of <em>For-man.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
