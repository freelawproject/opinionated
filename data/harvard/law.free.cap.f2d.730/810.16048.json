Appellants, Walter Threadgill and his wholly owned corporation, T &amp; R Consultants, Inc., brought this action under the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q, 78j (1982), and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.-10b-5 (1983)), charging appellees with fraud and misrepresentation in the sale and purchase of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">The complaint alleged that appellant Threadgill had been a shareholder of B &amp; W Productions, Inc., a New York corporation controlled by appellees. The complaint further alleged that on August 4, 1981, appellees, acting through B &amp; W, entered into an agreement with Threadgill to purchase his stock in B &amp; W and to satisfy all claims arising from his employment contract with B &amp; W. Threadgill was to receive $70,000, to be paid in fourteen monthly installments of $5,000. Appellees promised to execute a written memorandum of the agreement, but never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">The complaint charges that appellees entered into the agreement without any intention of ever paying the full $70,000;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the parties stipulated that only $10,000 was actually paid. The district court, without conducting any evidentiary hearing, found that although most of appellants\u2019 contentions regarding the fraudulent scheme were disputed by appellees no genuine issue of material fact prevented its conclusion that the federal securities laws were not applicable to the transaction at issue. First, the court found that \u201cthe purpose of the August 1981 meeting was not to repurchase any security but to settle Plaintiff\u2019s wage claims arising under the employment contract.\u201d <em>Threadgill v. Black, </em>Civil No. 82-0222, slip op. at 6 (D.D.C. Feb. 1, 1983). Second, the court found that because no stock was conveyed, the full purchase price was never paid, and Threadgill retained his interest in B &amp; W, no actual sale or purchase of any security had taken place: \u201cAt best, this was an attempt to repurchase Plaintiff\u2019s interest or mere negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7 (footnote omitted). The court therefore found itself without jurisdiction over the securities laws claims and granted summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-20\">That was error. The \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d of any security under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> includes \u201cany contract\u201d to purchase or sell a security. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(13) &amp; (14). <em>Cf. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 750-51, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1932-33, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975). Thus, fraud in the purchase or sale includes \u201c[ejntering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>into a contract of sale [of a security] with the secret reservation not to fully perform,\u201d <em>Walling v. Beverly Enterprises, </em>476 F.2d 393, 396 (9th Cir.1973). There is no exception for oral contracts, <em>see Desser v. Ashton, </em>408 F.Supp. 1174, 1177 (S.D.N.Y.1975); and summary judgment for the defendant has been denied on facts almost identical to those alleged here, <em>Oliver v. Bostetter, </em>426 F.Supp. 1082 (D.Md.1977). Threadgill did not allege that he \u201cnegotiated\u201d or \u201cattempted\u201d to sell his stock, but that he \u201centered into an agreement\u201d of sale with appellees, Civil No. 82-0222, Complaint at 3, 1110(g). Appellees denied that assertion, creating a contested issue of material fact which could not be resolved against appellants to grant appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We therefore reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We also vac\u00e1te the district court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motion to drop a party plaintiff. It is clear that issue would arise, if at all, in an entirely different context in light of our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-16\">. Threadgill contends that the August 1981 meeting and agreement were part of a larger scheme to defraud him of his interest in B &amp; W. That scheme allegedly included fraudulently misrepresenting the financial accounts of B &amp; W, systematically looting the corporation, allowing it to be dissolved by New York State for non-payment of taxes on June 25, 1980, and concealing the latter fact from appellant until after the 1981 meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-22\">. Threadgill's complaint referred to both 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q. The latter, however, provides relief only to defrauded <em>purchasers </em>of securities. <em>Simmons v. Wolfson, </em>428 F.2d 455, 456 (6th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>U.S. 999, 91 S.Ct. 459, 27 L.Ed.2d 450 (1971). Since the facts alleged set forth a claim as a defrauded <em>seller, </em>that provision could not sustain the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
