The first order modified a rate schedule to exclude from the rate base Jersey Central\u2019s investment in a cancelled nuclear plant and, as a consequence, ordered the utility to file reduced rates. The second order denied a petition for rehearing. We affirm the Commission in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">On March 31, 1982, Jersey Central filed with the Commission proposed rate schedules for service to six wholesale customers. The schedules proposed a two-step rate increase. Phase A has gone into effect and is not at issue here. Phase B amounted to a 19% rate of return on common equity, which would have resulted in an overall rate of return of 12.62%, and represented an annual increase of about $2 million. In Phase B, Jersey Central proposed to amortize over a fifteen-year period a $397 million investment lost when it suspended construction of a nuclear generating station at Forked River. Jersey Central also sought a return over the amortization period to cover the carrying charges on the debt and preferred stock portions of the unamortized investment in the cancelled plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-25\">Jersey Central\u2019s wholesale customers petitioned the Commission, urging it to reject that part of Jersey Central\u2019s Phase B request which sought a return on the unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>ortized portions of the loss in the cancelled nuclear plant by including the loss in the rate base. Consistent with its policy of such abandoned investments, the Commission granted the wholesalers\u2019 petition for summary disposition, relying on <em>New England Power Co., </em>8 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,054 (July 19, 1979), <em>aff'd sub nom. NEPCO Municipal Rate Committee v. FERC, </em>668 F.2d 1327 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 2928, 73 L.Ed.2d 1329 (1982) <em>(\u201cNEPCO\u201d). </em>The Commission thus allowed Jersey Central to recover the expense of building the cancelled project, but denied the company any return on the unamortized portion of that investment sufficient to cover the carrying charges on the debt and preferred stock portions of the unamortized investment. This is the only return on investment involved here. Though Jersey Central is not seeking a return of the unamortized portion of that part of its investment allocable to the common equity investors, the return it does seek would, of course, ease the burden on those investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">On June 24, 1982, Jersey Central petitioned for rehearing, relying primarily on the \u201cend result\u201d standard enunciated in <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 602, 64 S.Ct. 281, 287, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). That test, the company argued, requires that \u201ca hearing be held in order to assess the end result of the Commission\u2019s summary disposition order, in the event that Jersey Central be required to reduce its Phase B rates.\u201d Application of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. for Rehearing, Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 105. Jersey Central claimed to be \u201cin extremely precarious financial circumstances\u201d and \u201cunable to attract additional capital other than capital supplied through a very restrictive revolving credit agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107. The company maintained it was automatically entitled to a hearing, since application of the Commission\u2019s policy would produce a rate having an unreasonable \u201cend result.\u201d Jersey Central also argued that exclusion of its entire investment in the cancelled plant from the rate base was inconsistent with prior judicial and Commission precedent, especially those cases dealing with rate base treatment of abandoned gas pipelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The Commission denied rehearing with respect to that part of its order refusing to allow Jersey Central to include in its rate base the investment in the cancelled nuclear facility. It held that the \u201creasonableness\u201d of an end result under the <em>Hope </em>test could not be evaluated \u201cwithout regard to the individual components which comprise a rate.\u201d <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>20 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,083, at 61,181 (July 23, 1982) (Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Application for Rehearing) (\u201cCommission Order\u201d). And where, as here, the Commission has an established policy, no hearing was required \u201cto implement this policy determination.\u201d Commission Order at 61,182. The Commission also distinguished the gas pipeline decisions, which Jersey Central tried to use to establish that the policy had been inconsistently applied, on the grounds that the gas utilities had, in those cases, employed a different method of financing. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Commission refused to allow Jersey Central to \u201cinflat[e] the rate of return to recover dollars equal to those attributable to its impermissible rate base inclusion,\u201d because Jersey Central\u2019s case-in-chief did not support a higher rate of return, and because FERC \u201chas long held that utilities may not present a \u2018moving target\u2019 by offering alternative justifications for previously filed rates.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">In this court, Jersey Central advances several arguments for overturning the Commission\u2019s result. It will be convenient to the discussion to divide these into two groups. The first consists of arguments that directly attack the application of a rule against including in the rate base the cost of investments in abandoned projects for electricity generation. The second group is made up of arguments that, whatever the validity of that rule, the company was entitled to a hearing to alter the results here.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Jersey Central first attacks the decision on the ground that the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ruling is not mandated by any established policy, or, at least, no policy that ought to be followed here. This argument has two aspects. The existence of a policy is conceded, as it must be. The Commission in this case relied upon <em>New England Power Co., </em>8 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b661,054 (July 19, 1979), <em>aff'd sub nom. NEPCO Municipal Rate Committee v. FERC, </em>668 F.2d 1327 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 2928, 73 L.Ed.2d 1329 (1982). <em>NEPCO </em>demonstrates that FERC has articulated a valid policy against permitting a utility a return on the unamortized portion of that utility\u2019s investment in an abandoned electrical generating station. The Supreme Court long ago upheld the general principle underlying this policy \u2014 namely, that utilities are not entitled to have included in their rate base properties not \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service to ratepayers. <em>Denver Union Stock Yard Co. v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 470, 475, 58 S.Ct. 990, 994, 82 L.Ed. 1469 (1938) (Under the Constitution, a utility \u201cis entitled to rates, not <em>per se </em>excessive and extortionate, sufficient to yield a reasonable rate of return upon the value of the property used, at the time it is being used, to render the services. But it is not entitled to have included any property not <em>used and useful </em>for that purpose.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In <em>NEPCO, </em>the New England Power Company proposed to recover over a five-year period an investment loss of approximately $13 million in a partially constructed, but later cancelled, electric generating facility. The company also proposed to include, in an interim rate, the unamortized portion of its investment loss in its rate base. Under the New England Power Company\u2019s proposal, the investors would have been made 100% whole by receiving back their entire investment over a five-year period, including the time value of their money. The Commission, as it did here, allowed the company to recover only its expenditures on the project, and denied rate base treatment for the unamortized portion of the loss. 668 F.2d at 1332-33. We upheld the Commission\u2019s ruling on the ground that, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">The general rule recognized by this court is that expenditure for an item may be included in a public utility\u2019s rate base only when the item is \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service; that is, current rate payers should bear only legitimate costs of providing service to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">668 F.2d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The Commission has since applied this policy to other utility losses resulting from cancellation or abandonment. For example, in <em>Northern States Power Co., </em>17 F.E. R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,196, at 61,380-81 (Dec. 3, 1981), FERC denied the utility the same rate base treatment requested here. Also, in that case, as Jersey Central concedes, \u201cFERC made clear that its intention was that the investors receive back their entire investment but be denied all return on that investment during the amortization period.\u201d Initial Brief of Jersey Central at 19. Other cases also establish that this has been the Commission\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Jersey Central attempts to avoid the impact of that showing by contending that the Commission does not apply the policy consistently and that, in any event, it is irrational to apply the policy to the facts here. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The claim of policy inconstancy is based upon certain gas pipeline <em>decisions </em>\u2014 Ozark <em>Gas Transmission System, </em>16 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,099 (July 28, 1981) and <em>Trailblazer Pipeline Co., </em>18 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,244 (Mar. 12, 1982) \u2014 which, the company argues, provide support for its claim that the Commission has no firmly established rule denying rate base inclusion in cases like this. The two cases are inapposite. In <em>Ozark </em>and <em>Trailblazer, </em>the Commission allowed the utilities to recover \u201cdebt service (the debt-related portion of depreciation and all interest costs), actual operating and maintenance expenses, and actual taxes other than income ... without regard to the actual use of the pipeline.\u201d <em>Trailblazer, </em>18 F.E.R.C. (CCH) at 61,500. These projects, however, were financed not by \u201cconventional financing,\u201d as was Jersey Central\u2019s abandoned Forked River plant, but by \u201cproject financing.\u201d Project financing is, according to the Commission, \u201can alternative financing method in which the stream of income generated by the project is the primary security for the loan. This financing method is available only if the stream of revenues from the project is assured irrespective of the degree of the project\u2019s success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>FERC allows project financing only on the condition that the applicants waive \u201ctheir right to apply for the recovery of their equity investment in th[e] project should it fail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,-503. Here, it will be recalled, Jersey Central will, over a fifteen-year amortization period, recover the equity portion of its investment, although it is being denied any return.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Jersey Central correctly points out that the Commission has acknowledged that the ratemaking treatment accorded cancelled electric generating projects has, at times, been- inconsistent with the treatment accorded gas pipeline projects. <em>Trailblazer, </em>18 F.E.R.C. (CCH) at 61,511 n. 15. In <em>Trailblazer, </em>the Commission declined to resolve this inconsistency because \u201cthe question [was] not squarely before [it] on the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jersey Central also quotes the Commission\u2019s observation that \u201cpolicy considerations have led [it] in the direction of a consistent and more liberal allowance of abandoned plant costs in cost of service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,502. Jersey Central has been the beneficiary of this more liberal allowance. The company has not been denied <em>any </em>recovery of the loss resulting from the cancelled project, despite the non-\u201cused and useful\u201d nature of the project. To the contrary, Jersey Central is being permitted to recoup moneys expended on the Forked River project. There is a difference between the Commission\u2019s approach here and its approach in some of the gas pipeline cases. But the treatment accorded the pipelines, if applied here, would not permit Jersey Central to recover its equity investment, the debt, the carrying charges on the debt, and the preferred stock costs, all of which it attempted to do by including the Forked River investment in its rate base. The question of whether Jersey Central should have been afforded the option of project financing, thus securing debt but risking equity, is not before us because that is not what the company sought before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Jersey Central next contends that it is irrational for the Commission to apply its general policy to this case because of the difference in the proposed amortization periods. The five-year amortization period in <em>NEPCO </em>was much more favorable to the investors than the fifteen-year period chosen here. That is certainly true. The longer investors must wait to recover their investment, with no return on that investment, the greater the hardship is to them. Jersey Central contends that its investors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>should fare at least as well as NEPCO\u2019s. There is no such requirement in the law. The Commission\u2019s abandonment rule balances the interests of ratepayers and investors. As we said in upholding that rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO5\">Because it would be inequitable to place on the utility the entire loss of expenditures prudent when made, FERC allowed recovery thereof over time. At the same time, FERC is charged with a duty to protect the consumer against unreasonably high rates____ FERC here struck a reasonable balance between the interests of investors and ratepayers. This court has recognized the value and propriety of such a practical approach____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\"><em>NEPCO, </em>668 F.2d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Application of the abandonment rule to a situation with a different period of amortization alters the balance between ratepayers and investors but we cannot say that the balance has moved here so far from that achieved in <em>NEPCO </em>to have taken the balance out of the range that is reasonable. If the abandonment rule had to be modified or dropped every time some other feature of a tariff made the balance between investors and ratepayers different from that in <em>NEPCO, </em>there would be nothing left to call a rule. It is also to be borne in mind that Jersey Central, knowing, at the very least, that the Commission asserted that it had a policy of not including the cost of abandoned projects in the rate base, nevertheless filed rate increases that attempted to put the cost of Forked River in the rate base, and Jersey Central, rather than the Commission, chose the fifteen-year amortization period. <em>See FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., </em>371 U.S. 145, 153, 83 S.Ct. 211, 215, 9 L.Ed.2d 199 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Jersey Central\u2019s arguments that it was entitled to a hearing are no more persuasive than its challenges to the abandonment rule. The analysis set out above shows that there was no need to give Jersey Central a hearing on its claims that the rule did not exist or, if it did, could not be applied here. Such an attack raises no \u201cissue of adjudicative fact,\u201d and the Commission was under no obligation to grant Jersey Central a hearing. <em>United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., </em>351 U.S. 192, 205, 76 S.Ct. 763, 771, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956); 3 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 14.5, at 26-27 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Nor was a hearing required because Jersey Central offered to make an alternative evidentiary presentation in support of the rates it sought. In order to justify the increased rates once the Commission had rejected the proposed treatment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Forked River investment, Jersey Central would have had to change certain cost service elements. The Commission has \u201clong held that utilities may not present a \u2018moving target\u2019 by offering alternative justifications for previously filed rates.\u201d Commission Order at 61,181, <em>citing Western Power Division, Central Telephone &amp; Utilities Corp., </em>Docket No. ER76-92 (Aug. 17, 1976); <em>Northern States Power Co., </em>54 F.P.C. 1572, 1573-75 (1975); <em>Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co., </em>Docket No. E-9499 (Oct. 9, 1975); <em>New England Power Co., </em>54 F.P.C. 468, 469 (1975), <em>aff'd, New England Power Co. v. FPC, </em>No. 75-1379 (1st Cir. Nov. 13, 1975); <em>Georgia Power Co., </em>54 F.P.C. 458 (1975); <em>Central Vermont Public Service Corp., </em>Docket No. E-9040 (Aug. 5, 1975), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>54 F.P.C. 1441 (1975). <em>See also FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., </em>371 U.S. 145, 83 S.Ct. 211, 9 L.Ed.2d 199 (1962). The rule barring \u201cmoving targets\u201d is not arbitrary. It is justified by the \u201cadministrative necessity of closing the books at a time certain,\u201d as well as the need for a \u201cmechanism to prevent utilities from delaying refund orders by offering alternative justifications for the rate increases [they have] filed. FPC staff and intervenors cannot be expected to follow a moving target.\u201d <em>New England Power Co. v. FPC, </em>No. 75-1379, slip op. at 3 (1st Cir. Nov. 13, 1975), <em>cited </em>in Commission Order at 61,182.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Jersey Central\u2019s final contention is that a hearing was required so that it could prove that the refusal to include the unamortized portion of the Forked River investment in the rate base results in a violation of the \u201cend result\u201d test enunciated in <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). We think the company places more weight on <em>Hope </em>than it will bear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court there recognized the investor\u2019s \u201clegitimate concern with the financial integrity of the company whose rates are being regulated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 64 S.Ct. at 288.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. By that standard the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. That return, moreover ,.should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Judicial inquiry is warranted where the \u201ctotal effect of the rate order is ... unjust and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 64 S.Ct. at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The <em>Hope </em>court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\">[T]he Commission [is] not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of \u201cpragmatic adjustments.\u201d And when the Commission\u2019s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order \u201cviewed in its entirety\u201d meets the requirements of the Act. Under the statutory standard of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">320 U.S. at 602, 64 S.Ct. at 287, <em>quoting FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 586, 62 S.Ct. 736, 743, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (1942) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">In isolation these passages may seem to support Jersey Central\u2019s demand for a full evidentiary hearing. But the <em>Hope </em>opinion contains another theme: \u201c \u2018regulation does not insure that the business shall produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>net revenues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hope, </em>320 U.S. at 603, 64 S.Ct. at 288, <em>quoting FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. at 590, 62 S.Ct. at 745. <em>See FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., </em>371 U.S. at 152, 83 S.Ct. at 215 (\u201c[T]he hazard of not making a profit remains on the company____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Relying upon a very broad reading of Hope\u2019s first theme, Jersey Central argues that, as a result of the Commission\u2019s orders, its rate of return overall will be too low to be characterized as \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d In denying rehearing, however, the Commission responded that \u201cthe reasonableness of that end result cannot be evaluated without regard to the individual components which comprise a rate.\u201d Commission Order at 61,181. This is a rather terse explanation and we wish that in the future the Commission would share its undoubted expertise with us a bit more generously./ We understand the Commission to be saying, however, that the end result is to be judged by the rate of return allowed on items for which a rate of return is allowable, the Forked River expenditure is not such an item, and the rates are just and reasonable as to those cost items that are properly in the rate base. The dispute thus boils down to the question of whether the end result test is to be applied to a utility overall or only to those assets which valid Commission rules permit to be included in the rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The first theme of <em>Hope </em>tends to support Jersey Central\u2019s concept that the measure is the company\u2019s overall rate of return, for that is the relevant rate of return for purposes of maintaining credit and attracting capital. But that is apparently contradicted by the observation that regulation need not insure net revenues. Whether or not these themes are reconcilable, we think the Commission\u2019s view of the end result test is a permissible one and we think so for reasons beyond the deference we owe the Commission\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The requirement that property included in a rate base must be \u201cused and useful\u201d antedates Hope\u2019s end result test and is not generally regarded as overridden by that test. Such a broad view of <em>Hope </em>would revolutionize ratemaking. If the end result test were regarded as always applicable to a utility\u2019s overall rate of return, the entire complicated apparatus of ratemaking would be superfluous. The Commission would need only adjust rates until it found the lowest rates that permitted the utility to maintain credit and attract capital. Concepts such as that of a rate base would be unnecessary. The fact that this is not the way the rat\u00e9making process works is a strong indication that Jersey Central\u2019s view of the end result test is too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Because the rates set by FERC are primarily challenged by utilities on the grounds that they are \u201cunjust and unreasonable,\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a) (1982), and therefore do not generate a fair return, forcing the Commission to hold a hearing each time a utility claimed that applying a particular policy would produce an unjust and unreasonable end result would effectively end the \u201cjudicially-recognized exception to [a utility\u2019s] statutory right to a Commission hearing ... where the facts are not in dispute and the new tariff contravenes valid and explicit FPC [now FERC] regulations or policy.\u201d <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, </em>551 F.2d 460, 463 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>citing FPC v. Texaco, Inc., </em>377 U.S. 33, 84 S.Ct. 1105, 12 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964), <em>United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., </em>351 U.S. 192, 205, 76 S.Ct. 763, 771, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956), and <em>Municipal Light Boards v. FPC, </em>450 F.2d 1341 (D.C. Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 989, 92 S.Ct. 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 455 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">This is not a case in which the utility alleges that unjust and unreasonable rates are driving it into bankruptcy. Nor is it a case in which the utility claims that its ability to provide service to its customers is threatened. Jersey Central\u2019s expressed concern is for the well-being of its common equity investors who are paying the carrying charges on the debt and preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>stock. That one may sympathize with their plight does not mean that the Commission acted beyond its authority. No hearing was required because the Commission was entitled to apply its established rule excluding the cost of abandoned projects from the rate base and to read the end result test as applying only to rates computed from items properly included in the rate base. The Forked River investment could be excluded from the rate base and there was no dispute about other items that would require a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Nothing we have said, of course, is intended to prejudice any new rate tariff filing or request for a waiver by Jersey Central. We hold only that the Commission here acted within its authority and, for that reason, its decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. <em>See United Gas Public Service Co. v.

The deficiency may not be thus added to the rate base, for the obvious reason that the hazard that the property will not earn a profit remains on the company in the case of a regulated, as well as an unregulated, business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">315 U.S. at 590, 62 S.Ct. at 745 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-14\">.
