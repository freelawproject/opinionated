Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a \u201creasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\u201d); <em>United States v. Oakes, </em>564 F.2d 384, 387 (10th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 926, 98 S.Ct. 1493, 55 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (same); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>497 F.2d 548, 550 (4th Cir.1974) (same); <em>Presser v. Illinois, </em>116 U.S. 252, 265, 6 S.Ct. 580, 584, 29 L.Ed. 615 (1886) (second amendment confers rights as against activity by the \u201cfederal government only\u201d); <em>Quilici v. Village of Morton Grove, </em>695 F.2d 261, 269-70 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 194, 78 L.Ed.2d 170 (1983) (same); <em>Cases v. United States, </em>131 F.2d 916, 921 (1st Cir.1942), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 770, 63 S.Ct. 1431, 87 L.Ed. 1718 (1943) (same); <em>United States v. Warin, </em>530 F.2d 103, 106 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 948, 96 S.Ct. 3168, 49 L.Ed.2d 1185 (1976) (second amendment grants right to the state, not the individual); <em>Stevens v. United States, </em>440 F.2d 144, 149 (6th Cir.1971) (same). <em>See Lewis v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 65 n. 8, 100 S.Ct. 915, 920 n. 8, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980). Principles of res judicata bar appellant\u2019s remaining claims against the chief of police. <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). And, the opinion of the magistrate, adopted by the district court, adequately discusses any other of appellant\u2019s claims. The judgment of the district court, dismissing appellant\u2019s case, is</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
