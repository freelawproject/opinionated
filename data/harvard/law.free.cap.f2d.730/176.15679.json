The suits of 279 asbestos workers, who claimed damages for personal injury, were then stayed by the federal district court in which these claims were pending. Counsel for the asbestos workers sought to vacate the stay by seeking certiorari in this court. The bankruptcy court cited him for contempt of its stay order by thus seeking to vacate the stay. Counsel then applied to us for a writ of prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>to prevent the contempt proceedings. We deny both applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Separate suits were filed by 279 asbestos workers alleging that they suffered from asbestosis, cancer caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, and other asbestos-related diseases. The original defendants in all cases were (1) Mine Safety Appliance Company; (2) Norton Company and Textron, Inc.; and (3) Johns-Manville Corporation (Manville), the executive officers of Man-ville, and the insurers of both Manville and its executive officers \u2014 Travelers Insurance Company and Home Insurance Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The asbestos workers sued Travelers and Home Insurance companies under a Louisiana statute which affords injured persons \u201ca right of direct action against the insurer ... alone, or against the insured and insurer jointly and in solido ____\u201d La.R.S. \u00a7 22:655.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In 112 cases, the asbestos-worker plaintiffs have settled their claims against Man-ville <em>and </em>its executive officers, but not with the other defendants. In 247 cases, the asbestos-worker plaintiffs have settled their claims against Mine Safety Appliance Company, but not those against Norton and Textron. The cases, therefore, now fit into three categories, according to the defendants still sought to be held liable. In one group of cases, the only defendant is Norton and Textron. In a second group, the defendants are Manville, Manville\u2019s executive officers, the insurers, Norton, and Textron. Mine Safety Appliance is no longer a defendant in these two groups of cases because it has settled with the plaintiffs in each of them. In a third group, 32 cases, no settlements have been reached, and the cases are still pending against all of the original defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">While these cases were pending, Manville filed a petition for reorganization in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The petition caused an automatic stay of proceedings against Manville pursuant to 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 362(a). Thereafter, the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana stayed proceedings as to all of the defendants. The plaintiffs sought review by writ of certiorari regarding the cases in the first category, those in which the only defendant is Norton and Textron. That case was consolidated by us with two appeals. In <em>Wedgeworth v. Fibreboard, </em>706 F.2d 541 (5th Cir.1983), we considered both the two appeals and the asbestos workers\u2019 writ application, and held that the automatic stays applied only to Manville, not to the codefendants. We, therefore, vacated each of the district court orders which were predicated only on the automatic stay provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">In two of the cases considered in <em>Wedge-worth, </em>however, each district court had in addition invoked its own discretionary power to grant a stay against the codefendants in the interest of justice and in control of its docket. Quoting <em>Landis v. North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 254-55, 57 S.Ct. 163, 164-65, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936), we held that, in considering whether or not to enter a stay, a district court must balance the interests involved. 706 F.2d at 545. \u201cThe party seeking a stay bears the burden of justifying a delay tagged to another legal proceeding,\u201d we said. It \u201cmust make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to some one [sic] else. Only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one case be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court must also \u201ccarefully consider the time reasonably ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>pected for resolution of the \u2018other case,\u2019 for \u2018stay orders will be reversed when they are found to be immoderate or of an indefinite duration.\u2019[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] ... Thus, a stay must be \u2018so framed in the inception that its force will be spent within reasonable limits, so far at least as they are susceptible of prevision and description.\u2019 <em>Landis, </em>299 U.S. at 257, 57 S.Ct. at 167.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We concluded that \u201cthe hardship of a stay on the plaintiffs, many of whom allege that they are dying from asbestosis, is substantial and, in some instances, permanent. The grim reaper has called while judgment waits. Just as obviously, the bankruptcy proceedings are not likely to conclude in the immediate future. A stay hinged on completion of those proceedings is manifestly'\u2018indefinite.\u2019\u201d 706 F.2d at 545. Finding no \u201cclear case\u201d of hardship against or inequity to the co-defendants sufficient to offset the prejudice to the plaintiffs, we vacated the stays.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Thereafter, on September 15, 1983, the bankruptcy court issued an order (the \u201cSeptember order\u201d) that modified its prior orders. It expressly stayed \u201cany and all suits against any past, present or future Manville officer, director or employee or against [his or her] insurers.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It added that this paragraph \u201cwill be modified and amended regarding the impact of these findings and conclusions on the discovery rights of the parties,\u201d such modification to be detailed in a separate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">On October 6, one day before the bankruptcy court issued its promised supplemental order (the October order), the Louisiana district court, in response to the asbestos workers\u2019 motion to compel discovery against Travelers Insurance Company, stayed the proceedings pending before it to the extent prescribed in the September bankruptcy court order. Imputing to the September order a scope beyond its express terms, the district court also stayed discovery against Travelers Insurance Company which was the insurer both of Manville and its officers, directors, and employees. The court reasoned that, although the bankruptcy court had not explicitly stayed discovery against the insurer, the Travelers policy was issued to Man-ville and afforded coverage to the described individuals \u201cin [Travelers\u2019] capacity as Johns-Manville\u2019s insurer.\u201d Hence, the district court considered the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to stay discovery against Travelers in its capacity as insurer of the individuals to be inadvertent, and sought to afford the bankruptcy court a reasonable time to fashion appropriate discovery provisions. The district court declined to certify its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The district court\u2019s perspicacity was confirmed the next day when the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>court issued the October order. That order modified the April order to enjoin \u201call entities\u201d from \u201ccommencing, conducting, or continuing any discovery proceedings against Manville\u2019s insurers in any direct action suits____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Counsel for the asbestos workers, meanwhile, had not been idle. On the New York front, counsel filed a notice that he was appealing the bankruptcy court\u2019s September order to the district court for the Southern District of New York (the New York district court). The bankruptcy court issued its October order before that appeal was docketed, however, so counsel filed another notice of appeal, this time from the October order, on November 7. Returning to Louisiana, counsel then petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari to obtain relief from the Louisiana district court\u2019s stay. Thereafter, counsel, back again in New York, notified all parties and the bankruptcy court of his intention to move for relief from that court\u2019s stays pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Alternatively, counsel requested an order modifying the stays to permit the suits against defendants other than Manville to proceed to judgment, but not to enforcement of a judgment. The asbestos workers\u2019 counsel subsequently requested that his motion be adjourned <em>sine die.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Manville then countered by obtaining from the bankruptcy court an order commanding counsel for the asbestos workers to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for violating the bankruptcy court\u2019s stays by seeking a writ of certiorari from this court. The asbestos workers\u2019 counsel responded by petitioning this court for a writ of prohibition directed against the show cause order in the bankruptcy court. To give us time to act on that motion, that court postponed the hearing date on the show cause order until February 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">We later denied the petition for writ of prohibition \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of petitioner to renew it should [the] necessity appear and also without implying either that this Court has jurisdiction [to issue such a writ] or [that] the petition has merit.\u201d Thereafter, we denied the asbestos workers\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari. In the light of these developments, the bankruptcy court continued contempt proceedings \u201cwithout date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">At present, then, this is the situation:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">1. The Louisiana district court has enforced, by its own stay order, the order of the bankruptcy court staying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">a. Suits and discovery against Manville and its insurers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">b. Suits against any past, present or future officers, directors or employees of Manville, or against their insurers in direct action suits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">c. Discovery proceedings against or directed to Manville\u2019s current employees, agents, and others not named individually as parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">The stay applies only to those proceedings specified by the bankruptcy court: suits against Manville, its past, present, or future officers, directors, or employees and their insurers. Proceedings against the co-defendants Norton Company, Textron, Inc., and Mine Safety Company may continue in their normal course.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">2. Two appeals by the asbestos workers from the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders are pending in the New York district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">3. The asbestos workers\u2019 motion for relief from the bankruptcy court\u2019s stay order is pending in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>4. The bankruptcy court contempt proceeding has been continued with no date having been set for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The petition that sought to have us vacate the stay of proceedings in the district court is denominated a petition for writ of certiorari. Certiorari is a remedy for the correction of errors of law apparent on the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent, therefore, that the application seeks relief for the correction of such an error, it is properly labelled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mandamus, on the other hand, is the proper remedy to control procedural decisions of district courts when no other adequate means of seeking relief is available.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the All Writs Act, however, the form of the writ is of less importance than the substantive question whether an extraordinary remedy is available.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In connection with applications for writs of mandamus and orders seeking the stay of district court proceedings, we have developed a body of rules concerning the circumstances under which relief from an interlocutory ruling will be granted. We apply those rules here, principally because, regardless of the title given the writ, what is sought is review of a stay order, review that we have usually accomplished only by appeal under \u00a7 1292(b) or by mandamus. Regardless of the form of the writ we base jurisdiction on the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, which should be invoked only in the clearest and most compelling cases. <em>Kerr v. United States District Court for the Northern District of California, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402-03, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2123-24, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Sessions, </em>672 F.2d 564 (5th Cir.1982). In general, the petitioner seeking such an order must show that no other adequate means exists to attain the requested relief and that his right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d 426 U.S. 402, 96 S.Ct. at 2123, 48 L.Ed.2d at 732; <em>See Sessions, supra, </em>and cases cited therein.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">The asbestos workers contend that <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>precludes the Bankruptcy Courts from staying actions in the district courts against Manville\u2019s insurers, and, we presume, against the executives\u2019 insurers. They further contend that the interim rules adopted by the Second Circuit courts do not provide the bankruptcy court with jurisdiction. Finally, the asbestos workers argue that even if <em>Marathon </em>did not obliterate all bankruptcy court jurisdiction, the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders in this case exceed the scope of whatever jurisdiction that court retains.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">Like the Louisiana district judge, we read the bankruptcy court order as directed only to the litigants, and not as an attempt to restrain federal district courts from the exercise of their constitutional power. We, therefore, confine ourselves to the question whether <em>Marathon, </em>or some other limitation on bankruptcy court jurisdiction, provides a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to relief from the bankruptcy court stay. For present purposes, we assume, without deciding, that the district court has discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to disregard the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">This circuit, and every other one that has ruled on the issue, has refused to accord <em>Marathon </em>the broad sweep urged by petitioners. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-598, expanded the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts to include original jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471. In <em>Matter of Braniff Airways, </em>700 F.2d 214, 215 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2122, 77 L.Ed.2d 1302 (1983), \u201cwe conclude[d] that 28 United States Code \u00a7\u00a7 1471(a) and (b) were not invalidated by the <em>Marathon </em>decision, but if they were, nevertheless, the jurisdictional grant of 28 United States Code \u00a7 1334 [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] remains effective during the transitional period.\u201d (Footnote omitted).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit, in a thorough opinion, reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That court read the <em>Marathon </em>opinion, as limited by the concurring opinion of Justices Rehnquist and O\u2019Connor, to hold unconstitutional only 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(c) \u2014 the section purporting to vest direct and nonderivative jurisdiction in the bankruptcy courts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the interim rules, adopted in substantially the same form by the judicial councils of each circuit, the district courts exercise the power to refer bankruptcy cases to bankruptcy courts that they had employed under the Chandler Act. This referral is automatic, but is subject to numerous safeguards to address the concern articulated by the <em>Marathon </em>plurality: that \u201cthe essential attributes of judicial power are retained in the Art. Ill court.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These safeguards include the following: referrals may be withdrawn by the district court at any time for any reason; only the district court has power to enter a final judgment in a \u201crelated case\u201d (i.e. a <em>Marathon </em>-type case) unless the parties consent to disposition by a bankruptcy judge; all bankruptcy court orders are subject to <em>de novo </em>review in the district courts, review is mandatory for orders in related matters and upon motion of the parties or <em>sua sponte </em>by the court in traditional proceedings. <em>See White Motor Corp. v. Citibank, N.A., </em>704 C.2d 254, 256-57 (6th Cir.1983). Section 1334, which vests original jurisdiction over bankruptcy proceedings in the district courts exclusive of the states, provides an alternative jurisdictional basis during the transitional period or at least until April 1, 1984, when \u00a7 1334 is to be amended to give the district courts only appellate jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Finally, the present matter bears little resemblance to the situation in <em>Marathon. </em>In that case the bankruptcy court adjudicated to final judgment the debtor\u2019s contract claim against a third party, a claim that was based entirely on state law. These proceedings, however, involve interlocutory orders \u2014 issued under the bankruptcy laws \u2014 staying actions found to be detrimental to the estate. In <em>Marathon, </em>the debtor\u2019s claim would have been solely a matter for state courts absent \u00a7 1471(c) or diversity jurisdiction; the present dispute over the stay orders hardly could arise outside the bankruptcy context.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In support of their assertion that the bankruptcy court exceeded whatever jurisdiction may have survived <em>Marathon, </em>the asbestos workers eite several bankruptcy court cases that have plumbed the depths of \u00a7 1471(b) jurisdiction over \u201cproceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\u201d They also rely on Collier on Bankruptcy, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7X\"><em>[TJhere must be some reasonable nexus between a particular civil proceeding and the title 11 case to bring that proceeding within the section 1471(b) grant of </em>jurisdiction____ [Tjhere is a limited class of civil proceeding the nature of which is such that there is no logical connection of any kind between that proceeding and the title 11 case. Those cases fall without the comprehensive grant of jurisdiction of section 1471.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acj\">The asbestos workers assert that no \u201creasonable nexus\u201d exists between their direct action suits against Travelers Insurance Co. and the Manville bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">We do not agree with that conclusion. In each of the cases cited to us there was no real link between the third-party dispute and the bankruptcy estate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, both the bankruptcy court and the New York district court have found that direct actions and discovery against the insurers of Manville and its executive officers pose a significant threat to the estate.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">The Bankruptcy Reform Act arms bankruptcy courts with broad powers, analogous to those of a court of equity, to protect the estate. First, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(e) confers jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court over \u201call of the property, whereever [sic] located, of the debtor____\u201d Second, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) a bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ruptcy court is authorized, once jurisdiction is established, to \u201cissue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\u201d This provision includes the authority to enjoin litigants from pursuing actions pending in other courts that threaten the integrity of a bankrupt\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because we have construed the stay order as directed to the litigants rather than any courts, we have no occasion to consider the effect of the limitation on the bankruptcy court\u2019s power contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">A bankruptcy court shall have the powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty, <em>but may not enjoin another court </em>or punish a criminal contempt not committed in the presence of the judge of the court or warranting a punishment of imprisonment. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The bankruptcy court therefore has authority to issue a stay order intended to shield the insurers of Johns-Manville and its executives if the insurance policies constitute \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d That term is defined by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) to include \u201call of the following property, wherever located: (1) [subject to several exceptions not here relevant], all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d In upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s stay of direct actions against Manville\u2019s insurers, the New York district court held that \u00a7 541(a)(1) embraced insurance within the definition of \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d <em>Johns-Manville Corp. v. The Asbestos Litigation Group (In re Johns-Manville), </em>40 B.R. 219 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (affirming bankruptcy court\u2019s stay orders). Although the asbestos workers find some support in Collier on Bankruptcy<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for their challenge to this finding, the weight of authority supports the New York district court\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the asbestos workers have failed to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to extraordinary relief. Given the benefit of the assumption that the Louisiana district court had discretion to exercise, the asbestos workers have not shown that it abused its discretion by enforcing the bankruptcy court\u2019s stays. When the district courts whose actions were reviewed in <em>Wedgeworth </em>entered stays, the bankruptcy court had neither defined the bankrupt estate as including the insurance policies nor issued a specific stay order. Since that time the bankruptcy court has made specific findings of fact as to the effect of discovery and litigation on the debtor\u2019s estate, and as to the significance of intact insurance coverage as a bulwark against erosion of the estate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The petition fails also because adequate relief is available by other means. The harm the asbestos workers complain of \u2014 delay in proceeding to judgment \u2014 is caused by the Louisiana district court\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the bankruptcy court\u2019s stay order. Their real grievance arises from that order. They may obtain direct interlocutory review of that order in the New York district court or the Second Circuit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Additionally, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) provides a mechanism for seeking relief from a stay by motion in the bankruptcy court.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The asbestos workers have demonstrated their ability to invoke these processes. Relief by extraordinary writ may be had only when no other remedy is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">No alternative remedy existed in <em>Wedge-worth </em>because, at the time that case was decided, the bankruptcy court had entered no appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Counsel also seek to deflect the contempt citation by seeking a writ of prohibition. The show cause order seemed intended to punish counsel for seeking a writ of certiorari from this court. While we had the petition for certiorari under advisement, the bankruptcy court continued the show cause order; that continuation is now indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">It is entirely possible, indeed likely, that the bankruptcy court will dismiss the show cause order upon learning that we have denied the asbestos workers relief from the Louisiana district court\u2019s order. We decline the invitation to consider confronting another court over a matter that may become moot. We note, however, that our denial of the petition is without prejudice, should it become necessary for counsel to seek relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for writ of certiorari is DENIED. The petition for writ of prohibition is DENIED without prejudice to the right of petitioner to renew it should the necessity appear and also without implying either that this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition or that the petition has merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. The asbestos workers contend that respirators manufactured by Mine Safety Appliance Company, Norton Company, and Textron, Inc., and used in the plant where they worked were defective. Johns-Manville is a manufacturer of asbestos products with a plant located in Louisiana. The asbestos workers allege that their injuries were caused by asbestos fibers inhaled at this plant and in the surrounding area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\">. <em>Landis v.
