Watts, Gregory Pritchett, and Continental Hotel Group, Inc., brought suit against defendant Army Times Publishing Company (ATPC) alleging that they were libeled by an article published in the defendant\u2019s publication, <em>Federal Times. </em>Entitled \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse?\u201d, the article concerned a congressional inquiry into a loan guarantee of almost one million dollars made by the FHA to refurbish a motel owned by the Continental Hotel Group, an Alabama corporation. Plaintiffs Watts and Pritchett are both officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-23\">The defendant moved to dismiss the action on the basis that no personal jurisdiction existed in Alabama. After a hearing, the district court denied the motion, finding sufficient contacts for personal jurisdiction. The district court, however, granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify its order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) for interlocutory appeal because the jurisdictional issue was a controlling question of law \u201cas to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). This court agreed to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">I. Jurisdictional Pacts</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqj\">The relevant jurisdictional facts as found by the district court are undisputed by the parties. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-6\">1. During all times relevant, the <em>Federal Times </em>was a weekly newspaper based in Washington, D.C. and designed to appeal principally to federal civilian employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-7\">2. On November 24, 1980, and again on May 25, 1981, Alabama accounted for approximately 2.1% of the <em>Federal Times\u2019 </em>total circulation, with between 914 and 928 of the newspaper\u2019s issues circulated in the state on each of said dates; and California accounted for the largest percentage of the newspaper\u2019s total circulation, with between 11.6 and 11.9% of the newspaper\u2019s total circulation on each of said dates, followed by Washington, D.C. and the surrounding area, with between 11.6 and 11.8% of the newspaper\u2019s total circulation on each of said dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-8\">3. Almost all of the <em>Federal Times\u2019 </em>circulation in Alabama was by mail subscription.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-9\">4. The <em>Federal Times \u2019 </em>derived $1,591.20 in classified advertising from Alabama, an amount representing less than <em>lk </em>of 1% of the newspaper\u2019s total advertising revenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-10\">5. All the information used in the allegedly libelous article was gathered from sources in Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-11\">6. At the year-end 1980 and 1981, the <em>Federal Times </em>had twelve full-time and part-time regular employees, all located in Washington, D.C., and had several \u201cstringers\u201d located throughout the country but not in Alabama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-12\">7. ATPC is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-13\">8. In addition to the <em>Federal Times, </em>ATPC publishes three other weekly newspapers, the <em>Army Times, </em>the <em>Navy Times, </em>and the <em>Air Force Times, </em>all directed to military personnel, and it publishes two monthly newspapers, the <em>Times Magazine, </em>which is distributed with the three military newspapers, and the <em>Military Market, </em>which is distributed free of charge to exchange and commissary managers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-15\">9. On November 24, 1980, and December 21, 1981, the \u201ctotal number of subscribers in Alabama\u201d for all of ATPC\u2019s publications ranged from a circulation of 7,053 to 7,417, and the \u201ctotal paid circulation in Alabama\u201d for all of ATPC\u2019s publications ranged from a circulation of 7,988 to 8,307.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-16\">10. ATPC had three Alabama distributing agents who were paid a commission for each publication issue sold by them through military exchange newsstands and vending machines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-17\">11. ATPC derived $219,200.00 in 1980 and $245,900.00 in 1981 from the sale of all its publications in Alabama; and for 1980 approximately %o of 1% and for 1981 approximately Vio of 1% of the company\u2019s total advertising revenues came from classified advertising purchased by persons residing or stationed in Alabama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-20\">12. ATPC owned and operated the Army Times Marketing Service, which solicited renewal subscriptions in Alabama and throughout the rest of the country for all of the company\u2019s publications as well as those of other publishers and solicited renewals of several credit cards. ATPC estimates that for 1980, and again for 1981, the Marketing Service made approximately 3,500 renewal solicitation telephone calls on behalf of all the service\u2019s clients to persons in Alabama, with approximately 395 of these calls being on behalf of <em>Federal Times.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-21\">From this evidence, the court concluded that \u201ca picture emerges of [ATPC] as a nationwide publishing operation designed, through its weekly newspapers and monthly magazines and its national marketing service, to penetrate and exploit the various pockets of federal civilian and military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>personnel scattered throughout the country.\u201d It also found that Alabama was \u201ca significant market, if not one of several principal markets, for the newspaper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">II. The Sufficiency of ATPC\u2019s Contacts</p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">Based on its factual findings, the district court concluded that adequate contacts existed between the defendant and Alabama to make it fair and reasonable to require ATPC to defend in that state. It found that although the actual circulation figures for <em>Federal Times </em>in Alabama of between 914 and 928 a month were not quantitatively great, the \u201cquality and nature\u201d of the defendant\u2019s activities in the state were such that it justified a finding of personal jurisdiction. In making its determination, the district court relied on this circuit\u2019s law that where first amendment considerations are present the plaintiff must make \u201ca greater showing of contact to satisfy the due process clause than is necessary in asserting jurisdiction over other types of tortious activity.\u201d <em>Cox Enterprises, Inc. v. Holt, </em>678 F.2d 936, 937 (11th Cir.1982), <em>quoting New York Times Company v. Connor, </em>365 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s ruling, the United States Supreme Court decided the cases of <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984) and <em>Calder v. Jones, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 SCt. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984). The Court in <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Calder </em>\u201crejected] categorically\u201d the notion that first amendment considerations entered into a determination of whether personal jurisdiction existed, <em>Keeton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1481 n. 11; <em>Calder, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1487, and made clear that the personal jurisdiction inquiry in a libel case is the same as that used in all cases, focusing on \u201cthe relationship between the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u201d <em>Keeton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1478, <em>quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 2579, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977). This circuit\u2019s requirement of greater contacts for a finding of personal jurisdiction in first amendment cases is thus no longer valid law after <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Calder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-14\">The district court in finding that personal jurisdiction existed applied the \u201cgreater contacts\u201d standard of <em>Cox, </em>a more stringent standard than is now required after <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Calder. </em>Although the jurisdictional facts here may have presented a close question under the \u201cgreater contacts\u201d standard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that once the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d test is applied, the district court was clearly correct in finding personal jurisdiction. A review of ATPC\u2019s contacts with Alabama shows that the relevant factors outlined in <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Calder </em>for exercising personal jurisdiction were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-15\">Although the information for the allegedly libelous article was obtained from congressional hearings, the focus of the article was on a project being pursued in Alabama by the plaintiffs, all of whom are Alabama citizens. The defendant obviously knew that the effect of any injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 reputation would be primarily focused in Alabama, the plaintiffs\u2019 state of residence. <em>Cf. Calder, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1487. Moreover, as the district court found, Alabama is \u2019a \u201csignificant\u201d market for the defendant\u2019s publications and the defendant actively undertook efforts to maintain its Alabama readership. Finally, although the circulation of the defendant\u2019s publications is not of the magnitude of those involved in <em>Keeton </em>and <em>Calder, </em>we agree with the district court that a monthly circulation in Alabama of over 900 copies of <em>Federal Times,'</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>combined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>the defendant\u2019s purposeful efforts to enroll subscribers in the forum state, justifies a finding that ATPC could reasonably anticipate being \u201chaled into court\u201d in Alabama. <em>Worldwide Volkswagen Corporation v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 297-98, 100 S.Ct. 559, 567-68, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980); <em>Keeton, supra </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1481.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">\u25a0 Having determined that the subject of this litigation focused on events and parties in Alabama, that Alabama has a significant interest in vindicating the rights of its citizens, and that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the readership market available in Alabama, we conclude that the lower court did not err in finding that sufficient minimum contacts existed to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Therefore, the district court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1468-11\">. Interlocutory review of the personal jurisdiction question in this case as one with \"substantial ground for difference of opinion\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) was granted prior to the Supreme Court's rejection of the heightened contact standard previously used in this circuit for first amendment cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1468-17\">. The total paid circulation in Alabama for all of ATPC\u2019s publications between November 24, 1980 and December 21, 1981 fluctuated between 7,988 and 8,307. When all of the defendant's circulation in Alabama is taken into account, therefore, the significance of the defendant's quantitative contacts with Alabama approaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>that of <em>Hustler </em>magazine to New Hampshire in the <em>Keeton </em>case (sale of ten to fifteen thousand issues in New Hampshire each month).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
