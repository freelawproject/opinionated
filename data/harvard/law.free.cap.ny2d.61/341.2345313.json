Since it is an undisputed fact that Con Edison was the tenant in occupancy and lessee of record on the day of presentation, it had the right to purchase its apartment. <em>(Wissner v 15 West 72nd St. Assoc., </em>87 AD2d 120, 58 NY2d 645; <em>Payn v Lyras, </em>91 AD2d 557, 59 NY2d 970; <em>Thuna v Di Sanza, </em>102 Misc 2d 342, 78 AD2d 517; <em>Trachter v Parker 86th Assoc., </em>115 Misc 2d 271.) II. Con Edison cannot be excluded from purchasing simply because it is a corporation. <em>(Cooper v 140 East Assoc., </em>27 NY2d 115; <em>Matter of Cale Dev. Co. v Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>94 AD2d 229; <em>Richards v Kaskel, </em>32 NY2d 524; <em>Wissner v 15 West 72nd St. Assoc., </em>58 NY2d 645.) III. The landlord-sponsors\u2019 plan neither purports to restrict the statutory rights of tenants in occupancy nor can it have that effect. <em>(Payn v Lyras, </em>91 AD2d 557, 59 NY2d 970; <em>Cooper v 140 East Assoc., </em>27 NY2d 115.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-6\"><em>Steven R. Lapidus </em>and <em>Stanford M. Singer </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuS4\">I. Con Edison, as a corporation, had no right under the Rent Stabilization Code to subscribe for shares under a co-operative offering made solely and specifically to natural persons. <em>(After Six v 201 East 66th St. Assoc., 87 </em>AD2d 153, 57 NY2d 835; <em>Matter of Cortland-Clinton, Inc. v New York State Dept. of Health, </em>59 AD2d 228; <em>Matter of Walter &amp; Samuels v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>81 AD2d 212; <em>Matter of Sommer v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>93 AD2d 481; <em>Matter of Cole Dev. Co. v Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>94 AD2d 229; <em>Eckstein v United States, </em>452 F2d 1036.) II. Since Con Edison did not tender a subscription agreement, it was not in privity with the sponsor and has no standing to maintain this suit. Summary judgment was, therefore, properly granted in the sponsor\u2019s favor by the court below. <em>(Mobay Chem. Co. v Hudson Foam Plastics Corp., </em>277 F Supp 413; <em>Hall v Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>282 App Div 203, 306 NY 909; <em>Gram v Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>300 NY 375.) III. Con Edison\u2019s action for specific performance is barred on grounds of laches. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>(Dunham v Ottinger, </em>243 NY 423; <em>Schumann v 250 Tenants Corp., </em>65 Misc 2d 253; <em>Richards v Kaskel, </em>32 NY2d 524; <em>Matter of Greenthal &amp; Co. v Lefkowitz, </em>32 NY2d 457; <em>Tuvim v 10 East 30 Corp., </em>32 NY2d 541; <em>Apfelberg v East 56th Plaza, </em>78 AD2d 606; <em>Groesbeck v Morgan, </em>206 NY 385; <em>Eastern Shopping Centers v Trenholm Motels, </em>33 AD2d 930.)

Any tenant lawfully in possession on the date of presentation of a conversion plan is a tenant in occupancy. <em>(Thuna v Di Sanza, </em>78 AD2d 517; <em>Wissner v 15 West 72nd St. Assoc., </em>87 AD2d 120, 58 NY2d 645; <em>Burns v 500 East 83rd St. Corp., </em>90 AD2d 706, 59 NY2d 784; <em>520 East 81st St. Assoc. v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>38 NY2d 525.) II. Any tenant in occupancy has the right to purchase under a conversion plan. <em>(Payn v Lyras, </em>91 AD2d 557, 59 NY2d 970.) III. The right of a tenant in occupancy to purchase under a conversion plan is not dependent on the tenant\u2019s right to renew. <em>(Matter of Walter &amp; Samuels v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>81 AD2d 212, 55 NY2d 824; <em>Matter of Cale Dev.

The right of a tenant in occupancy to purchase also is not dependent on tax considerations or whether the unit is used as a transitory residence or whether the lease specifies who may occupy the apartment. <em>(Richards v Kaskel, </em>32 NY2d 524; <em>520 East 81st St. Assoc. v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>38 NY2d 525; <em>Matter of Cale Dev.

(Rent Stabilization Code), on the date a co-operative conversion plan is presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tenants is entitled to purchase in its own name the shares in the co-operative corporation allocated to its apartment, notwithstanding that the plan purports to limit the corporation\u2019s rights to the transfer of its purchase option to an individual who will take in his own right, and notwithstanding that the apartment is not the \u201cprimary residence\u201d of the corporation or any of its officers. The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\">Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Ed), is the tenant of apartment No. 30-H at 10 West 66th Street, which it maintains for the use of its directors, officers and guests. The building was owned by Park Ten Associates (Park Ten) and is rent stabilized. Con Ed\u2019s lease, entered into in July, 1970, has been extended several times, the most recent extension having been signed by Park Ten and Con Ed on September 9, 1979, two months before Park Ten filed its preliminary plan for conversion of the building to co-operative ownership. The plan as finally accepted for filing acknowledged that all 279 apartments in the building were subject to the Rent Stabilization Law, and defendants concede that Con Ed is the tenant in occupancy of a rent-stabilized apartment. The plan limited the offering of shares in 10 West 66th Street Corporation, the co-operative corporation to which ownership of the building has been transferred, to \u201cindividuals * * * for such individual\u2019s own account and his personal occupancy of his apartment\u201d and restated that limitation as a representation in the accompanying subscription agreement form, but also stated that \u201c[e]ach tenant in occupancy * * * will have an exclusive right * * * to purchase his apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">After approval of the plan by the Attorney-General it was presented to the tenants, including Con Ed. Within the permitted time Con Ed submitted a subscription agreement executed by Aaron Sadove, together with a form authorizing Sadove to purchase as the designee of Con Ed, and a letter from Sadove stating his contention that the representation in the subscription agreement was inapplicable and of no force or effect in relation to a subscription by an individual on behalf of a corporation. After Park Ten rejected the subscription, Con Ed began the present action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for judgment requiring Park Ten and the co-operative corporation to complete the subscription agreement and perform pursuant to the plan. Con Ed having moved and defendants having cross-moved for summary judgment, Special Term granted Con Ed\u2019s motion and denied defendants\u2019 cross motion. The Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting, reversed, holding that a tenant who does not have capacity to compel renewal of its lease is not a bona fide tenant in occupancy. We now reverse and reinstate Special Term\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Section 352-eeee (subd 2, par [d], cl [ix]) of the General Business Law provides that \u201ctenants in occupancy on the date the attorney general accepts the plan [for conversion to co-operative or condominium ownership] for filing shall have the exclusive right to purchase their dwelling units or the shares allocated thereto\u201d, and that provision is repeated in essence in section 61 (subd 4, par [b]) of the Rent Stabilization Code. The phrase \u201ctenant in occupancy\u201d is not defined in the General Business Law, the Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, tit YY) or the Rent Stabilization Code. The Special Term Justice looked to the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law (Administrative Code, tit Y) and finding in subdivision m of section Y51-3.0 of the Administrative Code a definition of \u201ctenant\u201d which includes a \u201cperson entitled to the possession\u201d of the accommodation and in subdivision h a definition of \u201cperson\u201d which includes a corporation, concluded that a corporation could qualify as a tenant in occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Although titles Y and YY of the Administrative Code can properly be read together as statutes <em>in pari materia </em>(McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes, \u00a7 221) there is additional and equally strong support for the conclusion reached by Special Term in section 8605 of McKinney\u2019s Unconsolidated Laws (Local Emergency Housing Rent Control Act, \u00a7 5 [L 1962, ch 21, \u00a7 1, subd 5, as amd]). The final unnumbered paragraph of that section directs that \u201cno local law or ordinance shall subject to such regulation and control any housing accommodation which is not occupied by the tenant in possession as his primary residence\u201d but limits that direction by the proviso that \u201csuch housing accommodation not occupied by the tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>in possession as his primary residence shall continue to be subject to regulation and control as provided for herein unless the city housing rent agency issues an order decontrolling such accommodation, which the agency shall do upon application by the landlord whenever it is established by any facts and circumstances which, in the judgment of the agency, may have a bearing upon the question of residence, that the tenant maintains his primary residence at some place other than at such housing accommodation.\u201d (L 1971, ch 373, \u00a7 2.) On the basis of that provision we held in <em>Wissner v 15 West 72nd St. Assoc. </em>(58 NY2d 645, affg for reasons stated in opn at Appellate Division 87 AD2d 120) that a tenant to whom the landlord had granted three successive renewals was a Rent Stabilization Law tenant in possession entitled to purchase the shares allocated to her apartment, even though the landlord could have avoided that result by refusing a renewal lease pursuant to section 54 of the Rent Stabilization Code and seeking decontrol of the premises pursuant to section 8605 because not occupied as a primary residence. By a parity of reasoning, there being nothing in the applicable provisions that explicitly excludes a corporation from tenant in occupancy status, it follows that as the lessee of record on the critical offering date Con Ed had the exclusive right to purchase the shares allocated to apartment No. 30-H even though it would not have had that right had Park Ten succeeded, prior to presentation of its offering plan, in decontrolling the apartment and denying Con Ed a renewal lease on \u201cprimary residence\u201d grounds. Nor in our view is it reasonable to conclude, as did the Appellate Division, that the landlord\u2019s failure to follow that procedure and its voluntary renewal of Con Ed\u2019s lease somehow detracts from the <em>bona fides </em>of Con Ed\u2019s status as the \u201ctenant in occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Defendants argue, nevertheless, that the plan expressly limited purchase rights to individuals and points to section 61 (subd 4, par [a], cl [v]) of the Rent Stabilization Code as authority for that provision. They suggest, further, that such a provision is essential because section 216 of the Internal Revenue Code (US Code, tit 26) requires that all tenant shareholders of a co-operative corporation be individuals. The plan provision is, however, inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the legislative direction that \u201ctenants in occupancy on the date the attorney general accepts the plan for filing shall have the exclusive right to purchase their dwelling units or the shares allocated thereto\u201d (General Business Law, \u00a7 352-eeee, subd 2, par [d], cl [ix]), which makes no distinction between individual and corporate tenants. Nor does the Rent Stabilization Code provision on which defendants rely help them, for it simply permits a sponsor to count toward the percentage requirement for acceptance of his plan an individual who purchases, with the approval of a corporate tenant in occupancy, the shares allocated to the corporate apartment. Without that provision such an individual purchaser could not be counted for that purpose, but nothing in it suggests an intention to proscribe the purchase by a corporate tenant in occupancy, against whom the sponsor has not seen fit prior to offering its plan to utilize the procedures provided for in section 8605 of McKinney\u2019s Unconsolidated Laws, of the shares allocated to its apartment, or permits the sponsor to restrict the corporate tenant\u2019s statute-given right to purchase <em>(Payn v Lyras, </em>91 AD2d 557, app withdrawn 59 NY2d 970). Nor, finally, are possible Federal tax consequences under section 216 of the Internal Revenue Code determinative <em>(Richards v Kaskel, </em>32 NY2d 524, 540).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Simons and Kaye concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Order reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
