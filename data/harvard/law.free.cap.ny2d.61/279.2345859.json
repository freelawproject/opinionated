Petitioners-appellants were granted permanent status in the position of principal office assistant by chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980. II.

Appellants are not entitled to permanent status in the title of principal office assistant, pursuant to chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980, on the basis of their performance of out-of-title duties. <em>(Matter of Gavigan v McCoy, </em>37 NY2d 548; <em>Matter of Ainsberg v McCoy, </em>26 NY2d 56; <em>Matter of Meenagh v Dewey, </em>286 NY 292; <em>Amico v Erie County Legislature, </em>36 AD2d 415, 30 NY2d 729; <em>Matter of Fornara v Schroeder, </em>261 NY 363; <em>Matter of Howard v Wyman, </em>28 NY2d 434; <em>Matter of Bernstein v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 437.) II. Article VI (\u00a7 28, subd [b]) of the State Constitution forecloses legislative determinations of individual court staffing needs based upon legitimizing out-of-title. duties. <em>(Corkum v Bartlett, </em>46 NY2d 424; <em>McCoy v Helsby, </em>28 NY2d 790; <em>Saxton v Carey, </em>44 NY2d 545.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b316-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Petitioners contend that, by virtue of the provisions of chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980 (applicable in the Counties of Nassau and Suffolk), they are entitled to permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>competitive class status in the position of principal office assistant, without the necessity of passing a competitive examination. They base this contention on their having performed the duties of that position for the year prior to July 1, 1980, even though, as they concede, they have never been provisionally appointed to that position and their work was out of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Supreme Court granted their petition and directed that they be appointed to the position of principal office assistant retroactive to July 1, 1980. The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the petition on the merits. We affirm; petitioners are not entitled to the benefit of the provisions of chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Throughout the declaration of legislative findings and intent and the operative provisions of chapter 846 are sprinkled references to positions which have been \u201cprovisionally filled\u201d or \u201cfilled provisionally\u201d, to \u201cpresent incumbents\u201d, \u201cqualified incumbents serving provisionally\u201d, \u201cincumbents of such positions who have served * * * therein\u201d, \u201cincumbents occupying positions\u201d and \u201c[i]ncumbents * * * who have been provisionally promoted\u201d \u2014 none of which terms include employees working out of title. At only one point in the statute is reference made to persons who \u201chave been employed in or performed the duties of such position for one year prior to the effective date hereof\u201d, and then that dependent clause stating the qualifying requirement applies only to \u201cincumbents occupying positions\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As observed by the Appellate Division, we have consistently held \u201cthat the performance of out-of-title duties creates no right to reclassification to a new position involving those duties\u201d. <em>(Matter of Gavigan v McCoy, </em>37 NY2d 548, 550-551, and cases cited therein.) We agree with that court that, in view of these holdings, \u201c[w]ithout a much clearer statement from the Legislature than is found in chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980 that it intends a statute to run counter to this well-established rule, [the courts] would be ill advised to so interpret one of its enactments\u201d. (96 AD2d, p 563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Chief Judge Cooke taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
