The minutes of Equitable\u2019s board of directors and investment and finance committees are not the type of records to which the public should be provided access under the Freedom of Information Law. <em>(Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Mosczydlowski, </em>58 AD2d 234.) II. The Department has expressly assured Equitable that its minutes would be treated as confidential, and the Department is bound by this assurance on which Equitable relied. <em>(NLRB v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 US 132; <em>Nassau-Suffolk Hosp.

III. Equitable\u2019s minutes never passed from its control to become property subject to the free disposition of the Department. <em>(Goland v Central Intelligence Agency, </em>607 F2d 339; <em>Federal Trade Comm. v Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., </em>626 F2d 966; <em>Ryan v Department of Justice, </em>617 F2d 781.) IV. The public interest requires that Equitable\u2019s minutes be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law. <em>(Matter of Lambert v Barsky, </em>91 Misc 2d 443; <em>Matter of Baumgarten v Koch, </em>97 Misc 2d 449; <em>Cirale v 80 Pine St. Corp., </em>35 NY2d 113; <em>Matter of Doolan v Board of Coop.

Consequently, they are subject to public review under FOIL unless it is established that the documents are, in whole or in part, subject to a statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Under New York\u2019s regulatory system, the affairs of domestic insurance companies are subject to examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>by the respondent State Insurance Department (see Insurance Law, art 3 <em>et seq.). </em>To facilitate this review, the insurance companies are required to maintain certain books and records, including minutes of the corporate board of directors\u2019 meetings; to provide respondent with access to these documents at reasonable hours; and to cooperate with respondent in facilitating such examinations (see Insurance Law, \u00a7\u00a7 26-a, 28, 29). A long-standing practice, formalized by the use of circular letters since 1927, developed among insurance companies for the voluntary sending of copies of their minutes to the respondent\u2019s offices, rather than requiring the respondent\u2019s examiners to travel to each insurance company for inspections. Respondent promised to keep such records confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In 1980, a reporter from petitioner, <em>The Washington Post, </em>filed a formal request under FOIL with respondent for access to the minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Directors or Trustees and certain finance committees of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York Life Insurance Company, and The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States for the years 1978 through 1980. After initially refusing the request, respondent indicated that the records would be disclosed, except for those portions that might be deemed exempt under section 87 (subd 2, par [d]) of the Public Officers Law by respondent and the insurance companies after they had an opportunity to review the documents. Subsequently, the Department again reversed itself, denying all access on the grounds that the minutes were not \u201crecords\u201d within the purview of FOIL or, alternatively, that they were exempt from that law\u2019s disclosure requirements. In addition, respondent asserted that its grant of confidentiality precluded disclosure and best protected the interests of policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The Committee on Public Access to Records concluded, in an advisory opinion sought by petitioner, that a blanket denial of access to the minutes was improper because they were \u201crecords\u201d under FOIL which should be disclosed to the extent that respondent, after a complete review, did not establish grounds for exemption. When respondent continued to refuse access, petitioner instituted this article 78 proceeding to compel disclosure of the documents. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>three affected insurance companies were granted leave to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Special Term granted the petition, holding that the corporate board meeting minutes were \u201crecords\u201d regardless of whether the submission of the documents was voluntary. It provided for <em>in camera </em>inspection of those portions which the intervenors or respondent wished to claim were subject to an exemption from the disclosure requirement of FOIL. Before the inspection was held, an appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Appellate Division reversed, holding that the documents were not \u201crecords\u201d as defined in FOIL because they did not aid any governmental decision-making. Rather, they were the private property of the intervenors, voluntarily put in the respondent\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d for convenience under a promise of confidentiality. This court now reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The statutorily stated policy behind FOIL is to promote \u201c[t]he people\u2019s right to know the process of governmental decision-making and to review the documents and statistics leading to determinations\u2019\u2019 (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 84). Consistent with this policy, the Legislature restructured FOIL in 1977 (L 1977, ch 933, \u00a7 1) to make the vast majority of requested documents presumptively discoverable as \u201crecords\u201d under the very broad definition contained therein: \u201cany information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for any agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photo, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes\u201d (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 86, subd 4; see <em>Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Kimball, </em>50 NY2d 575, 580). FOIL is generally liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government (see <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571). The task before this court now is to determine whether the requested minutes are within the scope of FOIL, and if so, whether they are subject to an exemption under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The requested minutes are \u201crecords\u201d under the plain language of FOIL because they are \u201cinformation kept, held, filed, produced * * * by, with or for an agency.\u201d When the plain language of the statute is precise and unambiguous, it is determinative (see <em>Roth v Michelson, </em>55 NY2d 278, 283; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205, 208). Additionally, inclusion of the documents requested here furthers the policy behind FOIL. The minutes are reviewed by respondent as part of its statutory duty to supervise and regulate the insurance industry for the protection of the interests of the people of this State (see Insurance Law, \u00a7\u00a7 26-a, 27, 28, 55 <em>et seq:, </em>196 <em>et seq.). </em>Respondent\u2019s determination as to whether statutory violations have occurred and should be remedied are affected by its inspection of the minutes (see, e.g., Insurance Law, \u00a7 56, subd 4; \u00a7 57, subd 1; \u00a7 67, subd 3). Thus, the documents are relevant to a governmental decision-making process. Moreover, \u201c[t]he statutory definition of \u2018record\u2019 makes nothing turn on the purpose for which a document was produced or the function to which it relates\u201d <em>(Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Kimball, </em>50 NY2d 575, 581, <em>supra). </em>As the expanding boundaries of government become \u201cincreasingly difficult to draw * * * there is bound to be considerable crossover between governmental and nongovernmental activities\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 581).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Respondent\u2019s long-standing promise of confidentiality to the intervenors is irrelevant to whether the requested documents fit within the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201crecords\u201d under FOIL. The definition does not exclude or make any reference to information labeled as \u201cconfidential\u201d by the agency; confidentiality is relevant only when determining whether the record or a portion of it is exempt (see <em>Matter of John P. v Whalen, </em>54 NY2d 89, 96; <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571-572, <em>supra; Church of Scientology v State of New York, </em>61 AD2d 942, 942-943, affd 46 NY2d 906; <em>Matter of Belth v Insurance Dept., </em>95 Misc 2d 18, 19-20). Nor is it relevant that the documents originated outside the government (see <em>Matter of John P. v Whalen, supra, </em>at pp 92-93 [patient\u2019s medical records obtained during investigation of doctor were \u201crecords\u201d, although exempt]). Such a factor is not mentioned or implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>in the statutory definition of records or in the statement of purpose (see Public Officers Law, \u00a7\u00a7 84, 86, subd 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Once determined to be \u201crecords\u201d, the minutes must be disclosed under FOIL unless respondent or the intervenors meet their burden of demonstrating that they fit within one of the statutory exemptions (see <em>Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Kimball, </em>50 NY2d 575, 580, <em>supra; Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571, supra; Public Officers Law, \u00a7 87, subd 2; \u00a7 89, subd 4, par [b]). It is argued that the records should be exempted in their entirety because they are \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by state * * * statute\u201d (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 87, subd 2, par [a]) or, alternatively, because they contain \u201ctrade secrets or are maintained for the regulation of commercial enterprise which if disclosed would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the subject enterprise\u201d (Public Officers Law, \u00a7 87, subd 2, par [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Nothing in FOIL itself expressly calls for exemption of the minutes. Intervenors\u2019 argument that the Insurance Law is a State statute that specifically imposes confidentiality is unpersuasive. The Insurance Law requires the intervenors to maintain certain records, including the minutes requested here, and to provide reasonable access to them for examination by the respondent and its examiners (see Insurance Law, \u00a7\u00a7 26-a, 29). However, the Insurance Law does not include any references to confidentiality or prohibit access by others to these minutes. Similarly, that an insurance company may review and comment on an examination report by respondent before its release to the public (see Insurance Law, \u00a7 30) does not, without more, render the minutes confidential (cf. <em>Matter of John P. v Whalen, </em>54 NY2d 89, 97, <em>supra </em>[clear legislative intent to preserve confidentiality of patients\u2019 medical records gathered in agency investigation]). While an express statement is not necessary to establish an exemption under a State statute, there is a requirement of a clear legislative intent to establish and preserve confidentiality (see <em>id., </em>at pp 96-98) which is not met under the Insurance Law. Lastly, the intervenors\u2019 reliance on a limited confidentiality accorded by common law (see <em>Matter of Cohen v Cocoline Prods., </em>309 NY 119; <em>Matter of Steinway, </em>159 NY 250) is misplaced (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>Matter of Doolan v Board of Coop. Educational Serus., </em>48 NY2d 341, 347). FOIL expressly refers to statutory exemptions so that a common-law privilege is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Intervenors\u2019 claim, that the minutes should be exempted in their entirety as information maintained for its commercial enterprise which would injure its competitive position if disclosed, is also unpersuasive (see Public Officers Law, \u00a7 87, subd 2, par [d]). Intervenors urge that sensitive information about a company\u2019s policy, financial management, investment strategy, and problems will be revealed, and thus ruin its competitive edge and be detrimental to the interests of the policyholders. This claim is presented in the form of conclusory pleading allegations and affidavits to the effect that every page of the minutes contains such sensitive information, all this without the benefit of evidentiary support. Consequently, the burden of proving that the records should be exempted in their entirety has not been met (see <em>Church of Scientology v State of New York, </em>46 NY2d 906, 908, <em>supra). </em>That some portions of the records may be entitled to exemption does not warrant withholding the minutes completely (see <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571, <em>supra). </em>If intervenors can establish that indeed disclosure will substantially injure their competitive positions, they will be entitled to an exemption. Whether and what portions should be protected can be ascertained at the <em>in camera </em>inspection that was ordered by Special Term (see <em>id., </em>at p 571).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Finally, it is noted that just as promises of confidentiality by the Department do not affect the status of documents as records, neither do they affect the applicability of any exemption. As originally enacted, FOIL contained an exemption for records \u201cconfidentially disclosed to an agency and compiled and maintained for the regulation of commercial enterprise, including trade secrets\u201d (L 1974, ch 578; Public Officers Law, former \u00a7 88, subd 6, par b). When the statute was amended this provision was deleted. Thus, respondent had no authority to use its label of confidentiality to prevent disclosure of the minutes (cf. <em>Washington Post Co. v United States Dept. of Health &amp; Human Serus., </em>690 F2d 252, 263 [\u201c(T)o allow the government to make documents exempt by the simple means of promising confidentiality would subvert FOIA\u2019s disclosure mandate\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The intervenors\u2019 other arguments have been considered and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
