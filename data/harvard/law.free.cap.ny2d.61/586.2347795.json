The sentence is predicated upon a prior Florida judgment, entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>after a jury trial on a 10-count amended information, in which the jury convicted defendant of lesser included offenses. Defendant contends that the Florida convictions do not satisfy the New York tests for predicate felonies and he seeks resentence as a first offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On September 23,1981, defendant pleaded guilty in New York to a criminal sale of a controlled substance (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.39), a class B felony, in full satisfaction of a multicount indictment charging him with other narcotic offenses. Prior to sentencing, the People lodged a predicate felony statement against him. Attached to it was the Florida amended information, dated May 7,1976, charging defendant and two others with the crimes of attempted robbery (counts 1 and 2); aggravated assault (counts 3, 4, 7 and 8); aggravated battery (counts 5, 6 and 10) and shooting into an occupied building (count 9). Following a jury trial on the charges defendant was found guilty of two counts of aggravated assault as lesser included offenses of attempted robbery, aggravated assault without a firearm as a lesser included offense of the aggravated assault as charged in count 7 and aggravated assault as charged in count 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">After reviewing the judgment and the accusatory instrument Supreme Court concluded that defendant\u2019s convictions under counts 1 and 2 of the Florida information constituted predicate felony convictions within the meaning of section 70.06 (subd 1, par [b], cl [i]) of the New York Penal Law and sentenced him as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 4V2 to 9 years. It reasoned that the offense of aggravated assault as alleged in those counts corresponded to the New York felony of attempted robbery in the third degree (see Penal Law, \u00a7 160.05). The court viewed the remaining two counts of aggravated assault as New York misdemeanors. The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">There should be a reversal. It cannot be determined by a comparison of the relevant statutes of the two States or from an examination of the Florida accusatory instrument whether the Florida jury, in convicting defendant of aggravated assault as lesser included offenses of attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>robbery, found that defendant had committed acts which would constitute a felony in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">For purposes of sentencing, a prior out-of-State conviction is a predicate felony conviction in New York when the foreign conviction carries with it a sentence of imprisonment in excess of one year and a sentence in excess of one year is also authorized for the offense in this State (Penal Law, \u00a7 70.06, subd 1, par [b], cl [i]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because New York only permits terms of imprisonment in excess of one year for felony convictions, the statute requires that the conviction be for a crime whose elements are equivalent to those of a New York felony. To determine whether a foreign crime is equivalent to a New York felony the court must examine the elements of the foreign statute and compare them to an analogous Penal Law felony, for \u201c[i]t is the statute upon which the indictment was drawn that necessarily defines and measures the crime\u201d (see <em>People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96, 98). The crime cannot be extended or enlarged by allegations in the indictment or by referring to evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Applying this standard, the sentencing court found that the elements of the Florida crime of aggravated assault corresponded with the New York felony of attempted robbery in the third degree. A review of the statutes defining the lesser included offenses of which defendant was convicted does not support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Section 784.021 of the Florida Statutes Annotated defines the crime of aggravated assault, which is a simple misdemeanor assault and then elevates it to a felony if committed: (a) with a deadly weapon without intent to kill; or (b) with an intent to commit a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>assault involving a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as set forth in the first subdivision is not equivalent to a New York weapon possession felony because our Penal Law requires the possession of a \u201cloaded firearm\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 265.02, subd [4]), whereas the Florida crime involving \u201ca deadly weapon\u201d does not (Fla Stats Ann, \u00a7 790.001, subd [13]). Nor, as the sentencing court found, is aggravated assault with a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d equivalent to other analogous New York felonies. It is not equivalent to the felony of assault in New York (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 120.05, 120.10) because the Penal Law requires the additional element of \u201cphysical injury\u201d or \u201cserious physical injury\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 120.00, 120.05, 120.10) and it does not correspond to \u201cattempted assault\u201d because that felony requires an \u201cintent\u201d to cause physical injury or serious physical injury (Penal Law, \u00a7 110.00). Therefore aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as defined in subdivision (a) of the Florida statute cannot serve as the basis for a predicate felony conviction in defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The second category of the Florida statute, aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, may be equivalent to the New York felony of robbery or attempted robbery, and therefore a predicate felony conviction, if the felony referred to in the statute corresponds to the forcible taking of property from the victim\u2019s person (compare Penal Law, \u00a7 160.00). The sentencing court and the Appellate Division evidently assumed that this was the case. In doing so, the sentencing court relied not only upon the statute which defined the crimes of which defendant was convicted, as <em>Olah </em>directs <em>(People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96, <em>supra), </em>but also the accusatory instrument defining the crime with which he was charged. Noting that the amended information charged robbery, the court decided the conviction was for aggravated assault with the intent to commit the felony of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">As an exception to the <em>Olah </em>rule we have permitted a sentencing court to go beyond the statute and scrutinize the accusatory instrument in the foreign jurisdiction where the statute renders criminal not one act but several acts which, if committed in New York, would in some cases be felonies and in others would constitute only misdemean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ors (see <em>People ex rel. Goldman v Denno, </em>9 NY2d 138, 140; <em>People ex rel. Gold v Jackson, </em>5 NY2d 243). Thus, in <em>Jackson, </em>defendant was charged with violating a statute which defined the offense by means of two separate and unrelated acts \u2014 breaking into a building with intent to commit a felony or breaking out of a building having entered with intent to commit a felony. The act of breaking in constituted a felony under New York law whereas the act of breaking out was a misdemeanor. Similarly, in <em>Denno, </em>defendant pleaded guilty to a Federal indictment, charging the violation of a statute which proscribed acts which in some instances constituted felonious conduct under New York law and in others did not. In doing so, defendant admitted the commission of an act constituting a felony (drug sale) and neither admitted nor denied the acts which were not felonies (drug possession, transportation, etc.). The judgment entered referred to defendant\u2019s unlawful sale of drugs. Because the accusatory instrument clarified the charge in <em>Jackson </em>as breaking in, a New York felony, the conviction was counted as a predicate felony; because the accusatory instrument did not clarify the crime in <em>Denno, </em>the conviction could not be counted, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s inculpating statement at the plea taking that he had sold drugs and the similar description of the crime in the judgment. The teaching of these cases is that the allegations of the accusatory instrument may be referred to when necessary to clarify the statutory charge, to limit or narrow the basis for the conviction, but they may not be used to enlarge or expand the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">This case is similar to <em>Denno </em>and <em>Jackson </em>because the statute of which defendant stands convicted is so broad that it proscribes conduct which in New York could be either a felony or a misdemeanor. It differs from those cases because the nature of the offense cannot be resolved by referring to the accusatory instrument. That is so because defendant was not convicted of the offenses stated in the information but rather of lesser included offenses, because the allegations of the information could support a finding of either assault with a deadly weapon or assault with intent to commit a felony, and because neither of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>crimes defined in those two aggravated assault subdivisions sets forth elements which we may determine are the equivalent of a New York felony. Thus on this record it is not possible to resolve which facts alleged in the information were accepted by the jury and which were \u201cnonoperative\u201d (see <em>People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96, <em>supra). </em>The jury could have found that defendant had committed aggravated assault either with a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d or with intent to commit a felony. If it found the latter we are still left without any basis upon which to determine what the felonious acts were and whether they constitute a felony in New York. Absent a review of the court\u2019s instructions there is no way of knowing which theory of the crime the jury accepted (cf. <em>People v Tucker, </em>55 NY2d 1) and the sentencing court should not have filled that, void by referring to the language of the original information.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Moreover, we have no assurance that Florida\u2019s rule governing lesser included offenses is the same as our \u201ctheoretical impossibility\u201d test (see <em>People v Green, </em>56 NY2d 427, 430; see, also, CPL 1.20, subd 37; <em>People v Glover, </em>57 NY2d 61). Indeed, it appears that its test is considerably more flexible and permits a charge down to a crime \u201cwhich <em>may </em>or <em>may not </em>be included in the [greater] offense charged, depending upon, (a) the accusatory pleading, and (b) the evidence\u201d <em>(Brown v State, </em>206 So 2d 377, 383 [Fla], mod <em>Matter of Use by Trial Cts. of Std. Jury Instructions in Crim. Cases, </em>431 So 2d 594, 596-597 [Fla]; see, also, <em>State v Anderson, </em>270 So 2d 353 [Fla]).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The statutory test for enhanced sentences is prescribed by the Legislature and our rules for implementing it have been settled for many years. The responsibility rests upon the prosecution to satisfy these requirements if it seeks additional punishment. If it is unable to do so because the record of the foreign conviction does not resolve the questions which must be answered before second offender status may be granted under New York law, then the court\u2019s analysis is at an end and enhanced sentencing must be denied. There can be no resort to other parts of the record to fill the gaps <em>(People v Olah, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Westchester County, for resentencing of defendant as a first felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Kaye concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Order reversed and case remitted to Supreme Court, Westchester County, for resentencing of defendant in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">.
