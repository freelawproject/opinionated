There was overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. <em>(People v Goodman, </em>54 NY2d 451.) II. Since appellant spoke when apprehended by the police, it was proper for the prosecutor at trial, in the absence of objection, to question appellant about this subject and to comment during summation upon the credibility of appellant\u2019s testimonial claim that he had never said anything to the police. <em>(People v Dobranski, </em>89 AD2d 250; <em>People v Conyers, </em>52 NY2d 454; <em>People v Bowen, </em>50 NY2d 915; <em>People v Lewis, </em>79 AD2d 977; <em>People v Davis, </em>58 NY2d 1102; <em>People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282; <em>People v Gibbs, </em>59 NY2d 930; <em>People v Williams, </em>46 NY2d 1070; <em>People v Argibay, </em>45 NY2d 45; <em>Wainwright v Sykes, </em>433 US 72.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b240-8\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">In <em>People v Conyers </em>(52 NY2d 454) we held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest is inadmissible for impeachment purposes in the absence of unusual circumstances. On this appeal defendant contends that <em>Conyers </em>requires reversal of his conviction. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In September, 1979 the police were summoned to an apartment building in The Bronx by one John Puig, who reported that defendant was inside the building and was carrying a revolver. There was then an outstanding bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest on an unrelated matter. When defendant emerged from the rear of the building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Puig alerted the police, whereupon defendant took flight, with the police, including both uniformed and plain-clothes officers, in pursuit. The chase ended in an exchange of shots in an alley, where defendant was wounded and then arrested. Defendant was charged with three counts of attempted murder in the first degree and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">At trial, the police testified that during the chase they shouted to defendant and ordered him to stop. In support of the People\u2019s contention that defendant knew his intended victims were police, two of the arresting officers testified that after defendant was apprehended and was confronted by the arresting officers he stated, \u201cI should have killed you when I had the chance,\u201d and spit on one of the officer\u2019s shoes. This testimony was central to the People\u2019s contention that defendant had the requisite knowledge and intent for attempted murder (of a policeman) in the first degree. (See Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [i].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Appellant testified that Puig had previously threatened him and that he did not know the men chasing him were police officers, but thought they were Puig\u2019s friends who were out to \u201cget\u201d him, and that he fled, and ultimately fired upon his pursuers, because of that fear. When asked by the prosecutor, without objection, if he spoke to the officers at the time of his arrest, defendant testified that he said nothing. In his summation, defense counsel argued that defendant became aware that his pursuers were police officers \u201conly after the shooting had stopped,\u201d that while he \u201cmay have cursed at them\u201d he did not do or say what the officers attributed to him upon his arrest, and that the officers who testified to the contrary were lying in an attempt to cover up the fact that they had shot defendant in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">During his summation, in the course of challenging the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u201c[Defendant] says that the police came into the alleyway and he knew they were police officers. Now here\u2019s a fellow who wants you to believe that he was protecting his own life, that he thought they were the bad guys out there. They come in, and does he say, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s the police, it\u2019s been a big misunderstanding, I thought you were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Puig\u2019s friends, I thought you were there to hurt me, I didn\u2019t know you were the police\u2019? He\u2019s being handcuffed, put in an ambulance and taken away under police escort and he tells you he said absolutely nothing to the police. When I asked him, \u2018Did you say anything at all\u2019 he said, T didn\u2019t say anything to them.\u2019 Is that how someone who is the innocent, the innocent victim, is that how he reacts? Wouldn\u2019t he have said something more consistent with his position? Would he have really stood there and said nothing while handcuffs are being put on him?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cNow, he\u2019s got absolutely no obligation whatsoever to say anything. He doesn\u2019t have to say a word to anybody but you apply your own common sense, your own everyday knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Defense counsel\u2019s objections to these comments were sustained. After the charge, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, contending that \u201cgiven the testimony of Mr. Davis [that] he didn\u2019t say anything * * * I\u2019m sure the law is so clear that this defendant\u2019s silence cannot in any way be used against him.\u201d The Trial Judge agreed that the comments were improper but denied the motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor then suggested that a curative instruction be given to the jury that \u201cif they believe [defendant] said nothing, they can draw no inference from the fact that he said nothing and he has no obligation to say anything to [police officers] at the time he\u2019s arrested.\u201d Defense counsel objected to such an instruction and none was given. Defendant was convicted of one count of attempted murder in the second degree, two counts of attempted assault in the first degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. The Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting, affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Defendant now urges that his conviction must be set aside because, under <em>Conyers, </em>a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence may not be used for impeachment purposes, as the prosecutor did in his summation. Because <em>Conyers </em>does not establish such a per se rule, and does not apply to the facts of this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">In <em>Conyers, </em>it was undisputed that defendant stood silent at the time of arrest. We held that because defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>silence in those circumstances was ambiguous, evidence of such silence was inadmissible to impeach his later exculpatory testimony. By contrast, here the evidence of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence came in without objection, and a key issue is whether defendant was indeed silent at the time of arrest. The prosecution contended that defendant made inculpatory statements. Defendant himself put the question of his silence in issue by testifying that he said nothing to the police at his arrest, .thereby disputing the prosecution testimony. The credibility of the testimony of defendant and of the arresting officers on this point was commented upon in closing argument by counsel for both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">This is not a case, like <em>Conyers, </em>where the prosecution tried to use evidence of the fact of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence against him by contending that such silence itself renders a later exculpatory version of events incredible. Here the defendant testified as to his postarrest silence, contradicting the prosecution witnesses, and the prosecutor attacked the veracity of defendant\u2019s testimony upon summation. In such a situation, the prosecutor\u2019s statements on summation about whether defendant was or was not silent at the time of his arrest concerned a key issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Given these circumstances, the mistrial demanded by defendant was in no event required. While the prosecutor\u2019s summation improperly invited the jury to draw an unwarranted inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s testimony that he had been silent at his arrest, a curative instruction could have helped insure that such an inference would not be drawn. Defendant, however, objected to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that such an instruction be given. In view of defendant\u2019s objection, the failure to give such an instruction cannot now be a ground for upsetting his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Meyer concur; Judge Simons taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
