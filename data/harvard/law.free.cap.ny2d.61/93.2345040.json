The allegations in the formal written complaint have not been sustained by a quantum of evidence. II. The commission utilized the incorrect standard of proof. <em>(Addington v Texas, </em>441 US 418; <em>Woodby v Immigration Serv., </em>385 US 276; <em>Chaunt v United States, </em>364 US 350; <em>Schneiderman v United States, </em>320 US 118; <em>Santosky v Kramer, </em>455 US 745; <em>Ross v Food Specialities, </em>6 NY2d 336; <em>Amend v Hurley, </em>293 NY 587; <em>Porter v Commercial Cas. Ins. Co., </em>292 NY 176; <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare v Ryan, </em>288 App Div 607; <em>Matter of Findlay, </em>253 NY 1.) III. The complaint lacks specificity. IV. The proceeding before the commission constitutes double jeopardy. <em>(Benton v Maryland, </em>395 US 784; <em>United States v Furlong, </em>5 Wheat [18 US] 184; <em>Green v United States, </em>355 US 184; <em>Matter of Barnes v Tofany, </em>27 NY2d 74; <em>Helvering v Mitchell, </em>303 US 391; <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v United States, </em>409 US 232; <em>Coffey v United States, </em>116 US 436; <em>United States v La Franca, </em>282 US 568; <em>Ex parte Wall, </em>107 US 265.) V. Judge Cerbone\u2019s conduct was justified. <em>(Matter of Fuhrer v Hynes, </em>72 AD2d 813.) VI.

The members of this court agree that petitioner should no longer be allowed to serve in a judicial position.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In the early evening of October 25, 1981, petitioner entered a Mount Kisco tavern for a meeting with the business\u2019s owner, who was one of petitioner\u2019s legal clients. While he was in the bar, petitioner had a confrontation with some of the other patrons, primarily several black men. A heated exchange occurred, during which petitioner admittedly used abusive and profane language. Petitioner loudly proclaimed that he was a judge and announced what he would do if any of the black patrons appeared before him in court. The evidence, which includes testimony by a number of witnesses, establishes that petitioner embellished his threatening remarks with racial epithets. The record also shows that petitioner either struck or pushed one of the other customers. This incident did not end until after the police twice came to the tavern and, on the second occasion, petitioner left with his brother. There is no evidence or claim that petitioner was intoxicated at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Petitioner proffers two grounds for justifying his conduct. First, he contends that he saw a drug transaction occur among the black men outside the bar and that he believed it necessary to remain inside so as to thwart any sales on the premises, which activity would have jeopardized his client\u2019s liquor license. Even were this to be accepted as true, petitioner\u2019s explanation does not excuse his behavior. Certainly, the same end could have been served by petitioner\u2019s quietly remaining in the bar without swearing, yelling, or using racial slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Petitioner\u2019s other \u201cjustification\u201d is that he felt that he could not leave because to do so would create the impression that judges can be intimidated. The judiciary has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>progressed beyond the stage where it is necessary to prove its fortitude by physical or verbal confrontation. Moreover, respect for the judiciary is better fostered by temperate conduct, not by hot-headed reactions to goading remarks in a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Petitioner has also challenged the standard of proof \u2014 preponderance of the evidence \u2014 employed in judicial disciplinary proceedings (22 NYCRR 7000.6 [i] [1]), urging that the appropriate standard is clear and convincing evidence. It is unnecessary to determine whether the higher standard should be applied for we conclude in any event, as did the referee who initially heard this matter, that the charges are supported by clear and convincing evidence (see <em>Matter of Steinberg, </em>51 NY2d 74, 82, n 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Petitioner\u2019s other arguments have been considered and are found to be without merit. Petitioner\u2019s demonstration has rendered him unfit to serve the public trust as a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Accordingly, the determined sanction of removal should be accepted, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Determined sanction accepted, without costs, and Vincent T. Cerbone is removed from the office of Justice of the Mount Kisco Town Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
