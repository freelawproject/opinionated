Dus\u00e9, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc. (\u201cBarnes &amp; Noble\u201d) on his employment discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000). Dus\u00e9 alleged that Barnes &amp; Noble unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his race, age, and gender, and that he was retaliated against when he complained of the alleged discrimination. Dus\u00e9 also appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s motion to strike witnesses not disclosed by Dus\u00e9 in discovery, claiming, in part, that the testimony of those witnesses would have bolstered his opposition to Barnes <em>&amp; </em>Noble\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Dus\u00e9 v. Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc., </em>No. 1:05-cv-01508-GBL-LO (E.D.Va. Sept. 11, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
