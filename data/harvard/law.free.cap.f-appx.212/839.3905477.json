We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we deny, in part, the petition for review and dismiss it in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">In 1994, Volkova and her husband unsuccessfully applied for asylum and withholding of removal, alleging past persecution and a fear of future persecution, both based on her Baptist faith, Russian nationality, race, and membership in a particular social group comprised of non-Chechnens who have lived in Chechnya and are therefore subject to discrimination by Russians. On June 4, 2001, following the enactment of new legislation regarding applications for adjustment of status, Volkova moved to reopen her asylum case, in order to seek readjustment of status under the new legislation. The BIA granted the motion to reopen and remanded the matter to the IJ for further consideration of Volkova\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status. During the course of her adjustment-of-status proceedings, Volkova also moved the IJ to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>reconsider her application for asylum and withholding of removal, based on her fear of future persecution if she returned to Russia, particularly in light of the intervening enactment of Russia\u2019s Law on Religion in 1997. The IJ denied the motion and determined Volkova was not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Volkova appealed to the BIA, which construed her appeal as both an appeal from the denial of adjustment of status and a new motion to remand to the IJ based on changed country circumstances. On January 9, 2006, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of adjustment of status and denied Volkova\u2019s motion to remand, finding that Volkova had neither established <em>prima fade </em>eligibility for asylum, nor demonstrated \u201cchanged circumstances,\u201d within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4). Volkova moved for reconsideration, attaching an affidavit outlining her asylum claim and a statement from a professor describing the worsening conditions in Russia. On April 27, 2006, the BIA denied the motion to reconsider, which it interpreted in part as a motion to reopen, reiterating its previous reasoning. On May 24, 2006, Volkova filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). In the motion to reopen that forms the basis of this appeal, Volkova\u2019s argument went primarily to the latter ground, a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">A petitioner may file a motion to reopen where there is new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), 1003.23(b)(3). The regulations provide that a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (recognizing that there are at least three independent grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen: \u201c(1) failure to establish a prima facie case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Here, Volkova\u2019s evidence primarily consisted of news articles about the activities of extremist nationalist groups in Russia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>and the government\u2019s treatment of evangelical groups. Volkova argued that the 1997 enactment of the Law on Religion had resulted in the persecution of evangelical churches, and that she, as a Baptist, would face this persecution if she returned to Russia. As in her initial asylum proceedings, she did not produce sufficient evidence that the generalized treatment of evangelical groups meant that <em>she </em>would be singled out for mistreatment and persecuted, within the meaning of the INA. <em>Cf. Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1287 (to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, an alien must \u201cpresent specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d (quotation omitted)). We discern no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Volkova\u2019s evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d did not materially affect Volkova\u2019s asylum eligibility. Accordingly, we deny Volkova\u2019s petition with respect to the BIA\u2019s April 27, 2006, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-11\">. To the extent the BIA treated Volkova\u2019s motion as a motion for reconsideration, we discern no abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2003) (reviewing BIA's denial of motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\">. Volkova also seeks review of the BIA's underlying final order of removal denying her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, and denying her motion to remand to the IJ. The BIA entered this order on January 9, 2006. Pursuant to our \"obligat[ion] to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking[,]\u201d we conclude we lack jurisdiction to review the January 9, 2006 order. <em>See Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We have jurisdiction over a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed <em>within 30 days. 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The Supreme Court has held that this statutory time limit is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and is \u201cnot subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 105a(a)). Moreover, the Supreme Court has further held that \"the filing of [a] reconsideration motion does not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 395, 115 S.Ct. 1537. Because the instant petition for review was not filed within 30 days of the BIA's January 9, 2006 final order of removal, we lack jurisdiction and must DISMISS Volkova\u2019s petition as to that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
