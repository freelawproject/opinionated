He was sentenced to concurrent seventy-one-month terms of imprisonment on Counts One, Ten, and Twelve, and a consecutive eighty-four-month sentence on Count Eleven, followed by five years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>supervised release. The district court also imposed a $5400 f\u00edne.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Hernandez has appealed. On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he found no meritorious issues for appeal, but seeking review of a district court ruling granting the Government\u2019s motion in limine limiting cross-examination of one witness. Hernandez was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, and has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Counsel asserts that the district court\u2019s grant of the Government\u2019s motion in limine prohibiting him from impeaching the officer who handled the evidence in this case regarding his discharge from the Lumber-ton Police Department violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We review the denial of a motion in limine for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 212 (4th Cir.) (\u201cWe review rulings concerning the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005); <em>Malone v. Microdyne Corp., </em>26 F.3d 471, 480 (4th Cir.1994) (reviewing ruling on motion in limine for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The Confrontation Clause guarantees the accused the right to cross-examine witnesses. U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 221 (4th Cir.) (\u201c[T]he right of cross examination is a precious one, essential to a fair trial.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). Thus, \u201ca trial court should accord a criminal defendant a reasonable opportunity to conduct cross-examination that might undermine a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 221. However, the Confrontation Clause does not guarantee counsel the right to unfettered, unlimited cross-examination, nor does it prevent a trial judge from imposing reasonable limits on cross-examination based upon concerns about harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness safety, repetition, or relevance. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986), and Fed.R.Evid. 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The appraisal of the probative and prejudicial value of evidence is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court and its appraisal, absent extraordinary circumstances, will not be disturbed. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>910 F.2d 154, 157 (4th Cir.1990). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s ruling, and find that its limitation of cross-examination in this case did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Therefore, this claim entitles Hernandez to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">We have reviewed the issue raised in Hernandez\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and find that it lacks merit. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hernandez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hernandez, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hernandez requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
