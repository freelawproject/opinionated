We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">In October 1974, Duvall began receiving disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Duvall\u2019s superseding indictment provided, \u201c[b]eginning in or about November 1993, and continuing through in or about May 2001,\u201d Duvall embezzled, stole, and converted to his use \u201cin excess of $1,000 of monies\u201d belonging to the VA. A jury found Duvall guilty and determined the offense involved more than $200,000. At sentencing, the district court received evidence the total loss suffered by the government for the entire period of Duvall\u2019s disability amounted to $641,283.60. The district court pronounced a sentence of 37 months\u2019 imprisonment based on a loss of $641,283.60, or, in the alternative, 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the loss found by the jury, if <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied. Duvall appealed, and we remanded for resentencing, in part, because Duvall\u2019s 37-month sentence, which was based on judge-found facts under a mandatory Guidelines system, violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621. We stated, \u201c[w]e note the district court correctly calculated Duvall\u2019s Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d and provided the district court, on remand, was \u201crequired to sentence Duvall according to <em>Booker, </em>considering the Guidelines advisory range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment....\u201d At re-sentencing, the district court, after considering the Guidelines advisory range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment, sentenced Duvall to a 37-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">Duvall appeals his Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. He acknowledges we will likely reaffirm our pri- or holding from his previous appeal that his Guidelines range was 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment, but argues the trial court erred in violation of <em>Blakely </em>by finding he should be held accountable for losses in excess of $400,000, based on benefits paid outside of the period in the indictment, and when the jury only found him responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>for losses in excess of $200,000. He contends the Government\u2019s allegation at sentencing, that he was paid $641,283.60 over the entire period that he was receiving disability benefits, includes periods as far back as 1974. He contends the attempt to expand his culpability back almost 20 years from his offense of conviction, \u201cignores the significance of the charging document in the process itself, and ... renders that document meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">\u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both district courts and appellate courts are generally bound by a prior appellate decision in the same case.\u201d <em>Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2004). The doctrine operates to preclude courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal. <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cThe mandate rule is simply an application of the law of the case doctrine to a specific set of facts.\u201d <em>Litman v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>825 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1987) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cIf the appeals court issues a specific mandate, the district court must obey: the mandate is not subject to interpretation.\u201d United <em>United States v. Mesa, </em>247 F.3d 1165, 1170 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The law-of-the-case doctrine and the mandate rule preclude any argument that Duvall\u2019s 30 to 37-month Guidelines range was miscalculated. <em>See Alphamed, </em>367 F.3d at 1285-86; <em>Mesa, </em>247 F.3d at 1170. Further, the district court did not err because it applied the Guidelines in an advisory fashion, and was entitled to make findings of fact not alleged in the indictment when fashioning Duvall\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (holding extra-verdict enhancements, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, may be based on facts not charged in the indictment so long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum for the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction). Duvall\u2019s 37-month sentence did not exceed his ten-year statutory maximum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. To the extent Duvall argues the district court could not make findings of fact as to an amount of loss contrary to the amount specifically found by the jury, we have held a court may consider relevant acquitted conduct if proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 615, 166 L.Ed.2d 456 (2006). Thus, if a court can consider acquitted conduct in sentencing, it follows the district court can also consider loss amounts exceeding the specific findings of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Duvall\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
