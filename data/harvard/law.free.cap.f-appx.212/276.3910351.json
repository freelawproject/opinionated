He also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">Sims, who is HIV positive, contends: the defendants have been deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by, <em>inter alia, </em>denying him medication for HIV treatment; and they are engaged in a \u201cconspiracy to let [him] die\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">Because the district court\u2019s dismissal was based on the complaint\u2019s both being frivolous <em>and </em>failing to state a claim, our review is <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1999). As the district court noted, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has stated an HIV-positive individual need not <em>necessarily </em>undergo anti-HIV treatment; whether to undergo such treatment depends on an individual\u2019s medical assessments and particular circumstances. Sims admits being medically examined on numerous occasions, but disagrees with his diagnosis and course of treatment. Such disagreement, standing alone, is insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995). Sims\u2019 conclusory allegation of a conspiracy is also insufficient to establish such a claim. <em>See Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">Because this case does not present exceptional circumstances, Sims\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>Akasike v. Fitzpatrick, </em>26 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
