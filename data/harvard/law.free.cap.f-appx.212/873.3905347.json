After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Ferguson, a convicted felon, was charged in a single-count indictment with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ferguson pled not guilty, and proceeded to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We first recount the trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">On October 26, 2001, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Officer Melvin Jones was on routine patrol in his car when he observed a silver sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d) parked on a service road. Officer Jones saw Ferguson standing in front of the SUV. Ferguson attempted to conceal himself by moving around to the other side of the SUV. Finding Ferguson\u2019s behavior suspicious, Officer Jones turned his car around to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">Officer Jones met Ferguson\u2019s SUV as it was leaving the area. The two vehicles stopped side-by-side, so that the driver\u2019s side doors were next to each other. Ferguson immediately opened his car door and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? What\u2019s up, Officer?\u201d in a manner that alarmed Jones. Officer Jones exited his patrol car, focusing on Ferguson\u2019s hands. Ferguson\u2019s left hand was on the steering wheel, but his right hand was down on his right side, between the center console and the driver\u2019s seat. Officer Jones told Ferguson to place both hands on the steering wheel. Ferguson did not comply until Jones instructed him three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>As Officer Jones drew closer, he noticed on the floorboard of the SUV, near the brake pedal, \u201ca small baggy\u201d of what appeared to be cocaine. Jones radioed for backup. In the meantime, Ferguson\u2019s right hand again dropped back between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console. Jones twice ordered Ferguson to exit the SUV, which he finally did. Jones patted Ferguson down and placed him in the back of his patrol car. Jones\u2019s backup, Officer Jason Naylor, arrived and the two officers retrieved the baggy from the SUV floorboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Officer Jones returned to his patrol car to place Ferguson under arrest, while Officer Naylor inventoried the SUV. Naylor called Jones back to the SUV because he \u201cfound something.\u201d Jones returned, sat in the SUV driver\u2019s seat, and saw \u201cwhat appeared to be the butt of a pistol in between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console.\u201d Jones pulled the gun out and verified that it was a pistol. The gun was not loaded, and electrical tape was wrapped around its handle. Jones and Naylor also located a marijuana cigarette in the SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">At trial and over defense objection, the district court permitted the government to use two photographs as demonstrative aids, but did not permit the photographs to be sent out with the jury as evidence. The photographs depicted the pistol jammed down between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SUV in the photographs had a different color interior than Ferguson\u2019s. The photographs were taken in daylight, rather than at night (when Ferguson was arrested). The district court expressly clarified to the jury that the photographs were \u201cnot of the actual vehicle or what was happening that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">According to Officer Naylor, the firearm in the photographs was in \u201capproximately the same location\u201d as Ferguson\u2019s. Naylor acknowledged, however, that Ferguson\u2019s firearm had been \u201cback maybe just a touch, maybe just a hair back----an inch or two, you know\u201d to the right of where it was depicted in the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Ferguson\u2019s sister, Jamika Ferguson, and his girlfriend, Paula Massey, also testified. The SUV belonged to Jamika, but her children\u2019s father (Robert Bradley), Massey, and the defendant Ferguson all frequently drove the SUV. Jamika had seen Bradley with a gun, and Bradley usually carried a firearm. In fact, Bradley shot Ferguson a few months after Ferguson\u2019s arrest in this case. Jamika had never seen Ferguson with a gun. Jamika could not explain, however, why she initially told investigators that no one besides herself and Ferguson drove the SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Massey likewise testified that she, Ferguson, Jamika, and Bradley all drove the SUV. On the day of his arrest, Ferguson picked up the SUV from Jamika at around noon, and Massey and Ferguson went out that night in the SUV. Ferguson brought Massey home between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m., and Ferguson went out again. Massey did not remember seeing a gun or cocaine in the SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">The jury convicted Ferguson. At sentencing, Ferguson\u2019s base offense level was 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The district court applied a 4-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), finding that Ferguson possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony (possession of cocaine and marijuana).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With an adjusted offense lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>el of 28 and a criminal history category of IV, Ferguson\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum sentence for Ferguson\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Ferguson to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AfG\">A. The photographs</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Ferguson argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to show the photographs to the jury, because the photographs did not accurately depict the SUV on the night of his arrest and were more prejudicial than probative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This situation is different from most we have addressed because the photographs were used only as demonstrative aids and were not admitted into evidence or allowed into jury deliberations. <em>Cf. United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1362 (11th Cir.2006) (considering the admissibility of color photographs from a homicide scene).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">More importantly, the officers identified the photographs as similar to the actual crime scene. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>972 F.2d 1566, 1579 (11th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any inconsistencies between the photographs and the actual crime scene were addressed by the officers\u2019 testimony concerning the differences between the interior color of the SUV and the lighting conditions at the time of the arrest. Although Jones testified that the photographs accurately represented the location of the firearm as it appeared that evening, Naylor\u2019s testimony that the firearm in the photographs was in a slightly different position put the jury on notice that the photographs may not have precisely captured the firearm\u2019s exact location. Moreover, the district court specifically addressed the accuracy of the photographs by stating before the jury that the photographs were \u201cnot of the actual vehicle or what was happening that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">Given that the photographs were admitted only as demonstrative aids, were not introduced into evidence or allowed into the jury room, and were identified by both officers as essentially accurate portrayals of the SUV on the night of Ferguson\u2019s arrest, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">B. Jury instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Next, Ferguson argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to give a jury instruction that a defendant\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d near an object is not sufficient to establish possession.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the district court\u2019s jury instructions included an accurate state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ment of the law regarding actual and constructive possession, and Ferguson\u2019s requested instruction was adequately covered by the charge. Specifically, the district court instructed the jury that a person may have actual or constructive possession of an object, and explained the difference between the two, stating: \u201c[a] person who is not in actual possession, but who has both the power and the intention to later take control over something, either alone or together with someone else, is in constructive possession of it.\u201d The district court further instructed the jury that in order to have \u201cknowingly\u201d possessed a firearm, Ferguson must have possessed the firearm \u201cvoluntarily and intentionally.\u201d The jury could not have attributed possession to Ferguson through his mere presence alone, because mere presence would not establish voluntarily or intentional possession. Therefore, Ferguson\u2019s requested instruction was adequately covered by the instructions given to the jury. <em>See United States v. Rojas, </em>537 F.2d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">C. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Ferguson also claims the trial evidence was insufficient to establish that he constructively possessed the firearm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the firearm was directly next to, and in view of, Ferguson as he drove the SUV. Ferguson repeatedly dropped his right hand near the location where the gun was found and was hesitant to obey Officer Jones\u2019s commands to keep both hands on the wheel. The jury reasonably could have inferred from the location of the firearm and Ferguson\u2019s continued hand movements toward the center console that Ferguson had both the power and intention to later take control over the firearm, and that Ferguson voluntarily and intentionally had the firearm in the SUV with him. Moreover, Massey testified that she did not remember seeing a gun or cocaine in the SUV when she was riding in the SUV just a few hours prior to Ferguson\u2019s arrest. Although both Massey and Jamika testified that several other people frequently drove the SUV, Massey\u2019s uncontroverted testimony\u2014that there was no gun or cocaine in the SUV two to three hours prior to Ferguson\u2019s arrest\u2014also supports the jury\u2019s finding that the gun belonged to Ferguson. The jury reasonably could have concluded that only Ferguson operated the SUV in the short interval between the time he dropped Massey off and the time of his arrest. Accordingly, we must reject Ferguson\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">D. Section 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Ferguson next argues that the district court incorrectly found that he pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>sessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his felony cocaine and marijuana possession, and improperly imposed a 4-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) does not define the phrase \u201cin connection with.\u201d However, this Court has read the \u201cin connection with\u201d language expansively, and concluded that \u201cthe firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that defendants possessed firearms \u201cin connection with\u201d counterfeiting offense where two unloaded guns were placed in the back seat of a vehicle with counterfeit money and the guns reasonably could have been present to protect the counterfeit money).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In this case, the baggy of cocaine was at Ferguson\u2019s feet and in his view, and the firearm was directly next to Ferguson and the cocaine. Ferguson made multiple movements towards the firearm. Thus, the district court did not commit clear error in finding that Ferguson possessed the firearm to protect his drugs or himself while possessing the drugs. <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695; <em>see also United States v. Gainey, </em>111 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.1997) (determining that a defendant with heroin around his neck and a firearm in his pants pocket possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the drugs); <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>139 F.3d 813, 815 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming without discussion district court\u2019s \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement for defendant\u2019s possession of gun \u201cin connection with\u201d defendant\u2019s possession of methamphetamine).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Ferguson also contends that the \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5) enhancement was improper because it punishes him twice for the same conduct or harm. Ferguson relies on <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2003), in which this Court concluded that a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement could not apply where the defendant\u2019s underlying convictions were for (1) being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g), <em>and </em>(2) using and carrying firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 1342, 1346. However, the defendant in <em>Brown </em>had two underlying convictions, one of which was a \u00a7 924(c) offense for carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense. The sentencing guidelines specifically prohibit applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement in that \u00a7 924(c) situation. <em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 1345; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">In contrast, Ferguson was charged only with the \u00a7 922(g) offense, which had no drug component, and as such, the 4-level enhancement for carrying a firearm in connection with a felony (his state drug offense) did not punish twice the same wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">E. Reasonableness of Ferguson\u2019s sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Finally, Ferguson contends that his 120-month sentence is unreasonable, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the district court failed to meaningfully consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>A district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). If the district court correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory guidelines range, an acknowledgment that the district court considered the defendant\u2019s sentencing arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the burden of establishing unreasonableness lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Ferguson\u2019s total offense level was 28 and his criminal history category was IV, which resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 120-month sentence, which was within that range, albeit also the statutory maximum. Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Additionally, the district court stated that it \u201cconsidered the statutory purposes of sentencing and the sentencing guidelines,\u201d and it found the statutory maximum guidelines-range sentence \u201cappropriate ... [and] otherwise reasonable\u201d because Ferguson previously had been convicted of \u201ccarjacking and possession of a gun in connection with that violent felony, [as well as] drug convictions.\u201d The district court also specifically rejected Ferguson\u2019s claim that he should receive a below-advisory guidelines sentence because his gun was unloaded, stating: \u201can unloaded gun will scare somebody just as bad as a loaded gun will.\u201d The district court complied with <em>Talley </em>and <em>Booker, </em>and Ferguson has not shown that his 120-month sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ferguson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">.

In <em>Myers, </em>this Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing into evidence a photograph of a bunk bed in a jail cell that was similar, but not identical, to the bunk bed in which the defendant police officer\u2019s victim was located at the time of the officer\u2019s alleged attack on the victim. Another police officer testified that the photograph \"fairly and accurately\u201d depicted the bunk in which the victim was located, except that it was on the opposite side of the room. <em>Myers, </em>972 F.2d at 1579.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b902-15\">.
