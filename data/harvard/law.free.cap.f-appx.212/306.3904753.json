Walley argues that the district court erred in not imposing substance-abuse treatment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) in lieu of incarceration. In sentencing Walley, the district court considered his previous failed attempt to participate in drug treatment. Walley committed several violations of the conditions of his supervised release in addition to failing a drug test, which renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>him ineligible for discretionary relief. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Walley has not argued that the length of his sentence is either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Accordingly, there was no error in the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release and imposition of a 24 month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
