Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201creasonableness\u201d review of <em>post-Booker </em>sentences, to be guided by the factors stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). After offense-level adjustments for amount of loss and acceptance of responsibility, his offense level was 12, with an advisory Guidelines range of 10-16 months imprisonment. The imposed 24-month sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>was eight months above the high end of this range.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u201cWhere, as here, a district court imposes a <em>post-Booker </em>non-Guidelines sentence\u2014 that is, one that deviates either above or below the relevant Guidelines sentence as opposed to departing with reference to an applicable Guidelines departure provision\u2014we conduct our reasonableness review through an abuse-of-discretion lens, paying particular attention to the specific reasons given for deviating from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir.2006). A non-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable if it does <em>not </em>account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or is the result of clear error in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The district court based its deviation from the high end of the advisory sentencing range (deviation) on factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for deterrence and to promote respect for the law, the seriousness of the offense, the kind of sentences available, and the Guidelines range. 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(l)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Mauricio has <em>not </em>shown that the district court failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, that the district court gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or that it was the result of clear error in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. Accordingly, the above-the-Guidelines-range sentence was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 707-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
