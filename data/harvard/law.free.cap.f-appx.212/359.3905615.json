He argues that the district court erred by failing to articulate fact-specific reasons for its nonguideline sentence. Sosa-Ibarra also argues that the court gave insufficient consideration or weight to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and the statutory sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The district court \u201cproperly calculated the applicable guideline range\u201d for Sosa-Ibarra\u2019s offense and \u201ccarefully articulated permissible reasons for its variance.\u201d <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006). The court implicitly analyzed the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant\u201d factor when discussing Sosa-Ibarra\u2019s specific facts, namely that Sosa-Ibarra has previously been convicted for an alien smuggling offense, that he was now in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of assisting undocumented aliens in entering the United States, and that he was a leader in the offense. By adopting the PSR in its Statement of Reasons, the court also showed that it considered the fact that Sosa-Ibarra committed the instant offense just six months after completing probation for a similar offense. The court also considered the need for Sosa-Ibarra\u2019s sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide a just punishment when it expressed concern that the 10 to 16 month guideline range did not reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the offense, considering that Sosa-Ibarra\u2019s involvement in alien smuggling had escalated since the first offense. Further, the court\u2019s warning to Sosa-Ibarra that he could face more time if he returned to the United States after deportation reflected a concern that the sentence encourage deterrence and protect the public from further alien smuggling by Sosa-Ibarra. Because the court committed no legal error in the sentencing procedure, the sentence must be given great deference. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Additionally, the court\u2019s fact-specific findings in support of the upward variance sufficiently demonstrate that the substance of the sentence is reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>at 707. The court articulated concern that the 10 to 16 month guideline range did not reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the offense, considering that Sosa-Ibarra\u2019s involvement in alien smuggling had escalated and become more sophisticated since his first smuggling offense. The court\u2019s analysis of the facts supporting the \u201cseriousness\u201d reflects a balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, namely the circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence to reflect certain factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). The nonguideline sentence therefore reasonably reflects the requisite consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, gives significant weight to relevant and proper factors, and demonstrates a balancing of the sentencing factors that does not represent \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. The district court therefore did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>discretion in imposing a nonguideline sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
