In <em>Threatte v. Toyota Motor Corporation et al., </em>77 Fed.Appx. 508, we vacated the district court\u2019s order granting Toyota summary judgment on an issue not involved in this appeal, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">The salient facts are fairly straightforward. In August 1998, Ms. Courtney Threatte, a college student driving her 1997 Toyota Corolla home from college, failed to negotiate a sharp curve in the road and hit a tree. The Corolla\u2019s air bag failed to deploy, Ms. Courtney\u2019s body struck the steering wheel, and she was killed. The cause of death, according to the Death Certificate, was \u201cmassive head and internal injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">Threatte\u2019s parents sued Toyota for wrongful death. During discovery, a Toyota engineer and a plaintiffs\u2019 expert concluded that the air bag failed to deploy because the air bag computer was not fully connected electrically and therefore could not function. The computer had been replaced by Toyota dealer Allen Automotive, Inc., d.b.a. Heyward Allen Toyota (\u201cAllen\u201d), pursuant to a voluntary recall program paid for by Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">Toyota called on Allen to indemnify it for any sums it might be required to pay the plaintiffs and to participate in settlement negotiations. Allen refused. Toyota therefore joined Allen as a third-party defendant in the Threattes\u2019 wrongful death action. Toyota subsequently settled the Threattes\u2019 claim for $900,000, and the case proceeded to trial on Toyota\u2019s third-party indemnity claim against Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">Prior to trial, Allen stipulated that it was negligent in failing properly to install the air bag computer and that such negligence caused the non-deployment, that Toyota was not negligent, and that the $900,000 payment to the Threattes was \u201ccorrect and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">At trial, the jury found Allen liable to Toyota on the theory of implied indemnity, and, after denying Allen\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and Allen\u2019s alternative motion for new trial, Record, Vol. 15 at 254, entered judgment for Toyota. Allen now appeals, arguing: (1) that there was no evidence that Allen\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of Ms. Threatte\u2019s death; hence, the court should have granted its judgment as a matter of law; and (2) that the court abused its discretion in denying Allen\u2019s alternative motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Allen\u2019s first argument is based on the court\u2019s overruling Allen\u2019s objection to the expert testimony of Roger Brown, a Toyota engineer, who testified on the causation issue. According to Allen, the court should have found Brown incompetent to testify under Fed.R.Evid. 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); had it done so, proof of causation would have been lacking and the court would have been required to dismiss Toyota\u2019s indemnity claim. We disagree. We find no error in the court\u2019s findings regarding Brown\u2019s qualifications as an expert to testify and that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Brown\u2019s testimony to come before the jury. Finally, we conclude that, with his testimony, the jury had ample proof of causation to render the verdict in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">As Allen properly recognizes, we review a trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. We have examined each of the grounds Allen cites in its motion for a new trial, and conclude that it was within the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion whether to grant the motion. We find no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
