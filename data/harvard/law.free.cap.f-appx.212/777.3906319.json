In this appeal of his 37-month sentence, Corliss first contends that the district court erred by applying a variety of sentencing enhancements based on facts unproven to a jury and not admitted by him, in violation of the principles of law established in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Corliss also asserts that the district court\u2019s application of two factually related sentence enhancements amounts to impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d Because Corliss made these objections to the district court during his sentencing hearing, we review that court\u2019s ruling on them de novo, but will reverse the sentence only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-18\">With respect to Corliss\u2019 first contention, we have, on several occasions, clarified the meaning of <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent cases addressing the federal sentencing guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-19\">According to <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, any fact that increases a sentence beyond the statutory maximum must be charged in the indictment. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Although <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] held that any fact increasing punishment must be admitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>defendant or proved to a jury, this Court has stated that \u201cboth majority opinions in <em>Booker </em>make clear that the decisive factor that makes <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing problematic is not extra-verdict enhancements but their use in a mandatory guidelines system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\"><em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005)). Accordingly, we have held that extra-verdict \u201cenhancements made in a non-mandatory Guidelines system are constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). In light of this holding, it is clear that the district court did not err when applying the sentence enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Additionally, Corliss argues that the district court impermissibly used \u201cthe same uncharged facts ... repeatedly to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d when it applied sentencing enhancements for: (a) an offense involving more than minimal planning or more than one victim, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2)(A) and (B) (1998); (b) an offense entailing \u201cmass marketing,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(3); (c) an offense in which Corliss misrepresented that he acted on behalf of charitable organizations, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(4)(A); and (d) an offense targeting \u201cvulnerable victims,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). In other words, Corliss argues that the district court impermissibly engaged in \u201cdouble counting.\u201d We have held that where multiple \u201cenhancements embody conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing because they are designed for ... different purposes,\u201d it is not double-counting to apply them cumulatively. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1334 (11th Cir.2003). For example, we have specifically concluded that the enhancement for an offense involving more than minimal planning or a scheme to defraud more than one victim focuses on the \u201cvictims harmed,\u201d while the \u201cmass marketing\u201d enhancement focuses on the \u201cmethod of inflicting harm,\u201d and thus do not overlap to the extent necessary to implicate a double counting problem. <em>United States v. Olshan, </em>371 F.3d 1296, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). Here, all of Corliss\u2019s enhancements were based on conceptually separate notions and do not overlap. An offense can involve \u25a0more than minimal planning without entailing mass marketing; an offense involving mass marketing does not necessarily require misrepresentations about charity; and offenses that involve charitable fraud do not always target vulnerable victims. <em>See Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1356. Accordingly, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
