Estrada contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. As there is a manifestation of a reservation of appellate rights in the record, Estrada has not waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment denying the motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 916-17 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">Within the context of a consensual encounter with police, an officer may approach an individual, identify himself, briefly question the person being stopped, and ask for identification. <em>See INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984). Estrada concedes his suppression argument is foreclosed by this Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
