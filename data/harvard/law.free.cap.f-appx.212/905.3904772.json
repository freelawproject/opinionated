On appeal, Minuti argues that the government breached its plea agreement by recommending a sentence at the sentencing hearing, and, therefore, we should remand this case for resentencing before a different judge. Minuti contends, without discussion, that the appropriate standard of review is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-25\">Generally, the issue of whether the government breached a plea agreement is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998). However, if \u201cthe district court affords a defendant an opportunity to object after the imposition of sentence, and he fails to do so, any objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>sentence are barred absent manifest injustice. [We] equate [ ] the manifest injustice inquiry with review for plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). If these three prongs are met, we may exercise discretion to notice this error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">When the government breaches a plea agreement, a defendant is to be afforded two available remedies: (1) specific performance of the government\u2019s promise; or (2) the withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>See Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). The choice of remedy is within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>169 Fed.Appx. 548, 554 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Although it is clear from the record that the government breached the plea agreement during the sentencing hearing, Minuti failed to properly preserve the issue. Minuti did not request the district court to afford him either available remedy. Instead, he told the court that he wished to proceed with the sentencing hearing. Because Minuti opted to proceed with sentencing, and because the district court made a specific finding that the government\u2019s comments were not going to affect her decision concerning Minuti\u2019s sentence, we conclude there is no plain error. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1503-04 (11th Cir.1993) (refusing to find plain error where the defendant did not preserve objection, and there was no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Minuti\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
