The immigration judge (IJ) denied relief based upon a finding that her testimony was not credible, and the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Ntumba-Kadiombo argues that she is a refugee for purposes of obtaining asylum and that her testimony was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Ntumba-Kadiombo\u2019s appeal is subject to dismissal for failure to comply with the rules requiring citations to the record and relevant legal authority. <em>See Moore v. FDIC, </em>993 F.2d 106, 107 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a); 5th Cir. Rule 28.2.3. Moreover, assuming arguendo that her arguments were briefed adequately, we would not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v.
