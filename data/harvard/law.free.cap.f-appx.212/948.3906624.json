Specifically, Treece alleged that the SSA\u2019s failure to pay his old-age benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>violates his rights under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unlawful seizure, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against excessive fines, the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Ex Post Facto Clause. He further alleged that the SSA denied him due process and access to the courts by unduly delaying a response to his appeal filed in October 2004. Treece also requested leave to pursue a <em>Bivens </em>claim against Quittie C. Wilson, Assistant Regional Commissioner for the Social Security Processing Center at the Southeastern Program Service Center, \u201cin his/her official and personal capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The district court dismissed Treece\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, holding that Treece could not recover under <em>Bivens </em>or the FTCA and rejecting his constitutional challenges. Treece now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">On appeal, Treece argues that he is entitled to proceed under <em>Bivens </em>and the FTCA, and that the suspension of his Social Security benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the Takings Clause, the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unlawful seizures, and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibitions against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the district court is required to screen civil complaints filed by prisoners against governmental officers or entities, and shall dismiss the complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cPro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Nonetheless, federal courts have discretion to dismiss <em>pro se </em>claims if they lack arguable basis either in fact or in law. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324-25, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">A. Bivens</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Treece argues that contrary to the district court\u2019s ruling, he does have a cause of action under <em>Bivens. </em>As the district court stated, however, the Supreme Court has declined to imply a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for people improperly denied Social Security benefits, <em>Schweiker v. Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 425, 108 S.Ct. 2460, 2468, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988), and in <em>FLIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), the Court held that <em>Bivens </em>actions may not be brought directly against federal agencies such as the SSA. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we conclude that Treece is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>entitled to maintain a <em>Bivens </em>action in this matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">B. <em>Federal Tort Claims Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Treece also argues that he is entitled to relief under the FTCA. We review the application of the FTCA <em>de novo. Andrews v. United States, </em>121 F.3d 1430, 1438 (11th Cir.1997). The FTCA waives the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity as to negligent or wrongful actions by its employees within the scope of their official duties, where a \u201cprivate person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). But constitutional claims are not cognizable under the FTCA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, and the United States is not hable for damages under the FTCA for suits arising out of constitutional violations. <em>Meyer, </em>510 U.S. at 478, 114 S.Ct. at 1001 (holding that \u201c \u00a7 1346(b)\u2019s reference to the \u2018law of the place\u2019 means law of the State\u2014the source of substantive liability under the FTCA\u201d such that \u201cthe United States simply has not rendered itself liable under \u00a7 1346(b) for constitutional tort claims\u201d); <em>Couden v. Duffy, </em>446 F.3d 483, 499 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>242 F.3d 169, 175 (4th Cir.2001). Here, Treece\u2019s complaint contains only constitutional claims, which are not cognizable under the FTCA. <em>Meyer, </em>510 U.S. at 478, 114 S.Ct. at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">C. <em>Constitutional Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Treece contends that suspending his old-age benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because the statute was amended seven days before Treece received his prison sentence. But as the district court noted, the version of \u00a7 402(x) in place before Treece\u2019s conviction and sentence also allowed the SSA to suspend the old-age benefits of convicted felons during their incarceration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Treece\u2019s ex post facto challenge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Moreover, Treece\u2019s argument that the suspension of old-age benefits during incarceration violates the Due Process Clause was expressly rejected by this court in <em>Andujar v. Bowen, </em>802 F.2d 404, 405 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cWe hold that \u00a7 402(x)(l) is constitutional\u2014we find no violation of due process, no punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>without trial, and no bill of attainder or ex post facto law.\u201d). And because \u201c[y]ounger prisoners are not similarly situated to older prisoners with respect to social security benefits.... Section 402(x) does not impermissibly discriminate against any class of prisoners,\u201d his equal protection challenge is likewise meritless. <em>Butler v. Apfel, </em>144 F.3d 622, 625 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also Davis v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 799 (4th Cir.1987); <em>Zipkin v. Heckler, </em>790 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir.1986). Furthermore, as our sister circuits have held, suspension of Social Security benefits during incarceration constitutes neither punishment nor an excessive fine. <em>See Wiley v. Bowen, </em>824 F.2d 1120, 1122 (D.C.Cir.1987); <em>Peeler v. Heckler, </em>781 F.2d 649, 651-52 (8th Cir.1986). Therefore, \u00a7 402(x) violates neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because the suspension of Treece\u2019s old-age benefits during his incarceration is otherwise constitutional, Treece has no legal entitlement to those benefits while he is incarcerated, and therefore, the suspension constitutes neither a \u201ctaking\u201d without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment nor an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-15\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-16\">. The current version of \u00a7 402(x)(l)(A)(i), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-24\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no monthly benefits shall be paid under this section or under section 423 of this title to any individual for any month ending with or during or beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>with or during a period of more than 30 days throughout all of which such individual\u2014is confined in a jail, prison, or other penal institution or correctional facility pursuant to his conviction of a criminal offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x)(l)(A)(i) (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b976-9\">. In his Brief, Treece also alleges that the SSA's suspension of his old-age retirement benefits pursuant to \u00a7 402(x) violates the Supremacy Clause, his right against self-incrimination, and. constitutes a bill of attainder. He further alleges that the SSA has defrauded him by using an incorrect social security number in its response to Treece's October 2004 appeal to the SSA\u2019s Southeastern Program Service Center. Because Treece raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, we do not consider them. <em>See Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-7\">. As the Government notes in its Brief, Treece never served Mr. Wilson with a summons or the complaint, and Mr. Wilson never had an opportunity to raise any defenses to Treece's claims in the district court. Indeed, the Government expressly states that its brief is filed \"solely on behalf of\u201d the SSA. Accordingly, to the extent Treece\u2019s arguments on appeal pertain to claims against Wilson, we do not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. Prior to the 1994 amendment to which Treece refers, \u00a7 402(x) allowed for the suspension of benefits to any person during any month in which he was incarcerated pursuant to a felony conviction unless he satisfactorily participated in a court-approved rehabilitation program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x) (1994). The Social Security Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-387, 108 Stat. 4071, 4076 (1994), which became effecfive 90 days after its enactment on October 22, 1994, amended \u00a7 410 by replacing the \"felony\u201d terminology with \"an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year,\u201d and abolishing the rehabilitation-program exception. <em>Id. </em>Treece\u2019s incarceration is pursuant to a felony conviction, and he has never alleged eligibility for the rehabilitation-program exception. In 1999, the statute was amended by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Pub.L. No. 106-170, 113 Stat. 1860, 1908 (1999), which eliminated the clause \u201can offense punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year\u201d and substituted the language \"a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Treece became eligible for old-age benefits in 2003, this latest version of \u00a7 402(x) applies to him. Treece has never contended that his offense was not \"punishable by imprisonment of more than 1 year\u201d or a \"criminal offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
