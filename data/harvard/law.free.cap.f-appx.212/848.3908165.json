California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Cameron\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">. Count One of the indictment, to which Cameron pled guilty, charged conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine (R.l-24). He only pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine (R.3-84 at 14, 27-28). The written judgment, however, lists the nature of the offense as conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. (R.l-72 at 1.) Therefore, the judgment does not correctly reflect the offense of conviction. While this error does not undermine Cameron\u2019s conviction or affect his sentence in any way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the district court is instructed to correct the written judgment to properly describe the offense of conviction as involving only a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
