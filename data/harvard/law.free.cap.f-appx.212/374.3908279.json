In his sole claim of error on appeal, Nguyen argues that, because the Government failed to prove that he possessed the firearm or that the firearm was related to drug trafficking, the district court\u2019s decision overruling his objection to the enhancement of his sentence based on his possession of a firearm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>connection with a drug trafficking offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) was based on the clearly erroneous presumption that he was strictly liable for the possession of the firearm by his codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The district court determined that the firearm was connected with the offense because it was jointly possessed by Nguyen and his codefendant in a vehicle containing MDMA. Although the testimony at trial was conflicting, by its ruling, the district court implicitly found Nguyen\u2019s and his co-defendant\u2019s testimony incredible. Such credibility determinations are within the province of the district court and will not be disturbed by this court. <em>United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The remaining evidence presented at trial indicated that Nguyen\u2019s codefendant knowingly possessed the firearm for the purpose of protecting the drugs and the drug proceeds, and that Nguyen was aware that he was participating in criminal activity involving transporting drugs. The evidence thus shows that Nguyen was engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), and the district court reasonably inferred that Nguyen should have foreseen his codefendant\u2019s possession of the firearm. <em>See United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990). The district court did not clearly err by applying the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 330 (5th Cir.1998). Nguyen\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
