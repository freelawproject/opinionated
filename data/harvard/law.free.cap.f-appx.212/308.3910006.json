Trevino claims he was coerced into confessing by government threats to arrest and imprison his wife (who had been detained) and place his child in the custody of Child Protective Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">The voluntariness of a confession is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>the factual findings underlying that determination, for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Bell, </em>367 F.3d 452, 460-61 (5th Cir.2004). Based on our review of the record, the district court did not err in finding, under the totality of the circumstances, Trevino\u2019s confession voluntary. <em>See id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
