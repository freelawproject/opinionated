Jurisdiction Over BIA\u2019s Order Dismissing Petitioners\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">On appeal, Ricaurte primarily argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal because she demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s December 28, 2005, order affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order because Ricaurte did not file a timely petition for review from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">\u201cWe review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and (b)(1). We have held that \u201c[sjince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A timely motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">The BIA\u2019s final order of removal in this case was issued on December 28, 2005, when the BIA dismissed the petitioners\u2019 appeal from the IJ\u2019s order denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a) (providing that \u201c[a]n order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final ... [u]pon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals\u201d). Although the petitioners filed a timely motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review. Because the petitioners did not file their petition for review until April 7, 2006, more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s initial order dated December 28, 2005, we lack jurisdiction to review the December 28, 2005, order. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction over the petition for review to the extent that the petitioners are seeking review of the IJ\u2019s order denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, or the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>initial order dismissing their appeal from the IJ\u2019s order. Hence, the only issue on appeal we can review is whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider, which is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">II. Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">On appeal, the petitioners argue that the BIA erred in finding that Ricaurte did not provide evidence that her son was granted asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). After the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s order of removal, the alien may seek reconsideration on the ground that the BIA has made a legal or factual error. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reconsider must specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and be supported by pertinent authority. INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Here, we conclude from the record that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because (1) the petitioners did not identify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s order dismissing their appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); (2) the majority of the petitioners\u2019 brief only contains argument concerning the merits of their claim for asylum and fails to set forth any facts or law relevant to the denial of their motion to reconsider; and (3) the record shows that Ricaurte\u2019s nephew was granted asylum, not her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
