This court reviews the BIA\u2019s rulings of law de novo and the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Revilla-Moreno argues that the 2006 removal order is erroneous because his 1999 removal order is invalid in light of this court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001). Because Revilla-Moreno\u2019s 1999 removal order had been legally executed at the time <em>Chapa-Garza </em>was decided, <em>Chapa-Garza </em>does not apply to the 1999 removal order retroactively. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 675 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, </em>271 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">Revilla-Moreno argues that the BIA erred in concluding that it was without jurisdiction to reopen the prior removal proceedings. Revilla-Moreno cannot show a gross miscarriage of justice because he failed to file a petition for review in this court following the BIA\u2019s decision in 1999. <em>See Ramirez-Molina v. Ziglar, </em>436 F.3d 508, 515 (5th Cir.2006). As in that case, there is no miscarriage of justice because, if Revilla-Moreno had petitioned this court for review, \u201che could have attained the result that was ultimately achieved by the petitioner in <em>Chapa-Garza.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">Revilla-Moreno\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
