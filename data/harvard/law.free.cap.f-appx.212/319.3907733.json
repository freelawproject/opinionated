She contends that the district court erred in calculating the applicable recommended sentencing range because it classified her release violation as a Grade A violation rather than a Grade B violation. The Government does not contest Mitchell\u2019s assertion that hers was a Grade B violation. Instead, the Government asserts that the error did not amount to reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">We agree. Although Mitchell has demonstrated obvious error based on the guidelines miscalculation, she has failed to demonstrate that the error affected her substantial rights. <em>Cf. United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The sentence imposed fell within the two-year statutory maximum authorized upon revocation, and Mitchell has not shown that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence but for the guidelines miscalculation. <em>See id.; see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 472, 3559(a), 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
