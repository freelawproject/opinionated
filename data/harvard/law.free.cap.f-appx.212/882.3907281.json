She asserts that her belief was objectively reasonable because racial discrimination claims can be based on the provision of better work assignments for workers of one ethnicity versus another.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">As the district court stated in its April 20, 2006 order granting Tropicana\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \u201c[ejven if Eastman had a good faith belief that Tropicana engaged in unlawful race discrimination, Eastman\u2019s conduct [in complaining about it] was not protected by the opposition clause [of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) ], because her belief was not objectively reasonable.\u201d We agree, and therefore affirm the court\u2019s judgment. We affirm as well for the second reason the court gave for granting Tropicana summary judgment: Eastman failed to establish a causal connection between the alleged discrimination and the alleged retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
