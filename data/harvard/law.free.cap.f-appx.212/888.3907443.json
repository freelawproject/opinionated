Morales, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Morales\u2019s first two claims challenged his custody classification in prison and how this has affected his work assignments. In his third claim, he asserted that prison officials improperly delayed his ability to file a timely motion for post-conviction relief in state court. We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">\u201cTo prevail on a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate both (1) that the defendant deprived [him] of a right secured under the Constitution or federal law and (2) that such a deprivation occurred under color of state law.\u201d <em>Arrington v. Cobb County, </em>139 F.3d 865, 872 (11th Cir.1998). In doing so, a plaintiff must establish \u201can affirmative causal connection between the official\u2019s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation .... \u201d <em>Swint v. City of Wadley, </em>51 F.3d 988, 999 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">Here, Morales first argues he was entitled to a law clerk position in the prison library and was removed from this position in retaliation for filing grievances requesting his reinstatement to that position, in violation of his First Amendment rights. Although Morales identified several defendants by name and stated their roles in the prison with respect to job assignments, he never described any actions specific to him and his claim. Because Morales failed to identify the specific defendants and how their actions amounted to retaliation, he failed to allege a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 actions and his filing of the grievances. <em>Swint, </em>51 F.3d at 999. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Morales\u2019s complaint as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">As for Morales\u2019s argument that his due-process rights were violated, there are only two instances when a prisoner may be deprived of a due process liberty interest under \u00a7 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">The first is when a change in the prisoner\u2019s conditions of confinement is so severe that it essentially exceeds the sentence imposed by the court. The second situation is when the state has consistently bestowed a certain benefit to prisoners, usually through statute or administrative policy, and the deprivation of that benefit imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABA\"><em>Kirby v. Siegelman, </em>195 F.3d 1285, 1290-91 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted) (citing <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)). Morales\u2019s claim implicates neither of the <em>Kirby </em>situations because (1) Morales has not claimed that a change to his custody classification is \u201cso severe that it essentially exceeds the sentence imposed by the court,\u201d and (2) the statute and the administrative code provisions that Morales relies on do not bestow a benefit vis-a-vis the custody classification, the deprivation of which would result in an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d on Morales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Kirby, </em>195 F.3d at 1290-91; <em>see also Slezak v. Evatt, </em>21 F.3d 590, 594 (4th Cir.1994) (in the context of a claim based on a custody classification, holding that the U.S. Constitution affords no liberty interest in a prisoner\u2019s custody classification); <em>of. Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224-26, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) (holding that a prisoner does not have a liberty interest in an assignment to any particular prison, regardless of whether the conditions of one prison are \u201cmuch more disagreeable\u201d than another).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-6\">. The state law applicable to this case, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.1905, provides the general guidelines that prison officials use to determine a prisoner\u2019s classification level. Likewise, Fla. Admin. Code \u00a7 33-601.201 describes generally the \"inmate work program,\u201d and Fla. Admin. Code \u00a7 33-601.210 describes custody classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-20\">. Finally, we are unpersuaded by Morales\u2019s argument that he was denied access to the courts by prison officials due to \"inadequate library services,\u201d and thereby was prevented from filing his state habeas petition in a timely manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
