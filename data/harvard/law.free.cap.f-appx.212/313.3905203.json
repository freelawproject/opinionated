Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court vacated Gore\u2019s original sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that 1,630.11 grams of \u201cice\u201d was attributable to Gore. The court sentenced Gore to 327 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Gore argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently made because neither the factual basis nor the Fed. R.CrimJP. 11 colloquy mentioned an \u201cice\u201d conspiracy. He argues that by failing to advise him of the true nature of the charge \u2022 to which he was pleading guilty, the district court failed to comply with Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(G). Where, as here, a defendant did not object to Rule 11 error in the district court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">A guilty plea involves the waiver of several constitutional rights and, accordingly, must be knowing and voluntary. <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-44, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>see </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 11. Rule 11 explicitly requires that the district court \u201cinform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(G). Rule ll(b)(l)(G)\u2019s requirement regarding the nature of the charge is fulfilled when the defendant is informed of the elements of the offense charged. <em>See United States v. Lujano-Perez, </em>274 F.3d 219, 224 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">The fact that the methamphetamine involved in the offense was \u201cice\u201d was not a fact that increased the statutory penalty for Gore\u2019s crime such that it, in effect, became an essential \u201celement\u201d of the offense charged. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Although the involvement of \u201cice\u201d did affect Gore\u2019s sentencing guidelines range, the district court could, following <em>Booker, </em>\u201ccontinue to find by a preponderance of the evidence all facts relevant to sentencing, even if those facts increase the guideline sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>range.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). Gore has not established error, plain or otherwise, in the validity of his guilty plea. <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Gore\u2019s argument that his <em>post-Booker </em>sentence violated due process is likewise without merit. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). To the extent that Gore argues that <em>Mares </em>was wrongfully decided, one panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
