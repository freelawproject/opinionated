Defendants seek to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part their motion for reconsideration, and its amended order granting in part and denying in part Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, both entered on November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders Appellants seek to appeal are neither final orders nor appealable interlocutory or collateral orders. Accordingly, we grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Strong\u2019s appeal, and dismiss Defendants\u2019 appeal, for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
