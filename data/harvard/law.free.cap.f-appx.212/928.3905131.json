After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b954-23\">Joyner pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. As a condition of his supervised release, Joyner was to refrain from excessive use of alcohol and prohibited from purchasing, possessing or using a controlled substance. Joyner was also required to participate in alcohol and drug testing and a treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-24\">After serving his prison term, Joyner began his supervised release on March 7, 2005. Joyner repeatedly tested positive for either cocaine or ethanol. After Joyner admitted to his probation officer that he had used cocaine, Joyner was placed in a substance abuse program. When he again tested positive for ethanol on three occasions, Joyner agreed to participate in a 90-day residential treatment program. After completing the 90-day program, however, Joyner again tested positive for cocaine and admitted that, because he had expected a positive urinalysis, he had sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>stituted someone else\u2019s urine for his own. Joyner\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court for revocation of Joyner\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">At the revocation hearing, Joyner admitted his violations and to having a \u201cdrug problem.\u201d Based on his Grade C violations and a criminal history category of IV, Joyner\u2019s advisory Chapter 7 guidelines range was 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). The statutory maximum term of imprisonment was two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(B)(3). Joyner requested that he be sentenced to 6 months\u2019 community confinement at a halfway house so that he could receive drug treatment and maintain his ability to work. The government made no recommendation as to sentence, but requested that Joyner not be put on supervised release following his term of imprisonment because it believed Joyner would be unable to comply with the terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In sentencing Joyner, the district court expressly noted that it had \u201cconsidered the sentencing guidelines\u201d as well as \u201cJoyner\u2019s background and history,\u201d and that, \u201c[biased on his extensive criminal history and his unwillingness to abide by the conditions of probation,\u201d a guideline range sentence was not appropriate. The district court further explained that Joyner had been using drugs even after being permitted to participate in the 90-day drug program. Furthermore, the court found that Joyner failed to \u201ccomply! ] with the orders and directives of the probation office,\u201d and instead \u201cactually attempted] to deceive\u201d the office. Based on the above, the district court sentenced Joyner to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, with an evaluation for potential drug abuse and participation in a treatment program if necessary. Joyner objected to the sentence as unreasonable, but the court disagreed based on its evaluation of \u201call the circumstances.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">On appeal, Joyner argues that the district court failed to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing his sentence and that, had the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it would have concluded that confinement in a community halfway house for drug treatment was the most appropriate punishment under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We have concluded that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, an indication that the district court has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Here, the district court did not explicitly mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, the arguments of the parties before the district court and the district court\u2019s stated reasons for imposing a sentence above the guidelines range implicate several \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the district court explicitly considered Joyner\u2019s background, criminal history and drug problem, his past unwillingness to abide by the conditions of probation and his attempts to deceive the probation office by substituting someone else\u2019s urine sample. In other words, the district court considered the history and characteristics of the defendant, the circumstances of offense and the need for medical treatment and deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (2)(D). Furthermore, we cannot say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Joyner\u2019s 24-month sentence was unreasonable under the factual circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
