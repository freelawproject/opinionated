Knezek fails, however, to provide any legal authority for his assertion (other than citing to a Guidelines handbook), cite the applicable standard of review, or provide adequate supporting citations to the record. Accordingly, Knezek has inadequately briefed his claim and, therefore, has effectively abandoned it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
