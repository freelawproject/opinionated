Wright, </em>No. 04-12335 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Petitioner thereafter moved the district court to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The court denied his motion, and we granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-25\">(1) Whether, in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), the district court was required to address all of the claims raised in [petitioner\u2019s] motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-26\">(2) If so, whether the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address [petitioner\u2019s] claim that, due to ineffective assistance from his counsel, he was deprived of a substantial assistance reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-27\">We answer the first question in the affirmative. The court was required to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>dress all of petitioner\u2019s claims. We answer the second question in the affirmative as well; the court failed to address petitioner\u2019s claim that due to the constitutionally ineffective assistance of his attorney, he was deprived of a potential substantial-assistance reduction of his base offense level at sentencing. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for consideration of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">VACATED and REMANDED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
