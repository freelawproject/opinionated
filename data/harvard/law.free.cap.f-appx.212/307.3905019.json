Zelaya-Parada argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 31-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-25\">Zelaya-Parada\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Zelaya-Parada properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-28\">Zelaya-Parada also argues that his guilty plea is not valid because (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>district court failed to give him full and correct information regarding the maximum statutory penalty that he would face for the offense and (2) the factual basis for his plea was insufficient to establish that he was \u201cfound in\u201d the United States. Zelaya-Parada\u2019s first argument is premised on the unconstitutionality of \u00a7 1326. However, the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1326 is constitutional. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 246, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As to the second argument, Zelaya-Parada has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 72-76, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Medina, </em>212 F.3d 1162, 1163-64 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">As the Government seeks to enforce Zelaya-Parada\u2019s waiver of sentencing issues and the waiver is valid, we do not address those issues. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
