Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a) for indecency with a child was a crime of violence. A review of the record shows that, although Figueroa objected in district court to the enhancement, he did so on grounds other than the following issue he raises here. Therefore, we review only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1175, 115 S.Ct. 1157, 130 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1995). For plain error, Figueroa must show a clear or obvious error affected his substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1029, 125 S.Ct. 675, 160 L.Ed.2d 510 (2004). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellant court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if ... the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides for a 16-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if he was previously deported after being convicted of a felony crime of violence. The accompanying Application Notes define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d either as one of a list of enumerated offenses or as \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (2005). The enumerated offenses include the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d. <em>Id.; see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>also United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 421-422 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1133, 117 S.Ct. 1283, 137 L.Ed.2d 359 (1997) (concluding sexual abuse of a minor is \u201cinherently violent\u201d and is, therefore, an enumerated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). Figueroa contends his conviction under \u00a7 21.11(a) did not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because, under that statute, a victim can be as old as a day under seventeen and therefore would not fall under the generic, contemporary meaning of the term \u201cminor\u201d as it is used in the vast majority of statutes proscribing sexual activity with or against persons below a certain age.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 982, 121 S.Ct. 434, 148 L.Ed.2d 441 (2000) is dispositive. It held the victim of a \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) offense, \u201ca child younger than 17 years, is clearly a minor\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 604. (internal quotations omitted). It further noted that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) is \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Finally, although it is unclear under which section of \u00a7 21.11 Figueroa was convicted both subsections employ similar language. <em>See </em>\u00a7 21.11(a). Needless to say, there was no clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Figueroa also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Figueroa\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would now overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Figueroa concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
