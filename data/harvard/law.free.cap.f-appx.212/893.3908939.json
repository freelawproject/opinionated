The IJ concluded that Sandoval had not carried her burden to establish eligibility for asylum, because the incidents she described \u201camounted] to civil chaos and/or generally dangerous conditions that exist in Colombia [and] that affect all citizens[,]\u201d and that Sandoval was a victim of \u201ccivil strife that exists in Colombia.\u201d On review, Sandoval argues that she was entitled to asylum because she established past persecution, or a fear of future persecution, by the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d) on account of her memberships in the Liberal Party and in the Convergence Party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">In the case at bar, the BIA issued a decision in which it adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and did not make additional findings. \u2018We therefore review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Wei Chen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). As the fact-finder, it is the IJ\u2019s duty to determine credibility, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings. <em>See Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977) (citation omitted). The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an ahen is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would <em>compel </em>a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">An ahen who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the ahen meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion----\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">The asylum apphcant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The apphcant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that her statutorily hsted factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cTo establish asylum based on <em>past </em>persecution, the apphcant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the ahen to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). We have held that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">If the ahen estabhshes past persecution, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to the country of removal unless the government shows by a preponderance that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the apphcant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened or that the ahen could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b). An ahen who has <em>not </em>shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if she can demonstrate a fear of <em>future </em>persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), \u201cTo estabhsh eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the apphcant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (citations omitted). If an apphcant satisfies these requirements, she then must show that the persecution cannot be avoided by relocating in the subject country. <em>See Sepulveda, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>401 F.3d at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum relief. Sandoval testified that between March 2000 and March 2001, she received threatening telephone calls from members of the ELN and the letters \u201cELN\u201d were painted on her house. She further testified that a group of men\u2014suspected guerilla members\u2014went looking for her at her parents\u2019 house. There is no evidence in the record, however, that either Sandoval or her husband were physically harmed or ever confronted by the ELN. Mere harassment, without more, is insufficient to establish persecution, as \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). We have made clear that threatening phone calls and letters constitute mere \u201charassment and intimidation,\u201d and that they fail to rise to the level of persecution. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237; <em>see also Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (stating that \u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats ... do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision\u201d) (citation omitted). In short, the threatening phone calls and other isolated incidents described by Sandoval do not rise to the level of \u201cpast persecution\u201d under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Sandoval did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by the ELN. Sandoval and her family lived in Colombia without incident from 1996 to 2000 and Sandoval failed to present specific evidence that the ELN maintains an interest in harming her or that she would be singled out for persecution by the ELN if she returned to Colombia, where her parents continue to live without incident. Because Sandoval did not show that she suffered past persecution or that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground, she did not establish eligibility for asylum. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-13\">. Sandoval challenges only the denial of asylum under the INA. Accordingly, we do not review the denial of withholding of removal under the INA or relief under the CAT, as any arguments as to those claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, when an applicant fails to raise arguments regarding an issue on appeal, that issue is deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
