We conclude that the court abused its discretion; we therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">On March 24, 1995, Michael Perez and his partner, both detectives in the Miami-Dade County Police Department, were working undercover when they overheard a police radio report that fellow officers were in pursuit of several black males who had just robbed a Radio Shack. Perez and his partner joined the chase, and, upon discovering the suspects driving away from the scene, followed them by car. When the suspects abandoned their vehicle, Perez and his partner chased them on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-14\">Meanwhile, Sergeant William Allsbury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also a County officer, was patrolling in his police car when he heard the same radio report, and, seeing Perez and his partner running along the street in the same area, believed them to be two of the suspects. When Allsbury closed in on Perez and his partner, his vehicle struck Perez. Perez contends that Allsbury struck him intentionally and that, as a result, he suffered serious injuries, including herniated discs, broken bones, and permanent psychological damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-16\">Perez filed this action on June 19, 1997. His complaint contained four counts against the County and four against Allsbury. Count I sought relief against both defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It alleged that the County had a \u201cpractice, custom or policy ... [of] allowing police officers to use unnecessary and unreasonable deadly force, including, but not limited to, the use of motor vehicles to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>and detain subjects, in the apprehension of persons,\u201d and that Allsbury was carrying out that practice, custom, or policy when his automobile struck Perez. Aimed only at Allsbury, Counts II and III alleged claims of common law negligence and assault and battery, respectively. Counts IV and VI sought relief solely \u00e1gainst the County under two Florida statutes: the \u201cWhistle Blower\u2019s Statute\u201d for \u201cretaliatory personnel action[s]\u201d the County allegedly took against Perez after he reported the incident, and the \u201cFull Pay Statute,\u201d which entitles an employee to full pay upon being injured at work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, Count V, directed at both the County and Allsbury under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985, alleged that the two defendants had \u201cconspired to deprive [Perez] of equal protection of the laws and of equal privileges and immunities under the laws based upon [their] animus against persons of African American or Latin origin.\u201d In each count, Perez prayed for compensatory and punitive damages \u201cin excess of $5 million.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Along with the complaint, Perez served the County with a Request for Admissions (\u201cJune 25 Request\u201d), consisting of forty admissions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The request was, for the most part, a verbatim copy of the complaint, save a few minor changes, like inserting \u201cRequest for Admissions\u201d in the place of \u201cComplaint\u201d and deleting the complaint\u2019s subsection titles, like \u201cFactual Background\u201d and \u201cClaim 1.\u201d Indeed, the June 25 Request is replete with the same typographical errors as the complaint and even includes such statements as, \u201cThis is a claim for deprivation of constitutional rights under color of state law ...\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 16.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">Though it did not answer the June 25 Request, the County, along with Allsbury, filed answers to the complaint on July 14, 1997, and denied, or claimed to be without sufficient knowledge to answer, all but two of the complaint\u2019s allegations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Significantly, the defendants denied (1) that Allsbury \u201cintentionally or negligently aimed his vehicle directly at [Perez], gunned the engine, and struck [him]\u201d and (2) that the County has \u201ca practice, custom, or policy allowing police officers to use unnecessary and unreasonable deadly force ... in the apprehension of persons.\u201d The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>also pleaded several affirmative defenses, including contributory and comparative negligence and assumption of risk. The answers were signed by Eric K. Gressman, Assistant County Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">On September 12, 1997, the district court held a scheduling conference, attended by Perez\u2019s attorney and Gressman. At the conference, in discussing the merits of the case, Gressman reiterated what had been stated in the defendants\u2019 answers: that \u201cthere is no policy or procedure that says that [officers may] use cars to run over suspects ... unless deadly force is being used against [an officer].\u201d Also at the conference, Perez\u2019s attorney stated that he had prepared written discovery requests, including requests for admissions, that, \u201caccording to Mr. Gressman, have not yet [been] served on him,\u201d but would be re-served \u201cin the next couple of days.\u201d Following the conference, the district court entered a scheduling order, setting the pretrial conference for February 20, 1998, and requiring that all motions be filed by February 1 and that all discovery be completed by February 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">On October 3, 1997, Perez served the County with a second request for admissions (\u201cOctober 3 Request\u201d) consisting of seventy-two admissions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This request was a verbatim copy of the June 25 Request with the addition of thirty-four new items., Most of the new items concerned the extent of Perez\u2019s injuries, e.g., \u201cAs a result of being hit by Seargent (sic) Allsbury\u2019s vehicle, Plaintiff suffered a broken leg.\u201d Along with the October 3 Request, Perez served the County with a request for production of documents and notices for the taking of depositions of several County officials and employees..</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Time passed and, as the district court ultimately found, the County \u201cfailed to produce the requested documents within thirty days, did not produce the witnesses for the scheduled depositions, and failed to respond to the [October 3 Request] within thirty days.\u201d On January 6, 1998, therefore, Perez re-served the discovery requests, including the October 3 Request. Gressman does not dispute that he received the January 6 discovery request, which was stamped \u201cReceived by [Miami-]Dade County Attorney, January 6, 1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">On January 27, having not received any response from the County as to his discovery requests, Perez' moved the district court to strike the defendants\u2019 answers and enter a default judgment because the officials and employees had not appeared to testify at their scheduled depositions, or, in the alternative, to compel production of the witnesses and documents sought. As for the unanswered requests for admissions, Perez argued that, under Rule 36(a) of \u00a1the Federal Rules of. Civil Procedure, the matters should be deemed admitted because the County had not responded within the rule\u2019s thirty-day time limit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Three days later, on January 30, 1998, Perez filed a motion for summary judgment on Count I, setting forth claims under section 1983, and asserted that 'the defendants, by failing to respond to the requests for admissions, \u201chave admitted to all material facts and issues including that it is a custom, practice, and policy of the department to engage in the unnecessary use of deadly force.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">On February 3, 1998, before the district court ruled on P\u00e9rez\u2019s two outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>motions, the County finally responded to the June 25 Request, denying, or asserting the inability to admit or deny, almost all of the items. Two days later, the County asked the court for more time to' respond to Perez\u2019s other discovery requests, asserting that it had first received those requests on January 6, 1998, and that the deadlines for responding be calculated from the date of January 8. The district court granted the motion on February 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Soon after receiving the County\u2019s answer to the June 25 Request, Perez, on February 18, filed a motion \u201cto Strike [the County\u2019s] Response to Request for Admissions, to Determine the Responses Insufficient, and to Order the Requests Admitted.\u201d In this motion, Perez once again argued that the court, should deem as admitted the items from both the June 25 Request and the October 3 Request because the County had answered the June 25 Request over six months after service and had completely failed to answer the October 3 Request. Failing to act within thirty days of service, Perez reiterated, violates Rule 36(a) and requires that the court find the items admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The day before the pretrial conference, held on February 20, 1998, Gressman filed, on behalf of both defendants, a response to Perez\u2019s summary judgment motion and, along with the response, finally answered the October 3 Request. The response to the summary judgment motion was timely because the court had extended the defendants\u2019 deadline to respond. The court had not, however, extended the thirty-day time limit for answering the October 3 Request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">At the pretrial conference, after accepting as timely the defendants\u2019 response to Perez\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court turned to Perez\u2019s motion to strike the County\u2019s answer to the June 25 Request. Before the court ruled, Gressman pointed out that the County had actually responded to both requests, albeit belatedly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court, without acknowledging Gressman\u2019s statement, proceeded to deem as admitted several of the items from both the June 25 and October 3 Requests.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Among others, the district court found that the following key items had been admitted: 1) Sergeant Allsbury was, at all times relevant, a County police officer; 2) Allsbury believed Perez to be an African-American suspect and intentionally aimed his vehicle directly at Perez and struck him; 3) Perez was seriously injured as a result of the incident \u2014 suffering a permanent total disability; 4) the County had a practice, policy, or custom of allowing police officers to use unnecessary and unreasonable deadly force, including the use of motor vehicles to strike and detain subjects; and 5) Allsbury struck Perez in accordance with the County\u2019s practice, policy, or custom.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Gress<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>man, in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage his clients\u2019 case, argued that \u201cthere is no prejudice [to Perez] whatsoever in [giving effect to] these late responses, if you want to call them late responses, to the requests for admissions.\u201d The court did not address his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The indirect effect of the court\u2019s ruling was to strike the answers of both defendants. That is, by finding the items admitted, the court had effectively deemed \u201cconclusively established\u201d all of the elements of Perez\u2019s section 1983 claims, to wit: that Allsbury, acting under color of state law, intentionally struck Perez as a result of the County\u2019s \u201cpractice, policy or custom of allowing police officers to use unnecessary and unreasonable deadly force.\u201d <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (\u201cIt is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under section 1983.\u201d). With these elements conclusively established, the district court granted Perez\u2019s motion for summary judgment against both defendants, but only as to liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">On February 26, the defendants, still represented by Gressman, under seal, with leave of court, filed a motion to withdraw admissions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the motion Gressman submitted that, during the time period at issue, he was under the care of a psychologist for a serious mental health condition that had rendered him incapable of carrying out his professional responsibilities, including the representation of the County and Allsbury in the instant case. These circumstances alone, he suggested, were sufficient to grant the defendants the relief they were seeking. Alternatively, Gress-man asserted, the court should grant relief because substantial doubts existed as to whether, as Perez was contending, the County maintained a \u201cpractice, policy, or custom\u201d of running down suspects with police vehicles and whether Allsbury had struck Perez intentionally.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, Gressman pleaded, a manifest injustice would result if the court adhered to its previous dispositive rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">The next day, the court entered a one-page order which confirmed the rulings it had made at the February 20 pretrial conference \u2014 granting Perez\u2019s \u201cMotion to Strike [the County\u2019s] Response to Request for Admissions, to Determine the Responses Insufficient, and to Order the Requests Admitted\u201d and Perez\u2019s \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The court\u2019s order made no mention, however, of the motion Gressman had just filed under seal the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">On March 3, still without a ruling on his motion to withdraw, Gressman moved the court to reconsider its earlier rulings. The court finally ruled on April 9, denying the motion to reconsider as well as the motion to withdraw.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court reasoned that Rule 36(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cprovides that matters set forth in a request for admissions are deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>admitted unless \u2018the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission, a written answer within 30 days.\u2019 \u201d The court further found that the County had received both requests months before they were answered and that Gressman\u2019s personal problem \u201csimply d[id] not justify his utter neglect of this case and flagrant disregard for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for over seven months.\u201d In short, Gressman \u201cha[d] not provided an adequate excuse\u201d to justify withdrawing the admissions or reconsidering the earlier rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">In a second order issued on April 9, the court reiterated its previous orders granting Perez summary judgment on the liability aspects of his section 1983 claims against the County and Allsbury and scheduled those claims for trial before a jury on April 27, 1998. The trial began on that date. After Perez rested, he dismissed Allsbury as a party defendant without prejudice. The jury received the case on May 1, and, that same day, returned a verdict against the County, awarding Perez $5.7 million in compensatory damages. After denying the County\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court entered judgment against the County for $5.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The County appealed the district court\u2019s judgment, but we dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The court had neither disposed of Perez\u2019s remaining claims nor entered a partial final judgment on Perez\u2019s section 1983 claim pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; consequently, the case lacked a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Perez v. Miami-Dade County, </em>No. 98-5075, at 8 (11th Cir. March 1, 2001) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">On remand, the County moved the court to enter a final judgment on the Count I section 1983 claim under Rule 54(b). The court did so on May 8, 2001. One week later, Perez, relying on the district court\u2019s previous rulings in his favor, moved the court for summary judgment with respect to the issue of liability on his remaining claims \u2014 Counts IV, V, and VI.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The County likewise moved for summary judgment on those counts on May 25. On August 22, 2001, the court granted the County\u2019s motion and gave it final judgment on the three remaining counts. Coupled with the Rule 54(b) judgment, the August 22 judgment brought an end to the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">The County now appeals the judgment on Count I, and Perez cross-appeals the judgments on Counts IV,. V, and VI. Perez\u2019s assignments of error- \u2014 laid out in the margin<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 are without merit. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>fore limit our discussion to the County\u2019s appeal, namely to the issue set out in the first paragraph of this opinion: whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the County\u2019s (and Allsbury\u2019s) motion, made pursuant' to Rule 36(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to withdraw admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">At the outset, we emphasize that district courts are entitled to broad discretion in managing pretrial discovery matters. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Ga., </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1269 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. McCutcheon, </em>86 F.3d 187, 190 (11th Cir.1996)). \u201cGiven the caseload of most district courts and the fact that cases can sometimes stretch out over years, district courts must have discretion and authority to ensure that then-cases move to a reasonably timely and orderly conclusion.\u201d <em>Chrysler Int\u2019l Corp. v. Chemaly, </em>280 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2002). Indeed, we have repeatedly emphasized the responsibility of trial courts to manage pretrial discovery properly in order to avoid \u201ca massive waste of judicial and private resources\u201d and a loss of society\u2019s \u201cconfidence in the courts\u2019 ability to administer justice.\u201d <em>Johnson Enters. of Jacksonville, Inc. v. FPL Group, Inc., </em>162 F.3d 1290, 1333 (11th Cir.1998) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1132-34 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Ebrahimi v. Huntsville Bd. of Educ., </em>114 F.3d 162, 165 (11th Cir.1997); <em>Pelletier v. Zweifel, </em>921 F.2d 1465, 1522 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">Nevertheless, . \u201c[t]his discretion [over discovery issues] is not wholly unfettered.\u201d <em>Chrysler Int\u2019l Corp., </em>280 F.3d at 1360. We therefore review the district court\u2019s denial of the County\u2019s motion to withdraw the admissions under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1213 (11th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs requests for admissions, allowing a party to serve on \u201cany other party a written request for the admission ... of the truth of any matters within the [general scope of discovery] set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The purpose of the rule is \u201cto expedite the trial and to relieve the parties of the cost of proving facts that will not be disputed at trial.\u201d 8A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Richard L. Marcus, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2252 (2d ed. 1994); <em>Pickens v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>413 F.2d 1390, 1393 (5th Cir.1969). The served party has thirty days after service to respond to the request \u2014 by a written answer \u201cspecifically deny[ing] the matter\u201d or \u201cset[ting] forth in detail the reasons why [it] cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter\u201d or by objecting to the request. Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a). If a party fails to respond within thirty days, then \u201c[t]he matter is admitted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Once the matter is admitted, Rule 36(b) provides that it is \u201cconclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(b).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A court \u201cmay permit withdrawal or amendment [of an admission] when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Based on this language, we have held that district courts should apply a \u201ctwo-part test\u201d in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw or amend admissions. <em>Smith v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>837 F.2d 1575, 1577 (11th Cir.1988). First, the court should consider whether the withdrawal will subserve the presentation of the merits, and second, it must determine whether the withdrawal will prejudice the party who obtained the admissions in its presentation of the case. <em>Id.; Hadley v. United States, </em>45 F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1995); <em>FDIC v. Prusia, </em>18 F.3d 637, 640 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Perez contends, however, that applying the two-part test is permissive and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>Rule 36(b), in stating that a court <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>allow a withdrawal or amendment, does not require a district court to grant such motions even if the two-part test is met. For this proposition, Perez cites <em>Carney v. IRS, </em>258 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir.2001), which stated, in dictum, that, \u201c[e]ven when these two factors are established, a district court still has discretion to deny a request for leave to withdraw or amend an admission.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not deny that Rule 36(b) vests the district court with discretion in ruling on motions to withdraw or amend admissions. We disagree with Perez, however, to the extent that he argues that such discretion is unfettered. See supra part III.A (discussing the power of appellate courts to review discovery decisions made by district courts, albeit with deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Indeed, we read Rule 36(b) as granting a district court discretion but then specifying exactly how that discretion is to be exercised. <em>See, e.g., In re Durability Inc., </em>212 F.3d 551, 556 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe court\u2019s focus must be on the effect upon the litigation and prejudice to the resisting party rather than ... on the moving party\u2019s excuses for an erroneous admission.\u201d) (citing 10A Federal Procedure L.Ed. \u00a7 26.500 (1988) (internal mark omitted)); <em>Asea, Inc., v. Southern Pac. Transp.

Rule 36(b)\u2019s two-part test is much more than merely hortatory; it \u201cemphasizes the <em>importance of having the action resolved on the merits, </em>while at the same time assuring each party that justified rebanee on an admission in preparation for trial will not operate to his prejudice.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>837 F.2d at 1577-78 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 36 advisory committee\u2019s note) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">While we stop short of holding that mov-ants have \u201can absolute right ... to have [their] admissions withdrawn,\u201d <em>Asea, </em>669 F.2d at 1248, we nonetheless believe that, to best fulfih the purposes of Rule 36, a district court must abide by the two-part test of Rule 36(b). We hold, therefore, that a district court abuses its discretion under Rule 36(b) in denying a motion to withdraw or amend admissions when it appbes some other criterion beyond the two-part test \u2014 or grossly misapplies the two-part test \u2014 -in making its ruling. <em>See Gutting v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>710 F.2d 1309, 1313 (8th Cir.1983) (\u201cRegardless of the intentions of the district court to sanction [the party], we find the district erred in not considering the factors set out in [R]ule 36(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">Here, the district court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to withdraw admissions without even discussing the two-part test of Rule 36(b). The court, in fact, never even mentioned Rule 36(b) at all; rather, it focused on the thirty-day time limit <em>from </em>Rule 36(a), noted that the County had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>missed the deadlines for both requests, and reaffirmed its finding that the items had been deemed admitted. Even though, in their motion to withdraw, the defendants had argued that Perez had shown no prejudice, the only other reason the district court gave for denying the withdrawal was the inadequacy of the County\u2019s excuse for its belated responses. Specifically, the court noted that the personal problems of Gressman, the County attorney, \u201csimply do[] not justify [the County\u2019s] utter neglect of this case and flagrant disregard for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for over seven months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Denying the motion to withdraw based on this reasoning (or lack thereof) was an abuse of discretion. Moreover, had the court properly applied the two-part test mandated by Rule 36(b), it would have found that withdrawal was not only appropriate but necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">The first prong of the two-part test from Rule 36(b) calls for a determination of whether \u201cthe presentation of the merits will be subserved\u201d by allowing a withdrawal or amendment of the admissions. This part of the test \u201cemphasizes the importance of having the action resolved on the merits,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>837 F.2d at 1577, and is \u201csatisfied when upholding the admissions would practically eliminate any presentation of the merits of the case,\u201d <em>Hadley, </em>45 F.3d at 1348. In <em>Hadley, </em>for example, the court found that two of the admissions \u201cessentially admitted the necessary elements [of the claims];\u201d therefore, withdrawal was proper. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">In the instant case, the items the court had deemed admitted conclusively established the liability of both defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For instance, the court found that the County had admitted that it had \u201ca practice, policy, or custom of allowing police officers to use unnecessary and unreasonable deadly force, including the use of motor vehicles to strike and detain subjects.\u201d A municipality\u2019s practice, policy, or custom is not some tangential factual matter in a section 1983 case; it is the core element and is, consequently, often the most disputed. Deeming this element admitted took the wind out of the defendants\u2019 sails and effectively ended the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">Thus, granting the motion to withdraw the admissions would have certainly aided in the \u201c \u2018ascertainment of the truth and the development of the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>837 F.2d at 1577 (quoting with approval the district court\u2019s opinion in that case); <em>see also Manatt v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>122 F.3d 514, 517 (8th Cir.1997) (\u201cIn the circumstances of this case, the prospect of deeming the controverted fact as having been admitted seems to be anathema to the ascertainment of the truth.\u201d) (citations and internal marks omitted). The first prong of the two-part test is therefore easily met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">Rule 36(b)\u2019s second prong requires the court to ascertain whether the non-moving party would be prejudiced by a withdrawal or amendment of admissions. We have before explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-12\">The prejudice contemplated by the Rule is not simply that the party who initially obtained the admission will now have to convince the fact finder of its truth. Rather, it relates to the difficulty a party may face in proving its case, e.g., caused by the unavailability of key witnesses, because of the sudden need to obtain evidence with respect to the questions previously answered by the admissions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\"><em>Smith, </em>837 F.2d at 1578 (quoting <em>Brook Village N. Assoc. v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>686 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir.1982)). For this rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>son, a court is more likely to find prejudice when a party seeks to withdraw its admissions once trial has already begun. <em>See, e.g., 999 v. C.I.T. Corp., </em>776 F.2d 866, 869 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cHad [the defendant] made this argument [that there was no prejudice] while moving for withdrawal of the admission before trial, it would have been more persuasive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Although the motion to withdraw the admissions was made before trial, Perez nonetheless argues that a withdrawal would have been prejudicial. Perez unconvincingly asserts that he \u201creified] upon the admissions in his preparation for trial,\u201d an astonishing claim in light of the facts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendants, in denying the allegations of the complaint (a document that mirrors the bulk of the requests for admissions), maintained from the very beginning that they would contest Perez\u2019s core allegations. Moreover, at the scheduling conference held on September 12,-1997, Gressman reiterated what had been stated in the defendants\u2019 answers: that \u201cthere is no policy or procedure that says that [officers' may] use cars to run over suspects ... unless deadly force is being used against [an officer].\u201d Finally, attached to Perez\u2019s \u201cUnilateral Pretrial Stipulation,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> filed on February 18, 1998, is a section entitled \u201cDefendants\u2019 Statement of Facts,\u201d in which the defendants maintained that the County had no \u201cpolicy or procedure ... authorizing use of deadly force against a fleeing suspect who does not pose a risk of causing the death of an officer.\u201d The same document also reveals that the County disputed whether Sergeant Allsbury had intentionally hit Perez with his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">Because Perez knew from the very beginning \u2014 and continued to be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>aware \u2014 that he would have to prove many of the elements of Ms case now deemed admitted, he would have suffered no prejudice, had the court allowed a withdrawal. In fact, Perez had been engaging in discovery all along, albeit with some resistance by the County, and had only relied on the admissions for six days \u2014 from February 20 to February 26, the day on which the defendants requested a withdrawal. Certainly, allowing an amendment or withdrawal at that early point would not have created a \u201csudden need\u201d for Perez to obtain evidence. Moreover, at the time the defendants requested the withdrawal, a trial on the merits had not yet begun; the district court could have simply extended the discovery deadlines \u2014 as it previously had done \u2014 to enable Perez to prove his case. The only prejudice Perez would have likely suffered would have been the inconvenience in having to gather evidence, and this \u201c[does] not rise to a level of prejudice that justifie[s] a denial of the withdrawal motion.\u201d <em>Hadley, </em>45 F.3d at 1349.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Perez relies heavily on our decision in <em>United States v. 2204 Barbara Lane, </em>960 F.2d 126 (11th Cir.1992), in which we affirmed the award of summary judgment for the government in a civil forfeiture action based on unanswered admissions. This reliance is misplaced. Unlike the instant case, the defendant in <em>2204 Barbara Lane </em>never disputed the underlying facts. In affirming the grant of summary judgment, we specifically noted that the defendant had conceded the essential element of the forfeiture action \u2014 that his property was used to sell cocaine. <em>See id. </em>at 129. Here, however, Perez had been warned all along that he would have to prove the most essential elements of his section 1983 claims; thus, we cannot say that he would have suffered prejudice had the court allowed the defendants to withdraw the admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">We conclude with a comment on Rule 36 and Perez\u2019s use of requests for admissions in this case. Essentially, Rule 36 is a time-saver, designed \u201cto expedite the trial and to relieve the parties of the cost of <em>proving facts that will not be disputed at trial.\u201d </em>8A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, <em>&amp; </em>Richard L. Marcus, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2252 (2d ed.1994) (emphasis added). That is, when a party uses the rul to establish uncontested facts and to narrow the issues for trial, then the rule functions properly. When a party like Perez, however, uses the rule to harass the other side or, as in this case, with the wild-eyed hope \"that the other side will fail to answer and therefore admit essential elements (that the party has already denied in its answer), the rule\u2019s time-saving function ceases; the rule instead becomes a weapon, dragging out the litigation and wasting valuable resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">For this reason, we believe that it is inappropriate (as well as prohibited by Rule 36 itself, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)) for a plaintiff to serve a request for admissions along with the complaint. It is simply too early for the defendant, having not yet received the allegations, to perceive what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>facts should or should not be contested. Once a defendant has answered, moreover, it continues to be inappropriate for a plaintiff to re-serve the complaint in the form of a request for admissions in order to \u201crequire the defendant to admit or deny nearly every paragraph [of a complaint it has already answered].\u201d <em>E.g., Downs v. Brasted, </em>No. 92-1611, 1993 WL 273370, at *1 (D.Kan. June 28, 1993); <em>Brenord v. Catholic Med. Ctr., </em>133 F.Supp.2d 179, 193 (E.D.N.Y.2001). <em>But see United States v. Young, </em>No. 87 CIV 9159, 1990 WL 135734, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 1990) (\u201cThe mere fact that a party has previously denied the matter about which an admission is sought does not obviate the need to respond to a Rule 36 request for admissions.\u201d). This is especially true here, where the defendants had denied Perez\u2019s core allegations \u2014 that the County- had a \u201cpractice, custom, or policy\u201d of running down suspects in police cars and that Allsbury intentionally struck Perez \u2014 in the answers and again at the scheduling conference. Perez\u2019s continued service of the same request for admissions in the face <em>of </em>these denials was an abuse of Rule 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sheds further light on Rule 36. According to Rule 37(c)(2), a party may properly deny the items in a request for admissions \u2014 without fear of sanctions \u2014 as long as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-6\">(A) the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-7\">(B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-10\">(C) <em>the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-11\">(D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(2) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That is to say, even had Perez prevailed at a trial on the liability issues of his section 1983 claims, thus establishing that the County did indeed have such a \u201cpolicy, practice, or custom,\u201d it would have been entirely proper for the County to deny its existence in the requests for admissions if the County reasonably believed it might prevail on the matter. The implicit message of Rule 37 is, therefore, that issues <em>obviously subject to dispute should be resolved at trial, </em>not in a discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">In sum, we find that the district court failed to apply properly the two-part test of Rule 36(b) in considering the defendants\u2019 motion to withdraw admissions, thereby abusing its discretion. Moreover, had the court applied the test correctly, it would have ruled in the defendants\u2019 favor. Because the court granted Perez\u2019s summary judgment motion on the section 1983 claims based on the items deemed admitted, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">. Rule 36(b),entitled \"Effect of Admission,\u201d states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-10\">Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to the provision of Rule 16 governing amendment of a pre-trial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">Here, the defendants styled their motion a \"Motion to Withdraw or Amend Admissions.\u201d For convenience, we refer to it as a motion to withdraw admissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">. Throughout the record, Sergeant Allsbury's name is spelled either as \"Alsbury\u201d or \"Allsbury.\u201d Because both the complaint and the district court used the spelling \u201cAllsbury,\u201d we do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1283-18\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-19\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was available.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">. Nowhere in the complaint is there a citation to either of these statutes. Presumably, Perez was relying on Fla. Stat. chs. 112.3187-112.31895 (\"Whistle-Blowers Act\u201d) and Fla. Stat. chs. 440.15(11) (\"Full-Pay Statute\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">. Perez also asked for a declaratory judgment that his rights had been violated and for permanent injunctive relief. Perez appears to have abandoned his claim for such relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">. Rule 36(a) states that \"requests for admission may not be served before the time specified in Rule 26(d).\u201d Rule 26(d) specifies that, unless the parties agree, \"a party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f),\u201d which requires the parties to \"confer to consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for a prompt settlement ... and to develop a proposed discovery plan....\u201d Here, Perez served the June 25 Request with the complaint \u2014 well before the parties had met as required by Rule 26(f). The County, however, did not object to the premature service. Rather, the County contends that it never received the June 25 Request and points out that the summons and return indicate \u201conly that the complaint was served and not th[is] first request or any other paper.\u201d The district court found that the request had indeed been served with the complaint and noted that the June 25 Request \"displays the same file stamp by the Clerk of Court as the original Complaint, civil cover sheet, and summons.\u201d For purposes of this appeal, we treat the June 25 Request as having been served on the County in accordance with law and hold that the court's finding that the County received the request is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">.The defendants shared representation and jointly filed their answers and many of their subsequent motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">. As with the June 25 Request, Gressman contends that he never received this second request; he stated as much in an affidavit he submitted to the district, court. The district court, however, found otherwise, pointing to the certificate of service attached to the request, which is \"clearly dated October 3, 1997.\" We accept this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">. The relevant portions of Rule 36(a) are set out <em>infra </em>note 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">. Although the discovery requests, including the.requests for admissions, had been direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>ed only to the County, Perez sought summary judgment on the section 1983 claims as to both defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">. The County had responded to the June 25 Request on February 3 and to the October 3 Request on February 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">. The district court did not deem as admitted all of the items from the two requests. The court struck a number of items that improperly called for a \"legal conclusion,\u201d and struck others that were \u201cuniquely within the knowledge of the plaintiff as opposed to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">. In ruling that the remaining items were deemed admitted, the court gave one of two reasons. For those items the County had claimed to be without sufficient information with which- to respond adequately, the court found that they were, instead, \"fairly simply - (sic),of being answered,\u201d and thus, it was improper \"to say that the [County] doesn't have sufficient information.\u201d For all other items, the court simply stated that they \u201cwere unresponded to\u201d and are \u2019therefore \"deemed admitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">. The court used the County's admissions in granting Perez\u2019s summary judgment motion against Allsbury. This was obvious error. Because Allsbury was later dismissed as a defendant, however, the issue is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">. Although the requests for admissions had been directed to and answered by the County, Gressman filed the motion to withdraw on behalf of both defendants. Presumably, Gressman did so because the district court had granted summary judgment as to both the County and Allsbury as a result of the County's admissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">. Gressman attached to his motion the deposition transcripts of various County officers, all of whom had been deposed by Perez during the period of February 9 through February 11. None of the depositions, - according to Gressman, \"indicate[s] that it was a policy of [the County] to run over African Americans or other fleeing suspects with a police car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">. The court's order was in response to the following: (1) the defendants' February 26 \"Motion to Amend or Withdraw Admissions, Clarify and Vacate and Request for Hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>on the same,\"(2) the County's March 3 \"Motion for Reconsideration,\u201d and (3) Allsbury\u2019s February 26 \"Objection to Oral Ruling and Motion to Vacate and/or Clarify.\u201d The latter motion, made by Allsbury, objected to the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling because it established liability against Allsbury based on the <em>County's </em>failure to respond to requests for admissions directed only to the <em>County.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">. Section 1291 states that courts of appeal \"shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1288-12\">. Because Allsbury had been dismissed at trial as a defendant, Claims II and III were also dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1288-13\">. In his cross-appeal, Perez contends that the district court erred (1) in rejecting Count IV, set forth under the Whistle-Blowers Act, on the ground that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies; (2) in applying the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine to foreclose Count V, his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; and (3) in concluding that his evidence was insufficient to support Count VI, the claim made under the Full-Pay Statute. Finally, Perez contends that the County is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>barred from obtaining a \"judgment as a matter of law\" on those counts because it failed to assert the proper affirmative defenses and \"to assert a Rule 50(a) motion\" at the close of the evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">. Perez contends that we need not even consider the merits of the County's motion to withdraw because it was untimely under the district court's pretrial scheduling order. <em>See Dedge v. Kendrick, </em>849 F.2d 1398, 1398 (11th Cir.1988) (affirming the denial of a motion for summary judgment that was filed over one month after the pretrial deadline for filing and hearing motions). In particular, Perez asserts that the County (and Allsbury) filed the motion to withdraw on February 26, 1998, some twenty-six days after the district court\u2019s deadline for pretrial motions. Under Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Perez points out, \"[a] schedule shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge.\u201d We note, however, that the district court considered the County's motion to withdraw (along with the County\u2019s motion for reconsideration) and <em>decided it on the merits. </em>Whether a motion was filed timely and is appropriate under a pretrial order is a question left to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See, e.g., Spiller v. Ella Smithers Geriatric Ctr., </em>919 F.2d 339, 343 (5th Cir.1990) (inferring that the district court modified its scheduling order by considering a motion after the order's cut-off date). We therefore defer to the district court's interpretation of its scheduling order rules, <em>see Lockett v. Bd. of Educ., </em>111 F.3d 839, 843 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997), assume that the district court found that good cause had been shown, and consider the motion timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">. The relevant portions of Rule 36(a) state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-6\">A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters ... set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact....

Thus, if the motion to withdraw would have modified a final pretrial order, then the County must show that the withdrawal was necessary to prevent manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">Here, however, the motion to withdraw was filed on February 26, one day before the district court entered the order granting Perez's motion to strike and motion to deem the items admitted. Even assuming that the February 27 order was a final pretrial order, which is not obvious on its face, the motion to withdraw did not seek- to modify that order, but rather, to modify the action taken at the pretrial conference. Because the motion would not have modified a final pretrial order, Rule 16(e) is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">. The statement is dictum because the court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the party's motion to withdraw the admissions based on another reason \u2014 that the party had never filed a motion for leave to withdraw the admissions as required by Rule 36(b). <em>See Carney, </em>258 F.3d at 419-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">. In his reply brief, Perez asserts a new reason for finding prejudice \u2014 that Sergeant Allsbury died on December 19, 1999. The prejudice inquiry, however, must focus on the harm Perez would have incurred in late February or early March 1998 had the district court granted the defendants' motion to withdraw. Allsbury's death, an event occurring long after the motion was filed, in no way prejudiced Perez. Moreover, even if we shift our focus to the present, we find no prejudice because Perez deposed Allsbury before the trial, cross-examined him at the trial, and, at the close of the evidence, dismissed him as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">. Perez filed the Unilateral Pretrial Stipulation under Southern District of Florida Local Rule 16.1(F), which is entitled \"Unilateral Filing of Pretrial Stipulation Where Counsel Do Not Agree.\u201d That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-8\">If for any reason the pretrial stipulation is not executed by all counsel, each counsel shall file and serve separate proposed pretrial stipulations <em>not later than five days prior to the pretrial conference, </em>or if no pretrial conference is held, five days prior to the call of the calendar, with a statement of reasons no agreement was reached thereon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9C\">(Emphasis added). Perez's stipulation was untimely because it was filed two days prior to the pretrial conference. Presumably for that reason, the court made no substantive use of the stipulation during the pretrial conference or in any of the orders relevant to the defendants' motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"A04\">The introductory paragraph of Perez's stipulation stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\">Defendants have provided witness lists and exhibit lists, which Plaintiff does not believe were filed in good faith. Defendants refuse to make meaningful stipulations of facts, despite having admitted virtually every relevant fact in this litigation. The uncontested facts set forth herein are based upon the unanswered October 3, 1997, Request for Admissions, which also provided the basis for Plaintiff\u2019s previously filed motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW-1\">The reason why the defendants refused to \"make meaningful stipulations of facts\u201d is, of course, that the defendants had steadfastly denied Perez\u2019s allegations. Because the court appears to have disregarded Perez's stipulation, we do not consider it, except to the extent that it shows that Perez was aware that the defendants disputed the existence of a practice, custom, or policy to run down suspects with police-cars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">. Yet another reason exists for finding that Perez would not have suffered prejudice had the court allowed the withdrawal: the County's admissions could not have possibly bound Allsbury, who, at the time the motion to withdraw was made, was still a defendant in the case. Of course, the district court, as we pointed out in note 14, improperly held that the County\u2019s admissions established liability against Allsbury. Had the court ruled correctly, however, and found that the admissions were not binding on Allsbury, then a trial on Allsbury\u2019s liability would have still had to be held, thus negating any argument Perez might have had in establishing prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">. Rule 37(c)(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-9\">If a party fails to admit ... the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves ... the truth of the matter, the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (A) the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (C) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
