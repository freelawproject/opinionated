The actual refusal complained of was by one Carter, a waiter employed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">A number of interesting questions raised on this appeal need not be decided, because of palpable error committed by the learned trial judge in refusing to charge two requests of defendant\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that if Carter was instructed' to serve colored persons, and not to discriminate between white and colored persons, then a mistake, or even a violation of the instructions, would create no liability, on the defendant\u2019s part for these actions. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that the defendant was and is not required to do more than instruct Carter in good faith to afford all persons alike free and equal accommodations and full enjoyment of all the facilities and privileges afforded by it to white persons as well as negroes, and if it did this in good faith, and the jury-finds it did so, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Respondent -concedes the admissibility of the uncontradicted evidence upon which these requests were based (see Westchester County v. Dressner, 23 App. Div. 215, 48 N. Y. Supp. 953), but claims, on the authority of Thomas v. Williams, 48 Misc. Rep. 615, 95 N. Y. Supp. 592, that such evidence \u201cwould not be necessarily conclusive\u201d; but no such.claim was made by appellant, nor was his request based on the conclusiveness of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
