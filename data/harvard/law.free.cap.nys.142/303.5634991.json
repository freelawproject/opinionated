There are some indications in the record that defendant claimed that this balance, or the bulk thereof, had been paid by some collections' made by the plaintiff; but that point need not now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Defendant\u2019s counterclaim is based on the allegation that plaintiff \u201cwarranted and represented said route to do a business of $1,000 a month.\u201d Defendant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">\u201cHe [plaintiff] gave me a receipt that the business would bring about $1,000 a month\u2014would do business about $1,000 a month.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">He also testified, in answer to plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">\u201cQ. You say, at the time you gave the $25, he gave you a receipt stating that the business does about $1,000? A. About $1,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">There is no proof that the business was not then amounting to about $1,000 a month, and therefore no proof of a misrepresentation. As proof of a warranty, the evidence is totally insufficient; nor is it conceivable that plaintiff would or could warrant that a business to be conducted by another person should yield any particular sum a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">Finally, the proof of damage is insufficient to sustain the amount ($270) awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
