Annexed to the petition is a copy of the indictment and an extract from the minutes of the Supreme Court, in which it appears that the respondent was arraigned on the indictment and that he pleaded guilty to the charge of willfully dissuading a witness from attending pursuant to a subpoena. In his answer the respondent admits the indictment and the plea of guilty, but denies that he was guilty of either of the crimes charged against him. A plea of guilty is conclusive evidence of the respondent\u2019s guilt, and, having pleaded guilty to such a charge, no further evidence is required to' show that he is not a fit person to remain a member of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The respondent is. therefore disbarred.
