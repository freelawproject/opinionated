Thereupon defendant paid to the purchaser $50 for rent of the remaining portion of February, and, upon being sued by the plaintiff for the full rent of that month, pleaded eviction by paramount title, tendered $16.66 into court, and counterclaimed for $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">While it is true that rent payable in advance is due and payable, regardless of what transpires subsequent to the due date, and therefore the change of ownership in the case at bar could not constitute a defense, the defendant, having been virtually evicted by paramount title, may, by way of counterclaim, recover from the original lessor the value of the balance \"of his term.
