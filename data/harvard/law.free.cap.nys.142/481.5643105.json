The documents that the plaintiff relied upon to prove, and which the court below has held to constitute, a lease are as follows (both on the letter heads of Ettinger Bros, and dated Bronx, N. Y., April 1, 1912):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">\u201cWe, Ettinger Bros., agree to give the unexpired term of our lease to C. Schuck &amp; Co. as soon as we are ready to move. The term of the lease calls for one year from May 1, 1912, for the monthly rent of <em>$75. </em>Deposit <em>$10.00 </em>(ten dollars) for the binding of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-20\">\u201c[Signed] Morris Ettinger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-21\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-22\">\u201cI, Christian Schuck, agree to take the lease for store No. 533 Third Ave. from Ettinger Bros, as soon as they are ready to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-23\">\u201c[Signed] Christian Schuck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-24\">On August-5, 1912, the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-25\">\u201cOwing to the unsatisfactory reading of the lease which the landlord has sent us, we have decided not to take the store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u25a0On August 9th the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney wrote that the store would be ready for them on September 1st, and\" notifying them that unless they performed their agreement of April 1st his clients would pay the rent and hold defendants liable therefor. \u25a0 On the first business day of September the defendants tendered $75 to the plaintiffs and demanded possession of the premises. The plaintiffs were still in possession of the premises, and told defendants\u2019 representative that they would give possession about September 15th, and on September 11th their attorney wrote that the premises were then vacant and ready for their occupancy, and that the plaintiffs would hold them liable for rent for the remainder of the term of plaintiffs\u2019 lease commencing with September 15, 1912. The defendants did not enter into possession, and this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">[-1, 2] There never was a lease entered into between the parties, nor did the relation of landlord and tenant ever exist between them. While it is true that no particular words are necessary to create a lease, yet an intention of one party to divest himself of possession and of the other to come into it for a determinate time must appear. In the papers put in evidence there is no intention disclosed by the plaintiffs to divest themselves of possession, but they are to remain in possession until they are ready to move. If they were not ready to move during the term\" of their lease, the defendants could not demand_ to be \"put 'into possession; nor would the defendants have any right of action against the plaintiffs if they did not vacate the premises. There ' was an entire lack of mutuality in the contract that was made. The most favorable construction that could be put on this agreement is that it is an agreement for a lease at some future time, to be determined at the will of the plaintiffs. But such an agreement vests no estate in the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Although an action may be maintained for damages for the breach of an agreement to lease, an action for rent cannot be predicated thereon. The measure of damages is the difference between the contract price\u2014i. e., the rental specified\u2014and the amount the plaintiff was able to realize upon the premises after the breach, and not the \"rent reserved. -Had there been a definite tim\u00e9 for the term to commence, and the defendant entered into possession then, although the form of the agreement. appeared to be merely an agreement for a lease, the taking of \u2022 \u25a0 possession thereunder would show the intention- of the parties that the agreement was to be one of lease. Such was the case of Fuest v. Craig (Sup.) 107 N. Y. Supp. 638, relied upon by the learned justice below.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellants, and judgment-given for the defendants,, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
