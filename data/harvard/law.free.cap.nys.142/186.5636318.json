Membership in the bar has a well-defined meaning, and a person admitted merely to practice as an attorney or solicitor is not within this definition. To entitle a person to admission under this rule, based upon his being a member of the bar of England, Ireland, or Scotland, he must have been \u00e1dmitted to the bar, and as such entitled to practice in the highest court of some part of the kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The application is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
