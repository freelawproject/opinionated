Straus, she is entitled, under the stipulation, to a return of the said money. If the money in question was not money paid into court, the court would have no power by a summary order to direct its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The provisions of rule 69 of the General Rules of Practice require that all orders directing the payment of money out of court shall direct the payment to be made to the person entitled to receive the same. Under this rule the money must be paid to Rosa W. Straus, or to her attorney in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The order must therefore be modified, by striking out'the provision . directing the money to be paid to her attorneys, and by further providing that this order is without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs, or other creditors, as against the defendant Rosa W. Straus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
