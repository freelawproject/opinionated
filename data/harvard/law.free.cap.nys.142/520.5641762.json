He also made a number of concessions, but after some disagreement with plaintiff\u2019s counsel remarked that he presumed \u201cthose concessions\u201d would be removed from the record; the court saying that there was nothing in the case up to that time, except that the \u25a0 jury was ready to hear the evidence. There was nothing further to indicate that defendant\u2019s counsel expected plaintiff to prove that defendant operated the line on Broad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>way. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was not required to prove defendant\u2019s control or operation of such line; the statement of defendant\u2019s counsel in regard to the line not being one of the \u201cconcessions\u201d which were subsequently withdrawn.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b547-5\">[Ed.

The two enactments first recited forbid an overcharge of fare, or the charging of more than one fare for a continuous ride over the main line of any road or any branch or extension thereof. The last-named enactment requires the giving of a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Plaintiff boarded a \u201cFourth &amp; Madison Avenue\u201d open car, southbound, at Forty-Second street shortly before 10 o\u2019clock of a drizzly and cloudy night; his destination being Brooklyn Bridge. As the car turned into Astor Place, he asked for a transfer, which was refused, though at least four other persons on the car, who asked for transfers at the same time and place, received them. They proceeded south on Broadway with their transfers. Plaintiff did the same, but had to pay the additional fare.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">As to the question of transfers, appellant\u2019s point seems to be, not that the regulation, of which he was aware, that transfers should be asked for at the time of paying the cash fare, is unreasonable, but that it is not a uniform rule, and, therefore, unfair and unreasonable on that account. The conductor admitted that he had discretion to give transfers at Astor Place, and explained his giving of them to others because \u201cthey looked like strangers.\u201d There is much force in plaintiff\u2019s claim; but it need not, in my opinion, be determined in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> I shall assume that it is reasonable operation for a street railway to run \u201cshort service\u201d cars, and to require through passengers who accidentally or intentionally board such cars to change at the \u201cshort\u201d terminus into a through car. It may also be accepted as a reasonable regulation that passengers desiring transfers shall demand them at the time they pay their fare. The real question, then, is whether this car is to be properly classed as a \u201cshort service car\u201d boarded voluntarily by plaintiff, when he was at liberty to wait for and take a through car on the same line. Plaintiff testifies positively that there was no sign illuminated bearing the words \u201cAstor Place\u201d on the car in question, and that the only inscription that was illuminated was \u201c4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>&amp; Madison Ave.\u201d In this respect he is confirmed by one or two of his companions. The conductor does not even claim to have notified plaintiff, or any of the passengers, that it was an Astor Place or any. other form of \u201cshort service car\u201d when they entered or when they paid their fare. He does testify that the car bore the inscription \u201cAstor Place\u201d and that that was illuminated by \u201can electric bulb.\u201d It is significant that neither plaintiff nor his three companions saw the sign, and that the conductor promptly gave four transfers to four other passengers. I think that the weight of evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that there was no such lighted sign on the car at that time; and there is no claim that the conductor notified any of the passengers that it was an Astor Place car. See opinion of Scott, Daughlin, and Clarke, JJ., in Baron v. N. Y. Rys. Co., 120 App. Div. 134, 105 N. Y. Supp. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Moreover, I do not believe that the mere placing of a sign reading \u201cAstor Place\u201d on a Fourth &amp; Madison Avenue car is sufficient notice to a passenger that it is a \u201cshort service car.\u201d The mere words \u201cAstor Place,\u201d without the usually added word \u201conly,\u201d do not, to my mind, apprise an intending passenger that the car is a \u201cshort service\u201d one. Plaintiff boarding a \u201c4th &amp; Madison Ave.\u201d car, under the circumstances detailed, was entitled to believe that it would carry him to Brooklyn Bridge, his intended destination. There w\u201eas, as he himself has testified, no reason why he, at that lime, should ask for a transfer; and when, without any notice, the car turned into Astor Place, he was entitled to demand and receive the transfer to continue on the same line, which he demanded, and its refusal compelled him to pay an overcharge, which was made deliberately in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Some point is made by respondent of the fact that there was no proof that the Broadway line was controlled or operated by the defendant. It is true that the defendant\u2019s counsel, after various concessions had been made at the opening of the case and some disagreement appeared between counsel, remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201cI presume that all those concessions will be removed from the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">And the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cThen there is nothing in this case up to this time, except that the jury is ready to 'hear the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The jury was subsequently waived. But the statement about the Broadway line was not a concession. Defendant\u2019s counsel, at the opening of the case, said: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201cTour honor will <em>take judicial notice </em>of the fact that the New Tork City Railways Company run down Broadway, as well as Park Avenue and other avenues; that is a matter of common knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">There is nothing in the subsequent proceedings or the remarks of the counsel or the court to indicate that defendant\u2019s counsel had changed his position in this regard, and it would be unfair to charge plaintiff\u2019s counsel, under these circumstances, with the need of proving the control or operation of the Broadway line by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
