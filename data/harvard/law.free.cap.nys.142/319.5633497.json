The pawn ticket described the pledge as one \u201cD\u201d ring; the letter \u201cD\u201d standing for the word \u201cdiamond.\u201d He claims that he took the ticket to the defendant\u2019s shop and asked to see the ring, but was told by the defendant that they \u201cdo not show.\u201d He then redeemed the ring for the sum of $61.80. As soon as he received the ring, he saw that it was evidently not a diamond ring, and demanded back the sum paid to redeem. His demand was refused, and he thereupon brought this action for fraud and deceit, in that the defendant falsely represented that the ring was a diamond ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">No principle is better established in our jurisprudence than that there can be no recovery for fraud unless a false representation has been made, either with knowledge and intent to deceive, or has been made by a person not knowing whether it was false or true, and not caring what the fact might be, recklessly paying no heed to the injury which might ensue. In this case the plaintiff has absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>failed to show actual knowledge on the part of the defendant, and, though he has shown negligence on its part, it certainly cannot be said that the representation was made by a person who did not know or care whether the representation was true or false, for the pawnbrokers themselves advanced the sum now sued for on their belief in the value of the ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">It follows that judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">WHITAKER, J., concurs. BIJUR, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
