Defendants and their superintendent deny this, and also deny the conversation which plaintiff claims took place at the discharge, namely, that they expressed satisfaction with his work, but told him that he must reduce his salary to $50 per week or else they would discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">No serious impeachment resulted from the cross-examination, except that one of the defendants, who claimed that plaintiff\u2019s designs were totally unsatisfactory, unskilled, and merely copies of other designs, having been asked whether he was not familiar with plaintiff\u2019s work at his previous employer\u2019s, denied that he knew anything about it, and said that the man was employed on the recommendation of defendants\u2019 superintendent, although the superintendent had testified that 'he never knew the plaintiff until he was actually employed at defendants\u2019 place.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The court submitted to the jury the question, whether defendants were actually dissatisfied, or whether their expressed dissatisfaction, if any, was a mere subterfuge, and the jury found in plaintiff\u2019s favor. I find nothing in the record to justify the evident opinion of the learned trial judge that the verdict was against the weight of evidence to such an extent as to warrant the belief that the jury was improperly influenced by external considerations. See Wagner v. H. Herrmann Lumber Co. (Sup.) 121 N. Y. Supp. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">Moreover, although appellant\u2019s counsel does not urge the question on this appeal, his exceptions to the charge clearly raise the point that, under the language of this contract, defendants were not entitled to discharge the plaintiff merely because <em>they </em>were dissatisfied with his work. In none of the leading cases on this subject has language of so dubious import as that in the contract in the case at bar been held to constitute an agreement on the part of the plaintiff to condition his employment upon the satisfaction <em>of his employer; </em>and I have, to say the least, serious doubt whether this contract should be so construed, See, for example, Crawford v. Mail &amp; Express Co., 163 N. Y. 404, 57 N. E. 616; Ginsberg v. Friedman, 146 App. Div. 779, 131 N. Y. Supp. 517; Diamond v. Mendelsohn, 141 N. Y. Supp. 775, Appellate Division, First Department, May 16, 1913; Haehnel v. Trostler, 54 Misc. Rep. 262, 104 N. Y. Supp. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Order reversed, with costs, and verdict reinstated, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
