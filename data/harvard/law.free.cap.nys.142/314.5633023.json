At the time of the accident the plaintiff was an infant about 10 years of age. She sues by her guardian ad litem. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">There is no doubt about the injury, and practically none as to its having occurred in the manner indicated. The issue litigated was the identity of the person who threw or allowed the piece of wood to fall, and whether such person was an employ\u00e9 of the defendant. In order to assist in the identification, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked of a witness, who was testifying through an interpreter, and who was manifestly slow-witted also, questions which might in some aspects be considered as leading; but they were not obnoxiously so, if they were open to that criticism at' all.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The learned trial judge excluded an entire series of such questions, whereupon plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked to be relieved of the trial of the case, and also asked to have a juror withdrawn. Counsel\u2019s last remark was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cI can\u2019t proceed. I can\u2019t ask any questions. Every question I ask is objected to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The court thereupon, addressing defendant\u2019s counsel, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cWhat is your motion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201cIf he is unwilling to proceed, I move to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">The motion was granted, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">After a careful examination- of the evidence, I am of opinion that the questions, or at least most of them, which plaintiff\u2019s counsel had asked, were improperly excluded, and plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the rulings present reversible error. The record is such that manifestly, in the interest of justice, there must be a new trial, which is hereby directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
