Van Beuren, is alleged \"to have been a member. At the close of the trial the court dismissed the com.plaint on the merits, upon the ground that the evidence failed to establish that defendant\u2019s intestate was a partner in the alleged firm, and, if it did, that the action could not be sustained because it did not appear that the surviving partner was insolvent. The appeal, therefore, presents two questions: (1) Whether there is evidence to sustain a finding that Van Beuren was a partner; and (2) whether the surviving partner is solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The notes were signed \u201cB. B. &amp; H. T. Groom, Mgrs.,\u201d under which name, according to the testimony, H. T. Groom and Henry C. Van Beuren were engaged in raising cattle in the states of Mississippi and Texas. The notes-in suit were made and delivered by H. T. Groom\u2014 one to the plaintiff and the .other to a third party who has since transferred it to him\u2014in payment for hay and supplies furnished to the business of the alleged firm. Upon the issue of the existence of the partnership between H. T. Groom and defendant\u2019s intestate, the former\u2019s deposition was taken, but such portion of it as related to personal transactions with the decedent, plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded at the trial, were inadmissible under section 829 of the Code of .Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is undisputed that B. B. Groom had no connection with the concern and he was not called as a witness, nor his deposition read. There was, however, put in evidence a portion of a deposition made by the decedent himself in a previous action, where, in answer to questions as to his connection with H. T. Groom or B. B. &amp; H. T. Groom, Mgrs., he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u201cI have an agreement with H. T. Groom to buy and breed high-grade cattle. The agreement, which was oral, was that I was to be reimbursed for all disbursements made, and both of us were to share in profits that might accrue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">It is fairly to be inferred from the testimony that the notes were given in payment of feed furnished for cattle thus raised. This statement by the intestate as to his connection with B. B. &amp; H. T. Groom, Mgrs., was in no way contradicted or explained by the defendant. It was therefore prima facie sufficient to prove the existence of the partnership, and that defendant\u2019s intestate was a member of it. An agreement for sharing in the profits of a business is- sufficient to constitute \u2022a partnership as to third persons (Hackett v. Stanley, 115 N. Y. 625, 22 N. E. 745; Leggett v. Hyde, 58 N. Y. 272, 17, Am. Rep., 244; Hull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>v. Barth, 48 App. Div. 590, 62 N. Y. Supp. 946), and it is' not necessary that the agreement should be to share in losses also (Manhattan Brass &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Sears, 45 N. Y. 797, 6 Am. Rep. 177).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the insolvency of the surviving partner,\" at the beginning of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded that, in order to recover, it would be necessary for him to prove, not only the existence of the partnership, but that the surviving partner was insolvent. .The complaint alleged that both H. T. Groom individually and the partnership were insolvent, unless the latter owned certain lands in Texas which were claimed by the defendant as part of' the individual estate of Van Beuren. The answer affirmatively alleged that the land referred to was owned by Van Beuren\u2019s estate, and denied that it was a partnership asset. The testimony clearly established that H. T. Groom was insolvent, unless he had an interest in such land. That he did not have such interest was admitted in the defendant\u2019s answer. Such fact was there affirmatively alleged, and that, the same belonged solely to the estate of the intestate. It was therefore unnecessary for the plaintiff .to show that Groom had no interest -in such lands. Outside of this land, as indicated, the proof was amply sufficient to establish insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The judgment appealed from, therefore, is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
