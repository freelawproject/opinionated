All that it contains are statements as to the making of the contract, the substance thereof, and that it is annexed to and made a part of the complaint. Then follows an allegation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-16\">\u201cThere is now due and owing to this plaintiff under the aforesaid contract the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000), no part of which has been paid, although duly demanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">No facts are stated from which it can be determined, or even inferred, whether the plaintiff claims for a breach of the contract, services rendered, or commissions earned. There was no allegation to the effect that the plaintiff has performed or was ready and willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>perform on his part. The allegation above quoted, showing that there is due $4,000, is a mere conclusion of law, not based upon any facts set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
