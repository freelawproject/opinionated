Vernon, and procures his water supply for domestic uses from the defendant, which is a public service water supply company. He complains that the defendant has threatened to cut off his supply of water unless he agrees to pay therefor at rates advanced by the defendant about 33% per cent, higher than those provided to be charged under a contract between the defendant and the city of Mt. Vernon for the benefit of its inhabitants, which was made in 1898, and which, as he alleges, is still in force. The complaint further alleges that there has been such a change of circumstances since the making of the contract that the rates therein prescribed have become unreasonably high, and relief is sought that the reasonable rates or charges should be determined judicially. The question arises whether the complaint sets forth two separate causes of action, and, if it does, then the defendant demands that they should be stated and numbered separately, as required by section 483 of' the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It seems clear to me that the complaint does set forth two separate causes of action, because it alleges a threatened invasion of two distinct primary rights of the plaintiff. If the contract is still in force, then the plaintiff has a primary right for its enforcement, and can maintain an action accordingly under its provisions. Pond v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>New Rochelle Water Co., 183 N. Y. 330, 76 N. E. 211, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 958, 5 Ann. Cas. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Whether or no it be in force, the plaintiff has another and distinct primary right which arises from the inherent nature of the duties of a public service corporation towards the public, and this right may be asserted independently of the contract in question. City of Mt. Vernon v. New York Interurban Water Co., 115 App. Div. 658, 101 N. Y. Supp. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Where there is an alleged invasion of two separate and distinct primary rights set up in a complaint, then two causes of action are set forth though intermingled in form. Stines v. City of New York, 154 App. Div. 276, 138 N. Y. Supp. 962. The defendant was entitled to have these separate causes of action set forth separately in the complaint, and it was error for the learned court at Special Term to deny defendant\u2019s motion for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,, and the motion is granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
