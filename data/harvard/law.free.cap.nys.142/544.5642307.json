' The contract under which such recovery was had, however, provided that on payment for the drawings covered by that contract he would release the claim for the drawings prepared for advertisements of Climax tobacco, which was the subject of his first cause of action. He should not be allowed, therefore, to recover full payment for his work under the second cause of action, and also retain the benefit of the claim that he had agreed to release.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The judgment will therefore be modified, by reducing the same to the sum of $280, and appropriate costs in the court below, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
