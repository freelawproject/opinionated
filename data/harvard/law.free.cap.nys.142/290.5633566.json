The only point urged by the appellant as a ground for reversal that merits any attention is that the order fails to set a day for the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">Such an omission has been held to render the order unauthorized. Murphy v. Joline, 62 Misc. Rep. 461, 115 N, Y. Supp. 108; Id., 63 Misc. Rep. 256, 116 N. Y. Supp. 715. The right of the Appellate Term to order a new trial in such a case was evidently not brought up or considered in those cases. The policy of disregarding techijicalities in matters of practice has recently been strengthened by legislative en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>actments, and now under section 1317 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as recently amended, the Appellate Term is authorized to reverse, affirm, or modify any judgment or order appealed from and render judgment accordingly, except where it may be necessary or proper to grant a new trial or hearing, when it may grant a new trial or hearing, and, whatever may have heretofore been the power of the Appellate Term in that respect, it is clearly defined in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">The order is therefore modified, by inserting therein the 1st day of July, 1913, as the day for a new trial, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
