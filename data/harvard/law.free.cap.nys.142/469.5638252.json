The defendant interposed a counterclaim for $605 damages for breach of said contract. Issue was joined on April 16, 1913, and the case adjourned until April 30th. On the adjourned day the plaintiff moved for another adjournment, which motion was denied. Thereupon the plaintiff moved to discontinue the action, and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-20\">\u201cAction discontinued. Complaint dismissed without prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-21\">Thereafter, over objection by plaintiff, the defendant was permitted to introduce testimony in support of his counterclaim, and judgment was given in his favor thereon for $503.50 against the plaintiff.
