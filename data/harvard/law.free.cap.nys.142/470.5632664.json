Thereafter a receiver in supplementary proceedings was appointed, which demanded and received the amount of the account from the bank. The .sheriff demanded possession of this fund from the receiver, but was refused. Finally the receiver\u2019s account was passed by the court, and the sheriff\u2019s application for poundage denied \u201cbecause of failure to collect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">The only ground for such denial which appears in the papers is the statement of plaintiff\u2019s attorney that he \u201ccalled at the office of the sheriff, and was informed that the sheriff could not collect either upon \u00ab -the attachment or the execution.\u201d That statement is quite insufficient as a basis for any judicial action. The sheriff had done all that entitled him to poundage, and had done nothing to forfeit his right \u2022thereto. See Lawlor v. Metal Co., 2 App. Div. 552, 38 N. Y. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>36; Wilkinson v Raymond, 80 App. Div. 378, 380, 81 N. Y. Supp. 82; Miller v. Miller, 108 App. Div. 310, 95 N. Y.

Supp. 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and upon - a new application to pass the receiver\u2019s account the court below is directed to charge the same with the proper amount of sheriff\u2019s fees. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
