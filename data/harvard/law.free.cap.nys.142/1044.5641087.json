The plaintiff dropped her ticket and five cents in the box on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>defendant\u2019s station, and thereupon requested the agent to pay her that sum. He explained that he could not do so, but that he would give her a receipt for the money, presentable at the main office. She urged her request and finally took a nickel from the window and was at once pursued by the agent, seized, and later taken by a police officer before a magistrate, by whom she was held for trial before the Court of Special Sessions, where she was found not guilty. So upon examination the magistrate decided that there was \"sufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty\u201d (Code of Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 208), and the jury in this action has decided that defendant\u2019s agent had not \u201csufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty.\u201d There is a distinct reason for the decision of the magistrate, and the opposite decision by the Court of Special Sessions. Before the magistrate the accused testified that a lady</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-3\">\u2014\u201cput in her fare and he threw out money like this [indicating], and I thought, \u2018That is for me; I will take it;\u2019 and he said, \u2018That is not for you\u201d\u2019\u2014and she reached for it and did not get it; the lady got it; -and plaintiff finally answered, \u201cI never got a taste of the nickel, never had it in my hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Her testimony before the magistrate was not proven before the Court of Special Sessions, and upon the trial of the present action the plaintiff disclaimed such evidence, although it was conceded that she gave it. But here she testified that the agent put out the nickel; that she took it and thought he gave it to her. In one court she denied any taking and asserted that he informed her that it was not for her. Surely, if she was informed and yet took it, that alone proved probable cause. But now she would prove absence of probable cause by showing that she took by invitation. Did the ag\u00e9nt have reasonable grounds.to believe that she took the coin with intention to steal it? The magistrate\u2019s decision is to that effect and to him was given the initial power to determine. What, then, is the relative probative force of her present testimony ? What is the value of the agent\u2019s testimony measured against that of the plaintiff? It cannot be doubted that his testimony, forfeited by the decision of the magistrate based on her uncredited denial that she took the money and her statement that she was told not to do so, prepondefatingly shows that there was probable cause. The agent did not testify that he said to her that the change was not for her. But she understood as much from the transaction or from what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
