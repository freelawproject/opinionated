Defendant printed an article concerning plaintiff\u2019s alleged preparation of the new plans, which were charged to be defective because of the omitted filtration plant. The article, however, contained no aspersions on plaintiff\u2019s professional capacity or discretion, and was not libelous per se. <em>Held, </em>that a complaint for libel, based on the article, which did not allege that plaintiff was ever an officer of the city, or that he was generally referred to or known as such, and which did not charge special damage, was demurrable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-12\">[Ed.

Tribune Ass\u2019n, 135 App. Div. 30, 32, 119 N. Y. Supp. 885), and that the fact that no general professional incapacity was imputed would be of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">But it appears here that plaintiff was employed by and prepared. the alleged defective plans under direction of his employer, the city, after plans which included a filtration plant had been rejected because of their expense, and that such defective plans omitted the filtration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>plant at the instance and to suit the purposes of the city. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that plaintiff exercised any professional discretion in preparing the plans alleged to have been defective, or that he did anything more than comply with the express directions given to him by those whom he served, assuming no professional responsibility for the alleged hygienic deficiency of the plans because of the absence of the filtration plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is nowhere alleged that plaintiff was ever an official of the city or even that he was generally referred to or known as such. Plaintiff therefore, can have no benefit from the innuendoes which attempt to enlarge the plain meaning of the words of the article. For the same reason, that portion of the article referring to the alleged insult to \u201cKate\u201d cannot be taken as in any way referring to plaintiff. 'The article, thus interpreted, contains nothing libelous per se, and, as there is no special damage alleged, the demurrer was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
