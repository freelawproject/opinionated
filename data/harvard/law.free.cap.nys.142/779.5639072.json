Moch Company, for $4,358.55; that on or about November 17, 1908, Eugene Moch, who, at said time, was the president of the said E. Moch \u25a0 Company, received said check and indorsed thereon \u201cE. Moch Company,\u201d and thereunder \u201cEugene Moch,\u201d and thereafter deposited the check to his personal credit and account in the said Fourteenth Street Bank; that the said bank accepted said check, and placed it h&gt; his personal credit and account; that it collected the check and placed the proceeds thereof to the personal credit of Eugene Moch; that since November 17, 1908, and prior to the commencement of this action, the said bank applied the proceeds thereof in payment of' checks drawn against the proceeds thereof by the said Eugene Moch personally for his personal benefit, and thereby misappropriated the proceeds thereof to the personal use of Eugene Moch; that the said check and the proceeds thereof were placed to the personal credit and account and the proceeds thereof withdrawn and paid for his personal benefit without authority ; that the said bank accepted and collected said check with notice that the said check and the proceeds thereof were the property of the plaintiff and with notice putting it upon inquiry which it failed to make, which would have disclosed that the same was placed to the personal credit and account of Eugene Moch and collected, and the proceeds thereof withdrawn, paid, and appropriated for the personal use of said Moch without authority; that there is now due and owing from the defendant to the plaintiff the said sum for which it demands judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\">Although an answer was interposed, it is not here material as this motion was made to test the sufficiency of the complaint. The Special Term held that the complaint stated a good and sufficient cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"An-\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The determination of this case depends, not upon a question of proof, but of pleading. The appellant admits in its reply that the phrase, \u201cwith notice that the said check and the proceeds thereof were the property of the plaintiff,\u201d is sufficient to permit proof of the facts which in the opinion of the plaintiff constituted said notice. It seems to us that the allegation, \u201cand with notice putting it upon inquiry which it failed to make, which would have disclosed that the same was placed to the personal account of Moch * * * without authority,\u201d is likewise the allegation of the ultimate fact and sufficient to permit the detailed evidence thereof. To state the proof tending to establish those facts would be to offend against the rule of pleading which requires the statement of ultimate facts and not intermediate and evidentiary facts. We think the complaint is sufficient. Under it, the plaintiff will be entitled to show, if it can, by any competent proof, such notice and knowledge on the defendant\u2019s part as would charge it with liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The order appealed from, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">INGRAHAM, P.
