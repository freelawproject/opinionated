It is also alleged that, prior to the time of the accident, the defendant had used the same ladder; that it was worn loose, and was unfit for use, of which defendant had knowledge; that on the day of the accident the defendant had represented that the ladder had been repaired, and that it was all right; and that he directed the plaintiff to use the same. It also avers that the repairs were so made that no inspection could have disclosed its defective condition. A mere statement of the allegations above set forth shows that a cause of action was alleged, and that the demurrer should not have been sustained, but overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Judgment reversed, with costs, and demurrer overruled, with leave to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer and answer, upon payment of costs in this court and $5 costs in the court below, within five days after service of a copy of this order with notice of entry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
