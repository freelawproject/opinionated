Regulation No. 376 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-12\">\u201cNo garage permit authorizing the storage of volatile inflammable oil shall be issued for any premises which are not provided with an oil separator, trap or other similar apparatus attached to the house drain for the purpose of preventing volatile inflammable oils from flowing into the sewer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Appellant operates a garage, and its application for approval thereof was denied by the commission for noncompliance with regulation 376. Thereupon appellant applied for a mandamus to compel acceptance of the application, asserting that its premises were thoroughly safe and lawful in every respect, except that it had not complied with section 376; its excuse being \u201cthat it conducts its garage in such manner that the amount of volatile inflammable oil flowing into the sewer * * * is negligible and creates no dangerous condition,\u201d also upon the ground that there were no oil separators, traps, or other similar apparatus in existence which would prevent such oils from flowing into the sewer. Appellant claims that section 376 is oppressive and unreasonable, and deprives it of its property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The motion was denied on the ground that the selection of appliances necessary to render garages safe was within the discretion of the commission, and that no issue was raised by the papers. Of course, any discretion vested in the commission is not reviewable. We do not need to consider the question whether an ordinance passed in pursuance of express legislative power to adopt such an ordinance can be assailed as unreasonable, because there is nothing unreasonable on the face of this ordinance. Its alleged unreasonableness rests solely upon the allegation of the petition that there are no separators or other devices which will \u201cprevent volatile inflammable oils from flowing into the sewer.\u201d By numerous affidavits the city showed that this was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>true. Notwithstanding this fact, appellant claims that because of the allegation of the petition an alternative writ should have issued, so that proof might have been taken. This is his principal objection to the order. We think it untenable. The statement in the petition may be true in the sense that there is no device which will wholly prevent volatile oils from flowing into the sewer, but there is nothing in the petition to contradict the city\u2019s affidavits showing that there are numerous devices on the market which are practically efficient in reducing to a minimum the risk of oils in the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
