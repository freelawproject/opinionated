The court submitted to the jury two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">(1) Did the applicant make a false answer to the question, \u201cHow long since you consulted or have had the care of a physician ?\u201d to which his answer had been, \u201cAs above,\u201d meaning last summer. The application was made January 24, 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">(2) Was the Defendant\u2019s. Exhibit B, namely, the application, containing, among others, this question and answer, the application for the policy in suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">As the defense was, in substance, fraud or false representations inducing the making of the policy, it is evident that, if the jury answered either of the above questions in the negative, the verdict must have been for defendant, and it was for the plaintiff, it is clear that the jury must have answered either or both of these questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The application, containing the question and the answer complained of, was not annexed to the policy. The plaintiff appellant contends that therefore, under section 58 of the Insurance Daw (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 28), it was not available to the defendant as a false representation tending to defeat the validity of the policy. I cannot, however, agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">I find nothing in the case of Becker v. Colonial Life Ins. Co., 153 App. Div. 382, 138 N. Y. Supp. 491, to sustain that construction. On the contrary, the Becker Case, as I read it, decides merely that, where a policy recites that it is issued \u201cin consideration of the application therefor, which is hereby made a part of this contract,\u201d statements made by the assured in other papers or other applications are necessarily immaterial as representations. By the express terms of the contract, it is agreed that they have not been relied upon, and therefore they cannot be availed of by the insurer to avoid the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">It seems to me, however, that, where the policy contains no such recital, false representations made to induce its issuance, and whether oral or in a paper not attached to the policy, may, if material, be relied upon by the insurer to defeat a recovery. The statute does not in terms or impliedly relate to such contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">The case of Wheelock v. Home Ins. Co., 115 Minn. 177, 131 N. W. 1081 (Minn., 1911), construing the Minnesota law of 1907, cited by the appellant, has no bearing upon the present controversy, because the language of the Minnesota statute is altogether different from ours in this respect. The same consideration renders unavailable as precedents many other cases cited by the appellant in the courts of sister states. So far, therefore, as the question of law raised by the order setting aside the verdict is concerned, I think that the learned trial court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> On the question of the falsity of the statements made by the applicant in answering the question, \u201cHow long since you consulted or have had the care of a physician ?\u201d I think that his answer was plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>a misrepresentation of the truth. The question itself is unambiguous, under the circumstances disclosed in this case, and the reasoning in the case of Stewart v. Equitable Mutual Life Ins. Co., 110 Iowa, 528, 8 N. W. 782, is therefore inappropriate, even if we were inclined to adopt it as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">Nor was the ailment for which the assured had in the interval consulted an eye specialist a mere casual one. The uncontradicted evidence is that he had visited distinguished specialists two or three times a week for months, and but one week prior to his application had been introduced for examination at a clinic at which 40 or 50 physicians were present. He must have been well aware of the fact that he had some serious illness, information of the existence of which he willfully suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> This consideration, however, is insufficient to support the order of the learned trial judge setting the verdict aside; for, as to the second question submitted to the jury, not only does the evidence fail to establish that the misrepresentation complained of by the defendant was made in the application for the policy on which this suit is brought, but, on the contrary, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s medical supervisor at a crucial point is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cThe answers in that report relate to an application for $1,000. Such application is not the one upon which a $2,000 policy was issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In this state of the record, I do not see how any verdict other than one for the plaintiff could have been rendered or be sustained,- I believe, therefore, that the order setting aside the verdict should be reversed, with costs, and the verdict reinstated, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">GERARD,. J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b596-8\">SEABURY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-C\">I do not agree with the views advanced by my learned colleagues as reasons for the reversal of the order appealed from. This action is brought to recover $2,000, the amount of an insurance policy issued by the defendant on the life of one Aaronson. The policy was issued January 26, 1911. The beneficiary named therein was the plaintiff, who was the mother of the insured. The first year\u2019s premium was paid in advance. On February 17, 1911, the insured died, and proof of death was subsequently furnished to the defendant as required by the terms of the policy. Two questions were submitted by the learned court below to the jury for their determination, namely: First, did the applicant make a false answer to question 10, contained in Defendant\u2019s Exhibit B, put to him by the defendant\u2019s medical examiner upon his examination for the policy? and, second, was the Defendant\u2019s Exhibit B actually the paper containing the questions put to the applicant by the defendant\u2019s medical examiner and the applicant\u2019s answers thereto upon his medical examination for the policy? The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, thereby answering both of these questions in the negative. The court below set aside the verdict of the jury on the ground that it was contrary to the evidence and contrary to law. From the order entered upon this motion, the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The Defendant\u2019s Exhibit B, referred to in the questions submitted to the jury, is an application for insurance on the life of the insured, and purports to contain answers by the latter to certain questions set forth in the application. The alleged false answers were made to questions numbered 9 and 10 on the application. The questions, together with the answers alleged to have been made thereto, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\">\u201c(9) What illnesses, diseases, or accidents have you had since childhood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">(The examiner should satisfy himself that the applicant gives full and careful answers to this question.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cName of disease? Acute indigestion\u2014ptomaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cNumber of attacks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cDate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cDuration. 2 wks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201cSeverity. Last summer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201cResults. Good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">\u201c(10) A. How long since you consulted or have had the care of a physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">B. If so, for what ailment? Name and address of physician? A. As above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">B. Dr. Gershenson, 46 Henry St.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The defendant seeks to avoid liability under the policy on the ground that the insured, in making the answers set forth, failed to disclose to the medical examiner that he had other illnesses and that he had consulted other physicians. The application containing the questions, in response to which the answers of the insured were made, was not attached to or indorsed upon the policy. Under these circumstances, they are not to be deemed a part of the policy. Section 58 of the Insurance Law provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\">\u201cEvery policy of insurance issued or delivered within the state on or after the 1st day of January, 1907, by any life insurance corporation doing business within the state, shall contain the entire contract between the parties, and nothing shall be incorporated therein by reference to any constitution, bylaws, rules, application or other writings unless the same are indorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued; and all statements purporting to be made by the insured shall in the absence of fraud be deemed representations and not warranties. Any waiver of the provisions of this section shall-be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">The purpose of this legislation was, as I understand it, that the policy of insurance should itself be treated as the entire contract between the parties, unless other provisions were indorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued. In this case the application upon which the defendant predicates its defense was not indorsed upon or attached to the policy, and therefore nothing contained in it can be used as a defense to an action upon the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-17\">Becker v. Colonial Life Insurance Co., 153 App. Div. 382, 138 N. Y. Supp. 491, in my judgment, is decisive of the present appeal. The opinion in that case discusses the authorities in other states, and comments upon the cases upon which the learned court below relied in setting aside the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">Moreover, in the present case, an issue of fact was presented as to whether or not the application in which the alleged false answers were contained was the application which the insured made for the policy upon which the action is brought. On its face, the application seems to have been made for a different policy of insurance from that which was issued to the insured. In view of the fact that this application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>was not indorsed upon or attached to the policy that was issued, the question is not important, although the fact that there was a dispute as to which application the defendant relied upon in issuing its policy shows the wisdom of the rule now embodied in section 58 of the Insurance Law (Consol. Laws, 1909, c. 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">I vote in favor of reversing the order appealed from and reinstating the verdict, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
