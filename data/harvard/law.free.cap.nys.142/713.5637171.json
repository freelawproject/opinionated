The committee\u2019s resolution of September 18th was a mere recommendation to the board of directors to be thereafter selected. The resolution of October 24th passed by the board did not purport in any way to relate to the original contract with plaintiffs or to their present claim for extra compensation, and was in no sense an adoption or ratification of the committee\u2019s resolution. Parol evidence that it was intended to be such was incompetent, and should have been excluded. Trustees, etc., of Southampton v. Jessup, 173 N. Y. 84, 65 N. E. 949. The subsequent resolutions of the board repudiated plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Nor was the parol evidence by-which plaintiffs sought to amplify the board\u2019s resolution of October 24th of a character sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>to establish a contract with the bank. It consisted of desultory conversations with certain members of the board, but at times and places other than at board meetings. Whatever was thus said was said by such persons as individuals, and not while acting officially, and hence did not bind the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\">The judgment should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">INGRAHAM, P.
