This account had been entered in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-14\">\u201cAlmira Clark, in trust for \u2018Benevolent Object\u2019 Warburton Avenue Baptist Church of Yonkers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">The controversy arises over the words \u201cBenevolent Object.\u201d Had that expression been omitted, it is not questioned that the plaintiff would have been entitled to this deposit, as a trust\u2014tentative while the depositor lived, but becoming absolute on her death. In re Totten, 179 N. Y. 112, 71 N. E. 748, 70 L. R. A. 711, 1 Ann. Cas. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">Here the term \u201cBenevolent Object\u201d may mean a wish or direction that the money shall be used in some benevolence of the church. This, however, did not prevent the gift from immediately vesting. If the added words be regarded as directing the manner that plaintiff is to use the money, nevertheless the language did not create a trust in the legal sense, as the church takes as an absolute donee. Its right and ownership are absolute, save as, in incidents and scope, they necessarily are adapted to the nature of a religious corporation. Wetmore v. Parker, 52 N. Y. 450; Bird v. Merklee, 144 N. Y. 544, 39 N. E. 645, 27 L. R. A. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">The latter case furnished stronger ground to assert a trust than does the case at bar. It was a bequest \u201cto the Methodist Episcopal churches of the Ninth ward of the city of New York, according to the number of members, to buy coal for the poor of said churches,\u201d yet the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">\u201cWe have here a direct and simple gift, made in terms that exclude any idea of trust.\u201d 144 N. Y. 549, 39 N. E. 646, 27 L. R. A. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>Such dispositions made to charitable or religious corporations raise the initial question merely of the corporate power to take, and if that power exists, our theory of the law, in order to save the gift, is that no trust at all results from such expressions by the testator or donor. Chaplin, Express Trusts and Powers, \u00a7 506. The suggestion as to the manner of enjoying the benefit creates a moral, but not a legal, obligation. Matter of Isbell, 1 App. Div. 158, 37 N. Y. Supp. 919. It is a benefaction given in confidence that the beneficiary will observe the benefactor\u2019s expressed wishes respecting it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-5\">\u201cIt is not, in a strict sense, a trust, inasmuch as the corporation, in effect, takes it absolutely.\u201d Per Gray, J., Matter of Griffin, 167 N. Y. 71, 78, 60. N. E. 284, 285.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Hence it is unnecessary to resort to the amending act of 1893 (Laws of 1893, c. 701), which, reversing the previous policy of this state, declares that religious, educational, charitable, or benevolent gifts are not void or invalid for uncertainty or indefiniteness of the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">In furtherance of the presumed intent of Mliss Clark as a member of the plaintiff church, her gift of this bank deposit must be held effectual, and hence that appellant is entitled to judgment therefor. I advise: .</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and entry of judgment directed for the plaintiff, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
