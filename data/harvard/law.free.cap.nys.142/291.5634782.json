On cross-examination, it appeared that these conversations had been held over the telephone, and that plaintiff had never seen the defendant and did not know him. The only basis for assuming that he had conversed with the defendant was that at the office of a large corporation, which he had called up, he had asked for a person by defendant\u2019s name, and some one had responded. Defendant\u2019s attorney then moved to strike out all this evi- and excepted to a denial of his motion.
