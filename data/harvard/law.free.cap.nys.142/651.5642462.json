The testimony of the mother of the child about to be born is substantially uncorroborated. It is contradictory, and so contradictory as to render it unworthy of belief, especially when read in the light of\" her previous history. She is 23 years of age, and admits having had two other children, though she has never been married. Appellant\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, is corroborated in . many respects by other witnesses, which, taken in connection with the other facts proved as to the situation and relation of the parties at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct, satisfies us that he is not the father of the child, and that the finding to that effect is against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The order appealed from therefore is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and defendant discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
