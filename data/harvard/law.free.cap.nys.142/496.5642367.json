The sole warrant for such a construction of the contract is contained in the second of the two recitals, which read as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\">\u201cWhereas, the parties of the first part are desirous of securing the services of the party of the second part as general manager for the wholesale sales department of the business of corsets, bust supporters, bust and hip reducers; and . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">. . \u201cWhereas, the party of the second part is desirous of obtaining and filling such position to the satisfaction of the parties of the first part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The respondents cite a number of cases which hold, in substance, that in construing an agreement all parts must be read together and each part given its due weight, and that recitals of fact in an executed contract under seal are to be regarded as estoppels against the parties who make the statement. See, for example, Gail v. Gail, 127 App. Div. 892, 112 N. Y. Supp. 96; Patterson v. Guardian Trust Co., 144 App. Div. 863, 129 N. Y. Supp. 807; Altman v. McMillin, 115 App. Div. 234, 100 N. Y. Supp. 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">I do not find that any of these cases are relevant, nor am I cited to any case which goes to the extreme extent, contended for by respondent, of holding that a mere casual recital of an obvious state of mind of the employ\u00e9 converts a contract of absolute employment for a definite time into one dependent upon the satisfaction of the employer with the work of the employ\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
