Reversed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1118-19\">The indictment contains three counts. The first charges the defendant with \u201cthe crime of keeping a room to be used for gambling, committed as follows: The said Samuel Weiss on or about December 1, 1912, and thence continually to the day of the taking of this inquisition, at the borough of Brooklyn of the city of New York, in the county 'Of Kings, unlawfully did keep a certain room in a certain building there situate, to be used for gambling.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1118-20\">The second count charges the defendant with \u201cthe crime of allowing a room, establishment, table, and apparatus to be used for gambling purposes, committed as follows: The said Samuel Weiss, on the day and in the year aforesaid, and thence continually to the day of the taking of this inquisition, at the county of Kings aforesaid, having the care, custody, and supervision of, and authority and control over the use of a certain room in a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>building there situate, and a certain gambling table and establishment, and divers cards, chips, dice, implements, paraphernalia, devices, and apparatus, then therein, a more particular description \u25a0 whereof is to the grand jury aforesaid unknown, and cannot now be given, the same being suitable for gambling purposes, feloniously did allow the same to be used for gambling purposes, to wit, for the purpose of conducting and allowing to be conducted in the said room, with the said gambling table, establishment, cards, chips, dice, implements, paraphernalia, devices, and apparatus a certain gambling commonly known as poker, where money and property were dependent upon the result, a more particular description of which said gambling game is to the grand jury aforesaid unknown, and cannot now be given, and for other gambling purposes, a more particular description whereof is to the said grand jury likewise unknown and cannot now be given.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1119-3\">The third count charges the defendant with \u201cbeing a common gambler, committed as follows: The said Samuel Weiss, on the day and in the year aforesaid, and thence continually to the day of the taking of this inquisition, at the county of Kings, having the care, custody, and supervision of, and authority and control over the use of, a certain room in a certain building there situate and a certain gambling table and establishment, and divers cards, chips, dice, implements, paraphernalia, devices, and apparatus then therein, a more particular description whereof is to the grand jury aforesaid unknown and cannot now be given, the same being suitable for gambling purposes, feloniously did allow the same to be used for gambling purposes, to wit, for the purpose of conducting and of allowing to be conducted in the said room, with the said gambling table, establishment, cards, chips, dice, implements, paraphernalia, devices, and apparatus a certain gambling game commonly known as poker, where money and property were dependent upon the result, a more particular description of which said gambling game is to the grand jury aforesaid unknown and cannot now be given, and for other gambling purposes, a more particular description whereof is to the said grand jury likewise unknown and cannot now be given, and did then and there and thereby become and yet is a common gambler.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1119-4\">The grounds of the demurrer were: \u201cI.

It is the rule that, in addition to charging the crime, the indictment must contain a plain and concise statement of the act constituting the crime. The rule is salutary because, in the first place, the defendant is enabled to prepare his defense, and, second, because a second indictment for the same offense may be avoided. People v. Corbalis, 178 N. Y. 516, 71 N. E. 106. The demurrer was sustained in the Corbalis Case, supra, because it did not allege any act constituting the crime, and it cannot be regarded, therefore, as an authority which would justify the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The indictment in the case at bar sufficiently charges the defendant with the crime of being a common gambler under the provisions of section 970 of the Penal Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 40), and is not demurrable under the provisions of sections 275 and 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. People v. Trainor, 57 App. Div. 422, 68 N. Y. Supp. 263; People v. Cavanagh and others (Sup.) 141 N. Y. Supp. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If it is true that there is any real doubt as to the particular place where it is charged the offense was committed, the remedy of the respondent was by motion for a bill of particulars. Tilton v. Beecher, 59 N. Y. 176, 17 Am. Rep. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I think the acts charged in the indictment in reality constitute but one .crime, viz., that of being a common gambler under the provisions of section 970 of the Penal Law; but, assuming that they constitute different crimes, they relate to the same thing in the same indictment, and such a pleading is permissible. Section 279, Code of Criminal Procedure; People v. Emerson, 53 Hun, 437, 6 N. Y. Supp. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is settled that, if one of several counts in an indictment is good, that is sufficient to sustain a conviction under' a general verdict of guilty. People v. Dimick, 107 N. Y. 13-30, 14 N. E. 178; Phelps v. People, 72 N. Y. 365; Pontius v. People, 82 N. Y. 339; People v. Willett, 102 N. Y. 251, 6 N. E. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">It follows that the judgment and order of the County Court of Kings County must be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
