It is manifest that the members of said firm are necessary parties to any action for the cancellation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> While, therefore, the defendant has in form pleaded an e table counterclaim for this and other relief, it is perfectly plain tL the counterclaim is not good, and that the defendant was not entitle-to any relief thereunder when the order was made, and if he were he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>would not be so entitled now, for on an appeal from the order allowing an amendment to the answer and requiring the plaintiff to join the members of said firm as parties, which was argued and is to be decided herewith, we are reversing the order and denying the motion. The facts upon which the equitable counterclaim is based can therefore be of no avail to the defendant in this action except as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Characterizing them as a counterclaim does not entitle the defendant to have a trial of the issues arising thereon at Special Term in advance of the trial of the other issues. Cohen v. Am. Surety Co. No. 1, 129 App. Div. 166-171, 113 N. Y. Supp. 375. If the facts pleaded in the counterclaim constitute a defense, they may be proved at Trial Term when the plaintiff brings the action on for a hearing; and, since for the reasons stated he cannot have the equitable relief demanded, there is no occasion for a separate trial of the issues arising on the facts pleaded in form as a counterclaim for equitable relief and on the reply ther\u00e9to. White v. Shonts, 154 App. Div. 428, 139 N. Y. Supp. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
