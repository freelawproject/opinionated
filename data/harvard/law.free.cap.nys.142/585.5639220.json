Proc. \u00a7 3364) provides that the provisions of law and of the rules of practice relating to the appearance of parties in actions in the Supreme Court shall apply to condemnation proceedings after the service of the petition. Section 3375 authorizes an appeal from a final order in condemnation proceedings entered after the report of commissioners, which brings up for review all proceedings subsequent to the judgment, and provides that such an appeal authorizes a review of proceedings antecedent to the judgment, if appellant states in the notice that the same will be brought up for review. Sections 3367 and 3376 declare that no other appeal is authorized, unless a trial of the issues has been had before the court or a referee, and judgment has been rendered for the defendant. <em>Held,, </em>that an order overruling objections to the petition was in the nature of an order overruling a demurrer, and unappealable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-9\">[Ed.

Upon the return day of the motion, defendants the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>of the state of New York and the commissioners of the land office of the state of New York appeared and interposed an answer. This answer is not made a part of the record in this case, but the fact that said defendants did answer is recited in the order appealed from. At the same time said defendants interposed certain so-called preliminary objections to the granting of the motion, upon the ground that the petition was insufficient in certain particulars. The learned court at Special Term overruled these objections and made an order appointing a referee to hear and determine the issues raised by said petition and answer, -and from that order this appeal comes.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We think that the appeal must be dismissed. The Condemnation \u25a0 Law (Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 3357-3384) does not in express terms authorize the service of a demurrer. It does provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cThe provisions of law and of the rules and practice of the court, relating to the appearance of parties in person or by attorney in actions in the Supreme Court, shall apply to the proceeding from and after the service of the petition.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 3364.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Under the former Railroad Law (Laws 1850, c. 140), whose provisions were less liberal in expression, it was held that such preliminary objections, when interposed, might be treated as a demurrer. In re New York, West Shore &amp; Buffalo R. Co., 64 How. Prac. 216. If we should, therefore, treat the order appealed from as an order overruling a demurrer, it is sufficient to say: First, that, having answered, defendants must be deemed to have withdrawn said demurrer; and, second, that such an order may not be reviewed by direct appeal therefrom. \u25a0 An appeal may be taken from the final order in condemnation proceedings, entered after the report of the commissioners, which ap- . peal brings up for review all the proceedings subsequent to the judgment. Id. \u00a7 3375. Upon such appeal all proceedings antecedent to the judgment may also be reviewed \u201cif the appellant states in his notice that the same will be brought up for review.\u201d Id. No other appeal is authorized, unless a trial of the issues has been had, either before the court or a referee appointed to hear and determine the same (Id. \u00a7 3367), and judgment has been rendered in favor of the <em>defendant </em>(Id. \u00a7 3376).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
