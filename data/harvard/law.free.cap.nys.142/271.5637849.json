Plaintiff claims, as I read the testimony, never to have either asked or received any interest, but only some $8 for disbursements which he had incurred. The judgment was for $68. If the learned trial judge believed the plaintiff, the judgment should have been for $100 at least; and if the defendants,/ to the effect that there had been usury, then the judgment should have been for the defendants. -</p>\n<p id=\"Ak_\">Judgment reversed, on the authority of Goldberg v.
