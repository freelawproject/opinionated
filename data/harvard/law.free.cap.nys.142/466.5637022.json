Her testimony and the exhibits offered in her behalf fail to show anything which could be in any manner construed as an account stated between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">On January 29, 1912, plaintiff wrote the defendant a letter, which stated plaintiff\u2019s version of their mutual accounts. This disposes of any possible claim that defendant\u2019s letter of January 21st, conceding that $250.75 was due, constituted an account stated, because it is evidence, as the record stands, that plaintiff did not accept defendant\u2019s version of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">_ It appears, however, on the appeal, that respondent relies on interviews with the defendant said to have occurred since these letters were exchanged; but there is no evidence as to those interviews, except that of defendant, and in that evidence there is nothing to show an account stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to. abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
