The covenant in question is to the effect that said land \u201cshall be used and occupied solely for the purpose of a private dwelling and a private stable or garage, to be used for and in connection with such dwelling house.\u201d The allegation of the complaint is that defendants have \u201cconstructed certain sheds or outhouses not permitted by and in violation of the terms of the contract * * * and in violation of the covenants referred to in the \u2019deed of the said premises.\u201d Defendants demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and from an order overruling said demurrer appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">Except the words \u201cconstructed certain sheds or outhouses,\u201d the allegation in the complaint above referred to is not the statement of a fact or facts, but a conclusion of law. Unless no shed or outhouse of any description can possibly be erected in connection with a dwelling house or a private stable or garage, without destroying the characteristic use of the land for these purposes, the complaint is insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>cient, and defendants\u2019 demurrer upon that ground should have been sustained. Beckwith v. Pirung, 134 App. Div. 608, 119 N. Y. Supp. 444. Manifestly, this is not the case. The allegation is in the disjunctive. For anything that appears, the \u201cshed or outhouse\u201d may have been a storm shed over one of the doors of entrance to the dwelling house, or a wagon shed forming part of the private stable, or it may have been a conservatory or a greenhouse. The burden is in the first instance on 'plaintiffs to show a violation of the covenant, not upon defendants to show a- compliance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The order overruling the demurrer should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiffs, within 20 days after the entry of the order herein, to amend the complaint upon payment of the costs of said demurrer and of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">THOMAS, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
