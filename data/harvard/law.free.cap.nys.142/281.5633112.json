J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">This appeal is from a judgment entered upon the \u25a0dismissal of the complaint at a Trial Term, upon a motion that neither \u25a0of the causes of action alleged therein contains facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The learned counsel for the appellant states in his printed brief that the second separate cause of action \u201cwas abandoned by the plaintiff, and no judicial interpretation thereof was prayed for, at the time of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The question presented is one of pleading. Coppola v. Kraushaar, 102 App. Div. 306, 92 N. Y. Supp. 436; Staiger v. Klitz, 129 App. Div. 703, 114 N. Y. Supp. 486. The plaintiff complains in his \u25a0first cause of action that Johanne Kemmna died intestate in 1910; that the defendant qualified as her administrator; that the said Kemmna, \u25a0on or about November 30, 1906, executed and delivered to plaintiff a full covenant and warranty deed of certain described premises; that the said deed \u201ccontained a covenant that the said Johanne Kemmna was seised of the said premises in fee simple and had good right to \u25a0convey the same, and the said Johanne Kemmna, in her said deed, so \u25a0delivered as aforesaid to the plaintiff, covenanted forever to warrant the title to the said premises\u201d; \u201cthat the said Johanne Kemmna, at the time of the execution and delivery of the aforesaid deed to plaintiff, was not seised in fee simple of the premises described in said \u25a0deed, and never had title to said premises and had no right to convey the same, and that on said November 30, 1906, and for some time prior thereto, one Antoinette F. K. McCauslan was the owner in fee simple \u2022of the said premises described- in said deed, and is still the owner thereof ;\u201d \u201cthat the said plaintiff, at the time of the execution and delivery \u2022of the aforesaid deed of said premises, paid to the said Johanne Kem- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u25a0 mna the consideration or sum therefor of $900;\u201d \u201cthat plaintiff, by reason of the premises, has sustained damages in the sum of $900, with interest thereon from the 30th day of November, 1906;\u201d and \u201cthat on or about the 22d day of September, 1910, the plaintiff .presented to the defendant for payment the aforesaid claim, duly verified, and on or about the 6th day of June, 1911, the said defendant rejected said claim and refused to pay the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I think that the complaint may be sustained as pleading a breach of the covenant of seisin (section 253 of the Real Property Law [Con-sol. Laws 1909, c. 50]), which covenant was broken when Kemmna without title delivered the deed (Mygatt v. Coe, 124 N. Y. 212, 218, 26 N. E. 611, 11 L. R. A. 646). Negativing the words of such a covenant is sufficient allegation of a breach thereof. Kent\u2019s Comm. (14th Ed.) vol. 4, citing authorities. In Rickert v. Snyder, 9 Wend. 417, the court, per Savage, C. J., say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201cThe rule as to the assignment of breaches on the various covenants in a -deed is briefly and correctly stated by Chancellor Kent. 4 Kent, Comm. (2d Ed.) 479. In the covenant of seisin it is sufficient to allege the breach, by negativing the words of the covenant. The same rule must also apply to the \u25a0covenant that the covenantor has good right to convey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">See, too, Abbott\u2019s Forms of Pleading, p. 422, note 1, citing authorities ; Woolley v. Newcombe, 87 N. Y. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> No eviction is necessary. Ency. of PI. &amp; Pr. vol. 5, p. 374; Shattuck v. Lamb, 65 N. Y. 510, 22 Am. Rep. 656; Rawle on Covenants for Title (5th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 58, 62, 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The various cases cited by the learned counsel for the respondent may be discriminated, in that they present covenants for quiet en- or of general warranty, which, in the language of Savage, <em>C. </em>J., in Rickert\u2019s Case, supra, \u201crequire the assignment of a breach by a specific ouster, or eviction by paramount legal title.\u201d Although there is the allegation that Kemmna covenanted forever to warrant the title, there is no plea of a breach of such covenant, and the allegation may be disregarded as surplusage, and the complaint held to charge a breach of covenant of seisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
