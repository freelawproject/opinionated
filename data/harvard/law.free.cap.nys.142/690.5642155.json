The nature of that instrument, considr ered in the light of the circumstances and situation of the parties, should be taken as equivalent to an agreement of dissolution, on which date it is fair to assume that it was the intention of the parties that interest on their respective money contributions should cease. Johnson v. Hartshorne, 52 N. Y. 173, 177. The net recovery from the bond and mortgage was $650. On January 1st plaintiff\u2019s contribution to the joint capital with interest at 6 per cent, from October 6, 1910, amounted to $858, and defendant\u2019s $214.50. The total capital of the parties was therefore $1,072.50. To repay this amount the parties had only $650; therefore they had lost $422.50, one-half of which is $211.25. Deducting this amount from the capital share of each produces the following result: Plaintiff\u2019s share of capital, $858, less one-half loss, $211.25, equals $646.75; defendant\u2019s share of capital, $214.50, less one-half, $211.25, equals $3.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The judgment should be modified so as to award to plaintiff $646.'75 from the net proceeds of the bond and mortgage in the hands of the attorneys, and to the defendant from the same $3.25, and as so modified affirmed without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">LAUGHDIN and DOWLING, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
