Harris, to acquire for himself the assets of the corporation at the expense of the appellant, the only other important stockholder. The assignment was itself an act of bankruptcy, and any fraud on the part of Sam H. Harris in procuring the same was not imputable to the creditors who filed the petition in bankruptcy. Under these circumstances, the appellant should not be held to have waived any rights because he did not attack the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-3\">But inasmuch as to unqualifiedly restrain a sale by Sam H. Harris of the former assets of the corporation might result in depriving the former creditors of the corporation of the fund from which they expected to be paid when they consented to the sale to Sam, the order will be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant, and the motion for injunction granted, with $10 costs, unless Sam H. Harris furnish appellant with a sufficient undertaking in the sum of $25,-000 to pay any final judgment recovered against him herein. If such bond is furnished, the order will be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
