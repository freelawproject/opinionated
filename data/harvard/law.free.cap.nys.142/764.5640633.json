Proc., under which the application for the order of examination was made, provides as follows:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\u201cAt any time after the issuing of an execution against property, as prescribed in section 2458 of this act, and before the return thereof, the judgment creditor, upon proof, by affidavit, or other competent written evidence, that the judgment debtor has property, which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, is entitled to an order, requiring the judgment debtor to attend and be examined concerning his property, at a time and place specified in the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">In First National Bank of Rome v. Wilson, 13 Hun, 232, it was held that the proof made on the application for an order for examination in supplementary proceedings before the return of the execution should show facts and circumstances, in order that the judge may decide whether there has been an unjust refusal, although, as the court said, the practice had been otherwise to a large extent. The defect, however, was held not to be jurisdictional, and an averment in the language of the statute was held to be sufficient to confer jurisdiction, as the defect was an irregularity which might be waived or amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In this case the averment was not in the language of the statute; but, on the contrary, it affirmatively appeared that the allegation that the debtor had property which it unjustly refused to apply to the satisfaction of the judgment was based on information and belief only, the sources of which were not disclosed. Under these conditions the moving affidavit was fatally defective. Barron v. Feist, 51 Misc. Rep. 589, 101 N. Y. Supp. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for examination granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
