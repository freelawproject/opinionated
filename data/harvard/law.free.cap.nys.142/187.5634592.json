Colt upon a complaint alleging in substance that he, being a director of the said United States Rubber Company, unlawfully took and retained a large sum of money the property of the company, and that other defendants, being also directors of the company, willfully and knowingly permitted him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The appellant, by his answer, admits the receipt of the money, but denies that it was received unlawfully, and by way of separate defenses alleges that the sum received by him was paid pursuant to a contract duly authorized by the directors, and further that the said contract was duly ratified by the stockholders of the Rubber Company, with full knowledge, at a general meeting. Incorporated in the answer, and appended thereto, and made part thereof by reference, are copies of certain' documents and resolutions forming part of the records of the Rubber Company, and apparently serving to support the allegations of the separate defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">, Upon appellant\u2019s motion, and upon the consent of plaintiff, an order was heretofore made requiring the plaintiff to reply to the new matter incorporated into defendant\u2019s answer, and consisting of separate defenses alleged therein. Into this order was inserted a provision that, for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to make definite and certain her reply to said new matter, she should have an examination of the by-laws of the Rubber Company, the records of the corporate proceedings, and of the contracts, reports, and other writings referred to in said separate defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It is not charged that any obstacle has been interposed to such examination by plaintiff, and yet she has seen fit to reply by denying, for lack of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, the existence of the contracts, resolutions, and the like set up by appellant in his separate defenses, and forming a part of the records of the Rubber Company, of which she was accorded the right of examination for the very purpose of avoiding an indefinite and uncertain reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This manner of pleading has frequently been condemned. Steinway v. Steinway, 74 Hun, 423, 26. N. Y. Supp. 657; Dahlstrom v. Gemunder, 198 N. Y. 449, 92 N. E. 106, 19 Ann. Cas. 771; Kirschbaum v. Eschmann, 205 N. Y. 127, 98 N. E. 328. The plaintiff has knowledge, or the ready means of ascertaining, whether or not the contracts and resolutions pleaded by appellant were actually executed and adopted, and may not put their existence in issue by a denial of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief. Of course, if she cannot deny their execution and existence, she is still at liberty to attack their validity or force in any way she sees fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted to the extent indicated, with $10 costs. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
