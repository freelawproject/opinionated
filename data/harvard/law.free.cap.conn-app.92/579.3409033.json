We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On March 17, 2002, the defendant and John Yeldell were walking together on Bishop Street in Waterbury. Barbara Stevens, who was acquainted with the defendant and Yeldell, stopped to give them a ride. Stevens was driving a pickup truck owned by Gregory Torwich and was returning from shopping with her friend, Valerie Brown. Stevens dropped off the defendant and Yeldell in front of an apartment building at 330 Bishop Street. She then parked Torwich\u2019s truck behind the building and went with Brown inside to the apartment where Brown lived with John Knight.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Thereafter, Brown, Knight, Stevens and Torwich were present in Knight\u2019s apartment when the defendant and Yeldell knocked on the door and asked Stevens if they could borrow Torwich\u2019s truck. When Stevens refused, the defendant and Yeldell left. They returned a short time later. Knight answered the door and told them to leave, but they brandished knives and pushed Knight aside. After struggling with Stevens and robbing Torwich of $1000 and the keys to his truck, the defendant and Yeldell fled. Police recovered Torwich\u2019s truck in Hamden on March 18, 2002. The following day, the defendant and Yeldell were arrested together in New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">After a trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of ten years incarceration followed by five years special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The defendant first claims that prosecutorial misconduct during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument to the jury deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to conclude that the defendant had fled with Yeldell in Torwich\u2019s truck from Waterbury to New Haven. The defendant directs us to the following statement made by the prosecutor, to which the defendant objected: \u201cI submit to you that what happened [after the burglary and robbery] is that both [Yeldell] and the defendant fled in the truck down to New Haven until they were arrested there.\u201d We conclude that that statement did not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We conduct a two step inquiry in analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cThe two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Com. 563, 572, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). We recognize that \u201cbecause closing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument. [I]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Nevertheless, [w]hile a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, such argument must be fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Antonio A., </em>90 Conn. App. 286, 298, 878 A.2d 358, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 926, 883 A.2d 1246 (2005). \u201cIt is not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>91 Conn. App. 509, 520, 881 A.2d 1039 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The evidence at trial indicated that the defendant and Yeldell had been together at Knight\u2019s apartment in Waterbury, had stolen the keys to Torwich\u2019s truck and later had been arrested together in New Haven. Furthermore, Torwich\u2019s truck was recovered in Hamden, which is adjacent to New Haven. In stating that the defendant and Yeldell had fled together in Torwich\u2019s truck, the prosecutor merely commented on the evidence and asked the jury to draw a reasonable inference. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court should have granted his request to charge the jury (1) that its disbelief of his testimony and Yeldell\u2019s testimony was not affirmative proof of the opposite and (2) to consider Stevens\u2019 testimony with caution because she admitted that she had smoked crack cocaine shortly before the burglary and robbery. We disagree with both parts of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">We previously addressed the issue in the first part of the defendant\u2019s claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>50 Conn. App. 369, 717 A.2d 828 (1998), appeal dismissed, 253 Conn. 541, 755 A.2d 179 (2000). That case, like the present case, involved a claim of instructional error, but not a claim of insufficient evidence due to a lack of affirmative evidence of guilt. We determined that a court need not \u201cinstruct the jury that it cannot . . . use its disbelief of a witness\u2019 testimony as affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>proof of the opposite\u201d; id., 380-81; when a defendant has not claimed insufficient evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the court in the present case did not act improperly in declining to give the defendant\u2019s instruction regarding the juiy\u2019s disbelief of his testimony and Yeldell\u2019s testimony as affirmative proof of the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The second part of the defendant\u2019s claim concerns his request for a cautionary instruction on Stevens\u2019 testimony. The defendant\u2019s proposed instruction provided in relevant part: \u201cThe testimony of a witness who has been using drugs . . . may be less believable because of the effect the drug may have [had] on her ability to perceive or relate the events in question.\u201d Although the court declined to give that instruction, it gave a lengthy instruction on the credibility of witnesses, which provided in relevant part: \u201cWith each witness, you should consider his ability to observe facts correctly, recall them and relate them to you truly and accurately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">It is well settled that \u201ca charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>275 Conn. 395, 400, 880 A.2d 151 (2005). Furthermore, \u201ca refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>86 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>App. 196, 213, 860 A.2d 1239 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 902, 868 A.2d 746 (2005). \u201c[W]hether certain factors relating to witness credibility need to be stressed will largely be left to the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s charge on credibility fairly presented the case and sufficiently guided the jury. The court instructed the jury to evaluate the witnesses\u2019 \u201cability to observe facts correctly . . . .\u201d That instruction had the same substance as the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction because it addressed the witnesses\u2019 perception. The court\u2019s decision not to refer to Stevens\u2019 drug use specifically was within its discretion and did not affect the juiy\u2019s ability to consider whether the drug use had impaired her perception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court therefore did not act improperly in declining to give the defendant\u2019s instruction regarding Stevens\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the cumulative effect of the improprieties he alleged in his first two claims deprived him of a fair trial. Our Supreme Court, however, does not permit the aggregation of claims to form \u201ca new constitutional claim in which the totality of alleged constitutional error is greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 218, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, <em>126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. </em>Ed. 2d 116 (2005). Because we rejected the defendant\u2019s first two claims, an aggregation of those claims cannot state a separate constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> Specifically, the defendant was convicted of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1), conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-101 (a) (1), robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> Furthermore, the court did not prevent defense counsel from commenting on Stevens\u2019 drug use during closing argument, and defense counsel in fact did comment on its possible effect on Stevens\u2019 perception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
