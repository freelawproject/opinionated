He claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the state\u2019s use of an incorrect docket number in referencing the matter for which he had been committed. Although the acquittee is arguably not aggrieved by the judgment of dismissal, which the court based on constitutional grounds, we conclude that the acquittee is aggrieved because of the conditional nature of that dismissal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>because the acquittee claims that he is entitled to an unconditional dismissal. On appeal, the acquittee claims that the court improperly concluded that the state\u2019s use of an incorrect docket number was a circumstantial defect subject to correction under General Statutes \u00a7 52-123. We disagree and conclude that the court had jurisdiction to open the judgment to correct the docket number. However, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment dismissing the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Certain procedural history is pertinent to our review. Under docket number CR74-175185, the defendant was charged with assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) in connection with the shooting of Wade Foote (Foote case). He was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Subsequently, while on conditional release during his commitment in the Foote case, the acquittee was charged with the crime of murder, under docket number CR76-197288, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a for fatally shooting a former girlfriend, Shereese Weatherly (Weatherly case). He also was found not guilty of that crime by reason of mental disease or defect and ultimately was placed under the jurisdiction of the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-602. His commitment was for a period of twenty-five years commencing January 25, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">On August 7, 2003, the state filed a petition for an order of continued commitment of the acquittee in connection with the Weatherly case pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c). That petition was filed under the wrong docket number, CR74-175185, the docket number from the Foote case. Neither the state nor the acquittee brought this error to the court\u2019s attention at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Using the incorrect docket number of the Foote case, the acquittee filed a motion to dismiss the state\u2019s petition on constitutional grounds, claiming that the petition should be dismissed because \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the acquittee\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The acquittee\u2019s motion to dismiss, although mistakenly referencing the wrong docket number, nonetheless correctly referenced the murder charge, which had resulted in his commitment with respect to the Weatherly case. The court dismissed the petition, but stayed its ruling because an appeal had been taken to our Supreme Court involving a similar issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 847 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004), which was still pending before our Supreme Court at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The state appealed from the dismissal of the petition and, after discovering that the wrong docket number had been used, filed a motion in the trial court to open the judgment to correct the docket number to the number assigned to the acquittee\u2019s murder file in the Weatherly case. The acquittee then moved to dismiss the state\u2019s petition to extend the commitment because he claimed that the mistake in the docket number was a substantive defect depriving the court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On April 27, 2004, our Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 508. It held that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) did not violate an acquittee\u2019s federal or state equal protection rights, that the statute did not affect a suspect class or a fundamental right and that there was a rational basis for different treatment of insanity acquittees from civilly committed inmates who have a periodic review of their commitment every two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Approximately one month after our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Long, </em>the trial court, on May 21,2004, denied the acquittee\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court found that the incorrect docket number was merely a \u201cscrivener\u2019s\u201d or \u201ccircumstantial\u201d error and granted the state\u2019s motion to open to correct the docket number error. The court additionally ordered that \u201c[t]he orders of the court on December 23, 2003, stand \u2014 and said orders are applied to Docket No. CR76-197288 \u2014 subject to the effect of the Supreme Court ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>[supra, 268 Conn. 508].\u201d The effect of that order was to enter in the Weatherly case (docket number CR-197288) the court\u2019s judgment dated December 23, 2003, and filed January 6, 2004, dismissing on constitutional grounds the state\u2019s motion to extend the commitment. The court obviously took into account in entering its order the petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court filed by the acquittee in the <em>Long </em>case, which was still pending at the time of the May 21 order, but which subsequently was denied on November 1, 2004. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In this appeal, we first address the issue raised separately by the acquittee, namely, whether the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the state\u2019s petition to extend the acquittee\u2019s commitment because the state, in its petition, improperly used the docket number from the Foote case rather than from the Weatherly case.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In its decision filed May 21, 2004, the trial court found on the basis of facts not in dispute, that \u201c[o]n or about July 30, 2003, as [the acquittee\u2019s] release date on Docket Number CR76-197288 approached, the state petitioned the court for continued commitment of the [acquittee] beyond the January 24, 2004 date pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c). The state in its motion for continued commitment did inadvertently file the petition under the wrong docket number \u2014 CR74<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>175185 \u2014 the docket number assigned to the [Foote case].</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u201cOn December 23, 2003, a hearing was held relevant to the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment beyond the January 24, 2004 date pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 (c). The parties stipulated to certain facts relevant to the procedural and substantive history of [the acquittee\u2019s murder case] (CR76-197288).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u201cAfter the hearing, and based upon the stipulation of facts entered into by the parties, the court denied the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment of [the acquittee] and granted the [acquittee\u2019s] motion to dismiss relying on its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>[Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. 308773 (September 3, 2002)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In its memorandum of decision filed May 21, 2004, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that the state inadvertently affixed to this file the docket number of a defunct matter does not elevate the error to one of a substantive nature\u201d and found that \u201cthe affixing to the subject file an incorrect docket number is a \u2018scrivener\u2019s\u2019 or \u2018circumstantial\u2019 defect that does not vitiate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Whether the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. <em>Neiman </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>270 Conn. 244, 251, 851 A.2d 1165 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On appeal, the acquittee claims that the state\u2019s use of an incorrect docket number in its petition for continued commitment was a substantive defect implicating the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. Specifically, the acquittee claims that the recommitment proceedings conducted under the docket number from the Foote case (CR74-175185) were a nullity, and the state\u2019s plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ings <em>related to that separate Foote case. </em>He claims that the proceedings were a nullity because his commitment in the Foote case had expired in 1995, and the state did not file for recommitment in the Weatherly case when that commitment expired in January, 2004. While the acquittee argues that the error constituted a substantive defect that deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction, the state contends that the use of an incorrect docket number was a circumstantial defect that was curable by \u00a7 52-123 and did not deprive the court of jurisdiction. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-123 provides: \u201cNo writ, pleading, judgment or any kind of proceeding in court or course of justice shall be abated, suspended, set aside or reversed for any kind of circumstantial errors, mistakes or defects, if the person and the cause may be rightly understood and intended by the court.\u201d \u201cSection 52-123 is a remedial statute and therefore it must be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit. . . . [Section] 52-123 replaces the common law rule that deprived courts of subject matter jurisdiction whenever there was a misnomer or misdescription in an original writ, summons or complaint.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396-97, 655 A.2d 759 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Defective pleadings are broken down into two categories: circumstantial defects, which are subject to correction under \u00a7 52-123, and substantive defects, which are not. See <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Rochester v. Pellechia, </em>31 Conn. App. 260, 264-65, 624 A.2d 395, cert. denied, 227 Conn 923, 632 A.2d 701 (1993). \u201cCircumstantial defects not subject to abatement by reason of \u00a7 52-123 or its predecessors have included the mistaken use of a Practice Book form . . . failure to designate an apartment number in a writ ... an erroneous reference in appeal papers to next term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>instead of next return day ... a copy of the affidavit attached to the writ served upon the defendant that did not bear the signature of the affiant ... an erroneous reference in the return to the City Court held at New Haven in and for the city of New Haven instead of The City Court of New Haven ... an erroneous prayer for relief on the writ and declaration rather than on the writ alone . . . and a defendant who had signed his name in the body of a plea in abatement signed <em>defendant </em>at the end of the plea instead of again signing his name. ... In contrast, substantive defects are those that are subject to abatement. . . . They involve defects or irregularities in the service or return of process and other matters that implicate the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see <em>Rogozinski </em>v. <em>American Food Service Equipment </em>Corp., 211 Conn. 431, 434-35, 559 A.2d 1110 (1989) (failure to return process to court clerk at least six days prior to return date was substantive defect subjecting plaintiffs action to motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 397, reiterated the test for determining whether a defect is circumstantial under \u00a7 52-123. First, the court looked to whether the party intended to reference the proper party or whether it \u201chad erroneously misdirected its action.\u201d Id. \u201cSecond, [the court] considered three factors to determine whether the error was a misnomer and therefore a circumstantial defect under \u00a7 52-123: (1) whether the proper defendant had actual notice of the institution of the action; (2) whether the proper defendant knew or should have known that [he] was the intended defendant in the action; and (3) whether the proper defendant was in any way misled to [his] prejudice.\u201d Id. Although <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>is a civil case, the language of \u00a7 52-123 itself does not limit the statute\u2019s applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to civil cases. The statute plainly states: \u201cNo . . . kind of proceeding in court or course of justice shall be abated, suspended, set aside or reversed for any kind of circumstantial errors, mistakes or defects . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-123. That language is broad enough to include petitions for continued commitment to the jurisdiction of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Here, the state intended to reference the acquittee with regard to the Weatherly case. It is not in dispute that as the acquittee\u2019s release date approached on docket number CR76-197288, which was the docket number assigned to the Weatherly case, the state <em>inadvertently </em>filed its petition under an incorrect docket number, CR74-175185, which was the docket number assigned to the Foote case. However, the stipulation of facts makes it crystal clear that it was the acquittee whom the state intended to reference. The caption title on the court\u2019s memorandum of decision dated December 23, 2003, represented the acquittee by his name, Gregory Gillespie, and the court found facts concerning the Weatherly murder case based on the stipulation entered into by the acquittee. Next, in applying the three factors set forth in <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>by our Supreme Court to determine whether the defect was circumstantial, we conclude that they are satisfied. The acquittee had actual knowledge of the institution of the action, knew that the murder case, not the assault case, was the subject matter of the action and was not in any way misled to his prejudice. First, it is clear' that the acquittee had actual knowledge of the institution of the action because in response to the state\u2019s petition, he filed a motion to dismiss specifically mentioning the murder charge and arguing that the state\u2019s petition for recommitment was unconstitutional pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 (c). Although the acquittee himself used the incorrect Foote case docket number in his caption to this motion, both he and the state understood what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>substantively before the court. Second, it is also clear that the acquittee knew that the murder case was the subject matter of the action because, on December 23, 2003, he entered into a stipulation of facts, which concerned facts of the Weatherly case and made no mention of the unrelated Foote case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a hearing on December 23, 2003, the acquittee and the state argued the merits of the Weatherly case. In its memorandum of decision filed May 21, 2004, the court stated: \u201cThe only viable file that was before the court on December 23, 2003 . . . was the file that charged murder, CR76-197288. ... All comments of the parties at the hearing concerned only the subject matter of the murder charged file.\u201d It is clear from the stipulation of facts and the argument of the acquittee\u2019s counsel at the December 23, 2003 hearing that the acquittee knew not only that the state\u2019s petition referenced him, but also knew that it concerned the Weatherly case. We therefore determine that the acquittee was not misled and that there was no prejudice, and conclude that the three part test in <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Furthermore, our Supreme Court has held that the use of an incorrect docket number is a circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>defect. In <em>Plasil </em>v. <em>Tableman, </em>223 Conn. 68, 612 A.2d 763 (1992), our Supreme Court reviewed whether a trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to grant prejudgment remedies in a case in which an incorrect docket number that referred to a previously dismissed case was used. The court held that \u201c[t]he failure to collect an entry fee for the re-served complaint or to assign it a new docket number did not deprive the court of jurisdiction or presumptively prejudice the defendants. To strip the plaintiff of her prejudgment remedies would neither facilitate the business of the court nor advance justice, but rather would serve merely to exalt technicalities above substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Case law from other jurisdictions is in accord that the use of an erroneous docket number, including that of an expired case in a criminal matter, does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 2821 (June 27, 1997) (use of incorrect docket number, which belonged to dismissed case against defendant, when sentencing defendant did not deprive court of subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>56 Va. Cir. 27, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 439 (January 30, 2001) (defendant incorrectly sentenced under docket number of dismissed case due to typographical errors and court ordered those scrivener\u2019s errors corrected); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ragsdale, </em>158 S.W.3d 426 (Tenn. App. 2004) (subject matter jurisdiction existed in civil case where incorrect docket number used referencing dismissed case).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We conclude that the court properly decided that the use of an incorrect docket number in this case was a circumstantial defect that was curable pursuant to \u00a7 52-123, and properly granted the motion to open to correct the docket number to conform to the proper docket number of the Weatherly case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>After opening the judgment and correcting the docket number, however, the court then proceeded to reinstate its prior judgment dismissing the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment. It stated: \u201cThe state\u2019s motion to reopen judgment is granted. The orders of the court [issued] on December 23, 2003, stand \u2014 and said orders are applied to Docket No. CR76-197288 \u2014 subject to the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>[supra, 268 Conn. 508] . . . .\u201d Thus, the order dated December 23,2003, and filed January 6,2004, dismissing the state\u2019s petition for continued commitment, in which the court held on the basis of its prior decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. 308773 that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) was unconstitutional, was again made an order of the court in docket number CR76-197288.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we reverse the judgment dismissing the state\u2019s petition and remand the case for further proceedings because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 508, had determined that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">After the court rendered its decision dated December 23, 2003, the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>was reversed by our Supreme Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 508. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permits a court to extend the commitment of an acquittee past his initial term of commitment if his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ers. The trial court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>concluded that \u201c\u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because the statute failed to provide an acquittee with mandatory periodic judicial review of confinement . . . violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution because it treats acquittees, like the defendant, differently from convicted prisoners who subsequently are civilly committed to a mental hospital at some point after they have been incarcerated . . . [and] violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution. . . .\u201d Id., 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>our Supreme Court held that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the state constitution and his equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. In so holding, the court stated that \u201c\u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, provided him with periodic judicial review sufficient to satisfy his state procedural due process rights.\u201d Id., 516. The court further reasoned that the statute does not affect a suspect class or implicate a fundamental right and there is a rational basis for the legislature\u2019s differential treatment of insanity acquittees and civilly committed inmates, who have a mandated right to judicial review of their commitment by a Probate Court at least once every two years, because \u201cthe board has general and specific familiarity with all acquittees beginning with their initial commitment and, therefore, is better equipped than courts to monitor their commitment.\u201d Id., 536. It further reasoned that because \u201cthe legislature could have determined that the likelihood of an erroneous commitment is reduced in the case of an acquittee because an acquittee initiates the commitment process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>himself by pleading and proving the mental illness that led to his commission of a crime.\u201d Id., 536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The judgment is affirmed only as to the finding of subject matter jurisdiction and in all other respects is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> The acquittee based his second motion to dismiss on the assumption that the court would grant the state\u2019s motion to open.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> In its memorandum of decision dated December 23, 2003, the court stated: \u201cThe state of Connecticut and Gregory Gillespie, acquittee, have entered into the following stipulation, and the court, accordingly, finds these facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201c1.
