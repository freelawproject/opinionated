We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). After carefully reviewing the entire record in this habeas proceeding, we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues raised are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Losada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). As the petitioner has not satisfied any of those criteria, he has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal reflects an abuse of discretion. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> The petitioner was convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-54a (a), and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). The judgment of conviction was affirmed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>210 Conn. 619, 556 A.2d 596 (1989). The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s subsequent petition for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, which judgment was upheld in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Conn. App. 122, 634 A.2d 1177 (1993). See also <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>45 Conn. App. 362, 696 A.2d 371 (affirming judgment dismissing petition for writ of habeas corpus that alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel), cert. denied, 242 Conn. 911, 697 A.2d 364 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> The petitioner also alleged a violation of the right to due process of law, but that claim was procedurally defaulted for not having been raised on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
