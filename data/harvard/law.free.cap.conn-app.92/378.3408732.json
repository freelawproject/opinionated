In this case, the judgment debtors were, at one time, represented by counsel who filed a general denial on their behalf, in the foreign state, without challenging that court\u2019s personal or subject matter jurisdiction. Suing in this state to enforce the subsequent default judgment, the judgment creditor filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted despite the judgment debtors\u2019 claim that the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction to render a judgment against them. The judgment debtors have appealed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision sets out the relevant factual history. The defendants, Golf Marketing, LLC, Golf Marketing, Inc., Golf Marketing, Incorporated, Golf Marketing Worldwide, LLC, and Kevin Kolenda, agreed to insure a \u201ckick for cash\u201d competition in which someone could win $100,000 for kicking a thirty-five yard field goal during the halftime of a 1999 college football game in Pasadena, California, between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Washington. After someone performed this feat, the plaintiff, the Regents of the University of California, asked the defendants to make the stipulated payment. They refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">As the court also found, \u201c[t]he plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants in the Superior Court of California. The defendants filed an answer to the complaint containing a general denial and nine affirmative defenses, none of which challenged the California court\u2019s competence or jurisdiction. Subsequently, counsel for the defendants filed a \u2018motion to be relieved as counsel,\u2019 which was served on the defendants and granted by the court. Following the withdrawal of the defendants\u2019 attorney, the plaintiff filed its first amended complaint. On November 19, 2001, the California court found that \u2018the defendants . . . [had] been regularly served with process, [and had] failed to appear and answer the plaintiffs first amended complaint . . . .\u2019 The [California] court entered a \u2018judgment by court after default\u2019 against the defendants in the amount of $346,773.23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The defendants argued at trial that the California judgment was not enforceable because it was rendered by a court that did not have personal jurisdiction over them. The trial court rejected this argument. It concluded that, under California law, once an unconditional appearance had been filed on the defendants\u2019 behalf, by an attorney, they had waived their right to litigate any issue with respect to personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Without contesting the accuracy of the court\u2019s description of the factual and legal history of this case, the defendants maintain that the court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-49, summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . A litigant challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is entitled to plenary review of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>88 Conn. App. 731, 735, 871 A.2d 1051 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Our plenary review of the well reasoned decision of the court persuades us that the defendants\u2019 argument for reversal of the court\u2019s judgment cannot be sustained. Most of their appellate brief is devoted to a discussion of personal jurisdiction under California\u2019s \u201clong arm statute.\u201d That discussion is devoid, however, of any analysis of the decision of the court with respect to the role of waiver in the law of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">This court\u2019s recent restatement of the law of enforcement of foreign judgments unconditionally supports the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue of personal jurisdiction in this case. In <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 735-39, we reiterated the proposition that, under the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution, \u201c[t]he judgment of another state must be presumed valid, and the burden of proving a lack of jurisdiction rests heavily upon the assailant. ... To determine whether a foreign court lacked jurisdiction, we look to the law of the foreign state.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.) Id., 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In this case, the defendants\u2019 brief lacks any analysis that would shed doubt on the court\u2019s description of the California courts\u2019 interpretation of the applicable provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure. As the court noted, under California law, \u201ca party who seeks relief on any basis other than a motion to quash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>for lack of personal jurisdiction will be deemed to have made a general appearance and waived all objections to defects in service, process, or personal jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DIAL 800 </em>v. <em>Fesbinder, </em>118 Cal. App. 4th 32, 52, 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 711, modified, 2004 Cal. App. LEXIS 683 (May 5, 2004). \u201cAn appearance is general if the party contests the merits of the case or raises other than jurisdictional objections.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sparks Construction, Inc., </em>114 Cal. App. 4th 1135, 1145, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 446 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The memorandum of decision issued by the trial court comprehensively addresses the relevant issues arising out of the plaintiffs action to enforce its California, judgment. The court properly concluded that, in the California court, under California law, the defendants waived any claim of lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-607 provides: \u201cThe right of a judgment creditor to proceed by an action on the judgment or a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint instead of proceeding under sections 52-604 to 52-609, inclusive, remains unimpaired.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
