We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Edward Geyer and the defendant were acquaintances for many years. Approximately two weeks prior to February 27, 2002, Geyer and a friend were at a bar in Bridgeport. The defendant and Geyer\u2019s friend got into a fight. The defendant subsequently went to Geyer\u2019s house and, in the presence of Geyer\u2019s family, angrily confronted Geyer about the incident. After the defendant challenged Geyer to a fight, Geyer struck the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">During the early morning hours of February 27, 2002, Geyer and some of his friends were socializing at another bar in Bridgeport. The defendant was present at the bar, and he and Geyer observed one another. At approximately 1 a.m., Geyer and his friends left the bar. They walked toward Geyer\u2019s automobile, which was parked on a side street near the bar. Suddenly, the defendant came out of the bushes and pointed a pistol at Geyer. The defendant stated: \u201c[W]hat now? What now? What now?\u201d Geyer raised his hands. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>dant pulled the trigger on his pistol twice, but the pistol did not discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Geyer ran in the direction of police officers who were on duty near the entrance of the bar. As he fled, he heard the sound of gunshots and he ducked from the bullets that he heard \u201cwhizzing\u201d by him. Geyer did not sustain any bodily injuries and later identified the defendant, who was in police custody, as the shooter. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The defendant first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction of reckless endangerment in the first degree and of carrying a pistol without a permit. We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Our role in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. \u201cFirst, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>91 Conn. App. 509, 512-13, 881 A.2d 1039 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant argues that the verdict rests \u201con a factual impossibility . . . The state presented evidence from Geyer and Officers David Neary and Christopher Robinson of the Bridgeport police department concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct on February 27, 2002. Neary and Robinson were on duty outside of the bar at the time of the incident in question. Neary testified that he observed the defendant leave the bar and drive away and that approximately fifteen to thirty seconds later, he heard the sound of gunshots. Neary pursued an individual running from the scene of the shooting and identified that individual as the same person he had observed leaving the bar. After Geyer identified the defendant as the shooter, Neary and his fellow officers arrived at the defendant\u2019s residence. Neary testified that he observed the same automobile that the suspect had been driving outside of the bar and observed a gun holster as well as a windshield advertisement from the bar in the automobile. While in the defendant\u2019s residence, Neary found articles of clothing that matched the clothing worn by the individual that he had observed leaving the bar and fleeing from the scene of the shooting. Robinson testified that he had observed the individual, matching the defendant\u2019s description, leaving the bar. Robinson testified that he had heard the sound of gunshots fewer than five minutes thereafter and that Neary had pursued the fleeing suspect on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Geyer testified as to the events that transpired prior to and during the shooting incident. He testified that he and the defendant had a disagreement prior to February 27, 2002. He testified that he and the defendant made eye contact in the bar prior to the shooting. Geyer testified that as he made his way to his automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>near the bar, the defendant jumped out of the bushes brandishing a handgun. The defendant addressed Geyer and twice pulled the trigger, but the handgun did not discharge. Finally, Geyer testified that as he fled from the defendant, he heard gunshots \u201cwhizzing\u201d by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The defendant asks this court to compare Geyer\u2019s testimony with Neary\u2019s testimony. The defendant argues that the time lines of events described by each witness cannot be reconciled. The defendant argues, essentially, that Neaiy\u2019s testimony that the defendant drove away from the bar less than thirty seconds before the shooting occurred precludes a finding that the defendant could have performed the criminal actions described by Geyer and precludes a finding of guilt. The defendant raised those arguments before the jury in an attempt to cast doubt on the state\u2019s case. Those efforts failed. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit because the jury\u2019s role was to weigh conflicting evidence. The jury was free to credit the testimony of any of the state\u2019s witnesses, in whole or in part, and to disregard the testimony of any of the state\u2019s witnesses, in whole or in part. See <em>State </em>v. Stewart, 77 Conn. App. 393, 400, 822 A.2d 392, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 906, 831 A.2d 253 (2003). It would not have been unreasonable for the jury to find that the testimony of Geyer and Robinson concerning the timing of events, rather than that of Neary, more accurately reflected the timing of events leading to the shooting. Geyer\u2019s testimony, whether corroborated or countered by that of another witness, provided a sufficient basis for finding that the defendant followed Geyer out of the bar, lay in wait for Geyer and later fired gunshots at Geyer as Geyer fled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant also challenges the credibility of Geyer\u2019s testimony. The defendant apparently argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the jury should have discredited Geyer\u2019s testimony at trial because, in a statement he gave to an investigator for the defense prior to trial, Geyer expressed uncertainty that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime. At trial, Geyer disavowed that statement. Geyer testified that he had lied to the investigator because he was motivated by greed to do so. Geyer also testified that in other statements he gave prior to trial and in his trial testimony in which he identified the defendant, he was telling the truth. The defendant also argues that Geyer was a paid informant who testified against him because of self-interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Those challenges to Geyer\u2019s credibility were certainly fodder for the jury\u2019s consideration, and the record reflects that the defendant raised those arguments during cross-examination and closing argument. The defendant\u2019s efforts to discredit Geyer failed. It is the jury\u2019s province, not ours, to evaluate Geyer\u2019s credibility. \u201cThis court will not revisit credibility determinations. Whether [a witness\u2019] testimony [is] believable [is] a question solely for the jury. It is . . . the absolute right and responsibility of the jury to weigh conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>90 Conn. App. 111, 132, 876 A.2d 547, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 926, 888 A.2d 1248 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Additionally, Neary testified that he observed the defendant pass in front of his police cruiser as the defendant left the bar prior to the shooting and observed the defendant running from the scene of the shooting. The defendant challenges the weight, if any, that the juiy could have afforded Neary\u2019s identification of him as the suspect Neary observed running from the scene. The defendant suggests that the distance between Neary and the suspect, poor lighting conditions on the street and other factors that came into play at the time of Neary\u2019s observation of the suspect cast serious doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>on the accuracy of Neary\u2019s identification. The defendant raised those arguments before the jury. On the basis of our review of Neary\u2019s testimony, as well as other evidence presented at trial, we conclude that it was not unreasonable for the jury to credit Neary\u2019s observations, as well as his identification of the defendant. In any event, the state presented identification evidence from Neary and Geyer, and, as we have stated, Geyer\u2019s testimony provided a sufficient evidentiary foundation on which the jury could have based its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The defendant also argues that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s finding that he had violated the terms of his probation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The defendant bases his claim on his contention that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction of reckless endangerment in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit. He argues that the evidence demonstrated the physical impossibility of his having committed the crimes of which he was convicted and that he was inadequately identified by Geyer and Neary. The court relied on the defendant\u2019s conviction in finding him in violation of probation and in determining that the beneficial aspects of probation were no longer being served. We already have rejected the defendant\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence in part I. It is not disputed that one of the conditions of his probation was that he not violate any of the criminal laws of this state or that the conduct underlying the crimes occurred during the defendant\u2019s probationary period. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the record did not contain sufficient proof for the court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had committed acts that violated the terms of his probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cator, </em>256 Conn. 785, 811-12, 781 A.2d 285 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>(2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 80, 327 A.2d 556 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of the crimes of attempt to commit murder and attempt to commit assault in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of incarceration of nine years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> Although the defendant did not preserve his claim, we review the claim because it implicates his constitutional right not to be convicted on insufficient proof. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 Conn. App. 255, 281, 797 A.2d 616, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> Insofar as the defendant challenges the conviction for carrying a pistol without a permit, he stipulated at trial that he had not been issued a firearm permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
