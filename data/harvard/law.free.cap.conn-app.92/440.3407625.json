We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On November 20, 1998, the defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with the plea, the court sentenced the defendant to a total term of six years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen months, and ten years probation. A special condition of the defendant\u2019s probation was that he attend sex offender evaluation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendant began his probation on February 18, 2000, residing with his parents and siblings. The defendant\u2019s wife and their three children lived in a separate residence. On the morning of September 4, 2003, the defendant appeared at his wife\u2019s residence in connection with the repossession of her television.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The wife previously had entered into a written lease agreement with Rent-A-Center, Inc., for the television, which provided that if she failed to make timely payments, Rent-A-Center, Inc., retained the right to repossess it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When she defaulted under the lease agreement, Rent-A-Center, Inc., sent her letters demanding that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>return the television. The defendant called Rent-A-Center, Inc., and spoke with the manager in order to come to an agreement about the television. According to the defendant\u2019s wife, the defendant and the manager agreed that she would return the television and that Rent-A-Center, Inc., would provide a letter crediting her with the amount of money that she already had paid toward it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As part of the agreement, Rent-A-Center, Inc., would repossess the television at 10 a.m. on September 4,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On the morning of September 4, 2003, two Rent-A-Center, Inc., employees, Julio Rivera and Anthony DoCarmo, were late in arriving at the wife\u2019s residence. In the interim, she had fallen asleep with two of her children while putting them down for their naps. The court credited Rivera\u2019s testimony that he and DoCarmo had knocked on the front door, received no answer and then proceeded to the back door where they were met by the defendant. The defendant allowed Rivera and DoCarmo to go into the living room to repossess the television. The wife claimed that the defendant was not in her apartment on the morning of September 4, 2004. Rather, she asked a neighbor to call her husband after awakening from her nap, coming downstairs and seeing Rivera and DoCarmo in her living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">After discovering Rivera and DoCarmo, the defendant\u2019s wife demanded to know if the men had brought the letter of credit. When Rivera responded that they had not, she told them they would have to get such a letter before she would hand over the television. Rivera and DoCarmo explained to her that she did not need a letter of credit because the credit she demanded already was part of the company policy of Rent-A-Center, Inc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Rivera and DoCarmo continued to unplug cables from the television at which point she asked the men to leave her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The defendant appeared in the living room with a pit bull dog on a leash and goaded the dog in a threatening manner toward the two men. Rivera told the defendant that he would call the police if the defendant continued that course of conduct. The defendant responded, \u201cGo ahead, call the police,\u201d whereupon Rivera dialed 911. While Rivera was on the telephone, the defendant grabbed him from behind and pushed him out of the front door. Soon thereafter, Steven Flaherty, an officer with the Waterbury police department, arrived at the apartment and arrested the defendant on two counts of assault and one count each of breach of the peace and threatening. Flaherty also notified the defendant\u2019s probation officer, George N. Tzepos, who then applied for a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest on a charge of violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">At the first phase of the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had committed threatening in the second degree and breach of the peace in the second degree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that the testimony of Rivera was credible, that the defendant had used the dog in a threatening manner and that the defendant had no right to defend his wife because neither she nor the children were being threatened. The court thus determined that the defendant had violated the law without justification and therefore had violated his probation. At the second phase of the defendant\u2019s probation revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>cation hearing, the court determined that he had not complied with sex offender treatment, and, thus, the beneficial purposes of his probation were no longer being served. Accordingly, the court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to three years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As a preliminary issue, we note that the record before us is inadequate and that we therefore may decline to review the claims raised on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 64-1. In cases in which the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 have not been followed, this court has declined to review the claims raised on appeal due to the lack of an adequate record. See <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Mongillo, </em>67 Conn. App. 799, 801-802, 789 A.2d 547 (2002). Nonetheless, this court may review an appellant\u2019s claim as long as there exists \u201ca sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Bank of America, FSB </em>v. <em>Franco, </em>57 Conn. App. 688, 691 n.1, 751 A.2d 394 (2000). Here, the defendant filed an unsigned transcript of the court\u2019s ruling that provides a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court\u2019s finding for us to review his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly determined that he violated a condition of his probation. One of the general conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation was that he not violate any criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state or territory. The defendant\u2019s probation violation was premised on his arrest on charges of threatening in the second degree and breach of the peace in the second degree in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tion of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-62<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 53a-181,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> respectively. The defendant, however, contends that because Rivera and DoCarmo were criminal trespassers, the court improperly concluded that he was not justified in using reasonable force in defense of his wife\u2019s premises. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cA revocation of probation hearing has two distinct components and two purposes. A factual determination by a trial court as to whether a probationer has violated a condition of probation must first be made. If a violation is found, a court must next determine whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served. . . . Since there are two distinct components of the revocation hearing, our standard of review differs depending on which part of the hearing we are reviewing.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>256 Conn. 412, 425, 773 A.2d 931 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We first review whether the court properly found that the defendant violated a condition of his probation. \u201cA trial court initially makes a factual determination of whether a condition of probation has been violated. In making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence. . . . Our review is limited to whether such a finding was clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The defendant relies on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-20, which permits the use of reasonable force by a person who is privileged to be on the premises and who \u201creasonably believes [such force] to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission ... of a criminal trespass . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order for that section to apply in this case, the victims, Rivera and DoCarmo, would need to have been criminal trespassers pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107, 53a-108 and 53a-109.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court concluded, to the contrary, that Rivera and DoCarmo were not on the premises as criminal trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The question of whether Rivera and DoCarmo were criminal trespassers is one of fact for the trial court to determine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>203 Conn. 466, 473, 525 A.2d 498 (1987) (noting that court\u2019s conclusion that victim was not criminal trespasser was based on factual findings).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court\u2019s determination that Rivera and DoCarmo were not criminal trespassers therefore was based on its factual findings that they entered the wife\u2019s residence with the sole purpose of repossessing her television. In addition, the court noted that neither Rivera nor DoCarmo had been charged with criminal trespass following their altercation with the defendant. In light of those factual findings, the court\u2019s conclusion that the victims\u2019 conduct did not constitute criminal trespass was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendant also claims that because he was not convicted of assault in the third degree, his conduct in removing Rivera from the premises was reasonable and therefore lawful under \u00a7 53a-20. Rivera, however, was not a criminal trespasser; therefore, \u00a7 53a-20 does not apply. Because the court determined that Rivera was not a criminal trespasser, the defendant was not justified in using any force, reasonable or not, in expelling Rivera from the premises to defend against the removal of property without threat to a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Furthermore, criminal trespass requires, at a minimum, that a person enter or remain on the premises of another person \u201cwith the knowledge that he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>privileged or licensed to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 555, 564, 398 A.2d 1197 (1978); see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107, 53a-108, 53a-109.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Noting that requirement, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination that Rivera and DoCarmo were not criminal trespassers finds support in the facts. The court therefore properly determined that the defendant was in violation of probation because he violated the laws of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court abused its discretion by revoking his probation and sentencing him to three years incarceration. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly considered his discharge from sex offender treatment in determining that his probation should be revoked. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In regard to that claim, we review the second phase of the defendant\u2019s revocation of probation hearing, namely, whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u201cThe standard of review of an order revoking probation is whether the trial court abused its discretion; if it appears that the trial court was reasonably satisfied that the terms of probation had been violated, and, impliedly, that the beneficial purposes of probation were no longer being served, then the order must stand. ... In making this determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>255 Conn. 830, 844, 769 A.2d 698 (2001). \u201c[E]xcept where an abuse of discretion is clearly shown, the conclusion of a trial court should be affirmed so long as it is a reasonable one on the basis of the evidence adduced and the inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>85 Conn. App. 7, 14, 855 A.2d 1006, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 937, 861 A.2d 510 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts, which are necessary to resolve the issue. On February 26, 2004, after determining that the defendant had violated his probation, the court held a sentencing hearing to determine if his probation should be revoked. At the hearing, all three of the defendant\u2019s former probation officers testified that the defendant had not satisfactorily met the condition of his probation requiring attendance at sex offender evaluation and treatment. On the basis of our review of the record, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">According to the defendant\u2019s first probation officer, Renu Bains, the defendant had accumulated six unexcused absences, been tardy numerous times and refused to take responsibility for his offense, as required by the defendant\u2019s first treatment center, The Connection, Inc. According to the defendant\u2019s second probation officer, Keith R. Fumiss, the defendant had attendance and tardiness problems and was dismptive to the group during treatment sessions. On September 12, 2001, The Connection, Inc., discharged the defendant from its treatment program because of his unexcused absences, tardiness, financial arrearage and failure to accept responsibility for his crime.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant then was transferred to his second treatment center, The Sterling Center. Although the defendant initially was compliant with his new program, the defendant\u2019s third probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>officer, Tzepos, later received reports from The Sterling Center regarding the defendant\u2019s negative attitude, unexcused absences and financial arrearage. Finally, The Sterling Center discharged the defendant due to his September 4, 2003 arrest, poor attendance, unacceptable attitude toward therapy and continued refusal to accept responsibility for his prior sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In his brief, the defendant contends that the court abused its discretion by relying on his discharge from The Sterling Center as the basis for revoking his probation. Specifically, the defendant claims that the only reason he was discharged from The Sterling Center\u2019s sexual offender treatment was because of his arrest on September 4, 2003, and therefore the beneficial purposes of his probation were still being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We find the defendant\u2019s argument without merit. On the basis of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s three probation officers, the court reasonably could have found that the defendant repeatedly violated the condition of his probation requiring sex offender treatment and therefore that the beneficial purposes of probation no longer were being served. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that he was not properly notified of the alleged violations of probation in violation of his due process rights. Specifically, the defendant contends that the court did not notify him that it would use his entire probation history, including sex offender treatment, in determining whether the beneficial purposes of his probation were being served. The defendant claims that had he known that, he would have subpoenaed therapists from The Sterling Center to give an assessment of his progress. We find the defendant\u2019s claim unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The defendant admits that his claim may not have been properly preserved for appellate review and seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We agree that the record is adequate for review and that the claim is of constitutional magnitude; therefore, we must determine whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201cProbation revocation proceedings fall within the protections guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution. . . . Probation itself is a conditional liberty and a privilege that, once granted, is a constitutionally protected interest. . . . The revocation proceeding must comport with the basic requirements of due process because termination of that privilege results in a loss of liberty. . . . [T]he minimum due process requirements for revocation of [probation] include written notice of the claimed [probation] violation, disclosure to the [probationer] of the evidence against him, the opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses in most instances, a neutral hearing body, and a written statement as to the evidence for and reasons for [probation] violation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>73 Conn. App. 781, 789, 809 A.2d 1132 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 937, 815 A.2d 137 (2003). \u201cAt [a probation violation] hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which such defendant is alleged to have violated the conditions of such defendant\u2019s probation or conditional discharge . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Maye, </em>70 Conn. App. 828, 838, 799 A.2d 1136 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">First, the defendant had ample notice of when his probation revocation hearing would occur. On December 23, 2003, the court stated that the probation revocation hearing would begin on January 30, 2004. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>defendant therefore had more than one month to subpoena his witnesses to show that he was amenable to continuing his treatment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, the defendant had notice that the court planned to hold a sentencing hearing during which it would hear testimony about his probation history. On February 23, 2003, following the first phase of the defendant\u2019s probation hearing, the court stated that it would hold a sentencing hearing on February 26, 2003, to hear further evidence regarding whether the beneficial purposes of probation were being served. The defendant was thus on notice that the court wanted to hear evidence regarding his treatment at The Sterling Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A court can rely on the defendant\u2019s entire probationary history in determining whether the rehabilitative purpose of probation is no longer being served. In this case, the defendant was given the opportunity to challenge all of the alleged violations at his probation revocation hearing. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant received adequate notice regarding all of the grounds on which he ultimately was found to have violated his probation. See id., 839-40. Thus, a constitutional violation does not clearly exist, and the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge ....

At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which such defendant is alleged to have violated the conditions of such defendant\u2019s probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that such defendant has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in such defendant\u2019s own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u201c(b) If such violation is established, the court may ...

That defense, however, is available only if the victim is determined to be a criminal trespasser. The question of whether the victim is a criminal trespasser is a question of fact and therefore subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 473.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\"> See footnote 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> After <em>the </em>defendant was discharged from The Connection, Inc., in 2001, Fumiss applied for a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest on the basis of that discharge. The court pretried the defendant on the violation of probation charge and asked Fumiss to continue supervising the defendant pending the disposition of the case. After the defendant was transferred to a second treatment center, The Sterling Center, the court initially determined that he had been compliant with his new program and disposed of his case by continuing the probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> When defense counsel complained that none of the service providers at The Sterling Center had testified about the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>prospects, the court responded that the defendant had had ample time to subpoena them because \u201ceveryone knew about this hearing for months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
