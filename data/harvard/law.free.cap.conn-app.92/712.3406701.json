In a series of interlocking statutes, our legislature has recognized that, at the time of their retirement from state service, state employees are entitled to compensation for accrued, unused vacation time and to longevity payments. In this case, we must decide in what manner the legislature intended these entitlements to be reflected in retirement income.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 5-162 (a), a portion of the State Employees Retirement Act, provides that \u201c[t]he retirement income for which a member is eligible shall be determined from his retirement date, years of state service and base salary . ...\u201d As defined by General Statutes \u00a7 5-162 (b) (2), \u201cbase salary\u201d is the average annual salary received by a retiree for his three highest-paid years of state service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Annual salary is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 5-154 (h) as any payment for state service, including longevity payments and payments for accrued vacation time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[SJtate service\u2019 includes a period equivalent to accrued vacation time for which payment is made under section 5-252.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-154 (m) (6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The issue in this case is whether, in the calculation of retirement income, accrued vacation time and longevity payments should be counted as additions to \u201cstate service\u201d or as additions to \u201cbase salary.\u201d The trial court agreed with the defendant state employees retirement commission (commission) that they should be deemed to be additions to state service. We disagree. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. Pursuant to the 2003 Early Retirement Incentive Program; Public Acts 2003, No. 03-02; the plaintiffs, former assistant attorneys general Richard K. Greenberg and Donald M. Longley, retired from active employment with the state on June 1, 2003. Each retired as a vested Tier I, Plan B member of the state employees retirement system. Accordingly, the act and related statutes govern the calculation of their retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 5-162, a retiree\u2019s income, for retirement purposes, is determined by his average covered earnings for his three highest paid years of state service. The plaintiffs\u2019 three highest paid years of state service were June 1, 2000, through May 31, 2001; June 1, 2001, through May 31, 2002; and June 1, 2002, through May 31, 2003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">During each of these years, the plaintiffs received two longevity payments, and, subsequent to retirement, each plaintiff also received payment for his accrued but unused vacation time and a final, prorated longevity payment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When they retired, their accrued vacation time also was recognized for a second purpose, as state service, in addition to their actual state service of more than thirty years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 5-154 (m) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In their pension applications, the plaintiffs asked for their base salaries to be calculated by including their longevity payments and their payments for accrued vacation time as part of their regular salary for their final year of state service. They recognized that this salary calculation might be subject to reduction if it resulted in an annual salary of more than 130 percent of the average of their two previous years\u2019 covered earnings. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-162 (b) (2). Apart from such a reduction, however, they maintained that their base salary should be calculated by including the vacation and longevity payments in their annual salary during the last year of state employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The commission denied the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers for relief. It assigned dispositive meaning to the temporal constraints imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 5-162 and 5-154. In particular, it noted that \u201cbase salary ... is the average salary received for the three highest paid <em>years of state ser</em>vice\u201d and that subsection (n) of \u00a7 5-154 defines a year of state service as twelve consecutive months.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the commission, a lump sum payment for accrued vacation time cannot be factored into the final year\u2019s salary directly, as the plaintiffs contend. To do so would impermissibly add <em>time </em>to the calculation of a retiree\u2019s three highest paid years of state service because, under \u00a7 5-154 (m), state service is defined as including \u201caccrued vacation time,\u201d and, under \u00a7 5-154 (n), a year of state service can include only twelve calendar months.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The commission took the position, therefore, that compliance with the applicable statutory mandates requires recalculation of a retiree\u2019s final three years of service. This recalculation involves adding the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>of months of service to which a retiree is entitled by virtue of his accrued vacation time to the final year of his state employment, at his then prevailing salary, and subtracting the same number of months of service at the beginning of the three year period of state employment, presumably at a lower salary. In the view of the commission, this methodology gives the plaintiffs the benefit of credit for their accrued vacation time and longevity without impairing the underlying time constraints that it views as embedded in the structure of the retirement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Because the plaintiffs disagreed with the commission\u2019s compensation formula, each of them filed a petition for a declaratory ruling challenging the commission\u2019s formula and requesting recalculation of his benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal. The plaintiffs then filed the present appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In their appeal to this court, the plaintiffs seek plenary review of the declaratory ruling issued by the commission and upheld by the trial court. In their view, the trial court (1) improperly deferred to the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling and (2) improperly affirmed the commission\u2019s calculation of their \u201cbase salary.\u201d The proper construction of \u00a7 5-162 raises a novel question of law on which the existing precedents give little guidance. We are persuaded, however, that the plaintiffs should prevail, and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">' The first issue in this appeal is whether the trial court applied the proper standard of review in its analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling. The parties agree that, because there was no evidentiary dispute, the petitions for a declaratory ruling raise pure questions of law. The parties also agree that the legal question with which the commission was presented has not been previously examined by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The plaintiffs claim, however, that the trial court, instead of reviewing these legal issues de novo, improperly afforded deference to the commission\u2019s conclusions of law. In dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the trial court relied not only on its own interpretation of the act, but also on the unanimity of the commission\u2019s interpretation and its long-standing and consistent application of that interpretation. We agree with the plaintiffs that the court should have examined the issues independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>257 Conn. 128, 137, 778 A.2d 7 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Concededly, the construction and application of \u00a7\u00a7 5-162 (b) and 5-154 (h) present issues of law not heretofore considered by the courts. Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs are entitled to plenary review of the claims they raised at trial. See, e.g., <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>275 Conn. 464, 474, 881 A.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">CONSTRUCTION OF GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7\u00a7 5-162 AND 5-154</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Under \u00a7 5-162 (a), retirement income is determined by \u201cyears of state service\u201d and \u201cbase salary.\u201d The principal issue in this case is whether, subject only to the 130 percent salary cap imposed by \u00a7 5-162 (b), the full dollar value of accrued vacation arid final longevity payments received by a potential retiree should be added to \u201csalary\u201d received in the final year of state service for the purpose of calculating \u201cbase salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">When interpreting a statute, we look first to its text to ascertain whether its meaning is plain. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the parties would construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u00a7 5-162 differently, each maintains that the State Employees Retirement Act is clear and unambiguous. We find the web of statutory references and cross-references that inform the calculation of retirement pensions more problematic. To decide whether the commission\u2019s pension formula violates the statutory scheme of the act, \u201cwe seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli Kitchen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>268 Conn. 222, 230-31, 842 A.2d 1089 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The trial court agreed with the commission that, although accrued vacation time and longevity payments are \u201csalary,\u201d these payments cannot be added <em>directly </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 annual salary for their final year of state service. In the commission\u2019s view, to do so would \u201cadd time\u201d to that year beyond the twelve month limitation imposed by \u00a7 5-154 (n). This argument is premised on the applicability of \u00a7 5-154 (m) (6), which provides that \u201c \u2018state service\u2019 includes <em>a period </em>equivalent to accrued vacation time for which payment is made under section 5-252 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commission argues that this additional \u201cperiod\u201d cannot simply be added at the end of a retiree\u2019s state service without running afoul of \u00a7 5-154 (n), which defines \u201cyear of state service\u201d to mean \u201cany period of twelve consecutive calendar months of state service, <em>but no month shall be counted in more than one year . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Accordingly, the commission has adopted a formula, which the court endorsed, that adjusted each plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>three highest paid years of state service to include the payment for and the temporal equivalent of his accrued vacation time and longevity payments and to subtract the same number of months and prior salary from the first of the last three years of his state service. Ordinarily, this formula is beneficial to retirees because it substitutes salary at the highest rate for salary at the third highest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The court not only agreed with the logic of the commission\u2019s position but stated additional reasons for dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. It noted that the commission\u2019s decision was unanimous with respect to the present appeals and reflected a statutory interpretation of long standing. Finally, it doubted that the legislature would have intended to reward the failure to use vacation time with a substantial addition to a retirement pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The plaintiffs read the statutes differently. In their view, \u00a7 5-154 (m) is relevant to the calculation of \u201cyears of state service\u201d in \u00a7 5-162 (a), but not to the calculation of \u201cbase salary.\u201d We agree. We find it significant that \u00a7 5-162 (b), which defines the operative terms of \u201cbase salary,\u201d does not include a cross reference to \u00a7 5-154 (m). It is also significant that, while the commission and the trial court take the view that accrued vacation payments and longevity payments should be treated alike, \u00a7 5-154 (m) does not refer to longevity payments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 5-154 (m) cannot, therefore, be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The only other statutory basis relied on by the commission for its formulaic attribution of service equivalents to the payments received by the plaintiffs is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>reference to state service in the statutory definition of salary. Pursuant to \u00a7 5-154 (h), \u201csalary\u201d is \u201cany payment, including longevity payments and payments for accrued vacation time . . . <em>for state service </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the commission, this \u201cplain language . . . demonstrates that state service includes longevity payments . . . .\u201d We are not persuaded. The commission\u2019s interpretation results in the definition of salary subsuming and rendering superfluous the explicit definition of state service, provided by the legislature, in \u00a7 5-154 (m) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The flaw in the commission\u2019s analysis is, however, more basic. The commission seems to take the position that, because \u00a7 5-154 (m) permits a retiree to use accrued vacation time to extend the length of his state service, accrued vacation time cannot be used for anything else. That is not what the statute says. Indeed, the commission does not deny that the plaintiffs in this case properly received both monetary payments and service credits as compensation for their unused vacation time. Similarly, subject to the 130 percent cap stated in \u00a7 5-162 (b), the plaintiffs are entitled to have their accrued vacation time factored into their retirement income.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We are equally unpersuaded by the trial court\u2019s reliance on the commission\u2019s rulings in this case because they reflect a unanimous policy of long standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Although the commission is persuaded that its calculation of retirement income properly reflects accrued vacation time while simultaneously \u201censurfing] that [only] the three highest paid years of state service are captured and averaged,\u201d at best, its reading of the governing statutory provisions is highly technical. The adoption of a commission policy that depends on a reading of a statute that is hypertechnical would better have been manifested by promulgating a regulation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>would have given notice to potential retirees of the commission\u2019s view of unused vacation time. With notice, the commission might have been asked, for example, to consider the significance of the fact that, for those state employees who receive no raises during their three highest paid years, the commission\u2019s policy would have provided no benefit under \u00a7 5-154 (h) for vacation time accruals.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The decision of the commission and the judgment of the trial court reflect concern with the propriety of a public policy that encourages a state employee to accrue significant periods of unused vacation time. As previously noted, each of the plaintiffs has a statutory right to receive credit for such accrued vacation time by a direct payment and by additions to their service time. As we construe \u00a7 5-162, they also have a statutory right to factor accrued vacation time into their retirement income. Perhaps the legislature should rethink this policy. It is not in our province to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to remand the matter to the commission for recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 retirement income.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-162 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The retirement income for which a member is eligible shall be determined from his retirement date, years of state service and base salary ....</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201c(b) As used in this section . . .
