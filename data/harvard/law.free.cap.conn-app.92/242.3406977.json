We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The court made the following findings of fact that are relevant to the petitioner\u2019s appeal. At the time the petitioner pleaded guilty, on November 21,1991, he was charged in three separate informations with possession of a weapon in a correctional institution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-174a, two counts of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c and violation of probation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. Given the serious nature of the crimes with which the petitioner had been charged, he faced a lengthy prison term, if convicted, and possibly the death penalty. The trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>thoroughly canvassed the petitioner. In February, 1992, Judge Ronan sentenced the petitioner to thirty years in prison, pursuant to a plea agreement trial counsel had negotiated with the state. The habeas court further found that the petitioner\u2019s plea was made knowingly and voluntarily with the assistance of competent counsel. The petitioner had sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences of his plea. The court concluded that the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was valid. The court denied the amended petition and denied the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). The standard of review of a habeas court\u2019s denial of a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>tion for a writ of habeas corpus that is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is well settled. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a habeas petitioner generally must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \u201cFor ineffectiveness claims resulting from guilty pleas, we apply the standard set forth in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) .... To satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>82 Conn. App. 701, 705-706, 846 A.2d 889 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Following our careful review of the record, including Judge Ronan\u2019s plea canvass of the petitioner and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal. We cannot conclude that the issues presented in this appeal are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 829, 831, 779 A.2d 165, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 905, 782 A.2d 138 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
