We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The facts of the underlying criminal case are set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>69 Conn. App. 96, 793 A.2d 290, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 930, 798 A.2d 972 (2002), in which we affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). Briefly, on June 28, 1996, the petitioner and four other men were involved in an altercation with the victim, David Laureano, whom the defendant fatally shot. When the police apprehended the petitioner, he shouted that he had not shot or killed anyone. Forensic tests revealed the presence of lead on the petitioner\u2019s hands. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>supra, 97-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">\u201cOn appeal, we review a habeas court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard of review .... [WJhether the representation a defendant received at trial was constitutionally inadequate is a mixed question of law and fact. ... As such, that question requires plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cThe petitioner\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is assured by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. In <em>Strickland </em>v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court established that for a petitioner to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of [the] conviction. . . . That requires the petitioner to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable. ... A court deciding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim need not address the question of counsel\u2019s performance, if it is easier to dispose of the claim on the ground of insufficient prejudice. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u201cWe cannot, in a habeas corpus appeal, disturb underlying historical facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The habeas court judge, as the trier of the facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>88 Conn. App. 169, 172-73, 868 A.2d 125, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 941, 875 A.2d 43 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The petitioner alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate a psychiatric defense fully, failed to notify the state of the psychiatric defense and failed to present a psychiatric defense on the petitioner\u2019s behalf to mitigate the charges against him. The petitioner claimed that he suffered from extreme emotional disturbance and that if such evidence had been presented at the criminal trial, the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>would have been different. The habeas court found that counsel was aware of the petitioner\u2019s history of psychiatric illness and that he had discussed the condition with several psychiatrists, some of whom had examined the petitioner. On the basis of his discussions with the psychiatrists and the state\u2019s evidence, counsel made a tactical decision not to present a psychiatric defense. Alleging a psychiatric defense would amount to an admission that the petitioner had shot the victim, and there was no good medical basis on which to assert the defense. Counsel, therefore, elected to attack the credibility of some of the state\u2019s witnesses. The court found that counsel had some success in impeaching the state\u2019s witnesses and concluded that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On the basis of our review of the record, including the court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the court properly found that the petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of counsel, as he failed to \u201covercome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
