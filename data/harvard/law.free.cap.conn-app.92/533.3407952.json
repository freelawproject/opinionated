Fawcett, </em>supervisory assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Jonathan C. Benedict, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Gerard P.

Following an evidentiary hearing, the habeas court dismissed the petition. The court also denied the petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We have reviewed the issues raised by the petitioner and the record of the proceeding before the court, as well as the court\u2019s oral decision. We conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues raised relating to his petition for certification to appeal are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). As the petitioner has not satisfied any of those criteria, he has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal reflects an abuse of discretion. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-16\"> The petitioner previously was convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a (a), two counts of attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a) and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>237 Conn. 518, 679 A.2d 902 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
