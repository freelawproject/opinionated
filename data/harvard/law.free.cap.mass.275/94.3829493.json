There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was a housewife living with her husband and that she sustained injuries. The finding was for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The trial judge granted requests of the plaintiff to the effect that she was entitled (10) to damages which would \u201c fairly compensate her for all loss and injuries suffered by her as a result of the accident,\u201d (11) to \u201cfair compensation for all the pain and suffering, physical and mental, which she has endured or will endure as a result of the accident,\u201d (15) \u201cto compensation for mental suffering, nervousness and hysteria, resulting from, and jar to her nervous system due to the trauma received at the time of the accident,\u201d (16) to compensation \u201c for the natural and probable consequences of an injury caused by negligence, though the precise form in which it resulted was unperceived,\u201d and (17) \u201c to . . . compensation for probable impairment of future earning capacity.\u201d There was no error in refusing request 14 to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled \u201c to fair compensation for all loss of earning capacity resulting from the accident, and this irrespective of whether at the time of the accident she was actually profitably employed.\u201d The ground of this request was covered with sufficient fulness by request 17 which was granted. There is nothing in the record to indicate that all rights of the plaintiff were not fully protected in this respect. <em>Millmore </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>198 Mass. 370. <em>Koch v. Lynch, </em>247 Mass. 459. Request 13, to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred by her as a result of the accident, was too broad and was rightly denied. It would include counsel fees and other disbursements not recoverable under the laws. <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>11 Allen, 73, 77. <em>Newton Rubber Works </em>v. <em>De Las Casas, </em>182 Mass. 436, 438. Request 12 is treated as waived because not argued and request 18 was waived at the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
