L., c. 152, \u00a7 30, was heard by Mr. Parks, at the rooms of the Board, State House, Boston, Mass., on Monday, October 21, 1929, and the evidence is reported herewith to the Industrial Accident Board for finding and decision, as provided by s. 13. . . . A hearing was held on September 23, 1927, in re reasonableness of Dr. Martin\u2019s charges in this case up to and including July 5, 1927, and the Board found that they were reasonable and approved payment of the same. The hearing now is on Dr. Martin\u2019s bill for services subsequent to July 5, 1927. Questions: (1) Whether the case is an \u2018unusual\u2019 one within the meaning of the act. (2) Whether the insurer is bound to continue to pay bills for services made necessary by reason of his injury.\u201d The decision of the board was that \"this case continues to be unusual within the meaning of the act,\u201d that the bill for services was reasonable, and that the insurer was \"obligated to pay to Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Martin\u201d a specified sum. The case went t\u00f3 the Superior Court, where decree was entered to the effect that the case was not an unusual one within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The physician alone appealed to this court from that decree. \"' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">At the argument at the bar of this court it was stipulated by the attorney for the insurer and the attorney for the physician that the said hearing on September 23, 1927; was held at the request of the employee to determine the rights of the parties under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30,\" that the only question then raised by the insurer related to the reasonableness of the charges and that the record showed that the insurer then admitted that the case was unusual and had paid all medical expenses incurred up to January 28, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">It is manifest that the physician is not and has not become a party to these proceedings. The hearings were held at the request of the employee, not at the request of the physician. The physician may become a party to proceedings of this nature. <em>Huxen\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 292. <em>Golden\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 178. <em>Allen\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 490. No great formality is required to that end. He is not a party merely because the employee petitions for payment of the charges made to him by his physician. The single circumstance that the name of the physician appears on the caption of the printed record sent from the Superior Court does not make him a party. That cannot overcome the specific assertion in the body of the record that the proceeding was by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Since the physician was not a party to the proceedings, he could not appeal from the decree of the Superior Court. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Noxon Chemical Products Co. </em>274 Mass. 526. If, however, the case be considered on its merits, \"no error is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">If the ruling of the trial judge be considered on its merits, it. is plain that the medical aspects of the employee\u2019s condition did not present an unusual case within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30. Doubtless his injury arose in an unusual way; but that does not make an unusual medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>case. The injury was a stricture of the urethra. To relieve the condition thereby created, it was necessary to have sounds passed every ten days approximately in order to empty the bladder. The employee works regularly and goes to the office of his physician for treatment. Within the authority of numerous cases this does not constitute an unusual case. <em>Rys\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 244. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 533. <em>Hooey\u2019s Case, </em>258 Mass. 515. <em>Pappas\u2019s Case, </em>262 Mass. 51. <em>Bourgardes\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The admission of the insurer at an earlier hearing that the case was unusual did not preclude an inquiry into the fact as it might be two years later, at the time of the hearing here assailed. <em>Mulkern\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 69, 74. The precise issue stated as being heard by the board was \u201cWhether the case is an 'unusual' one.\u201d The decision of that issue was wrong. The rule of <em>Kareske\u2019s Case, </em>250 Mass. 220, is not pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
