Wyman, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The material facts are as follows: The decedent died in June, 1929. An instrument purporting to be her will was presented for allowance in the Middlesex Probate Court. A motion- for jury issues was duly filed by the respondent, and in October, 1929, the issues were waived. After a hearing the will was allowed by a judge of the Probate Court. An appeal was taken to this court, and the decree reversed for errors incident to the reception of testimony. <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>271 Mass. 159,</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Whatever the original right to have issues framed may have been, as to which see <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>240 Mass. 49, it is plain a motion or petition for a rehearing to frame issues after such motion has been voluntarily and formally waived, and after a hearing on the merits has been had, presents no question of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
