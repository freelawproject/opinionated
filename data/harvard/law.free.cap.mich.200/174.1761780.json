Liability is admitted. The sole litigated question is the amount of compensation to be paid. For several years prior to-June 21, 1916, plaintiff\u2019s husband, the decedent, was continuously in the employ of defendant coal company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>as a locomotive crane operator. His average weekly wage during this period was $17.59. On that day decedent and other employees of the company went out on a strike. On August 24, 1916, he again entered the service of the company; this time as a mechanic. On October 1st, he met his death from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment; his average weekly wage for the period from August 24th until his death was $20.14. The board awarded to plaintiff $10 per week for a period of 300 weeks. If the board was. correct in computing the compensation on the basis of his average daily wage from August 24th to October 1st, the award should be affirmed, if not, it should be reduced to $8.79 per week. We quote briefly from the testimony of the secretary and treasurer of defendant coal company :</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-3\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Mr. Gram, how do you denominate the character of service he was given.

Up to the time of the strike he held that position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did he go back to the same position after the strike?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He took the position of mechanic at the rate of $90 per month.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And up to that time he was paid by the hour?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When the men went back did they go back to the same places they left?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I didn\u2019t say they got the same places; they went back regardless of what they did before.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-11\">Fellows, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A86V\"><em>(after stating the </em>facts). The section, of the employer\u2019s liability act involved in this case is part 2, \u00a7 11 (2 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 5441). In the case of <em>Andrejwski </em>v. <em>Wolverine Coal Co., </em>182 Mich. 298, this court had this section under consideration. Speaking through Chief Justice McAlvay, it was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cBy section 11 of part 2 of this act the legislature specifically provided the manner in which the average annual earnings of each employee should be determined by making four classifications, under one of which every case to be considered and determined under this statute must fall. Attention will now be given to these classifications, quoting and construing them in the order in which they appear in this section: * * * ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\"><em>\u201cSecond. </em>\u2018If the injured employee has not worked in the employment in which he was working' at the time of the accident, whether for the employer or not, during substantially the whole of the year immediately preceding his injury, his average annual earnings shall consist of three hundred times the average daily wage or salary which he has earned in such employment during the days when so employed\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cThis class is intended to include those cases where an employee who has not worked in the employment in which he was engaged at the time of his injury, whether for the same employer or not, during substantially the whole of the year immediately preceding his injury, where his daily wage or salary earned is fixed and known. In such case his average annual earnings will be 300 times such average daily wage or salary earned in such employment during the days when so employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In the case of <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Engine Co., </em>191 Mich. 122, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Ostrander, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201cA man may change his employment or the capacity in which he follows it. If he has done so at a time substantially less than a year before his injury then the statute fixes 300 times his daily wages-as his average annual wages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">When the decedent, a locomotive crane operator, left the employ of the coal company on the occasion of a strike, June 21st, the relations of master and servant, of employer and employee, were at an end. It required a new contract, a new employment, to restore such relations. When he entered the service of the coal com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>pany as a mechanic on August 24th, it was under a new contract, a new employment; in a different capacity, at a different wage. It was in this new capacity, this new employment, that he was working when he met his death. He had not worked in this eim ployment \u201cduring substantially the whole of the year immediately preceding his injury.\u201d In fact, he had so worked but a short time. It is clear, therefore, that the decedent belonged to the second class mentioned in the <em>Andrejwski </em>Case, and that compensation should be computed upon the basis of his average daily wage during the days when he was so employed. It was upon this basis that the award was made by the industrial accident board and such award is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-3\">Ostrander, C.
