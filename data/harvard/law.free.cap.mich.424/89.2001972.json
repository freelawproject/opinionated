This policy can only be effectuated \"if the means chosen by the parties for settlement of their differences under a collective bargaining agreement is given full play.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v American Mfg Co, </em>363 US 564, 566; 80 S Ct 1343; 4 L Ed 2d 1403 (1960). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that the decisions of joint management-labor grievance committees, such as was employed in this case, are entitled to the same deference as the decisions of independent arbitrators. <em>General Drivers, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local Union No 89 v Riss &amp; Co, Inc, </em>372 US 517; 83 S Ct 789; 9 L Ed 2d 918 (1963).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">Although the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the rule of finality in the context of a Title VII employment discrimination claim in <em>Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co, </em>415 US 36; 94 S Ct 1011; 39 L Ed 2d 147 (1974), it has no application to this case. Here, the finding of the grievance committees that plaintiffs seek to avoid is not one of constitutional magnitude or statutory construction; rather, it is a simple question of fact clearly within the competence of the grievance committees. See, also, <em>Ivery v United States, </em>686 F2d 410 (CA 6, 1982), especially Jones, J., <em>concurring. </em>[130 Mich App 375, 377-378; 343 NW2d 559 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-6\">Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b251-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">Plaintiffs Cleo Fulghum and Robert Morin, employees of defendant United Parcel Service, Inc., were suspended and later discharged after defendants Ed Mastay and Marvin Shevrovich, other employees of ups, accused them of stealing a small quantity of homemade sausage sent to ups for shipping. Fulghum and Morin were members of Local 243 of the Teamsters Union.</p>\n<p id=\"Aal\">Pursuant to the collective bargaining agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fulghum and Morin filed grievances against ups. At both the local level and on appeal to the state committee, consisting of ups and union representatives, the representatives deadlocked. The agreement provided that a discharge was deemed to be upheld in the event of deadlock. A further appeal was taken to the ups joint-area committee in Chicago. The joint-area committee reached a decision, denied the grievances, and sustained the discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The parties agree that Fulghum\u2019s and Morin\u2019s grievances were properly submitted under the grievance procedure provided in the agreement and that the decision reached in Chicago is final and binding on the issue whether their discharge was for \"cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Fulghum and Morin then filed this action in circuit court against their former employer, ups, and Mastay and Shevrovich. The complaint stated three counts; the first and third counts were based on statements made at the time of, and following, the suspension of Fulghum and Morin, accusing them of dishonesty. In the first count, Fulghum and Morin claimed that Mastay and Shevrovich, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the course and scope of their employment with ups, falsely accused Fulghum and Morin of stealing \"and/or\u201d misappropriating merchandise belonging to ups or one of its customers and that the statements were subsequently repeated to other persons. Further, written documents were prepared by ups, publishing such false statements. The second count, for invasion of privacy arising from the surveillance and filming of Fulghum and Morin\u2019s work activity, was subsequently withdrawn. The third count alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from the wrongful accusation and discharge of Fulghum and Morin.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Extensive discovery depositions were taken, and on that basis the circuit court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating that \"[defendants ups and Shevrovich were granted summary judgment because the grievance process comported with 'elementary fairness\u2019; therefore, plaintiffs were bound by the factual determinations made by the grievance tribunals. Defendant Mastay was granted summary judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Fulghum and Morin do not claim that ups breached the collective bargaining agreement; nor do they claim that the union violated its duty of fair representation. They claim rather that the decision of the ups joint-area committee affirming their discharge does not bar their common-law claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. They rely on <em>Alexander v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Gardner-Denver Co, </em>415 US 36; 94 S Ct 1011; 39 L Ed 2d 147 (1974), and assert that the policy considerations that justify a dual remedy for violation of a statutory right should also govern when a common-law right is involved. Second, they assert that, in the absence of mutuality of estoppel, the decision of the joint-area committee cannot preclude litigation of the issues in the instant action. Third, even if the mutuality of estoppel requirement is satisfied, they contend that the findings of the joint-area committee do not preclude the claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress because Fulghum and Morin were not accorded minimal due process in the grievance proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The defendants contend that the summary judgment should be affirmed because of the preclusive effect of the grievance determination. They also argue that since the allegedly defamatory statements were made solely within the scope of Mastay and Shevrovich\u2019s employment, and were made leading up to and within the context of grievance proceedings, the statements are absolutely privileged as a matter of federal labor law. The statements complained of relate to the charges of dishonesty which were the basis of the suspensions and discharges and the grievance filed pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Fulghum and Morin allege that the accusations of dishonesty made at the time they were suspended and their wrongful discharge constitute \"outrageous\u201d behavior sufficient to support a cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Assuming, without deciding, that the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>recognized in this state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fulghum and Morin cannot maintain such a claim on evidence that their employer did no more than inform them of its belief that they had stolen property and, on that basis, they were suspended and later discharged. There is no evidence that ups, Mastay, or Shevrovich held Fulghum and Morin up to obloquy in a manner such as to bring them within the scope of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. On the basis of Fulghum\u2019s and Morin\u2019s deposition testimony, it appears that the accusations related solely to the reason for the discharge, albeit a reason accusing them of dishonesty and theft and locker room language was used.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>A discharge ordinarily involves a communication to the employee of the reason for discharge. If an employer who explains the basis of discharge were subject to an action for mental distress damages on the basis of the explanation, every employee asserting wrongful discharge might claim that the reason or cause stated by the employer is untrue and seek, on that basis, mental distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Fulghum and Morin have job security only because of the provision in the collective bargaining agreement providing that they may not be discharged except for \"just cause.\u201d The question of \"cause\u201d for discharge has been decided in the final and binding grievance proceedings conducted pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. To permit plaintiffs to maintain an action for intentional infliction of mental distress on the basis of the allegation that the accusations were false would be tantamount to allowing them to bring in a different form and forum, a claim for wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Fulghum and Morin\u2019s count in defamation has two components: 1) statements made in the course of and during the grievance procedure, and 2) communications to co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We hold that accusations of dishonesty made during grievance proceedings provided for in the collective bargaining agreement cannot be the basis of a common-law action for defamation. Federal and state courts have uniformly held that communications made in the course of, or in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>nection with, grievance or arbitration proceedings provided for by a collective bargaining agreement, are, at least in some degree, privileged under the law of defamation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Defendants argue that as a matter of federal law the statements are absolutely privileged. In a leading case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, <em>General Motors Corp v Mendicki, </em>367 F2d 66 (CA 10, 1966), the plaintiff was discharged for misappropriation of company property. The alleged slanderous statement was made by a General Motors representative at a grievance meeting between gm and the union. The court held that the statements complained of were protected by an absolute privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">We think Congress intended that the respective representatives of employer and employee at such conferences and bargaining sessions should feel free to express their respective contentions as to the pertinent facts and the issues involved fully and frankly and to strongly support their positions with -respect to the controversy . . . \"untrammelled by fear of retribution . . . .\u201d Moreover, such actions . . . would tend to impair the chance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>for a peaceful settlement of labor controversies .... [Id. at 71.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The federal policy governing statements made during the course of a grievance proceeding has been clearly and repeatedly articulated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Other state courts that have addressed this issue have divided on whether a qualified,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rather than an absolute, privilege should be accorded to communications made in the course of, or during, grievance proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>We choose to follow Mendicki<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and accord an absolute privilege to communications during griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>anee proceedings because we are of the opinion that such protection is necessary to protect the process. The rationale is the same as underlies the absolute privilege that protects statements made during and germane to judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The potential for interference with the federal scheme of labor regulation is sufficient to \"preempt\u201d the interest of the state in protecting its citizens from defamatory statements during grievance proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Linn v United Plant Guard Workers of America, </em>383 US 53; 86 S Ct 657; 15 L Ed 2d 582 (1966), that the nlra does not bar a civil action for libel under state law where the defamatory statements were published during a union organizing campaign by the union and its officers, is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The basis of the discharges in the instant case, the accusation that the plaintiffs were dismissed because they stole sausage, was necessarily repeated in the grievance proceedings. A determination whether Fulghum and Morin were discharged for \"just cause,\u201d as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, could not be made without a consideration of the employer\u2019s reasons for the discharge. The exception recognized in <em>Linn </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In contrast to the recognized exceptions to federal preemption of state law,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a common-law ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion for defamation based on statements germane to the discharge of an employee during a grievance proceeding would directly and severely impair the functioning of the agreed-upon grievance procedure which has been repeatedly sustained by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whatever deficiencies, if any, there may be in the Teamsters grievance procedure, it is the chosen mechanism under the collective bargaining agreement for the resolution of disputes. A rule of state law that would frustrate the efforts to adjust grievances through the process of collective bargaining would strike at the core of federal labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The alleged defamatory statements in the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>stant case, made within the limited confines of the grievance proceeding, are absolutely privileged. Ups, Mastay, and Shevrovich are absolutely privileged from a defamation action based on what they said, including accusations of dishonesty and theft, during the course of the grievance proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Fulghum and Morin also allege that the defamatory accusations of dishonesty and theft were published and communicated to others. The record is sparse on these claims,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Fulghum and Morin acknowledged during their deposition testimony that the circumstances in which the information about their discharge was communicated to others is unknown to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It is unrealistic to expect an employer and all of its employees to maintain confidentiality about the discharge of a coemployee where there is an ongoing grievance proceeding, so perfectly that word cannot get out. In many situations it will be difficult to determine the person \u2014 the discharged employee, the employer, or union representative\u2014 responsible for the information becoming known.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>It is critical for a company like ups \u2014 the essence of whose business is the careful transport of other people\u2019s goods \u2014 to have honest people in its employ. In the instant case, the employer has an interest in informing other ups employees that discharge is the penalty for stealing even sausage. Further, the employees have an interest in knowing how the disciplinary process works in practice. In light of the ultimate holding of the joint committee, the plaintiffs were not damaged by any premature communication of the reason for discharge before its, decision was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">An employer is not privileged to communicate needlessly to the world at large, including fellow employees, the reason for discharge if it is of a character that would hold the discharged employee up to opprobrium. An employer does have a qualified privilege<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to publish statements to other employees whose duties interest them in the subject. <em>Sias v General Motors Corp, 372 </em>Mich 542; 127 NW2d 357 (1964). In some situations there could be a genuine issue of material fact for the jury regarding a plaintiff\u2019s claim that the employer abused the qualified privilege through excessive publication of the defamatory statement or by proof that the defamatory statement was made with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This Court has said that publication of the reason for discharging an employee to his coemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ees is outside of the qualified privilege. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Sias, </em>the employer told the fellow employees that the discharge of an employee in the protection department was for his misappropriation of company property \u2014 a charge that the jury found to be false. <em>Sias </em>and the cases following <em>Sias </em>are not controlling because there the publication was of a <em>false </em>statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the instant case, the grievance proceedings implicitly determined, in upholding the discharge, that the communicated statement of dishonesty was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">If an employee invokes the agreed-upon grievance procedure, the determination of an arbitrator or joint committee that the discharge was for \"cause\u201d establishes the defense of truth to a defamation action premised on statements which explain the reason for the discharge. To permit Fulghum and Morin to litigate the truth or falsity of the alleged defamatory statements would, again, be tantamount to allowing them to obtain a redetermination of the wrongfulness of their discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We accept the determination of the joint committee for the limited purpose of deciding whether an employer\u2019s communications to his employees are outside of the qualified privilege because we are of the opinion that such effect should be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to the determination of an independent arbitrator or the joint committee. The United States Supreme Court has given the same effect to the resolution of a grievance when the parties\u2019 chosen instrument for resolving disputes is a joint committee as when it is to submit the matter to an independent arbitrator.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Recognizing the differences in process, we follow the lead of the United States Supreme Court in declining to draw a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In sum, the determination of an independent arbitrator, or of a joint committee, that a discharged employee was guilty of misconduct (and thus that there was cause for discharge) bars an action alleging conduct by the employer incidental to and directly related to the discharge and, in effect, that the employee was not guilty of misconduct<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because the question whether he is guilty of misconduct has been decided adversely to the employee and may not be litigated in another form or forum.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">Williams, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> Article 5 of the supplemental agreement to the National Master Panel Service Agreement, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\"A grievance is hereby jointly defined to be any controversy, complaint, misunderstanding, or dispute arising as to interpretation, application or observance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Supplement or Rider hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\"In the event of any grievance, complaint, or dispute on the part of any employer, it shall be handled in the following manner, and a <em>decision reached at any stage shall be \u00f1nal and binding on both parties. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\"(c) If the parties fail to reach a decision or agree upon a settlement in the matter, it shall be submitted to the State Committee or ups Joint Area Committee, whichever is applicable within fifteen (15) days.

In the leading case of <em>Bird v Meadow Gold Products Corp, </em>60 Mise 2d 212; 302 NYS2d 701 (1969), a New York Supreme Court, looking both to New York law and to other state court decisions under the Railway Labor Act, held that statements made during grievance proceedings are protected by a qualified privilege. <em>Bird </em>was followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Dunning v Boyes, </em>351 So 2d 883, 884 (Ala, 1977), <em>cert den </em>436 US 917 (1978), where it was held to be a jury question whether the qualified privilege was abused by writing in a letter in connection with a grievance proceeding that the employee was a \"known Bigot.\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts also followed <em>Bird </em>in <em>Ezekiel v Jones Motor Co, Inc, </em>374 Mass 382; 372 NE2d 1281 (1978). A former employee sought damages for an allegedly slanderous statement made by a witness during a hearing before a joint management-union grievance board to the effect that the plaintiff had stolen a rod and reel from the employer. The Supreme Judicial Court held that where the defendants had a duty to communicate to the grievance board the reasons for terminating the employee, they enjoyed a qualified privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> The Court of Appeals, in <em>Merritt v Detroit Memorial Hospital, </em>81 Mich App 279, 286; 265 NW2d 124 (1978), held that defamatory statements about an employee to a union representative communicated during grievance proceedings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement are absolutely privileged. The union representative was acting \"more or less as the agent of the plaintiff\u201d and the plaintiff never objected to his presence. The Court viewed Merritt\u2019s action as the equivalent of consent and the communication was therefore absolutely privileged. In contrast, publication of the reason for Merritt\u2019s dismissal to supervisory personnel was qualifiedly privileged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> See Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 114, p 777.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> The general rule of preemption of state regulation of conduct actually or arguably prohibited as an unfair labor practice has two notable exceptions: \"[W]here the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act . . .

In <em>Hasten v Phillips Petroleum Co, </em>640 F2d 274 (CA 10, 1981), <em>Linn </em>was distinguished in the language of <em>Mendicki:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\"The question in the <em>Linn </em>case was whether a libel action in the circumstances of that case 'might interfere with the national labor policy.\u2019 The question in the instant case is whether an action for damages on account of the statement upon which the instant case is predicated, made in a conference and bargaining session to adjust an employer\u2019s grievance, and which was clearly germane to the issue involved, would interfere with the national labor policy, and whether it is necessary to hold such statements unqualifiedly privileged to prevent impairment of that policy.\u201d 367 F2d 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Linn </em>was also distinguished in <em>Brooks v Solomon, </em>542 F Supp 1229, 1233 (ND Ala, 1982):</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\"In <em>Linn </em>exclusive jurisdiction was unsuccessfully sought on the basis of statements arguably made during the course of what the law forbids or discourages; an unfair labor practice. While the nlkb has jurisdiction over claims of unfair labor practice, there is no federal policy reason to shield the alleged libeler from a libel made during the course of an unfair labor practice. Here the statements were made during a proceeding which, rather than being discouraged by federal law, is encouraged by federal law; federal policy being to encourage the peaceful disposition of grievance issues. While the libelous statements considered in <em>Linn, </em>and the context in which they were uttered, constituted conduct which was merely a 'peripheral concern\u2019 of the nlrb, the circumstances giving rise to the action at bar involve interests which necessarily require the uniform employment of federal law in order to prevent the impairment of national labor policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The district court for the District of Columbia distinguished <em>Linn </em>in <em>Joftes v Kaufman, </em>324 F Supp 660, 664 (D DC, 1971), where the employee brought a libel action for statements in the letters of notice of dismissal, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\"The rationale of the Court\u2019s decision [in Linn] was that the remedial provisions of labor law offered no possibility of relief for the injury allegedly suffered by the official .... Here, on the other hand, Joftes had available to him an opportunity through the grievance machinery to secure personal relief and vinification, and by way of an action for wrongful discharge if the grievance procedure were held not to be an exclusive remedy under the terms of the agreement. To allow him to proceed instead by way of a burdensome, expensive, vexatious libel suit against individuals who did no more than fulfill their duty to inform him of reasons for his discharge would indeed be subversive of procedures and remedies for employment disputes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> The exceptions to federal preemption of state law involve actions that can be adjudicated without regard to the merits of the underlying labor controversy. Thus, in <em>Linn, </em>there was little risk that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>state cause of action would interfere with the effective administration of national labor policy. The board\u2019s \u00a7 8 unfair labor practice proceeding would focus only on whether the statements were misleading or coercive; whether the statements also were defamatory would be of no relevance to the board\u2019s performance of its functions. Similarly, state court actions to redress injuries caused by violence or threats of violence are consistent with effective administration of the federal scheme. See, e.g., <em>United Construction Workers v Laburnum Construction Corp, </em>347 US 656; 74 S Ct 833; 98 L Ed 1025 (1954); <em>Youngdahl v Rainfair, Inc, </em>355 US 131; 78 S Ct 206; 2 L Ed 2d 151 (1957); <em>UAW v Russell, </em>356 US 634; 78 S Ct 932; 2 L Ed 2d 1030 (1958) . There is no risk that state damage actions will fetter the exercise of rights protected by the nlra or procedures pursuant to the cba governed by the nlra. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the \"outrageous conduct\u201d of union officers consisting of \"frequent public ridicule,\u201d \"incessant verbal abuse,\u201d and refusals to refer him to jobs in accordance with the rules of the hiring hall could be brought in state court does not require that we apply state law in the instant case.
