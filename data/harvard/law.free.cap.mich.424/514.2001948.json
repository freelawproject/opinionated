The complaint, as amended, alleged the following misconduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">1) Misappropriation of client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">2) Forgery of her former law associate\u2019s signature on trust account checks in conjunction with the misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">3) Obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">4) Violation of Canon 5(D) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">5) Subornation of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">We accept the master\u2019s findings of fact and the commission\u2019s findings as detailed herein, and hold that respondent is hereby removed from her judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Between May 1979 and May 1983, respondent practiced law in Flint in an association which included attorneys Arthalu Lancaster and Delores Coulter. The members of the association shared office expenses, but retained individual responsibility for their work. The association maintained three checking accounts: a general business account, a payroll account, and a client trust account. Any check needed two separate signatures to be negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">In August 1981, Caroline Sullivan and Earnestine Buchanan hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. The case involved injuries sustained by their children in a motorcycle-pedestrian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>accident. Respondent negotiated a partial settlement against the motorcyclist for $40,000. Respondent deducted her fee and deposited the remainder (the \"Sullivan funds\u201d) into the association\u2019s client trust account. Respondent was later appointed conservator of these funds by order of the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In May 1983, respondent was appointed to the 68th District Court. Both respondent and Lancaster had actively sought the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Before assuming the bench, respondent transferred several cases, including the Sullivan case, to Flint attorney Gregory Gibbs. Gibbs would later testify that he was under the impression that respondent placed all of the Sullivan funds in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In July and August 1983, Caroline Sullivan and her daughter met with Gibbs to discuss the status of their case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When asked about the Sullivan funds, Gibbs told his clients that the money was being held in trust by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In December 1983, respondent\u2019s secretary called Lancaster\u2019s office. Respondent requested that Lancaster write a check out of the Sullivan funds, so that respondent could continue her bond as conservator in the Sullivan case. This proved to be the impetus of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Lancaster, who was under the impression that the entire Sullivan matter had been transferred out of the office, contacted Gibbs. Gibbs wrote respondent, asking why the funds were not in an interest-bearing account. Lancaster and Coulter also wrote respondent and asked her to explain why $10,500 was missing from the trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">During the commission\u2019s investigation, it became apparent that a crucial factual issue involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>whether respondent\u2019s former clients gave her prior permission to use the Sullivan funds. The commission tape-recorded an interview with Earnestine Buchanan. During that interview, Ms. Buchanan stated that she was positive that she never gave respondent prior permission to use the funds. When Buchanan testified to the contrary at the hearing, the tape-recorded statement was used, over objection, for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As a result of the commission\u2019s investigation, respondent ultimately admitted that she withdrew ten checks totaling $10,500 from the Sullivan funds for her personal use. These withdrawals occurred both before and after respondent\u2019s judicial appointment. The focus of this proceeding involves respondent\u2019s personal use of these funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On April 10, 1984, the commission filed its formal complaint with this Court, and we appointed 30th Circuit Court Judge Carolyn Stell as master. The master granted a motion to amend the complaint to allege obstruction of justice. We granted the commission\u2019s supplemental petition for interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The hearing before the master included the testimony of twenty-five witnesses and the introduction of fifty-four exhibits into evidence and was concluded by the filing of a thirty-page report.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The commission reviewed the master\u2019s report and heard oral argument before rendering its decision. The commission adopted the master\u2019s findings in toto, and recommended to this Court that respondent be removed from office and permanently enjoined from serving in any future judicial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Preliminary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Respondent raises two procedural arguments before addressing the factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>At the close of proofs, the examiner moved to amend the complaint to conform to the proofs. The examiner sought to add, inter alia, charges involving a violation of Canon 5(D) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and subornation of perjury. Respondent\u2019s counsel objected on the basis that respondent had no notice of the additional charges and had not come to the hearing prepared to defend against them. See <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 US 544; 88 S Ct 1222; 20 L Ed 2d 117 (1968); <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Jackson, </em>390 Mich 147, 155; 211 NW2d 38 (1973). At the suggestion of respondent\u2019s counsel, the master took the motion to amend the complaint under advisement. In her written report, the master granted the motion in part, stating that, in light of the lack of objection during the pertinent testimony, the issues of a violation of Canon 5(D) and subornation of perjury had been tried with respondent\u2019s implied consent. See GCR 1963, 932.14; MCR 9.214; GCR 1963, 118.3; MCR 2.118(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Before reaching its decision, the commission requested further briefing from the parties on this issue. The commission found that the master properly granted the motion to amend the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We have distinguished <em>Ruffalo </em>in a situation where an attorney was effectively informed of the charge, and was in no way prejudiced from adequately defending himself. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Roth, </em>400 Mich 484, 492; 255 NW2d 624 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We have also declined to apply <em>Ruffalo </em>in at least one judicial tenure case. <em>In re Ryman, </em>394 Mich 637; 232 NW2d 178 (1975). In <em>Ryman, </em>the commission alleged that a district judge was unfit to hold office because of acts committed both before and after he assumed the bench. Ryman was not formally charged with perjury or false swearing. Nonetheless, the master and the commission both found that respondent gave false testimony. The majority of the Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> quoted the commission\u2019s decision on this allegation verbatim and ordered removal. 394 Mich 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Accordingly, we find that the motion to amend the complaint was properly granted on the basis of GCR 1963, 932.14 and GCR 1963, 118.3. Respondent admitted that she was aware of Canon 5(D) and knew that her continued foie as conservator violated that canon. No objection was made during that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We also agree with the commission that the subornation of perjury charge was integrally related to the misappropriation charge. Respondent was not surprised or prejudiced in this matter. At the time of the supplemental petition for interim suspension, respondent was well aware of the conflicting affidavits on the issue of permission and the probability that they would be the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>further inquiry. Furthermore, respondent made no motion to reopen the proofs, even though the possibility was discussed during the hearing. Therefore, the unique facts of this case indicate that respondent\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We stress that even <em>if </em>the motion to amend had not been granted, the remaining charges and findings amply support the sanctions imposed today.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The second preliminary problem involves the appropriate standard of proof. It is clear that our review of the record, including the master\u2019s report, is de novo. MCR 9.225; <em>In re Lawrence, </em>417 Mich 248, 252; 335 NW2d 564 (1983). However, the question what standard of proof is required at the hearing is not as clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Respondent argues that the allegations must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Heuermann, </em>90 SD 312; 240 NW2d 603 (1976). During oral argument, respondent\u2019s counsel noted that the commission\u2019s brief in <em>In re Del Rio, </em>400 Mich 665; 256 NW2d 727 (1977), advanced a similar standard. Nevertheless, throughout <em>this </em>proceeding; the commission consistently argued that it had the burden of proving the allegations contained in the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">MCR 9.211 states that the hearing \"must conform as nearly as possible to the rules of procedure and evidence governing the trial of civil actions in the circuit court.\u201d The preponderance of the evidence standard is generally employed in civil actions. 30 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, \u00a7 1163, p 337. We also emphasize that the primary concern in judicial tenure proceedings is the maintenance of high standards of judicial fitness and competency. The need for a reputable judiciary and the maintenance of the public\u2019s confidence in a compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tent judiciary is of utmost importance. See <em>In re Probert, </em>411 Mich 210, 228; 308 NW2d 773 (1981). For these reasons, we are not persuaded that a standard of \"clear and convincing\u201d evidence is appropriate. Accordingly, we hold that the proper standard of proof to be utilized in judicial tenure cases is preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Substantive Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AACq\">Misappropriation</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Respondent admitted in her amended answer that she withdrew $10,500 from the Sullivan funds. Although respondent admitted that she never received prior <em>written </em>consent from the parties to use these funds, her basic defense is that she had the clients\u2019 prior oral permission to borrow the money. The master focused on the testimony of Reverend Willie Buchanan, Caroline Sullivan, and Earnestine Buchanan.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Although Reverend Buchanan testified that he gave respondent permission to \"handle the whole trust fund in the manner that she saw fit,\u201d the master correctly noted that Reverend Buchanan was merely a family advisor and was neither a party to the Sullivan case nor legal guardian or next friend of any of the parties in that case. Although Reverend Buchanan was initially unsure of the exact year and month, he ultimately stated on direct examination that he gave verbal permission to use the funds in October 1982. The master noted a number of inconsistencies in Reverend Buchanan\u2019s testimony before concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">It is the Master\u2019s finding, based upon her opportunity to view the demeanor of the witness, his attitude, and the substance of his testimony, that the testimony of Reverend Buchanan was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>fabricated in an attempt to help Respondent for whom he testified. \"The only thing she has ever been to our family is help for our family, provided help in every way she could.\u201d And for whom he signed an affidavit presented to him by Respondent without reading it because \"... I know it was legal . . . because, like I said, I never knowed [sic] Judge Loyd to do anything crooked because, like I said, she always [sic] been fair.\u201d His loyalty is admirable; his willingness to perjure himself is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Caroline Sullivan\u2019s testimony regarding permission to use the funds was riddled with inconsistencies. She recalled a meeting with attorney Gibbs in his office in which she told Gibbs that she was angry with respondent for taking the money and that she wanted to sue her. At one point, she stated unequivocally that she gave respondent permission to use the funds in April 1984. She also stated that she gave respondent verbal permission to use the funds in April or March 1982. This date would have been before the partial settlement occurred and must be compared with her affidavit which states that she gave oral permission in the fall of 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The master concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">It is the Master\u2019s finding that such permission was not given prior to the funds being borrowed from the Client Trust Account, but was given after the money was repaid and Sullivan realized that her earlier actions had caused trouble for Respondent. This finding is based upon the witness\u2019 demeanor and attitude. I believe that Sullivan was not consciously perjuring herself, but had been persuaded by Respondent that she herself had erred in failing to \"remember\u201d her previous permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Earnestine Buchanan testified that she gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>respondent prior permission to use the funds. However, the credibility of this testimony was seriously undermined by her previous tape-recorded statement. We agree with the master\u2019s finding that this witness\u2019 testimony was obviously \"coached.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The master made the following ultimate findings regarding the misappropriation charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">(1) That both prior to and after her appointment to the 68th District Court the Respondent misappropriated from the estates of Angela Sullivan, Brian Sullivan and James Liggins $10,500 derived from the partial settlement of the <em>Sullivan </em>matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">(2) That Respondent had no permission whatsoever prior to March 20, 1984 from Caroline Sullivan, Angela Sullivan, Earnestine Buchanan or Reverend Willie Buchanan to use these funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">These findings are not only established by a preponderance of the evidence, but beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Our review of the record persuades us that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>findings of the master and the commission are amply supported. We decline to further discuss the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, since that standard is not required under today\u2019s holding. It is obvious that the master was well aware of the appropriate standard since she ruled on it in her report. We believe that the use of the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d language was merely meant to emphasize the relative weight of the evidence against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Forgery</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The complaint alleged that respondent forged Lancaster\u2019s signature to facilitate the misappropriation of the Sullivan funds. Respondent admitted signing Lancaster\u2019s name on at least nine trust account checks. She contends that she had Lancaster\u2019s implied consent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Both Lancaster and respondent testified that they had, on occasion, signed each other\u2019s names on checks drawn from the general account. Lancaster stated that this implied understanding did not carry over to the trust account because \"[t]hey weren\u2019t our monies.\u201d Ms. Coulter stated that she was unaware of any common practice regarding the trust account. Respondent testified that she assumed there was an informal understanding \"based on the fact that Miss Lancaster would sign my name to checks and other documents and I did the same thing with her name.\u201d Respondent testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\"><em>Q: </em>And was this common practice known to all parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\"><em>Q. </em>And was it common practice known to all parties as it related to the trust account also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>A. </em>I assumed it was. We certainly never had a discussion about you do it with this account but not with that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\"><em>Q. </em>Did you at any time forge the name of Arthalu Lancaster on any document or check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The master noted that respondent was the only one who testified that signing another attorney\u2019s name to a trust account check was a common practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Forgery may be defined as the making of a false document, including a check, with the intent to deceive in a manner which exposes another to loss. MCL 750.248; MSA 28.445; <em>People v Susalla, </em>392 Mich 387, 392-393; 220 NW2d 405 (1974). Respondent argues that she had no intent to deceive on the basis of her assertion that she had Lancaster\u2019s implied consent to sign both signatures to the trust account checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">The master found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">that the testimony demonstrates that Respondent did not have express or implied authority from Lancaster to sign Lancaster\u2019s name to any of the nine checks drawn upon the Client Trust Account. The Master further finds that the method used to account for these checks clearly demonstrates an intent to hide the fact that Respondent was withdrawing client funds for her own personal use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">The Master makes the following findings of fact with respect to this charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-12\">(1) That Respondent forged Arthalu Lancaster\u2019s signature to the checks enumerated in paragraph 4 of Formal Complaint No. 31, except Check No. 143 dated May 2,1983, in the amount of $300.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">(2) That Respondent had no authority to place Lancaster\u2019s signature upon such checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">(3) That Respondent took such action in further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>anee of her intentional plan to misappropriate client funds from the <em>Sullivan </em>settlement proceeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">These findings are established by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We agree that respondent\u2019s actions involving the trust fund and the signing of the trust checks demonstrates an intent to deceive. Respondent wrote six checks totaling $8,550 from the Sullivan funds between October 1982 and May 1983. However, she never entered these transactions onto the trust account ledger. Respondent also failed to include the disbursements in the annual account filed with the probate court. Respondent made notations on five of these checks that the funds taken represented salary advances to her for work to be done in unrelated collection cases. Respondent admitted that these notations were untrue. When respondent transferred the Sullivan case to Gibbs, she failed to mention that she had written these checks with her clients\u2019 permission. The testimony given by respondent\u2019s former associates, coupled with the surreptitious accounting methods used, supports the master\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Paragraph 13 of the complaint alleged that respondent engaged in various activities designed to dissuade others from initiating, and later cooperating with the commission\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In <em>People v Ormsby, </em>310 Mich 291, 299-300; 17 NW2d 187 (1945), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">The term, to obstruct justice, connotes an interference with the orderly administration of law. In 46 CJ p 868, it is stated: \"The phrase 'obstructing justice\u2019 means impeding or obstructing those who seek justice in a court, or those who have duties or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>powers of administering justice therein.\u201d [Citations omitted.] In 2 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law and Procedure, p 1879, \u00a7 1637, it is stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\"The question upon the trial is not the guilt or innocence of the respondent in the main case, nor the sufficiency of the information nor the jurisdiction of the court, but whether the respondent was guilty of obstructing or interfering with the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\"><em>The more common examples of obstruction of justice are </em>the bribery and influencing of officials and officers intrusted with the enforcement of law, <em>coercion of witnesses, interference with the obtaining of testimony, </em>resisting an officer, <em>and other acts generally calculated to interfere with the orderly process of the administration of law. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">See also <em>People v Coleman, </em>350 Mich 268; 86 NW2d 281 (1957); <em>People v Somma, </em>123 Mich App 658, 661-662; 333 NW2d 117 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Paragraphs 13(a) and 13(b) alleged that respondent made various threats against her former law associates in an attempt to harass and dissuade them from initiating and cooperating with the commission\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Before contacting the commission, Lancaster and Coulter wrote respondent and inquired into the whereabouts of the missing Sullivan funds. The letter requested an explanation and stated that \"[a]ll of those monies were removed without either our knowledge or consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Respondent admitted replying in a letter dated January 3, 1984. Respondent asserts that the letter was 1) meant to protect her former clients from Lancaster, 2) reflected justifiable anger towards Coulter for allowing herself to become embroiled in a controversy which she knew nothing about, and 3) contained truths about Lancaster\u2019s conduct which would be established at the hearing. With respect to the telephone calls, respondent denied any intent to threaten Lancaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The master summarized numerous conversations between Coulter, Lancaster, and respondent. We do not need to chronicle each and every allegation contained in paragraph 13. We are convinced that the following specific examples established the charge of obstruction of justice by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Both Lancaster and Coulter testified that respondent implied that she would not be the only one subject to disciplinary proceedings. Lancaster testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\"><em>Q. </em>In the course of these discussions, was there any reference to Judge Loyd going down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes, and I don\u2019t know if those were between the 14th, 15th, whatever it was, and the time we wrote the letter or after the letter that she wrote to me. It seems that it was before we wrote the letter, but I know that she said repeatedly in several conversations, and whether they were at that point or later in January, I won\u2019t go down alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Although respondent denied using such language, Coulter substantiated this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Lancaster also testified in support of the allegation contained in paragraph 13(f), that the following threat was made during a telephone call received near midnight on April 9, 1984:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\"><em>Q. </em>What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\"><em>A. </em>I walked in the house and the telephone rang and I picked it up and Lee identified herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\"><em>Q. </em>What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\"><em>A. </em>She said, \"Artie, this is Lee,\u201d and then she said something and I don\u2019t remember what it was but it was a lot of this same type of, you know, why are you doing this or remarks like that, because I remember my response was, I said, \"Lee, what do you want me to say?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\"><em>Q. </em>What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\"><em>A. </em>She said, \"I don\u2019t want you to say anything. I just want you to listen.\u201d And then she said, \"I\u2019ll follow you to the ends of the earth, I\u2019ll follow you until the day I die,\u201d and then she said, \"I\u2019ll stop at nothing. Do you know what nothing means?\u201d And that\u2019s all she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\"><em>Q. </em>Did you make a response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\"><em>A. </em>I said, \"Lee, I am going to hang up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\"><em>Q. </em>And you terminated the call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">We agree with the master that these statements were made with the clear intent to dissuade Lancaster and Coulter from initiating and later cooperating with the commission\u2019s investigation. Respondent argues that no recordings were made of these statements even though Lancaster testified that she recorded other conversations. We find this argument irrelevant. The animosity which existed between Lancaster and respondent, and the truth or falsity of the allegations directed against Lancaster are not the focus of these proceedings. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>evidence did not prevent the master from correctly finding that the allegations of obstruction of justice were proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Paragraph 13 also summarized three telephone calls between respondent and Gibbs which occurred after Ms. Buchanan gave her tape-recorded statement. In the first call, respondent expressed her displeasure with Gibbs for his failure to inform her of the meeting in which Buchanan gave the recorded testimony. In the second call, respondent accused Gibbs of failing to protect his clients\u2019 interests during that meeting. In a third call, which occurred after respondent\u2019s appointment, respondent demanded that Gibbs return all of \"her\u201d files. Gibbs testified that he did not return the files, since none of his clients had contacted him regarding a substitution of counsel. He also stated that he would have incurred economic loss as a result of such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The master found that the allegations contained in paragraphs (13)(d) and (e) were established by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and agree with the master\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Violation op Canon 5(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Amended paragraph 15 alleged that respondent\u2019s failure to withdraw as conservator for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>estates of the children involved in the accident violated Canon 5(D) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">A judge should not serve as the executor, administrator, testamentary trustee, or guardian, except for the estate, testamentary trust, or person of a member of his immediate family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The master found that this charge was established by the respondent\u2019s own admission, since she testified that she was aware that she was in violation of the canon in December 1983, but did not take any steps to withdraw as conservator. We agree that this allegation was established by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Subornation of Perjury</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Paragraph 16 of the amended complaint alleged that respondent violated DR l-102(A)(3)-(6)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by inducing Caroline Sullivan, Earnestine Buchanan, and Reverend Buchanan to file false affidavits with this Court. The affidavits were filed in support of respondent\u2019s motion to reject the commission\u2019s petition for interim suspension. In general, the affidavits indicated that Ms. Sullivan and Ms. Buchanan gave permission to respondent in the fall of 1982 to use a portion of the Sullivan funds for her personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On the basis of the earlier finding that respondent did not have prior permission to use the funds, the master concluded that the allegations contained in paragraph 16 were established beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">The testimony is clear that Respondent prepared the affidavits and requested affiants\u2019 signatures. The content of the affidavits has already been found to be false. (See analysis of affiants\u2019 testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>mony under Section I, <em>supra.) </em>Note also Sullivan\u2019s telling comment that the affidavits were signed \"in order to make things halfway legal, I guess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">The facts, as found by the Master, are strikingly similar to those which were found to provide an adequate basis for a finding of subornation of perjury in an attorney misconduct case, <em>In the Matter of Grimes, </em>414 Mich 483, 493 [326 NW2d 380] (1982). The standard of conduct for judges is surely no less than that expected of attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Respondent argues that there was no testimony that she actually prepared the affidavits. We find that a reasonable reading of the testimony supports at least an inference that she prepared them or directed their preparation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, regardless of who <em>prepared </em>the affidavits, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that respondent requested that the affiants sign them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\"><em>Q. </em>Let me show you this paper entitled Affidavit of Caroline Sullivan, is that your signature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\"><em>Q. </em>Dated the 20th of April, 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\"><em>Q. </em>Do you remember who asked you to sign this affidavit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\"><em>A. </em>Lee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\"><em>Q. </em>Lee? Do you remember where you signed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\"><em>A. </em>In her office, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\"><em>Q. </em>In her office at Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\"><em>A. </em>(Nodding head yes.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-15\"><em>Q. </em>Who asked you to sign those statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-16\"><em>A. </em>It depends on which statements you\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-17\"><em>Q. </em>The affidavits I showed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-18\"><em>A. </em>In order to make things halfway legal, I guess, when did Lee did [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">Respondent argues that all the affiants swore to the truth of the affidavits on the witness stand. Nonetheless, the master found the contents of the affidavits to be false on the basis of her earlier finding regarding the misappropriation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">Allegations of perjury and subornation of perjury generally hinge on the relative credibility of witnesses. Indeed, the master explained at length that her findings were partly based on her perception of the witnesses. Our power of review de novo does not prevent us from according proper deference to the master\u2019s ability to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and comment on their credibility. Cf. <em>In re Laster, </em>404 Mich 449, 471; 274 NW2d 742 (1979) (dissent of Levin, J.). Our review per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>suades us that the master\u2019s findings are amply supported by the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The commission recommends that we permanently enjoin respondent from serving in any future office. We recently rejected a similar recommendation under different facts. <em>In re Callanan, </em>419 Mich 376, 387-389; 355 NW2d 69 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We hold that respondent shall be removed from office. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a730.

Further, the proofs regarding her claim of prior permission are essentially identical to those regarding the allegation of subornation of perjury; the outcome of these two mutually exclusive claims being dependent upon the same proofs.

She had obviously been coached to give this answer in an effort to explain her prior inconsistent statement made to the Commission investigators (Commission Exhibit 64). The coaching was particularly evident when she gave the same answer to questions that had nothing to do with the obtaining of the previous statement, <em>e.g., </em>in response to' a question asked to establish her appearance in Probate Court. Ms. Buchanan had great difficulty in keeping her story straight. At one point she testified that she told the truth in the taped statement; at a later point she testified that she. denied giving Respondent permission to use the money during the taped statement because 'they scared me.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">\"As was the case with Sullivan, Ms. Buchanan\u2019s greatest desire was to see that no harm came to Respondent.

However, the telephone call made April 5, 1984 by Respondent to Gibbs, in which she demanded the return of files she had turned over to him when she took the bench, cannot be construed as other than an attempt to harass Gibbs and dissuade him from testifying.
