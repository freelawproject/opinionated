Both policies contain coordinated benefits clauses, and each insurer claims that its coverage is secondary to the other. We are persuaded that to give effect to defendant\u2019s clause would defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent, expressed in \u00a7 3109a of the no-fault act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to allow insureds the option of coordinating their medical benefits. Thus, we hold that defendant health insurer is primarily liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">At the time of the accident, the claimant was insured for personal injury protection (pip) benefits under a no-fault automobile insurance policy issued by plaintiff. Because claimant elected to coordinate these no-fault pip benefits with his health insurance, plaintiff offered the coverage at a reduced premium rate. Plaintiffs coordination of benefits clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">This insurance does not apply to the extent that any amounts are paid or payable for allowable expenses to or on behalf of such named insured or relative under the provisions of any other insurance, service, benefit or reimbursement plan pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>viding similar direct benefits, without regard to fault, for bodily injury sustained as a result of the operation, maintenance or use, including the loading or unloading, of a motor vehicle. [Michigan Personal Injury Protection Endorsement (Medical Expense Amendment) Form Number AUTO 523A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The claimant also had coverage for medical and hospital expenses under a group health insurance policy written for his employer by defendant. That policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">Under \"No Fault\u201d legislation the benefits of this plan shall be determined after the benefits provided by \"No Fault\u201d legislation in those states where such legislation is in force and allowable by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Following the accident, plaintiff paid the claimant\u2019s medical and hospitalization expenses and commenced this action, claiming that defendant is the primary insurer. Plaintiff sought reimbursement from defendant for payments made to the claimant and a judgment declaring defendant liable for future medical and hospital expenses which might arise. Alternatively, plaintiff sought contribution from defendant in the event the trial court determined that the parties were both liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Each company moved for summary judgment. In a written opinion, the trial judge found that there was no conflict between the two \"escape clauses\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">Although it would be far easier simply to choose plaintiff\u2019s position as a means of implementing the policies of reducing No-Fault premiums and of promoting oversight of hospital and medical costs recognized in <em>LeBlanc v State Farm, </em>410 Mich 173 [301 NW2d 775] (1981), and <em>Nyquist v Aetna Ins Co, </em>84 Mich App 589 [269 NW2d 687] (1978), <em>aff\u2019d </em>404 Mich 817 (1979), the Court should perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>make a careful juxtaposition of the two policy provisions to see if there is, in reality, a conflict. I can find none. In defendant\u2019s elaborate attempt (attached as Exhibit 2 to plaintiffs brief) to deal with conflicting coordination of benefits provisions, it clearly makes itself secondary to \"benefits provided by 'no fault\u2019 legislation.\u201d Note that it does not refer to benefits provided by No-Fault <em>policies </em>purchased by the insured but rather to the benefits provided by No-Fault <em>legislation. </em>On the other hand, plaintiffs policy excludes amounts \"paid or payable\u201d by other insurance. Because defendant\u2019s policy pays no benefits in this situation, plaintiffs coordination of benefits language does not become effective by its own terms. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-3\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted and plaintiffs was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, and that Court reversed the decision of the trial court. <em>Federal Kemper Ins Co, Inc v Health Ins Administration, Inc, </em>135 Mich App 76; 351 NW2d 900 (1984). First, the Court characterized the policies as having conflicting \"other insurance\u201d provisions. Then, relying on <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Horace Mann Ins Co, </em>131 Mich App 98; 345 NW2d 655 (1983), <em>lv den </em>419 Mich 880 (1984), which followed the minority rule that where conflicting \"other insurance\u201d provisions exist, both are rejected, the Court prorated liability between plaintiff and defendant on the basis of the proportion of the combined policy limits represented by the limits of each insurer\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 422 Mich 936 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Before this Court, defendant first takes issue with the Court of Appeals conclusion that the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>policies involved contain conflicting \"other insurance\u201d provisions. Specifically, defendant claims that the Court of Appeals incorrectly characterized the following clause of its policy as an \"other insurance\u201d provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">Under \"No Fault\u201d legislation the benefits of this plan shall be determined after the benefits provided by \"No Fault\u201d legislation in those states where such legislation is in force and allowable by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Before addressing defendant\u2019s argument as to why the above clause is <em>not </em>an \"other insurance\u201d provision, some brief background may be instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Many insurance policies contain language intended to restrict or escape liability for a particular risk in the event that there is other insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such \"other insurance\u201d provisions are of three basic types: \"pro rata,\u201d \"escape,\u201d and \"excess.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A \"pro rata\u201d clause purports to limit the insurer\u2019s liability to a proportionate percentage of all insurance covering the insured event, while an \"escape\u201d or \"no liability\u201d clause provides that there shall be no liability if the risk is covered by other insurance, and an \"excess\u201d clause limits liability to the amount of loss in excess of the coverage provided by other insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Disputes may arise, as in the instant case, when two or more insurance policies covering the same risk contain such provisions. Moreover, various combinations of the clauses may occur <em>(e.g., </em>pro rata v excess, pro rata v escape, excess v escape), and courts have developed different rules for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>solving the conflicts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two trends have evolved. The majority rule attempts to reconcile the competing provisions by discerning the parties\u2019 intent through an analysis of the clauses. <em>See, e.g., Jones v Medox, </em>430 A2d 488 (DC App, 1981). Critics of this approach argue that it is circular and that the decision as to which clause is primary depends on which policy is read first. Thus some courts deem the provisions \"mutually repugnant\u201d and reject both clauses. <em>Lamb-Weston, Inc v Oregon Automobile Ins Co, </em>219 Or 110, 129; 341 P2d 110 (1958). Courts adopting this minority view, such as the Court of Appeals in the instant case, hold that liability must be prorated. Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Against this background, we return to defendant\u2019s argument, which attempts to distinguish its clause from a typical \"other insurance\u201d provision. Defendant argues that a typical \"other insurance\u201d provision, such as that in plaintiff\u2019s policy, requires reference to the other policy involved to determine whether the first policy provides benefits. Conversely, it is <em>not </em>necessary, defendant claims, to examine plaintiff\u2019s policy to ascertain whether defendant\u2019s policy provides benefits because its clause is a \" 'no-fault\u2019 <em>law </em>exclusion\u201d (emphasis in original). Defendant explains: Its pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>icy \"does not provide any benefits in a state which has a [n]o-[f]ault [a]utomobile [i]nsurance law until benefits provided for under [that] law are exhausted. . . . [Since] the Michigan no-fault law provides that a 'no-fault\u2019 insurer is liable to pay for all reasonable medical and hospital expenses which result from 'accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle,\u201d MCL 500.3105; 500.3107; MSA 24.13105; 24.13107, its policy does not provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We are not persuaded by this attempted distinction. Pip benefits are not payable pursuant to Michigan\u2019s no-fault law. The law requires a motor vehicle owner to obtain insurance affording pip benefits. MCL 500.3101; MSA 24.13101. Pip benefits are not paid directly by reason of the operation of the statute; rather, the statutory scheme contemplates that pip benefits will be paid under the required insurance. <em>Reynolds v Life Ins Co of </em>Virginia, 399 So 2d 519, 520 (Fla App, 1981), <em>lv den </em>411 So 2d 383 (Fla, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Thus, we agree with the Court of Appeals characterization of the two policies as containing conflicting \"other provisions.\u201d More precisely, each policy contains an \"excess\u201d provision. However, as noted above, the Court of Appeals resolved the conflict by disregarding both clauses and prorating liability. With this resolution, we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Certainly, the minority rule of <em>Lamb-Weston </em>upon which the Court of Appeals relied has the advantage of ease of application, and it has been almost always followed in cases involving competing \"excess\u201d clauses, even by those courts generally adopting the majority view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>case, however, unlike <em>Lamb-Weston, </em>the no-fault act is implicated. Thus, any analysis of these clauses must include consideration of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Recently, the Court of Appeals decided <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v Frederick &amp; Herrud, </em>Inc, 145 Mich App 722; 377 NW2d 902 (1985), a case similar to the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There, despite a clearly stated attempt by the health insurer to evade primary liability,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court discerned the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tive intent that no-fault coverage would be secondary, and, therefore, deemed the health insurance primary. We are persuaded that a similar analysis and result is proper in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">By 1974 PA 72, the Legislature enacted MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">An insurer providing personal protection insurance benefits shall offer, at appropriately reduced premium rates, deductibles and exclusions reasonably related to other health and accident coverage on the insured. The deductibles and exclusions required to be offered by this section shall be subject to prior approval by the commissioner and shall apply only to benefits payable to the person named in the policy, the spouse of the insured and any relative of either domiciled in the same household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This section mandates that no-fault carriers offer coordination of benefits at reduced premiums when the insured has \"other health and accident coverage.\u201d In <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 197; 301 NW2d 775 (1981), this Court recognized the dual purposes of \u00a7 3109a of \"eliminating] duplicative recovery and . . . containing] or reducing] insurance costs.\u201d See also <em>Nyquist v Aetna Ins Co, </em>84 Mich App 589, 592; 269 NW2d 687 (1978), <em>aff'd </em>404 Mich 817 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Both the <em>LeBlanc </em>and <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud </em>Courts quoted from a report on HB 5724 (enacted as \u00a7 3109a) which was prepared by the Analysis Section of the House Insurance Committee. The report gave several arguments in support of and in opposition to the bill. The arguments were based on the assumption that the coordination of benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>scheme would make health and accident insurance the primary coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Additionally, <em>LeBlanc </em>and <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud </em>relied on a letter to Governor William G. Milliken from Daniel J. Demlow, the Commissioner of Insurance, dated February 26, 1974, which expresses the view that the \"bill gives each consumer the chance to select or reject deductibles based on his existing non-automotive health and accident coverage.\u201d <em>LeBlanc, </em>pp 194-195, <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud, </em>p 731. As the <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud </em>panel noted, \"This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>statement makes sense only if health and accident insurance is considered primary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">Defendant urges that the objectives of eliminating duplicative recovery and containing insurance costs would also be served by giving effect to its coordination of benefits clause, thereby making its coverage secondary and plaintiff\u2019s primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">However, we note that the health insurer in <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud </em>made a similar argument, which was rejected by the Court. Section 3109a requires \"prior approval by the commissioner\u201d of \"[t]he deductibles and exclusions\u201d offered by no-fault carriers. By contrast, defendant, like the health insurer in <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud, </em>points to no evidence on the record that the Insurance Commissioner has approved its coordinated benefits coverage. The <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud </em>panel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">There is further no evidence that defendant\u2019s coordination-of-benefits clause was offered in such a way as to foster consumer savings, a major goal of \u00a7 3109a, ... or as to how premiums or employee co-pay were affected by this clause to insure that defendant is not reaping unearned premiums. That is, because no-fault is mandatory and coordination of benefits must be offered <em>at a reduced rate, </em>the insured gains an advantage from such a clause by the required reduction in premium while the insurer\u2019s reduced profits reflect a corresponding reduction in its potential liability. No such check necessarily applies to health and accident insurance. It would not be difficult to simply insert a coordination-of-benefits clause in a health and accident policy without a corresponding reduction in premium or co-pay where the determination of primary liability is covered by the policy language. <em>[Id., </em>p 733. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Similarly, other than defendant\u2019s conclusory statement that by offering coordination of benefits it \"is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>able to offer reduced premiums,\u201d there is no record evidence that its coordinated benefits coverage is offered at lower rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A further purpose of \u00a7 3109a \u2014 controlling health care costs \u2014 was recognized in <em>Dean v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>139 Mich App 266; 362 NW2d 247 (1984), <em>lv den </em>422 Mich 921 (1985), and noted in <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud, supra. </em>The <em>Dean </em>Court quoted the following argument from the analysis on HB 5724:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\"Argument For:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\"The skyrocketing hospital and medical costs could be contained to a greater extent with health and accident as the primary coverage since these policies, like the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, have established limits on their reimbursement of doctor and hospital expenses. A physician who knows his or her patient has unlimited medical coverage has no incentive to keep the doctor bill at a minimum.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>p 273. Emphasis deleted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">In <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud, </em>p 732, the Court contrasted health care expenses paid by no-fault insurance, noting that they are not subject to such limits. Thus, health care costs are contained by recognizing health insurance as primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Finally, defendant quotes from a bulletin issued by the Insurance Commissioner on April 5, 1974 (Bulletin AD 74-2), arguing that it evidences an understanding that when no-fault and health policies each purport to be secondary, as in the instant case, the no-fault policy is deemed primary. The bulletin contains guidelines to be followed in various situations. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">2. If auto insurance is secondary with no deductible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">a. and health is secondary with a deductible, auto pays the entire loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>b. and health is secondary with no deductible, auto pays the entire loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Defendant notes that plaintiff admitted in its answers to defendant\u2019s interrogatories that it had knowledge of Bulletin AD 74-2 at the time it issued the policy in the instant case, and suggests that plaintiff set the premium accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We are not persuaded that the result suggested by the bulletin should be determinative. While we agree that courts give weight in statutory interpretation to the opinion of administrative officials charged with implementing and enforcing the statutes being interpreted, <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>earlier we noted that the Insurance Commissioner, in his letter to the Governor, expressed his understanding that no-fault insurers could, as indeed they must, offer secondary coverage at the insured\u2019s option. Reading the bulletin and letter in isolation, the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s view is not entirely clear. The letter, however, is consistent with the legislative history surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 3109a. We think that if the bulletin guidelines labeled \"2(a)\u201d and \"2(b)\u201d above were strictly followed, health insurers could effectively and unilaterally deprive no-fault insureds of their option to obtain coordinated medical coverage at reduced premium rates by inserting exclusions like that in defendant\u2019s policy. Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded this at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We conclude, therefore, that defendant health insurer is primarily liable. Giving effect to plaintiff\u2019s coordinated benefits provision furthers the purposes of \u00a7 3109a to contain both auto insurance costs and health care costs, while eliminating duplicative recovery. Further, this result is consistent with the legislative scheme vesting in insureds, rather than insurers, the option of coordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>nating benefits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we so modify the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We assess no costs, a public issue being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-6\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Riley, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> MCL 500.3109a; MSA 24.13109(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> 44 Am Jur 2d, Insurance, \u00a7\u00a7 1781-1793, pp 769-782; 7A Am Jur 2d, Automobile Insurance, \u00a7\u00a7 432-437, pp 77-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\"> <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Jones v Medox, </em>430 A2d 488, 489, n 1 (DC App, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-5\"> See, <em>e.g., </em>Anno: <em>Resolution of conflicts, in non-automobile liability insurance policies, between excess or pro-rata \u201dother insurance\u201d clauses, </em>12 ALR4th 993; Anno: <em>Apportionment of liability between automobile liability insurers where one of the policies has an \"excess insurance\u201d clause and the other a \"proportionate\u201d or \"prorata\u201d clause, </em>76 ALR2d 502; <em>Union Ins Co (Mutual) v Iowa Hardware Mutual Ins Co, </em>175 NW2d 413, 416 (Iowa, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> In addition to the instant case, two Court of Appeals cases have taken this approach; <em>i.e., Farm Bureau, supra </em>(conflict between an \"escape\u201d clause and a \"prorata\u201d clause); <em>Mary Free Bed Hospital &amp; Rehabilitation Center v Ins Co of North America, </em>131 Mich App 105; 345 NW2d 658 (1983), <em>lv den </em>419 Mich 943 (1984) (conflicting \"excess\u201d provisions).

In lieu of automatic, fully comprehensive coverage by the auto insurer (under no-fault), under the proposed wrap-around deductibles, both the no-fault insurer and the health and accident company would be required to devote extra time and money to investigate an accident claim. They would have to reach an agreement to the extent to which each is responsible to the injured person. The rapid simplified reparations which have thus far characterized no-fault settlements would be bogged down by this process of double investigation and adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">\" 'Argument Against:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">\" 'No-fault insurers would be unable to establish fair and equitable rates since the multitude of wrap-around combinations would make it impossible to determine a schedule for the proposed deductibles and exclusions. No-fault is only 4 months old and insurance companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>have yet to accumulate enough data to establish those premiums confidently. Spokesmen for the industry claim 18 months of data are necessary for the establishment of accurate premiums for a specific no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\" 'Argument Against:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\" 'Required secondary coverage by no-fault providers raises many ambiguities concerning the insurance statutes since no-fault is, by law, a mandatory requirement. Persons who reduce their no-fault medical coverage and then change jobs, or become unemployed, or those who misrepresent their accident and health coverage could be left without the minimum coverage required by the no-fault statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">\" 'Argument Against:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">\" 'Primary coverage by health and accident insurers would weaken the coverage on many persons and would serve to confuse policyholders since it would substitute unknown, variable, noncompulsory benefits for compulsory, definitive and standardized benefits. No-fault is specifically designed to cover automobile accidents and injuries, offering the same basic coverage for everyone, but the accident and health insurers as well as Blue Cross/Blue Shield provide a puzzling number of alternative coverages, none of which are [sic] as complete and comprehensive as those of no-fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">\" 'Argument Against:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">\" 'The bill discriminates against auto personal injury protection (no-fault) insurers since it does not require the accident and health insurers or Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans to offer similar deductibles to persons desiring to make their comprehensive no-fault policies primary, with other coverages being secondary. If the intent of the bill is to save money for the consumer by offering a maximum of alternatives at reduced premiums, then health carriers should also be compelled to offer wrap-around coverage. If accident and health coverage were made secondary, the reduction in premiums would be much larger, particularly for persons whose policies include coverage for many dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">\" 'Neutral Discussion (Proposed Amendments):</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">\" 'The Michigan Association of Insurance Companies suggests offering consumers another alternative by requiring health and accident insurers (by statute) to offer at reduced rates, deductibles and exclusions to persons already covered under no-fault.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Frederick &amp; Herrud, supra, </em>pp 728-731.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> Our decision today is made in the factual context in which the no-fault insured chose coordinated coverage and the no-fault insurer, accordingly, charged a lower premium rate. We express no view as to what the result would be when the insured does not so elect and the no-fault premium is not correspondingly reduced. We note, however, that at oral argument, plaintiffs counsel admitted that in that situation the no-fault insurer would not be secondary, nor entitled to reimbursement from the health insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
