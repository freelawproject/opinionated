Wilhelmina received the trust income until her death in 1981. The question is whether Vasanti Ferrando Fithian, who was adopted by Wilhelmina in 1940, may, pursuant to \u00a7 128 of the Revised Probate Code, take as \"issue\u201d of Wilhelmina. We hold that Vasanti takes as issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The probate court found that \u00a7 128, read together with \u00a760 of the Revised Probate Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leaves \"no doubt that an adopted child is to be treated in all respects the same as a natural child,\u201d and held that Vasanti takes as \"issue.\u201d The Court of Appeals, relying in part on <em>In re Graham Estate, </em>379 Mich 224; 150 NW2d 816 (1967), reversed, saying that, because the Leggetts had died before the enactment of \u00a7 128, they should be presumed to have intended the meaning given the term \"issue\u201d at the times of their deaths. We agree with the probate court, and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Before the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 60 and 128, rules of construction were developed to determine the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tlor\u2019s \"intent\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when intent was not clear. The term \"issue\u201d is unclear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A rule of construction developed that the term \"issue\u201d did not include adopted children. <em>Graham, supra, </em>p 227. Another rule of construction provided that the meaning of a term in a will is to be \"determined according to the law in effect at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Graham, supra, </em>p 226.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both rules of construction were \"in effect\u201d at the time of the Leggetts\u2019 deaths.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>In 1966, the Legislature restricted the application of these common-law rules of construction by enacting \u00a7 128:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">In the construction of a trust agreement or will, whether <em>executed on, before, or after June 23, 1966, </em>the term \"child\u201d, \"grandchild\u201d, \"issue\u201d, \"heir\u201d, \"descendant\u201d, \"beneficiary\u201d or other equivalent term <em>shall </em>be construed to include any adopted person and his descendants whether natural or adopted <em>unless </em>a contrary intention appears by the terms of the instrument or <em>unless </em>the estate devised to the \"child\u201d, \"grandchild\u201d, \"issue\u201d, \"heir\u201d, \"descendant\u201d, \"beneficiary\u201d or other equivalent person vested before June 23, 1966, in an already ascertained person or persons who have an immediate indefeasible right of enjoyment or a present indefeasible fixed right of future enjoyment in the estate. [Emphasis added. 1966 PA 128, now MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In the instant case, because no \"contrary intention appears <em>by the terms </em>of the instrument\u201d (emphasis added), and because, in contrast with <em>Graham, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the estate devised to the issue of Wilhelmina did not \"vest\u201d before June 23, 1966, in an already ascertained person who had an \"indefeasible\u201d right of enjoyment, the statutory rule of construction set forth in \u00a7 128 governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">While \u00a7 128 supplanted the common-law rule of construction that accorded different treatment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>adopted persons <em>(In re Maloney Trust, </em>423 Mich 632; 377 NW2d 791 [1985]), it does not expressly repudiate the common-law rule of construction that the settlor\u2019s intent is to be determined by looking at the law in effect at the date of the settlor\u2019s death. Appellees contend that this common-law rule should be harmonized with \u00a7 128 by excluding from the scope of \u00a7 128 cases in which the settlor\u2019s death preceded the enactment of \u00a7128.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Section 128 provides that the term \" 'issue\u2019 . . . <em>shall </em>be construed to include <em>any </em>adopted person.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) This language is mandatory and leaves no room for a court to carve out an exception for a case where the settlor\u2019s death preceded the enactment of \u00a7 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Although \u00a7 128 was first enacted a year before <em>Graham </em>was decided, there is no reference to this enactment in Graham.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Graham </em>considered \u00a7 60, stating that an adopted child shall \"become an heir at law of the adopting parent or parents.\u201d Section 60 did not state, as does subsequently enacted \u00a7 128, a rule of construction of a trust agreement or will that an adopted child is \"issue\u201d unless certain explicitly stated exceptions are applicable; wills of settlors dying before the enactment of \u00a7 128 are not so excepted. The statement in <em>Graham, supra, </em>p 228, that \"[i]t was not competent for the legislature to change his will in that respect by statutory enactment adopted after his death\u201d spoke in \"respect\u201d to \u00a7 60, and not \u00a7 128 which was not considered in <em>Graham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-8\">Williams, C.J., and Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"> The last wills and testaments of John and Grace Leggett provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\"(e) The trustee shall pay over the net income of the trust estate quarterly or oftener, in its discretion, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">\"(1) To my daughters, <em>Wilhelmina </em>L. and Annabell L. in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\"(2) Upon the death of one of my daughters one-half to the surviving daughter and one-half to the <em>issue </em>of the deceased daughter, per stirpes, failing such issue to the surviving daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\"(3) Upon the death of the said surviving daughter, to my then living issue per stirpes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> \"Sec. 60.
