In <em>Rittenhouse, </em>the appellant also contends that the prejudgment interest against it was improperly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The facts leading to this appeal are largely undisputed in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"AQH\">\n<em>Rittenhouse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Karen Rittenhouse is the daughter of plaintiff Donald Rittenhouse. On the evening of June 14, 1973, Rittenhouse, then a sixteen-year-old high school student, was at home with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Kerry Erhart. At approximately 10:00 p.m., they left in Erhart\u2019s 1969 Chevrolet, saying that they would return soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">About 7:00 a.m. the following morning, the Er-hart family automobile was found parked in a nearby subdivision with the two teenagers inside. The ignition switch was in the \"on\u201d position, but the engine was not running. Carbon monoxide poisoning caused the death of Erhart, and Rittenhouse suffered brain injuries from which she has not fully recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>On December 20, 1974, plaintiff obtained an order appointing him next friend of Karen Rittenhouse, and he filed a complaint listing Earl M. Erhart (father of the deceased) as the sole defendant. Appellant North Woodward Mufflers, who had installed the exhaust system on the Erhart auto, entered the case when a second amended complaint was filed on October 12, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Other defendants were also named, but they settled for the combined amount of $395,000 prior to or during trial. At trial the jury found that appellant was negligent and that plaintiff had suffered damages in the amount of $1,500,000. Earl Erhart was not found to have been negligent. The jury also found that plaintiff had been twenty percent comparatively negligent. The trial judge computed prejudgment interest from the date of the filing of the second amended complaint and the amount of judgment in the manner proposed by appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">$1,500,000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"AZR\">- 300,000 Twenty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"Acr\">$1,200,000</p>\n<p id=\"AVK\">- 395,000 Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"AmD\">$ 805,000 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"AtN\">The Court of Appeals affirmed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the circuit court\u2019s judgment, except that it recomputed the amount of the judgment against appellant in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">$1,500,000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"ASF\">- 395,000 Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"AKf\">$1,105,000</p>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">- 221,000 Twenty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"ABH\">$ 884,000 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The Court of Appeals also noted that plaintiff had failed to cross-appeal the issue of when the prejudgment interest should have begun to run. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to appeal on a particular issue, which the Court of Appeals granted, and the Court ruled that interest should have been calculated from the date the original complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We granted North Woodward\u2019s application for leave \"limited to the following issues: (1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in its method of calculating the judgment amount, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals erred in its determination of the date from which the appellant is to be charged judgment interest.\u201d 418 Mich 955 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>Gagnon</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Plaintiff, Michael Gagnon, suffered a broken leg and other complications as a result of an industrial accident on July 26, 1976. Plaintiff filed suit naming several defendants including appellant, Dresser Industries. Settlements totaling $100,000 were made with other defendants, and plaintiff went to trial against Dresser only.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The jury found appellant negligent and that plaintiff had suffered $200,000 worth of damages. It also found, however, that plaintiff was fifty percent comparatively negligent. The trial court entered a judgment on the verdict in the manner proposed by plaintiff:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">$200,000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">\u2014100,000 Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">$100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">\u2014 50,000 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"A3Jz\">$ 50,000 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Defendant appealed, contending that the judgment should have been calculated in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">$200,000 Plaintiffs damages</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u2014100,000 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">$100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u2014100,000 Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">$ 0 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In a per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 130 Mich App 452; 344 NW2d 582 (1983). We, thereafter, granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 419 Mich 917 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\n<em>Jackson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Plaintiff, Michael Jackson, was injured while working at a construction site in 1977. He was accidentally struck in the face with a shovel wielded by a coworker. Suit was filed against the general contractor and the appellant, Barton-Ma-low. After plaintiff and the general contractor settled for $150,000, the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">The jury, as in the companion cases, was not informed of the settlement. Plaintiff was found to have suffered $400,000 in damages. The jury found plaintiff seventy-five percent negligent and defendant twenty-five percent negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">Defendant successfully urged the trial judge to compute the amount of judgment accordingly:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">$400,000 Plaintiffs damages</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">\u2014300,000 Seventy-five percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">$100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">\u2014150,000 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">$ 0 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">Plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>modified the amount of the judgment by the following method:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">$400,000 Plaintiffs damages</p>\n<p id=\"A3c\">\u2014150,000 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">$250,000</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u2014187,500 Seventy-five percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">$ 62,500 Judgment against appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">131 Mich App 719; 346 NW2d 591 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered this case to be argued and submitted with <em>Rittenhouse </em>and <em>Gagnon. </em>419 Mich 917 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">In 1978, the Legislature decreed that comparative negligence be applied in products liability cases. MCL 600.2949(1); MSA 27A.2949(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">(1) In all products liability actions brought to recover damages resulting from death or injury to person or property, the fact that the plaintiff may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery by the plaintiff or the plaintiff\u2019s legal representatives, but damages sustained by the plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">One year later this Court formally<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted the doctrine of comparative negligence in <em>Placek v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979). The pure comparative negligence form was adopted, because it is the one which \"most nearly accomplishes the goal of a fair system of apportionment of damages.\u201d <em>Id., </em>660. This is the only doctrine that \"truly distributes responsibility according to the fault of the respective parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Citing <em>Kirby, supra, </em>the <em>Placek </em>Court also noted that one of the virtues of pure comparative negligence is that it does not \" 'unjustly enrich\u2019 anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also, the following language from <em>Kirby </em>was approved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">The doctrine of pure comparative negligence does not allow one at fault to recover for one\u2019s own fault, because damages are reduced in proportion to the contribution of that person\u2019s negligence, whatever that proportion is. The wrongdoer does not recover to the extent of his fault, but only to the extent of the fault of others. To assume that in most cases the plaintiff is more negligent than the defendant is an argument not based on equity or justice or the facts. What pure comparative negligence does is hold a person fully responsible for his or her acts and to the full extent to which they cause injury. That is justice. <em>[Id., </em>661.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">With these general principles in mind, we now turn to the issue in the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Appellants contend that the amounts of plaintiffs\u2019 total-damages in these cases must be reduced by the percentages of comparative negligence returned by the juries before subtractions of the settlements. They assert that the percentages of comparative negligence assigned to each plaintiff are factual findings of the proportion of responsibility on each plaintiff\u2019s part in bringing about the injury. Each plaintiff\u2019s total damages should thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>according to appellants, be reduced by the degree of fault in bringing about the injury, <em>i.e., </em>the jury\u2019s finding of the percentage of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The fundamental flaw in this argument is that there is no indication that the juries in these cases determined the plaintiffs\u2019 percentages of negligence by comparing their actions to all the possible tortfeasors. Rather, the juries only weighed the responsibility of the plaintiffs as to the defendants at trial. It would thus be inaccurate to reduce plaintiffs\u2019 total damages by a percentage which only applies to the trial parties and not all tortfeasors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In analyzing appellants\u2019 contention, it is essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tial to delineate the limited nature of the trials in these cases. In each case, the plaintiff commenced suit against multiple defendants. Plaintiffs achieved settlements with some defendants and went to trial against others. The juries were not instructed on the existence of the settlements or of the amounts received. <em>Brewer v Payless Stations, </em>412 Mich 673; 316 NW2d 702 (1982). Also, importantly, the negligence or fault of the settlers, in causing plaintiffs\u2019 damages, was not an issue litigated before the juries by virtue of the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ments. Nor was the fault of the settlers in causing plaintiffs\u2019 damages an issue as to the nonsettling tortfeasors, as the settlements guaranteed that the settlers were immune from contribution from the trial defendants. MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4). Moreover, it would not serve the non-settling defendants\u2019 goal of limiting their liability to attempt to show that the settlers were more the cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries than they. This is so because if the nonsettler was found to be negligent and the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries at all, then he would be liable for all of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries (less settlements and comparative negligence) no matter how much negligence was attributable to the settlers. We thus believe that the focus of trial, such as the ones in the cases at hand, will normally be upon only the conduct of the trial parties. Accordingly, the percentages of comparative negligence returned by these juries represent findings applicable only to the trial parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would be inaccurate to reduce plaintiffs\u2019 <em>total </em>damages by a percentage not applicable to the <em>total </em>causal negligence. Also, once the settlements occurred, the total damages were no longer at stake for the trial parties. Rather, under MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), the amount remaining in issue at trial was reduced by the settlement amounts. In relevant part, \u00a7 2925d provides:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">(b) <em>It reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors </em>to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Accordingly, by the time of trial, the \"claim\u201d of each plaintiff against the .nonsettling tortfeasors was an amount equal to the total damages minus the settlements. <em>Mayhew v Berrien Co Road Comm, </em>414 Mich 399, 410; 326 NW2d 366 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Contrary to the assertion of the dissent, our position is not that the \"plaintiffs 'claim\u2019 [against the nonsettling defendants] includes] the percentage of damages attributable to the plaintiff[\u2019s]\u201d own negligence. Rather, we hold that a plaintiffs percentage of fault in these trials was determined only in relation to the defendants participating at trial. Therefore, a plaintiffs comparative negligence should only be deducted from that part of the judgment to be paid by the defendant who was the only other party to a determination of fault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Prior to subtracting the plaintiffs comparative fault from this judgment, the settlement between the plaintiff and the nonparty tortfeasors should be subtracted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This settlement may, and presum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ably will, be based, among other things, on an estimate of the comparative fault of the parties to the settlement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Scott v Cascade Structures, </em>100 Wash 2d 537; 673 P2d 179 (1983), the majority, en banc, adopted the rule advocated by appellants here. We find, however, the reasoning of the dissent more convincing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">The comparative fault of [plaintiffs was] calculated not as a percentage of total fault, but as a percentage of the fault of the parties remaining in the action. Logically, this limited comparative fault figure should be applied not to total damages but to only those damages attributable to the parties remaining in the action. <em>[Id., </em>546 (Utter, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Also, the dissent noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[A]ll allocation of fault at trial [is] among only those parties still remaining in the case. Logically, such fault apportionment figures should be applied to a correspondingly limited damages figure, <em>i.e., </em>only those damages attributable to the remaining parties. This limited damages figure is to be created by the deduction from total damages of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>court approved settlement, since that settlement should approximate the damages attributable to the settling defendants. <em>[Id., </em>548. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The limited nature of these trials was also succinctly analyzed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Gagnon </em>in the context of the facts of that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">[P]laintifFs entire claim for injuries [is] the amount of total damages which the jury has found, in the present case, $200,000. . . . [T]his \"claim\u201d should be reduced by the amount of settlement, $100,000 here, recognizing that the settlement represented satisfaction of the third party\u2019s liability, thus removing the issue of the third party\u2019s fault from subsequent litigation between plaintiff and the nonsettling tortfeasor, <em>Mayhew, supra. </em>Applying this analysis, the trial [is] then confined to the issue of how to apportion fault as between the plaintiff and nonsettling tortfeasor for the remaining $100,000 in damages. The jury would not have to face the problem of determining the liability of non-parties; its sole duty would be to allocate fault among the parties who were represented at trial, plaintiff and the nonsettling tortfeasor. [130 Mich App 458-459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We concur in this reasoning, as it correctly delineates the limited scope of the trials in each of these suits and recognizes that the percentages of comparative negligence returned by the juries are applicable only to the parties , at trial and not to all possible wrongdoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Appellants also assert that the form jury instructions led the jurors to believe that the amount of total damages awarded would be reduced by the plaintiffs\u2019 percentages of comparative negligence. Specifically, appellants point to SJI2d 66.01, which was given in each case here. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the instructions, it was initially established that defendants were negligent and that this negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The juries then found plaintiffs\u2019 \"total amount of damages.\u201d Each jury also determined that plaintiffs were negligent and that their negligence was also a proximate cause of the injuries. In <em>Jackson </em>and Gagnon, the following instruction was given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Using 100 percent of the total combined negligence [which proximately caused the injury to plaintiff], what percentage of such negligence is attributable to the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">A similar instruction was given in <em>Rittenhouse.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Gagnon </em>the forms also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Please note that the Court will reduce th\u00e9 total amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages [entered] by the percentage of negligence attributable to plaintiff, if any, [found]. The remainder will be the amount which plaintiff is entitled to recover.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Appellants urge that the juries\u2019 findings on these instructions manifest an intent by the jury that plaintiffs receive a net damages award of an amount equal to the total damages minus the percentage of comparative negligence found by the juries.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We agree that the instructions given could have this effect and that to that extent they are misleading. However, we do not agree that the jury\u2019s possible intent in a limited trial between only the parties that have not settled should be determinative as to the total recovery against all tortfeasors. The juries were never told that it was their responsibility to fix the final figure to be received by the plaintiffs. To the contrary, it was made clear to them that their responsibility was to answer specific questions about damages and comparative fault. The most these instructions meant to the jurors was that the plaintiffs would be entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>certain amount from the trial defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The jurors did not know the extent of negligence or amounts of settlements with other tortfeasors. Thus, they could not accurately determine a complete net recovery for plaintiffs. Assuming arguendo, the juries were operating under the erroneous interpretation that plaintiffs would receive a set amount from these defendants, it would be equally true that they erroneously assumed that the defendants would pay a set amount. We thus decline to allow speculation on the juries\u2019 speculation of the outcome to control our decision as long as the jury was properly informed of its responsibility. In <em>Brewer, supra, </em>we held that juries should not know of the settlements of joint tortfeasors and accordingly of the ultimate subtraction of the settlements from the jury\u2019s verdict, and in <em>May-hew, </em>we held that the jury may not determine the comparative fault of parties not at trial. These holdings compel the conclusion that juries are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>normally in possession of enough information to find the plaintiff\u2019s damages and the fault of the trial parties. These necessarily limited findings should not, as appellants contend, be given inordinate weight so that they control the ultimate outcome of complex litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">It is our conclusion that a more accurate and just verdict, consistent with the principles enunciated in <em>Placek </em>can be best arrived at by reducing the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence vis-\u00e1-vis the nonsettling tortfeasor by deducting it from the \"claim\u201d against that same nonsettling tortfeasor rather than from the total damages. That \"claim\u201d under the statute as interpreted in <em>Mayhew </em>is \"the total liability of the joint tortfeasors minus the amount of the settlement. . . .\u201d 414 Mich 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue in each case is affirmed, with costs awarded to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Karen Rittenhouse suffered her injuries on June 14-15, 1973. On December 20, 1974, the plaintiff filed his original complaint naming only Earl Er-hart (the father of the deceased) as a defendant. Appellant North Woodward Mufflers first entered the case when a second amended complaint naming it as defendant was filed on October 12, 1976. The trial court ordered that plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest from appellant from the date the second amended complaint was filed. The Court of Appeals held that plaintiff was allowed interest from the date of the original complaint. Appellant contends that it should only be liable for interest from the date of the second amended complaint, when it was first made a party to the action. Since the jury returned a verdict of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cause of action on the original complaint, appellant asserts that the interest should only be allowed on the complaint where liability was found. MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">(1) Interest shall be allowed on \u00e1 money judgment recovered in a civil action, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(2) For complaints filed before June 1, 1980, . . . the interest on the judgment shall be calculated <em>from the date of \u00f1ling the complaint </em>to June 1, 1980 at the rate of 6% per year and on and after June 1, 1980 to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually.

Section 6013 plainly says that \"interest on the judgment shall be calculated from the date of the filing of the complaint.\u201d Had the Legislature borne the intent ascribed by appellant, it would have simply provided, for example, that interest runs \"from the date of the filing of the complaint or amended complaint first filed against the judgment debtor\u201d or \"from the date of the complaint against the party named in the judgment.\u201d Instead, the wording of the statute is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ambiguous, and we will not read into it provisions that the Legislature elected not to include.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Even an examination of the rules of statutory interpretation still compels us to conclude that the Court of Appeals reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Section 6013 is a remedial statute which is to be liberally construed in favor of a plaintiff, the intended beneficiary of the legislation. <em>Denham v </em>Bedford, 407 Mich 517, 528; 287 NW2d 168 (1980). Appellant asserts that the central purpose of \u00a7 6013 is to encourage prompt resolution of lawsuits and that it could not have settled its suit until a complaint was filed. However, we have held that \" '[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 6013] is to <em>compensate </em>the prevailing party for the expenses incurred in bringing an action and for the delay in receiving money damages.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Wood v DAIIE, </em>413 Mich 573, 589, n 17; 321 NW2d 653 (1982), affirming 99 Mich App 701; 299 NW2d 370 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The evolution of \u00a76013 into its current form supports this conclusion. As of 1961, \u00a7 6013 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Execution may be levied for interest on any money judgment recovered in a civil action, such <em>interest to be calculated from the date of judgment </em>at the rate of 5% per year unless the judgment is rendered on a written instrument having a higher rate of interest in which case interest shall be computed at the rate specified in the instrument if such rate was legal at the time the instrument was executed.

The first modification evidences a compensatory policy of allowing interest from the date the plaintiff formally initiates an action to recover damages. The latter addition to \u00a76013 demonstrates a policy of encouraging settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">1980 PA 134 rewrote \u00a7 6013 by dividing what had been one paragraph into five subsections. MCL 600.6013(1); MSA 27A.6Q13(1) provides that interest accrues from the date of the complaint. Subsections (2), (3), and (4) concern the appropriate rate of interest, which was increased by the 1980 act. Section (5) involves the trial court\u2019s discretion to stop the accruing of interest under certain circumstances where settlement offers have been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The history shows that the purpose of \u00a7 6013(1) is compensatory. The policy of encouraging settlements is embodied in subsection (5). Thus, while appellant is correct that one of the policies of \u00a76013 is to encourage settlements, its reliance is misplaced when it focuses on subsection (1) rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>than subsection (5). The legislative intent to encourage settlements is embodied in subsection (5) and since that subsection does not address the amended-complaint issue here we are convinced that the Legislature intended interest to accrue from the date of the filing of the complaint in these circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-5\">Williams, C.J., and Cavanagh, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b351-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, J., in part I only.</judges>\n<author id=\"b351-7\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8G\">The computation issue presented by these appeals concerns a joint tortfeasor\u2019s substantive right to a credit for amounts received by a plaintiff in settlement with other potentially liable joint tortfeasors for the same injury. Because the principles of joint and several liability have not been displaced by the adoption of comparative negligence, the computation approach approved by the majority today may result in double recovery in direct contravention of the long-established rule that a tort victim is entitled to only one satisfaction for an indivisible injury sustained, and that a defendant is entitled to a setoff for amounts received by the plaintiff in a prior settlement. <em>Larabell v Schuknecht, </em>308 Mich 419; 14 NW2d 50 (1944).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The majority\u2019s decision in this regard is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>any legal or factual basis and is an affront to the fundamental principles of the comparative negligence doctrine as it has been developed through the decisions of this Court. Furthermore, my colleagues\u2019 decision requires a strained interpretation of the language of the applicable statutory setoff provision, MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), codified and embodied within the contribution statutes, MCL 600.2925a-600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(1)-27A.2925(4). The majority concludes that a plaintiff found to have been contributorily negligent should have the amount received in a prior partial settlement deducted from the factfinder\u2019s determination of total damages which includes the percentage of the damages which the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The effect of this computation approach is to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence factor and thereby to increase the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s recoverable damages. The plaintiff\u2019s \"claim against the other tortfeasors,\u201d within the meaning of the contribution statute, is interpreted, by the majority, as including the percentage of the damages attributable to the plaintiff, which is, pursuant to the doctrine of comparative negligence, not recoverable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The majority\u2019s reasoning is premised on a number of false presumptions. The majority presumes that the relative negligence of a settling defendant is attributed to the plaintiff by the factfinder in determining what percentage of the plaintiff\u2019s damages was proximately caused by that plaintiff\u2019s own negligence. Theoretically, the potential relative liability of a settling defendant (percentage of fault relative to other defendants), if any, is assumed by the nonsettling defendants, and not attributable to the plaintiff. Hence, the reason for reducing the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the nonsettling defendants by the amount of the settlement. Any potential effect upon a jury\u2019s determination concerning the amount of a plaintiff's contributory negligence because of the absence of a released defendant is speculative at best. Indeed, none of the plaintiffs-appellees in the present cases have argued otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet, the majority takes this speculative reasoning even further than its advo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cates have argued and implies that a settling defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence is somehow directly and equally attributed to the plaintiffs percentage of contributory negligence. Each of the hypothetical illustrations set forth within footnotes 3 and 7 of the majority opinion is based upon this false presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">By misconstruing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mayhew v Berrien Co Road Comm, </em>414 Mich 399; 326 NW2d 366 (1982), the majority assumes that in determining the amount of a plaintiffs contributory negligence the factfinder is prohibited from considering all of the factual circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs injury, and may only consider the trial defendants\u2019 negligence in this regard. The issue decided in <em>Mayhew, </em>however, was not even related to this issue and the consistent reference to <em>Mayhew </em>in the majority opinion, as holding that the plaintiffs amount of contributory negligence must be determined by comparing the plaintiff\u2019s negligence with the negligence of the trial defendants only, is simply unfounded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Although its decision is entirely premised upon this speculation and unwarranted interpretation of <em>Mayhew, </em>the majority further expressly states: \"[W]e hold that a plaintiffs percentage of fault [is to be] determined only in relation to the defendants participating at trial.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 182. First, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>must be noted that this was not the accepted rule at the time of any of the trials in the present cases. Second, this proposition is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the comparative negligence doctrine, and principles of joint tort liability generally, because it implies that a plaintiffs claim for damages may be bifurcated against separate joint or concurrent tortfeasors with regard to a single indivisible injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">In <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), this Court held that a plaintiff found to have been contributorily negligent in causing his own injury is still entitled to recover to the full extent that his injury was caused by the tortious conduct of others. A plaintiff\u2019s recovery in such cases has not heretofore been limited by the percentage of fault attributable to the trial defendants; it is the plaintiff\u2019s percentage of negligence that determines the total amount of his <em>recoverable </em>damages. The implications of the majority\u2019s express, if incidental, holding in this regard may adversely affect plaintiffs in such cases, and, in any event, will result in inaccurate findings of fact concerning a plaintiff\u2019s percentage of contributory negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>I. Contribution Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The computation issue presented by these cases concerns the appropriate application of the setoff provision incorporated within the statutory scheme embodied in the contribution statutes, MCL 600.2925a-600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925U)-27A.2925(4). The contribution-release section here in question, MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">When a release ... is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(a) It does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(b) It reduces <em>the claim against the other tortfeasors </em>to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release ... or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">(c) It discharges the tort-feasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tort-feasor. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">This statute allows a plaintiff to settle with less than all of the alleged tortfeasors, without discharging his claim against the remaining tortfeasors. It also allows the settling tortfeasor to escape liability for contribution, whatever the settlement amount or degree of fault.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs \"claim against the [remaining] tort-feasors,\u201d however, is reduced by the amount of the settlement._</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The approach approved by the majority construes the plaintiffs \"claim\u201d against the nonsettling defendants as including the percentage of the damages attributable to the plaintiffs own negligence. This construction is inconsistent with the general comparative negligence principles adopted in <em>Placek, supra, </em>and by legislative act applicable in all products liability actions, MCL 600.2949(1); MSA 27A.2949(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The flaw in this characterization of the plaintiffs \"claim\u201d is that it does not distinguish the plaintiffs negligence in causing his own injury from the negligence of the defendant-tortfeasors. A plaintiffs negligence in this regard relates to a failure to use due care for his own protection. Unlike the defendant\u2019s negligence which relates to the lack of due care for the safety of others, the plaintiffs negligence is not tortious. A plaintiff found to have been contributorily negligent in causing his own injury, therefore, cannot be characterized as a \"tort-feasor\u201d with regard to his own injury. Recognizing this distinction in <em>American Motorcycle Ass\u2019n v Superior Court, </em>20 Cal 3d 578, 589-590; 146 Cal Rptr 182; 578 P2d 899 (1978), the California Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Moreover, even when a plaintiff is partially at fault for his own injury, a plaintiff\u2019s culpability is not equivalent to that of a defendant. In this setting, a plaintiff\u2019s negligence relates only to a failure to use due care for his own protection, while a defendant\u2019s negligence relates to a lack of due care for the safety of others. Although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>recognized in <em>Li </em>[v <em>Yellow Cab Co of California, </em>13 Cal 3d 804; 119 Cal Rptr 858; 532 P2d 1226 (1975)] that a plaintiffs self-directed negligence would justify reducing his recovery in proportion to his degree of fault for the accident, the fact remains that insofar as the plaintiffs conduct creates only a risk of self-injury, such conduct, unlike that of a negligent defendant, is not tortious. (See Prosser, Law of Torts [4th ed] \u00a7 65, p 418.) [Cited in <em>Lemos </em>v <em>Eichel, </em>83 Cal App 3d 110, 117; 147 Cal Rptr 603 (1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The conclusion that the proportion of damages attributable to the plaintiffs own negligence is to be included as part of the plaintiffs \"claim\u201d against the nonsettling defendants is inapposite. The determination concerning whether and to what extent a plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to his injury is necessary, specifically, to determine whether and to what extent a claim exists. The language of the statutory setoff provision here in question does not lend itself to the majority\u2019s characterization of the plaintiff\u2019s \"claim.\u201d That the Legislature intended to confer a substantive right upon plaintiffs to deduct settlement amounts from the proportion of the plaintiffs damages found to have been self-inflicted is questionable. To quote Judge Marutiak\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Jackson v Barton Malow Co, </em>131 Mich App 719, 727; 346 NW2d 591 (1984): \"The statute clearly anticipates that plaintiff\u2019s negligence will be factored against the gross assessment of damages before the settlement amount is to be subtracted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Unless \u00a7 2925d is constitutionally invalid, it governs and must be applied. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s attempt to reconcile its decision with the language of this statutory provision, the only possible construction that is consistent with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>decision is that \"the claim against the other tortfeasors\u201d is the total amount of damages before application of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault percentage. This construction was expressly given to \u00a72925d by the Court of Appeals in <em>Gagnon v Dresser Industries, </em>130 Mich App 452, 458; 344 NW2d 582 (1983). See <em>ante, </em>p 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">II. Comparative Negligence Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Placek, supra, </em>this Court abrogated the contributory negligence doctrine and replaced it with the doctrine of comparative negligence. \"Comparative negligence\u201d is a term of art which distinguishes contributory negligence as a partial bar to recovery from contributory negligence as a total bar. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">As a matter of terminology we replace the doctrine of contributory negligence. In actuality, however, it is contributory negligence as a <em>total </em>bar to recovery which is replaced. The effect of this action is to establish contributory negligence as a partial bar to recovery by insuring that any recovery of damages by a plaintiff be reduced to the extent of his or her own negligent contribution to the injury. [Emphasis in original. <em>Placek, supra, </em>650, n 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In adopting the pure form of comparative negligence, the Court in <em>Placek, </em>660-661, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">The \"pure\u201d form does not \"unjustly enrich\u201d anyone. For example, if an accident is wholly the fault of one party, then that party would not, of course, recover damages. If an injured plaintiff was 51% to blame, then there still remains 49% of the fault which was not plaintiff\u2019s, and for which therefore the person who caused that much of the injury should be liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">The doctrine of pure comparative negligence does not allow one at fault to recover for one\u2019s own fault, because damages are reduced in proportion to the contribution of that person\u2019s negligence, whatever that proportion is. The wrongdoer does not recover to the extent of his fault, but only to the extent of the fault of others. . . . What pure comparative negligence does is hold a person fully responsible for his or her acts and to the full extent to which they cause injury. That is justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Thus, in cases in which the negligence of the plaintiff is at issue, a specific determination concerning the extent to which the plaintiffs negligence contributed to his injury is necessary in order to determine the total amount of recoverable damages. It should be noted that this determination is not made in relation to each defendant. The relative degrees of fault attributable to the defendants in such cases is not an issue relevant to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is relevant only as between the tort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>feasors themselves, in an action for contribution, when available. MCL 600.2925b; MSA 27A.2925(2), MCL 600.2925c; MSA 27A.2925(3). The present jury instructions, which are modeled after the suggested instructions set forth in the appendix to <em>Placek, </em>only require assigning a percentage to the plaintiffs contributory fault. Percentages are not assigned to any of the defendants in making this determination, whether they have participated at trial or settled and been released. In assigning a percentage of contributory fault to the plaintiff, the jury is instructed to consider what percentage of the total fault (one hundred percent) is attributable to the plaintiff. The balance is assumed by the defendants. In a contribution action, the factfinder is instructed to assign percentages of fault to each defendant considering the total fault of the defendants only, so that the percentages add up to one hundred percent. See SJI2d 43.01A, 43.01B, 72.01A and 72.01B.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In each of the present cases the juries were instructed and directed that if they found negligence on the part of the defendants they would then proceed to assess the total amount of the plaintiffs damages and determine whether the plaintiff was negligent. If he was, they were then to go on to express that negligence in the form of a percentage which would be used to reduce the total amount of the plaintiffs damages. In each case, the matter was submitted to the jury in special verdict form per <em>Placek, </em>and in each case the plaintiffs were found to have negligently contributed to their injuries. For example, in <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Gagnon, </em>the matter was submitted to the jury in the form of special questions as set forth in SJI2d 66.01. Question number three of SJI2d 66.01 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Question Number 3: What is the total amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Answer: $__</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Question number six of SJI2d 66.01 poses the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Question Number 6: Using 100 percent as the total combined negligence which proximately caused the injury or damage to the plaintiff, what percentage of such negligence is attributable to the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">Answer: _percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">Please note that the Court will reduce the total amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages entered in Question No. 3 by the percentage of negligence attributable to plaintiff, if any, entered in Question No. 6. The remainder wdll be the amount which plaintiff is entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Thus, the juries in each case were asked to determine, using one hundred percent as the <em>total combined negligence which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, </em>what percentage was attributable to the plaintiff. In <em>Jackson, </em>the jury determined that the plaintiff\u2019s total damages were $400,000 and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s negligence at seventy-five percent. In <em>Gagnon, </em>the jury determined that the total damages were $200,000 and that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was fifty percent responsible. In <em>Rittenhouse, </em>the jury assessed the plaintiff\u2019s total damages at $1,500,000 and found the plaintiff to be twenty percent at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Applying the computation method approved by the majority (i.e., deducting the settlement amount before applying the plaintiff\u2019s percentage of negligence), reduces the plaintiff\u2019s fault percentage below that found by the jury. Applying the method approved by the majority to the present cases has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the following effect. In <em>Jackson, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s total recovery is increased to $212,500, and, thus, the jury\u2019s determination concerning the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence is reduced from seventy-five percent to slightly less than forty-seven percent (46.875 percent). In <em>Gagnon, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s total recovery is $150,000, and the jury\u2019s finding that fifty percent of the damages were attributable to the plaintiff is reduced to twenty-five percent. In <em>Rittenhouse, </em>the plaintiff recovers $1,279,000, and the jury\u2019s assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s fault percentage is reduced from twenty percent to fifteen percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">This approach results, in every instance, in the modification of the jury\u2019s determination concerning the percentage of damages attributable to the plaintiff. In fact, the greater the proportion of fault attributed to the plaintiff toward one hundred percent, the greater such a modification occurs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Two other jurisdictions that have adopted pure comparative negligence, by judicial decision and by legislative act, have addressed this precise computation issue. The courts of both jurisdictions have rejected the approach approved by the majority in these cases because it is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of comparative negligence and contradictory to the statutory setoff provisions of those states, which are substantially similar to the setoff provision incorporated within Michigan\u2019s statutory scheme.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The California Court of Appeals addressed this precise calculation issue in <em>Lemos v Eichel, </em>83 Cal App 3d 110; 147 Cal Rptr 603 (1978). The court rejected the approach approved by the majority in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the present cases, stating that applying the percentage reduction to the total damage before deducting the settlement is necessary to comply with the principles of the comparative negligence doctrine, adopted by the California Supreme Court in <em>Li v Yellow Cab Co of California, </em>13 Cal 3d 804; 119 Cal Rptr 858; 532 P2d 1226 (1975), because it \"[reduces] the plaintiffs damages 'in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person recovering.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lemos, supra, </em>118 (citing <em>Li, supra, </em>829). The court said that \"deducting the settlement first in effect reduces the fault percentage below that found by the jury,\u201d and, therefore, the court concluded that \"the correct procedure is to apply each plaintiffs contributory fault percentage reduction to the total damage and reduce the resulting figure by the amount of that plaintiff\u2019s pretrial settlement.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id., </em>118-119. The California Supreme Court has approved the <em>Lemos </em>court\u2019s decision in this regard. See <em>Aceves v Regal Pale Brewing Co, </em>24 Cal 3d 502, 512, n 4; 156 Cal Rptr 41; 595 P2d 619 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Washington Supreme Court rejected the approach approved by the majority in the present cases in <em>Scott v Cascade Structures, </em>100 Wash 2d 537; 673 P2d 179 (1983). Applying the Washington contribution-release statute, Wash Rev Code, \u00a74.22.060(2), which is analogous to Michigan\u2019s in all relevant respects,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court held that the percentage of the plaintiff\u2019s fault was to be deducted prior to the settlement reduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">The purpose of the contribution statute is to ensure that a plaintiff receives that to which he or she is entitled. Accordingly, we conclude the proper method of calculation is to reduce the jury award by the percentage of fault attributable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the plaintiff before deducting the settlement award. <em>[Id., </em>545.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Washington court also noted that under the gross damages approach (deducting settlement amounts from total damages), the percentage of fault attributable to the plaintiff would fall below the actual percentage determined by the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I agree with the analyses of the California Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court and conclude that the reasoning advanced by the majority in supporting its decision affirming the Court of Appeals decisions in the instant cases is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Rittenhouse, </em>126 Mich App 674, 683-684; 337 NW2d 626 (1983), relied entirely upon <em>DeMaris v Brown, </em>27 Wash App 932; 621 P2d 201 (1980), in deciding this issue. The Washington Court of Appeals decision in <em>DeMaris, </em>however, was directly reversed by the Washington Supreme Court in <em>Scott, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>458-459, based its decision upon an incorrect extension of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mayhew, supra, </em>and a strained construction of the language of MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In <em>Jackson, supra, </em>722-723, the Court of Appeals decision was based upon the prior decisions in <em>Gagnon, </em>and <em>Rittenhouse. </em>The majority in <em>Jackson </em>also cited <em>Mayhew, DeMaris, supra, </em>and the policy of encouraging settlements in support of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">[T]here is no indication that the juries in these cases determined the plaintiffs\u2019 percentages of negligence by comparing their actions to all the possible tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">[PjlaintifFs percentage of fault . . . was determined only in relation to the defendants participating at trial. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 178, 182.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The majority asserts that in determining the extent of a plaintiffs contributory fault a jury\u2019s \" 'sole duty [is] to allocate fault among the . . . plaintiff and the nonsettling tortfeasor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 185 (quoting <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>458-459).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">These statements are less than accurate and thus misleading. The juries in these cases did not determine the defendants\u2019 percentages of relative fault in relation to the plaintiffs contributory fault at all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In determining the plaintiffs\u2019 comparative negligence the juries in each of these cases were only required to assign percentages to the plaintiffs\u2019 contributory fault. These necessary determinations were not made \"only in relation to the defendants participating at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Pursuant to the fundamental principles of the comparative negligence doctrine, factual determinations concerning what percentage of a plaintiffs injury, if any, was caused by that plaintiffs contributory fault are necessary to determine the total amount of that plaintiff\u2019s recoverable damages. Because plaintiffs in such cases are entitled to recover to the full extent of the fault of others, this necessary determination is not to be made \"only in relation to the defendants participating at trial.\u201d Rather, this determination should reflect the percentage of the plaintiffs injury that was proximately caused by the negligence of others, including those who have settled and been released from liability, and others who, for a variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of possible reasons, have not participated at trial. This is the only way that a plaintiffs total amount of recoverable damages can accurately be determined, and it is the only way which complies with the comparative negligence principle enunciated in <em>Placek, supra, </em>and with the principles of joint tort liability generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Nothing in the past decisions of this Court precludes a plaintiff, defending against an assertion of comparative negligence, from presenting all of the factual circumstances surrounding the injury, including the conduct of settling parties or other parties that for some reason are not present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">That factual determinations concerning a plaintiffs contributory fault are to be made only in relation to nonsettling tortfeasors and that a settling tortfeasor\u2019s relative fault is somehow attributed to plaintiffs in such cases was refuted by this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Mayhew, supra. </em>In <em>Mayhew, </em>this Court ruled that the statutory setoff provision incorporated within the contribution statute has survived the judicial adoption of comparative negligence, and rejected the assertion that the plaintiffs recovery against nonsettling defendants should be reduced by the percentage of fault attributable to the settling defendants rather than the amount of the settlements. The defendants in <em>Mayhew </em>argued that to comply with principles of pure comparative fault, the nonsettling defendants\u2019 liability should be reduced by the settling defendants\u2019 percentage of fault because the nonsettling defendants\u2019 liability should be limited to their proportion of fault. See 12 ULA, Uniform Comparative Fault Act, \u00a7 6 (1985 Supp). The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the statutory language was clear and, therefore, should be applied. The Court, noting that the adoption of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>parative negligence did not displace principles of joint and several liability, held that the nonsettling defendants\u2019 liability was to be reduced by the settlement amounts only, regardless of the settling defendants\u2019 relative fault. The <em>Mayhew </em>Court stated that the \"defendants\u2019 argument [was] not without logic,\u201d <em>id., </em>405, and that \"allocation of liability by the tortfeasors\u2019 relative degree of fault is an important goal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>410. Nevertheless, the Court held, applying the statutory setoff provision reflected in MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), \"that the liability of the defendant non-settling tortfeasors is the total liability of the joint tortfeasors minus the amount of the settlement of the settling tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>410. The \"total liability of the joint tortfeasors\u201d from which the settlement amount is to be deducted is, as referred to in <em>Mayhew, </em>the total amount of damages not caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence. The rationale advanced by the <em>Mayhew </em>Court was that its decision was consistent with the policies of \"(1) encouraging settlements and (2) assuring that a plaintiff is fully compensated for injuries sustained.\u201d <em>Id., </em>411-412. The statute encourages settlement because the nonsettling defendants, in cases in which a plaintiff receives amounts in settlement from other potentially liable parties which are less than commensurate to the proportionate fault of those parties, risk liability in excess of their proportionate fault. The statute assures that a plaintiff is fully compensated for the same reason: The non-settling defendants assume all liability in excess of amounts received by the plaintiff in settlement. In reaching its decision in <em>Mayhew, </em>the Court offered an example of the calculation and deduction method envisioned by the applicable statutory setoff provision. The calculation method approved by the majority in the present cases is inapposite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to the example offered in <em>Mayhew. </em>See <em>Id., </em>408, n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The issue decided in <em>Mayhew </em>did not concern the method by which a jury is to determine the plaintiff\u2019s percentage of comparative negligence. However, the arguments of the defendants and the plaintiff in <em>Mayhew, </em>as well as the Court\u2019s analysis and decision, were based on the legally and factually correct premise that a settling defendant\u2019s relative percentage of fault is assumed by the nonsettling defendants and not equally attributed to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In <em>Brewer v Payless Stations, Inc, </em>412 Mich 673; 316 NW2d 702 (1982), the parties were in agreement concerning the amount of settlement and the calculation method for the deduction. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brewer </em>was limited to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">Does the judge or the jury deduct the amount of the settlement . . . under the facts of this case in which evidence of the amount has no bearing on a material issue of fact? <em>[Id., </em>675.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The Court noted, quoting MRE 402, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible. <em>[Id., </em>675, n 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The defendant in <em>Brewer </em>argued that the jury should be fully informed of settlement amounts \"if it is to deliver a considered judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>677. The plaintiff argued that informing the jury of settlement amounts may be prejudicial to a plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tiff for a variety of reasons. <em>Id. </em>The Court agreed with the plaintiff in <em>Brewer </em>and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">When there is no genuine dispute regarding either the existence of a release or a settlement between plaintiff and a codefendant or the amount to be deducted, the jury shall not be informed of the existence of a settlement or the amount paid, unless the parties stipulate otherwise. <em>[Id., </em>679.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In reaching its decision in <em>Brewer, </em>the Court noted that the issue in that case could cut both ways; some of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments could be used by a defendant, and vice versa. <em>Id., </em>678.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The cases considered today stand as examples of the <em>Brewer </em>Court\u2019s observation concerning the double-edged nature of the arguments for and against allowing the jury to make the settlement deductions. In the instant cases the plaintiffs argue that if the juries had been informed of the settlement amounts, and had been required to make the deductions, their determinations may have been different, resulting in more favorable judgments for the plaintiffs. Likewise, the plaintiffs argue that if the juries had been required to determine the percentages of fault attributable to the settling defendants, their determinations concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 percentage of contributory fault may have been lower.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiffs argue, and the majority agrees, the settlement amounts should be deducted from the total damages before the reduction for the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">It should be noted that none of the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the present cases has challenged this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Brewer </em>or <em>Mayhew. </em>Nor did any of the plaintiffs object to the jury instructions given in each case. They each argue that -these factors should only be considered at the calculation stage, and, thus, their arguments are limited to supporting the suggested deduction method they have advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The problems with this analysis are many. First, it has no basis in fact; both arguments are premised on speculation. Second, as the Court noted in <em>Brewer, </em>these arguments cut both ways. The plaintiff in <em>Brewer </em>successfully argued that allowing the jury to make the settlement deduction would prejudice the plaintiff. Third, and most importantly, this calculation approach is contradictory to the fundamental principles of the comparative negligence doctrine and is not supported by the language of the applicable statutory setoff provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Since <em>Placek, </em>the jury instructions used by the trial courts of this state have been modeled after the suggested jury instructions set forth in the appendix to that reported decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> None of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>applicable jury instructions indicate that a plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault percentage should fluctuate depending on how many defendants are present at trial. They do, however, inform the jury that this finding of fact will be used to determine the \"amount which plaintiff is entitled to recover,\u201d and that it should be made in relation to the \"total combined negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>As stated in <em>Placek, </em>by general definition, and as reflected in the jury instructions given in each of the present cases, the factual finding concerning the extent of a plaintiffs contributory fault reduces the total amount of that plaintiffs damages, and the remainder is the total amount which is recoverable. This factual determination must be applied to reduce the plaintiffs total damages before deducting settlement amounts. There is no legal or factual basis to support crediting amounts received by a plaintiff in partial settlement, in such cases, to the percentage of damages attributable to the contributory fault of that plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I am in respectful dissent. I would reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgments of the trial courts in <em>Rittenhouse </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>and I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Gagnon </em>and remand that case to the trial court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">III. Prejudgment Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">With regard to the prejudgment interest issue in <em>Rittenhouse, </em>this Court construes \"the complaint\u201d within the meaning of the prejudgment interest statute, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, as the formal complaint filed against the defendant upon whom the prejudgment interest is being taxed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Thus, we hold that prejudgment interest commences to accrue, and therefore should be calculated, from the date of the filing of the complaint upon the defendant against whom the judgment has been entered. In the instant case it was at that time that an action commenced against the defendant, North Woodward Mufflers.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We are persuaded that the purposes of the prejudgment interest statute are not furthered by the dissent\u2019s argument with respect to this issue, and the relation back of amendments to complaints for other purposes is not analogous. That the Legislature intended plaintiffs to be compensated for periods during which no disputed claim even existed against the judgment debtor strains credulity. Likewise, the laudable purpose of encouraging settlements is not applicable to periods during which no claim existed against the defendant. A statute must be construed in the light of the purpose sought to be accomplished thereby. <em>Lakehead Pipe Line Co v Dehn, </em>340 Mich 25, 34; 64 NW2d 903 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Thus, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Rittenhouse </em>as to the calculation of prejudgment interest issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We assess no costs on this issue, neither party having prevailed in full.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-9\">Ryan, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b376-10\">Levin, J., concurred with Riley, J., in part III only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-23\"> 126 Mich App 674; 337 NW2d 626 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-15\"> In <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585; 256 NW2d 400 (1977), three justices of this Court voted to adopt the comparative negligence doctrine in Michigan. As expressed in the opinion by Justice Williams, that view was by and large adopted by the Court in <em>Placek </em>two years later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> The inaccuracies that would result by the adoption of appellants\u2019 method are convincingly demonstrated by the following hypotheticals.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">A. Plaintiff suffers $1000 worth of damages and names two tortfeasors in an action. Each of the parties is one-third responsible (negligent) in bringing about the injuries, and one tortfeasor settles for $333. The case then proceeds to trial between plaintiff and one tortfeasor. Since the trial parties are equally negligent and the juries will only assess the fault of the trial parties <em>(Mayhew), </em>each one will be considered fifty percent negligent. The amount of damages plaintiff is found to have suffered should not change because of the settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The plaintiff ideally should receive a total recovery of $666.00, because the plaintiff is thirty-three percent comparatively negligent as to all responsible parties for $1000 worth of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Also, ideally, both tortfeasors should be liable for $333 as they are each one-third responsible for the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Appellees\u2019 proposed version:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">$1000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">\u2014 333 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">$ 666</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">\u2014 333 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\">$ 333 Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">+ 333 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b336-18\">$ 666 Plaintiff\u2019s net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">Appellants\u2019 proposed version:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">$1000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">\u2014 500 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">$ 600</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">\u2014 333 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>$ 167 Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">+ 333 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">$ 500 Plaintiff\u2019s net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As can be seen, appellants\u2019 calculation, in effect, treats plaintiff as if he were fifty percent comparatively negligent when he was actually thirty-three percent negligent. Also, the appellants\u2019 version has the effect of reducing the settlement amount by the comparative negligence percentage. We believe it is more accurate to assume that any possible comparative negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part has already been taken into account in the settlement process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">B. Plaintiff suffers $1000 worth of damages and is again thirty-three percent comparatively negligent. There are two tortfeasors who are also each one-third responsible for the injuries. Ideally, each tortfeasor is liable for $333 worth of damages, but one settles for $200 while the other goes to trial. As in the first hypothetical, the jury will find each trial party fifty percent comparatively negligent, as they are equally at fault and the negligence of the settlor may not be considered. <em>Mayhew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Again, plaintiff\u2019s ideal net recovery is $666.66. Since he received $200 in settlement, the optimal judgment against the trial defendant is $466.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Appellees\u2019 version:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">$1000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\u2014 200 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\">$ 800</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\u2014 400 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">$ 400 Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">+ 200 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"APQ\">$ 600 Plaintiff\u2019s net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Appellants\u2019 version:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">$1000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">\u2014 500 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">$ 500</p>\n<p id=\"b337-17\">\u2014 200 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b337-18\">$ 300 Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">+ 200 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">$ 500 Plaintiff\u2019s net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">Due to low settlement, each method results in plaintiff receiving less than the ideal amount. However, appellee\u2019s version has the virtue of making plaintiff closer to being whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-21\">C. A final possible solution is where the settling tortfeasor settles for an amount greater than that for which it is actually liable. If plaintiff and two tortfeasors are each equally at fault for $1000 worth of damages, defendants are liable for $333 each. If one tortfeasor settles for $500, the ideal recovery against the nonsettlor will be $166.66, making plaintiff\u2019s total net recovery $666.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Appellees\u2019 version:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">$1000 Plaintiff\u2019s damages</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u2014 500 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">$ 500</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u2014 250 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">$ 250 Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">+ 500 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">$ 750 Plaintiffs net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"AB8\">Appellants\u2019 version:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">$1000 Plaintiffs damages</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u2014 500 Fifty percent comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">$ 500</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">\u2014 500 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">$ -0- Judgment against nonsettling tortfeasor</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">+ 500 Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">$ 500 Plaintiffs net recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b338-19\">Due to the inaccurately high settlement, appellees\u2019 version results in a recovery greater than is ideal, while appellants\u2019 computation still achieves a recovery below the optimal result. However, appellees\u2019 approach, as in the first two examples, is closer to the ideal. We believe that in the vast majority of cases the settlement process will insure that the settlement is not likely to exceed the tortfeasor\u2019s liability. Even if this does not always occur, the higher accuracy of the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals is evident under the first hypothetical. A calculation that allows plaintiff to recover only to the extent of the fault of others is mandated by comparative negligence principles. In the ideal situation where a tortfeasor has settled for the exact amount of its actual liability, appellees\u2019 version correctly distributes the liability among the remaining parties while appellants\u2019 method assigns plaintiff an artificially high percentage of comparative negligence. When the settlement amount is below an accurate amount, and in many cases where it is above the ideal figure, the appellees\u2019 computation will result in a net recovery closer to the optimal amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-4\"> This conclusion is supported by the following jury instruction given here:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\"If you find that each <em>party </em>was negligent and that the negligence of each <em>party </em>was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries, then you must determine the degree of such negligence expressed as a percentage attributable to the plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The instruction speaks only of the negligence of each <em>party </em>and not of that of the settlers or others whose negligence may have caused the damages. We must assume that the juries followed these instructions and determined the \u201cdegree\u201d of negligence of each \"party\u201d expressed as a percentage attributable to the plaintiff and did not assign a percentage to plaintiff applicable to nonparties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> In <em>Mayhew, </em>we enunciated this same rule from the viewpoint of defendant liability as follows: \"the liability of the defendant non-settling tortfeasors is the total liability of the joint tortfeasors minus the amount of the settlement of the settling tortfeasor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> The dissent cites <em>Lemos v Eichel, </em>83 Cal App 3d 110, 116; 147 Cal Rptr 603 (1978), for the proposition that the comparative negligence factor should be deducted before the settlements.

Do not try to do it, okay, </em>if you get to that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The emphasized portion belies appellant Dresser Industries implicit argument that the calculations were actually carried out by the jury during deliberations. It is better to assume, as we must, that the jury followed the instructions and did nothing \"beyond answering [the] questions\u201d on the verdict form. There is also no showing in <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Rittenhouse </em>that the juries carried out the mathematics necessary to have in mind a net recovery for plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> The dissent interprets the instruction \"[u]sing 100 percent as the total combined negligence which proximately caused the injury or damage to the plaintiff\u201d to mean that the jury considered plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault in respect to all tortfeasors, whether present at trial or not. In <em>Mayhew, supra, </em>where the nonsettling defendant was seeking to apportion fault to a settling tortfeasor, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\"[Njumerous difficulties would be presented if we were to allow the jury to apportion damages among all tortfeasors, including a settling non-party. It would mean that the settling tortfeasor\u2019s liability would be assessed without anyone adequately representing that interest. It would put the plaintiff in a unique trial situation. The plaintiff would not only have to advocate that he was not at fault, he would have to convince the jury that the non-party was only minimally at fault. Otherwise, there might be too great a percentage of fault attributed to the non-party, thus reducing the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.\u201d 414 Mich 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">If as we said in <em>Mayhew, </em>it would be difficult for the plaintiff to try to defend against the relative fault of a nonparty defendant, how, indeed can we expect the plaintiff in this situation to defend against his contributory negligence vis-\u00e1-vis nonparty defendants. If the instructional reference to \"total combined negligence\u201d was interpreted \u201dto include the negligence of nonparty tortfeasors, it would be left to the plaintiff and defendant to argue the relative negligence of the nonparty tortfeasors, notwithstanding the \"numerous difficulties\u201d alluded to in <em>Mayhew.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\"> For example, in <em>Rittenhouse, </em>two of the defendants actively participated in the trial for several weeks until they settled before the verdict.

Also, in <em>Gagnon, </em>the appellant\u2019s theory of the cases, read by the court to the jury, provided in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\"Defendant contends that it was the owner\u2019s responsibility [the owner is one of the settling defendants] for maintaining the crane, that it was his improper maintenance which was the proximate cause of the Plaintiff\u2019s accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">In <em>Jackson, </em>the person who wielded the shovel which struck plaintiff was not named as a defendant, and the jury was not able to assess his degree of responsibility, if any. It is short sighted to presume that the juries believed their findings on damages and comparative negli, gence would be the only basis upon which plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate net recovery would be calculated.

The total liability of the joint tortfeasors, however, is not the total amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages, but only the amount that was not caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence. In order to determine the amount of total liability of the joint tortfeasors, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s percentage of contributory negligence must first be deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s total damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The majority\u2019s attempt to reconcile its holding that settlement amounts are to be deducted from total damages before applying the plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault percentage with the language of the applicable statute is perplexing. Was the Court incorrect in <em>Mayhew v Berrien Co Road Comm, </em>414 Mich 399, 402-403; 326 NW2d 366 (1982), when it stated: \"the law does not contemplate judicial abrogation of constitutional legislative enactments because not reasonably related to a judicial decision\u201d?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> None of the plaintiff-appellees in the present cases have argued that a settling defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence is in fact correlatively attributed to both the nonsettling defendants and the plaintiff. They each argue, in the words of plaintiff-appellee Gagnon, that \"[t]he simple fact is, we don\u2019t know\u201d whether the jury\u2019s finding concerning the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence would have been different had the settling defendants been present at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> The issue decided in <em>Mayhew </em>was whether the settling defendants\u2019 proportionate fault was to be used to reduce the nonsettling defendants\u2019 liability, rather than the amount of the settlements as required by the applicable provision of the contribution statute. MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4). That issue did not concern the method by which a jury is to determine what percentage of a plaintiffs total damages is attributable to that plaintiffs own contributory negligence, which is necessary in order to determine what percentage is recoverable. This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mayhew, </em>therefore, does not mandate that a jury must balance the plaintiffs negligence with the negligence of the trial defendants only, in determining what percentage of the total damages the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If anything, the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mayhew </em>implies the opposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> This issue was not briefed in the present cases, nor has it been directly addressed in any of the past decisions of this Court.

The heretofore recognized rule (adopted in <em>Placek </em>and reflected in the jury instructions), as noted by the Court in <em>Mayhew, </em>assures that plaintiffs will be fully compensated, even if amounts received in settlement are less than equal to the relative fault of the settling defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\"> A settling tortfeasor may also recover contribution if the requirements of MCL 600.2925a(3); MSA 27A.2925(1)(3), and MCL 600.2925c(4); MSA 27A.2925(3)(4) are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> MCL 600.2949(1); MSA 27A.2949(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\"In all products liability actions brought to recover damages resulting from death or injury to person or property, the fact that the plaintiff may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery by the plaintiff or the plaintiff\u2019s legal representatives, but damages sustained by the plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> In situations in which a plaintiff has sustained a single indivisible injury, although that injury may have been caused in varying degrees by joint tortfeasors, the plaintiff is entitled to only one satisfaction.

The applicable jury instruction, SJI2d 41.04, which should be given in such cases, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\"SJI2d 41.04 Damages Not to Be Allocated among Joint Tort-Feasors</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\"If your verdict is for the plaintiff against <em>[both defendants/more than two defendants], </em>you may not divide the damages <em>[between/ among] </em>them, but you shall return a verdict in one single sum against <em>[both defendants/those defendants whom you \u00f1nd to be liable].\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Thus, the relative degrees of fault attributable to joint tortfeasors is never an issue relevant to the plaintiff.

However, the percentage of negligence attributable to the plaintiff will be used by the Court to reduce the amount of damages which you find to have been sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">\"The Court will furnish a Special Verdict Form to assist you in your duties. Your answers to the questions in the Special Verdict Form will provide the basis on which this case will be resolved.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">None of the applicable Standard Jury Instructions indicate that, in determining what percentage of a plaintiff\u2019s damages is attributable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>to the plaintiff\u2019s negligence (and, therefore, for which the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover), a jury should only consider the plaintiff\u2019s negligence relative to the trial defendants\u2019 negligence, in situations in which less than all the possible tortfeasors are present at trial. Rather, they instruct juries to decide what percentage of the <em>total combined negligence </em>is attributable to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> Nevertheless, if these jury instructions become inadequate or ambiguous in situations in which some party who is potentially at fault for the plaintiff\u2019s injury is not present at trial, then perhaps they should be modified. If, as the majority asserts, the only way that the negligence of a settling tortfeasor will not be attributed to the plaintiff is by requiring the jury to assign a percentage of negligence to each tortfeasor, whether at trial or not, then perhaps adopting this procedure should be considered. See <em>ante, </em>p 182, n 6 (citing the California comparative negligence jury instruction). Short of actually requiring the jury to assign percentages to each party, the current instructions could be modified to clarify the nature of the crucial determination concerning the plaintiff\u2019s percentage of contributory negligence to assure that a settling defendant\u2019s relative fault is not somehow attributed to the plaintiff. It must be emphasized again, moreover, that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mayhew </em>does not prohibit a jury from considering the fault of parties not present at trial in determining the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault. Nor does <em>Mayhew </em>prohibit a jury from assigning percentages to reflect each party\u2019s relative fault in making this determination. Furthermore, the passage from <em>Mayhew </em>quoted, out of context, by the majority would not be applicable to the present analysis. See <em>ante, </em>p 187, n 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The <em>Mayhew </em>Court concluded (correctly, I believe) that if it were to adopt the defendants\u2019 argument in that case (i.e., that the nonsettling defendants\u2019 liability should be reduced by the settling defendants\u2019 percentage of fault rather than the amount of the settlements), plaintiffs would be put in a \"unique trial situation\u201d because they would be forced to defend the settling defendants\u2019 relative fault. Because a plaintiff\u2019s recovery against nonsettling defendants would be reduced by the relative fault of settling defendants, a plaintiff would not only have to defend his own conduct but also the relative fault of a settling defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Unlike the situation referred to in <em>Mayhew, </em>a plaintiff defending against an assertion of comparative negligence generally, relative to the total combined negligence that caused the indivisible injury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to the total number of possible tortfeasors whether present at trial or not, would only be required to defend his own contributing negligence. The relative fault of the settling defendants would be attributed to the nonsettling defendants and not used to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Therefore, the concern expressed with regard to the issue in <em>Mayhew </em>is inapplicable within the present context.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Finally, it should be noted that the current jury instructions will have to be modified, in any event, to reflect the majority\u2019s express holding that \"a plaintiff\u2019s percentage of fault [is to be] determined only in relation to the defendants participating at trial,\u201d which in my opinion is a serious error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b376-11\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAI\">I concur in the result reached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Justice Riley on the issue in these cases regarding settlement setoff computations. There is no requirement that a jury determine a plaintiffs negligence by comparing the plaintiffs actions to all possible tortfeasors. A jury is not and should not be permitted to adjust a plaintiffs fault upward or downward on the basis of the fault of an absent defendant. The jury is to determine the plaintiffs fault in bringing about the <em>injuries, </em>expressed as a percentage of damages. The remainder is attributed to the universe of factors that caused damages, as to which the defendant at trial is responsible if the defendant\u2019s action was \"a\u201d proximate cause of the injury. Moreover, in these cases, the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct which contributed to the damages is exactly the same irrespective of the presence or absence of any defendants. Stated otherwise, if the settling defendants had been present at trial in these cases, and if our system permitted determination of relative fault among the defendants, the factfinder could not permissibly conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct was comparatively less or greater vis-\u00e1-vis one defendant or another. In each of these cases, the plaintiffs conduct is a constant, is relevant to the injuries, and is not based on the relative fault of all the potential tortfeasors. The majority has thus created a rule of compensation on the basis of an assumption which, on these facts, is not legally permissible. The result of today\u2019s decision may do harm to the societal objective of full compensation for tort victims. <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979). Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>I concur with Justice Riley\u2019s opinion on the prejudgment interest issue in <em>Rittenhouse v Erhart.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
