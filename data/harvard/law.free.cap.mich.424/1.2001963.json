We reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In <em>Buckey,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two members of the Court of Appeals panel also held that questions by the prosecutor during cross-examination of defendant concerning whether various prosecution witnesses were lying constituted error requiring reversal. Here again, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The <em>McWhorter</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>panel also found that the prosecutor erred in questioning defendant about his financial condition at times both before and after an alleged kidnapping. We remand the case to the Court of Appeals for a determination whether this was error that requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Finally, after we granted the prosecutors\u2019 appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cations for leave to appeal, both defendants brought cross-appeals alleging other errors which had not been addressed by the Court of Appeals. We remand the cases to the Court of Appeals for consideration of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">A. <em>People v Buckey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Defendant Buckey was convicted of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the second degree. An earlier trial resulted in a mistrial when the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict. In both proceedings, Buckey was charged with and tried for the completed offense of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. MCL 750.520c(l)(f); MSA 28.788(3)(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Testimony established that defendant met the complainant at a bar on the evening in question and that after some period of time the two left in a jeep. Defendant drove to a field and stopped the vehicle. The complainant testified that defendant touched her breasts and that he forced her to touch his exposed genitals. She further testified that she struggled with defendant to get out of the jeep and that, when she did get out, defendant grabbed her, pushed her to the ground, and got on top of her. At that point a car pulled up, and she got out from under defendant and ran over to the car. The occupants, four boys, gave her a ride home. The four boys testified to seeing defendant either push the complainant to the ground or hold her on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Defendant gave a statement to the police when he was arrested in which he claimed that the complainant had not objected to his sexual advances. He further stated that she \"freaked out\u201d after she declined his proposition of further sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>activity. He stated that nothing happened on the ground outside of the jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">At trial, defendant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his statement, except for his description of what had happened outside of the jeep. He testified that she had fallen to the ground as she got out of the vehicle. She tried to kick him and may have fallen again as she ran to the boys\u2019 car, and he may have fallen at that time as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">During his closing argument in both trials the prosecutor made the following unobjected-to remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">If you\u2019ll recall his cross-examination testimony you\u2019ll recall that he testified that he was present at the preliminary examination back in December of 1981. He sat through the whole thing, he heard Debbie DeFord testify, he heard one of the boys testify, and he also admitted that he\u2019d reviewed, to some extent anyway, the police report in connection with this case. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this [sic, his] doing that, per se, reviewing the police report, but the point is, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the defendant knew \u2014 and also he was the last witness to testify in this case \u2014he knew before he took the witness stand, completely, what the People\u2019s proofs were going to be. He knew completely what they were. He also admitted that he sat through proceedings in this case back in February of this year. All of our witnesses, except Trooper Stayer, testified at that time. He indicated on the witness stand he heard them all testify. He testified, himself, back then. He was cross-examined at that time. He indicated that he later heard all the remarks that both I made and his attorney made, concerning that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the point is that the defendant has known for some time precisely what the People\u2019s proofs were going to be. He\u2019s had plenty of time to try to figure a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>around our proofs and also to get prepared to tell his story in a convincing manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Following his conviction, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing, inter alia, that certain questions asked of him on cross-examination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the above-quoted closing argument con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>stituted prosecutorial misconduct which deprived him of his right to a fair trial. All three members of the panel agreed that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument resulted in error requiring reversal, relying on <em>People v Fredericks, </em>125 Mich App 114; 335 NW2d 919 (1983), and <em>People v Smith, 73 </em>Mich App 463; 252 NW2d 488 (1977), <em>lv den </em>402 Mich 803 (1977). Judge Cynar disagreed with the majority\u2019s finding that the cross-examination was improper and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, writing that a timely objection could have cured any prejudice. <em>People v Buckey, </em>133 Mich App 158, 167; 348 NW2d 53 (1984) (Cynar, J., <em>concurring in part).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">B. <em>People v McWhorter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Defendant McWhorter was charged and convicted of conspiracy to kidnap, MCL 750.349, 750.157a; MSA 28.581, 28.354(1), and kidnapping, MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The. facts are succinctly set forth in the Court of Appeals opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arose out of the abduction of David Nixon from defendant\u2019s law office by William Snyder and Joseph Postelwaite. The evidence tended to show that the kidnapping was arranged by defendant as a means of extorting payment of legal services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">Defendant was retained by Douglas Suess to represent his parents and a friend who had been arrested in Florida while driving trucks filled with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>marijuana. The marijuana was being shipped to other states, including Michigan, as part of an operation equally run by Suess and Nixon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">Nixon owed Suess his share of the proceeds from marijuana sales which had accumulated during the course of the venture. Suess intended to pay defendant with some portion of these proceeds; however, Nixon refused to provide him with any money. When Nixon refused to pay Suess, defendant told him to be more emphatic and forceful with Nixon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Ultimately, defendant offered Snyder the opportunity to work off fees which Snyder owed to him. Defendant asked Snyder to follow Nixon and scare him into giving Suess some money. Snyder proved to be unable to accomplish the task and suggested recruiting some help. The pair agreed to seek assistance from Postelwaite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">At some point, Snyder, Postelwaite, Suess, and defendant all met at defendant\u2019s office. Defendant indicated that Nixon would be coming in shortly. The group agreed that if the meeting with Nixon did not go right and he would not pay the money, they would grab him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Nixon arrived at defendant\u2019s office and went downstairs with defendant into his law library. An argument ensued. Defendant returned from the library and told Snyder to grab Nixon as soon as possible. Defendant and others then left the office. Snyder and Postelwaite bound Nixon with a cord and took him to Postelwaite\u2019s farm where he was tied to a tree. Nixon eventually agreed to pay $30,000. When this offer was conveyed to defendant, he agreed to accept the deal and arrangements were made for collecting the funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Defendant denied involvement in the extorting of money from Nixon. He claimed that he only learned that Nixon had been beaten and abducted after the fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">A careful review of the record indicates that defendant confirmed much of the prosecution wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>nesses\u2019 testimony, while denying those parts which would incriminate him. He made repeated references to other witnesses\u2019 testimony or lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The meeting at defendant\u2019s office and the abduction took place on May 14, 1977. On the following day, Nixon paid $30,000 in cash and was released. Defendant\u2019s secretary picked up $15,000 in cash from Snyder and Postelwaite in a grocery store parking lot and took the money to defendant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">I\u2019m not going to belabor that, because I think the line is drawn. I think on the one side of that line you have one person, two persons, six people and on the other side of the line you have Bob McWhorter who says here is where I was and all the other people who were involved say, hey, Bob, you were over here with us. What are you trying to tell us? You didn\u2019t know what was going on. You were obvious [sic] as to what was going on. We are the patsies on the other side of this line. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, says Bob Mc-Whorter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Well, I challenge you and I ask you to look at that because that is where the line is drawn. Did he know? Did he not know? When you think about how that line is drawn, I want you to remember this. How many of those other witnesses were present in the courtroom during this testimony? How many people knew where that line was so when it came time to walk that line you knew where to walk? I submit to you only one person knew where that line was because that one person heard all that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\"><em>[Defense </em>Attorney]: I will object, Your Honor. That is the defendant\u2019s right in every case. In fact, he has to be present during all the testimony. That\u2019s improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\"><em>The Court: </em>You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>[Prosecuting </em>Attorney]: Thank you, Your Honor. Specifically, Bob McWhorter is the only person who knew where to go, knew where the testimony had to go to avoid any implications and I submit to you he took that line and he walked it very carefully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, raising numerous allegations. Relying on <em>People v Fredericks, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions, finding error requiring reversal in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The common issue in these cases has been addressed by two panels of the Court of Appeals, with differing results. The issue was first considered in <em>People v Smith, supra. </em>The <em>Smith </em>Court found the prosecutor\u2019s unobjected-to remark, that the defendants\u2019 presence in court gave them opportunity to conform their testimony, \"inadvisable.\u201d However, it held that the error was harmless because a curative instruction could have cured any prejudice. <em>Smith, supra, </em>470-471.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The other case was <em>People v Fredericks, supra. </em>The <em>Fredericks </em>Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because the prosecutor had argued to the jury that the defendant may have altered his testimony to match the testimony of other witnesses he had heard during the trial. As in <em>Smith, </em>the defendant in <em>Fredericks </em>had not objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Unlike <em>Smith, </em>however, the <em>Fredericks </em>Court found the error to be of the type that could not be considered harmless. This conclusion was based on the Court\u2019s finding that the argument infringed on a fundamental right, <em>i.e., </em>the right to be present at trial, which, the Court noted, is guaranteed by statute, MCL 768.3; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>MSA 28.1026, and by the United States Constitution, US Const, Am VI. The <em>Fredericks </em>Court analogized the comment to prosecutorial references to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Comments of the latter type are erroneous because they infringe on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; <em>People v Mancill, </em>393 Mich 132; 223 NW2d 289 (1974). The <em>Fredericks </em>Court believed that just as comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify \"place[s] an intolerable burden on the defendant\u2019s decision to exercise or forego his right to remain silent,\u201d reference to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to conform his testimony to that of other witnesses impermissibly burdens his right to be present at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">This method of discrediting a testifying defendant\u2019s version of the facts places the defendant between the horns of an intolerable dilemma: the defendant must decide to either present himself at trial and risk being discredited by his presence or absent himself from trial and avoid the risk. A defendant in this position cannot freely exercise his right to be present at trial. Therefore, we hold that, in his argument to the jury, a prosecutor may not attempt to discredit a defendant\u2019s testimony by reference to the defendant\u2019s presence at the trial. <em>[Fredericks, supra, </em>120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In contrast to <em>Smith </em>and <em>Fredericks, </em>cases from other jurisdictions have found similar remarks to be permissible argument on credibility. In telling brevity, the courts have rejected arguments identical to defendants\u2019 at bar that such remarks impermissibly infringe on the right to be present at trial. <em>State v Martin, </em>101 NM 595, 599; 686 P2d 937 (1984); <em>State v Hoxsie, </em>101 NM 7, 9; 677 P2d 620 (1984); <em>State v Howard, </em>323 NW2d 872, 874 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(SD, 1982); <em>Reed v State, </em>633 SW2d 664, 664-666 (Tex App, 1982); <em>State v Robinson, </em>157 NJ Super 118, 119-120; 384 A2d 569 (1978), <em>cert den </em>77 NJ 484; 391 A2d 498 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In <em>State v Robinson, supra, </em>120, the court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not deny the defendant his right to be present at trial or to confront the witnesses against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">Obviously he did confront these witnesses and was present at his trial. And a reasonable reading of the comments clearly reveals that they were a comment on the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony. It is well settled that when a defendant waives his right to remain silent and takes the stand in his own defense, he thereby subjects himself to cross-examination as to the credibility of his story. And that issue would involve whether the story had been fabricated. . . . Here the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility was whether his testimony was tailored to that of the testimony of other witnesses, a perfectly proper inquiry. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Relying on <em>Fredericks, supra, </em>defendants argue that the prosecutorial comments at issue impermissibly burden a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at trial by penalizing him for exercising that right._</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>As noted above, the <em>Fredericks </em>Court analogized comment similar to that at issue to comment on a defendant\u2019s right to not testify at trial. Remarks of the latter type are prohibited because they ask the jury to draw the inference that the defendant is guilty or hiding something merely because he has not taken the stand. <em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965); <em>People v Mancill, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Had the comment in the instant cases been something like: \"If defendant was innocent, would he have appeared for trial?\u201d the analogy <em>might </em>be applicable. That would seem to be a direct comment on the defendant\u2019s presence at trial. However, we think the analogy is strained on the facts of the cases at bar. Here, the comments only indirectly related to defendants\u2019 right to be present at trial. Any resulting inference was not directly of guilt, but rather that defendants had the opportunity to conform their testimony because they heard other witnesses testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Therefore, we are unable to agree with the Court of Appeals in the cases at bar that the prosecutors\u2019 arguments in fact commented directly on the defendants\u2019 right to be present at trial. Rather, we believe the arguments simply concerned the defendants\u2019 credibility. It is well-established that the prosecutor may comment upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>testimony and draw inferences from it and may argue that a witness, including the defendant, is not worthy of belief. <em>People v Wirth, </em>108 Mich 307; 66 NW 41 (1896); <em>People v Couch, </em>49 Mich App 69; 211 NW2d 250 (1973), <em>lv den </em>391 Mich 755 (1973); <em>People v Cowell, </em>44 Mich App 623; 205 NW2d 600 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Opportunity and motive to fabricate testimony are permissible areas of inquiry of any witness. Both arguments in the instant cases presented the prosecutions\u2019 theory that defendants\u2019 testimony appeared to be carefully drawn explanations of the testimony presented. In both cases, the prosecutors commented on the content of defendants\u2019 testimony in relation either to his own earlier inconsistent testimony <em>(Buckey), </em>or to the testimony of other witnesses <em>(McWhorter).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Defendants further argue that other rights may be implicated if prosecutors are permitted to argue as did those in the instant <em>cases </em>\u2014 i.e., the right to testify, the right to remain silent, and the attorney-client privilege. These latter rights may be affected, they contend, because, in an attempt to combat this prosecutorial tactic, a defendant might be induced not to testify, to waive his right to remain silent and make a statement at arrest, or to call his counsel as a witness to testify to earlier discussions which were consistent with the defendant\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">This argument misses the point of why the prosecutors\u2019 arguments were not improper in these cases. We do not suggest that a prosecutor may, in every case, argue that a defendant who testifies has fabricated his testimony merely because he has sat through his trial and heard the evidence. Thus, it cannot be said that every defendant will be faced with a choice between forfeiting one right so that he may exercise <em>another </em>\u2014 e.g., being pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ent at trial, but not testifying so as to avoid the risk of prosecutorial comment that he fabricated testimony. When, as here, however, the evidence does support that inference, the argument is perfectly proper comment on credibility. In this situation, the prosecutorial comment is not that the defendant was present at the trial, but that his presence gave him the opportunity to conform his testimony. To accept defendants\u2019 argument that they must choose between exercising their right to be present at trial and some other right would be to say that a defendant has the right to fabricate or conform testimony without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Finally, we reject defendant Buckey\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper because they focused on his status as a defendant. A defendant may be compelled at trial \"to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture.\u201d <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757, 764; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966); <em>People v Markley, </em>99 Mich App 658, 661; 298 NW2d 615 (1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>413 Mich 852 (1982). These procedures might be said to take advantage of the defendant\u2019s presence at trial, yet our research has disclosed no case which has held such procedures violative of the defendant\u2019s right to attend his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Therefore, we hold that the closing arguments in the instant cases were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Next, we consider the second instance of alleged prosecutorial misconduct which prompted reversal in <em>Buckey. </em>The conduct which was the basis for the finding of error was the prosecutor\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>examination of Buckey<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in which he was asked whether he believed the complainant, the four young men, and Detective Harkin were lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The Court of Appeals found the questioning erroneous on the basis that \"it [is] improper for a witness to comment or provide an opinion on the credibility of another witness since matters of credibility are to be determined by the trier of fact. <em>People v Adams, </em>122 Mich App 759, 767; 333 NW2d 538 (1983), <em>remanded with jurisdiction retained </em>417 Mich 1073; 336 NW2d 751 (1983).\u201d <em>Buckey, supra, </em>163. The cases cited by the Court of Appeals applying that rule concerned nondefendant witnesses commenting on the credibility of other witnesses or on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals believed that the rule should also apply where the defendant is the witness providing the opinion. <em>Buckey, supra, </em>163.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that it was improper for the prosecutor to ask defendant to comment on the credibility of prosecution witnesses. Defendant\u2019s opinion of their credibility is not probative of the matter. However, we do not agree that the error resulted in unfair prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">This was not a case where the defendant might have been prejudiced by improper bolstering of the credibility of prosecution witnesses or by allowing an opinion on his guilt or credibility to be expressed. Concededly, the prosecutor\u2019s strategy was to discredit defendant by inviting him to label prosecution witnesses \"liars.\u201d However, the substance of the exchange indicates that defendant dealt rather well with the questions. We fail to discern how he was harmed by the questions._</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Moreover, as the Court of Appeals noted, defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not raise the objection urged on appeal. We agree with Judge Cynar that \"[a] timely objection by defense counsel could have cured any prejudice, either by precluding such further questioning or by obtaining an appropriate cautionary instruction.\u201d <em>Buckey, supra, </em>167 (Cynar, J., <em>concurring in part).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We hold that the prosecutors\u2019 closing arguments that defendants\u2019 presence at trial gave them an opportunity to fabricate or conform their testimony to that of other witnesses did not result in error which requires reversal. Additionally, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant Buckey did not result in error requiring reversal. Accordingly, the judgments of the Court of Appeals in both cases are reversed. <em>Buckey </em>is remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issues raised in defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. <em>McWhorter </em>is remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of whether the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of defendant McWhorter as to his financial condition was error which would require reversal and also for consideration of the issues raised in defendant\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-8\">Ryan, Brickley, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-13\"> <em>People v Buckey, </em>133 Mich App 158; 348 NW2d 53 (1984), <em>lv gtd </em>419 Mich 924 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-14\"> <em>People v McWhorter, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam, decided May 2, 1984 (Docket No. 54321), <em>lv gtd </em>419 Mich 924 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> The prosecutor commenced his cross-examination of defendant by questioning defendant about his attendance at prior proceedings in the case and about reading police reports prepared in connection with the case.

I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>persuaded that such prosecutorial comments impermissibly infringe on a defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to be present at trial, as well as his rights to testify and assist in his defense. See <em>People v Fredericks, </em>125 Mich App 114, 119-120; 335 NW2d 919 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The majority concedes it would be error for a prosecutor to link a defendant\u2019s presence or absence at trial with his ultimate guilt or innocence, but that linking presence with credibility is permissible. In so holding, the majority pays no heed to the cases it cites in footnote 5 where prosecutorial comments which could infringe upon the exercise of other constitutional lights having little to do with guilt have been found improper. The focus should be on whether the comments could impermissibly chill or infringe the exercise of a constitutional or statutory right, rather than whether the comments are \"direct\u201d or \"indirect.\u201d If a prosecutor can call a defendant a liar merely because he attended trial and his testimony differs from other witnesses, the defendant may either forego testifying or appearing in court until he testifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The majority does suggest that such prosecutorial comments are not always justified, but does not intimate when they would be improper. I do not know where the line could be drawn. Following the majority\u2019s reasoning, it would seem that any time a defendant\u2019s testimony differs, the prosecutor could argue that he manufactured certain details to make the story appear consistent with other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Prohibiting these comments would certainly not be debilitating to the people. The prosecutor already has numerous ways to attack a defendant\u2019s credibility \u2014 prior inconsistent statements; impeachment with prior convictions; arguments that defendant\u2019s story is inherently incredible or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the evidence of guilt is overwhelming; comparisons of witnesses\u2019 demeanors while testifying. The mere fact that a defendant has been listening to other witnesses is not particularly probative of his credibility, but its prejudicial effect could be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I would not hold such comments to be error per se that requires reversal. See <em>People v Buckey, </em>133 Mich App 158, 164-165; 348 NW2d 53 (1984); <em>Fredericks, supra; People v Smith, </em>73 Mich App 463, 470-471; 252 NW2d 488 (1977), <em>lv den </em>402 Mich 803 (1977). While the evidence against McWhorter was relatively strong, the Court of Appeals found error requiring reversal because the prosecution witnesses were convicted felons who had \"entered into various favorable arrangements with the prosecution in exchange for their testimony.\u201d It also found that the testimony of McWhorter was not incredible and that it might have been believed but for the improper comments. I am not persuaded that this conclusion was clearly erroneous and would affirm that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As to defendant Buckey, I find the issue to be even closer. Since Buckey\u2019s trial was essentially a credibility contest between complainant and defendant, the jury convicted defendant of the lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit second-degree criminal sexual conduct and the prosecutor improperly questioned defendant about the credibility of other witnesses, I would affirm the determination of the Court of Appeals that error occurred which requires reversal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-7\">Williams, C.J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b178-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">The question presented, in these cases consolidated on appeal, is whether the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Appeals properly reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of the prosecutor having adverted to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to hear all the evidence before he testified, with the attendant suggestion that the defendant may have modified his testimony from what he otherwise would have said. I would reverse and remand for a new trial in <em>McWhorter </em>and affirm in <em>Buckey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The opinion of the Court concludes that the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not require reversal. The Court draws back from suggesting that \"in every case [the prosecutor may] argue that a defendant who testifies has fabricated his testimony merely because he sat through the trial and heard the evidence.\u201d In the instant cases, however, the Court finds \"the evidence does support the inference\u201d that the defendants \"fabricated testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The opinion of the Court does not specify what evidence shows or tends to show that either Buckey or McWhorter fabricated testimony. In <em>Buckey </em>there is evidence that he may have done so. In <em>McWhorter </em>there is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In <em>Buckey, </em>the defendant gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest. He was present at the preliminary examination and at the trial. After the completion of the people\u2019s case and the presentation of all his other evidence, Buckey gave testimony that varied somewhat from a statement he had given to the police shortly after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In <em>McWhorter, </em>the defendant gave a statement to an fbi agent. Because the statement was not offered by the people, and the people succeeded in having the statement excluded when the defendant sought to have it introduced, there was no record evidence that McWhorter\u2019s testimony at trial was altered as a result of what he heard at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Motive, bias, and interest are permissible areas of inquiry and comment. Because trials occur sometime after the event, all witnesses have an opportunity to fabricate their testimony. All witnesses have ample time to think about and rehearse what they are going to say. Most witnesses talk to someone before they testify, either an investigator or a lawyer. A witness may be asked if he has discussed his testimony with another person and whether he was made aware of the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The prosecutors here did not in so many words argue that the defendants had an opportunity to fabricate or that they fabricated their testimony, but, as the Court acknowledges, the innuendo is there.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">All would agree that no witness has a right to fabricate. It is, however, the essence of the defendant\u2019s rights to remain silent, to consult counsel, and to be presumed innocent, that the defendant be made fully aware of all the evidence before he is required to decide whether to speak at all. Consequently, the defendant has the constitutionally protected opportunity to know all the evidence before he decides whether to speak. This right is not secured to him so that he can fabricate his testimony, but so that, among other things, he does not innocently overlook something before he speaks and thereby appear to be withholding something or speaking falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Comment on the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected opportunity to know all the evidence before he decides whether to speak is an attack on his exercise of his constitutional privileges and violative of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Buckey was tried twice on the charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. The first trial concluded in a mistrial when the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict. The second trial concluded with Buckey being found guilty of the lesser offense of assault with intent to commit second-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed on the' basis of two findings of prosecutorial misconduct. The first was the cross-examination of Buckey in which the prosecutor asked him whether he believed that the complainant, the four young men, and the police officer were lying. The second, which I consider here, was the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument suggesting that because Buckey had heard the testimony of the other witnesses he had an opportunity to fabricate an explanation for the testimony presented against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">When Buckey was arrested on a charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, he made a statement to the police. He said that he had met the complainant in a bar and agreed to take her home. After a stop at a hotel, they left in his friend\u2019s Jeep to go \"four-wheeling.\u201d The pair drove for a while and Buckey parked. He touched her breasts and she touched his genitals. According to Buckey, he asked if she wanted to make love, but she refused because she did not have any birth control device. She then started acting \"weird.\u201d She got out of the Jeep and left with some boys who had driven up. When asked if anything happened on the ground outside the Jeep he said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">At trial the complainant\u2019s account of what happened prior to the time they left the hotel was generally consistent with Buckey\u2019s statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the police and his trial testimony. She denied that they went \"four-wheeling,\u201d but agreed that Buckey pulled off the road and parked. She also said that Buckey had touched her breasts, but claimed he had forced her to touch his genitals. She said that her response to Buckey\u2019s inquiry whether she was interested in having sex was indeed that she could not because she did not have any birth control device.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">At this point, however, the complainant\u2019s account diverged sharply from Buckey\u2019s. According to the complainant, she had to struggle to get out of the car. Outside of the car Buckey grabbed her, pushed her to the ground, and got on top of her. When another car pulled up, she got up from under Buckey and went over to that car. The occupants, four boys, gave her a ride home.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The four boys testified at the preliminary hearing and at trial that when they drove into the field the two were on the ground. They testified to observing Buckey push the complainant to the ground or to his being on top of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In his closing argument the prosecutor commented on Buckey\u2019s opportunity to fabricate or conform his testimony: \"The defendant has known for some time precisely what the people\u2019s proofs were going to be. He\u2019s had plenty of time to try to figure a way around our proofs and also to get prepared to tell his story in a convincing manner.\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">McWhorter was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to kidnap<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and kidnapping.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that comments made by the prosecutor during his closing argument concerning McWhorter\u2019s presence at trial and his opportunity to conform his testimony were improper, reversed his conviction, and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">McWhorter\u2019s convictions arose out of the abduction of David Nixon from McWhorter\u2019s law office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>by William Snyder and Joseph Postelwaite.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The prosecution\u2019s theory was that McWhorter agreed with Suess, Snyder, and Postelwaite to kidnap Nixon as a means of extorting money from Nixon, approximately half of which was to be used by Suess to pay legal fees to McWhorter. The prosecution\u2019s explanation of the May 14 meeting was that McWhorter provided his office as a place where Nixon would willingly go and where the kidnapping could be executed if the meeting did not result in a satisfactory resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>At trial, McWhorter denied his involvement in the kidnapping. His testimony confirmed that of the other witnesses, but denied that he had any knowledge until after the fact of the planning or execution of the beating and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">I\u2019m not going to belabor that, because I think the line is drawn. I think on the one side of that line you have one person, two persons, six people and on the other side of the line you have Bob McWhorter who says here is where I was and all the other people who were involved say, hey, Bob, you were over here with us. What are you trying to tell us? You didn\u2019t know what was going on. You were obvious <em>[sic] </em>as to what was going on. We are the patsies on the other side of this line. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, says Bob Mc-Whorter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">Well, I challenge you and I ask you to look at that because that is where the line is drawn. Did he know? Did he not know? When you think about how that line is drawn, I want you to remember this. How many of those other witnesses were present in the courtroom during this testimony? How many people knew where that line was so when it came time to walk that line you knew where to walk? I submit to you only one person knew where that line was because that one person heard all that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\"><em>[Defense </em>Attorney]: I will object, Your Honor. That is the defendant\u2019s right in every case. In fact, he has to be present during all the testimony. That\u2019s improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\"><em>The Court: </em>You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\"><em>[Prosecuting </em>Attorney]: Thank you, Your Honor. Specifically, Bob McWhorter is the only person who knew where to go, knew where the testimony had to go to avoid any implications and I submit to you he took that line and he walked it very carefully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The prosecutor could properly inquire on cross-examination why Buckey\u2019s statement to the police did not fully conform to the explanation that he gave after he had heard the other witnesses testify. Buckey\u2019s lawyer did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Under the circumstances, a new trial is not justified because of the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In <em>McWhorter, </em>the defendant\u2019s lawyer did object. I would reverse and remand for a new trial in <em>McWhorter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments in <em>McWhorter </em>were impermissible comments on matters not in evidence. There is nothing in the record that indicates that McWhorter changed or supplemented his testimony after hearing the testimony of other witnesses. Indeed, when McWhorter\u2019s lawyer twice sought to introduce the copy of a statement which McWhorter had given, before the preliminary examination, to an fbi agent, the prosecutor objected and succeeded in excluding the only evidence which would have supported or contradicted the comments in his closing argument. The prosecutor\u2019s assertion simply has no basis in the record. Even if one were to agree that a prosecutor may properly make the objected-to argument, a proposition I consider subsequently, before such a comment is made there must, at a minimum, be a factual basis in the record to support the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Jury argument must be based solely on the evidence presented at trial and reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>enees that can be adduced therefrom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is the rule in both civil and criminal cases and for both defense and prosecution counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the prosecutor may ask the jury to draw inferences from facts appearing in the record,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and may comment on the testimony,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and argue on the facts and the evidence that a witness is not worthy of belief,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he may not seek to obtain a conviction by going beyond the evidence before the jury<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and imply that evidence not before the jury implicates the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although, \"[c]ounsel in their closing arguments are given wide latitude . . . <em>there must be a basis of fact </em>[in the evidence] for such assertions.\u201d <em>Pritchett v United States, </em>87 US App DC 374, 376; 185 F2d 438 (1950).

They may collapse under skillful and persistent cross-examination, and through no fault of their own they may fail to impress the jury as honest and reliable witnesses. . . . [T]he defendant is unlikely to know whether this testimony will prove entirely favorable. Because of these uncertainties, a defendant may not know at the close of the State\u2019s case whether his own testimony will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>necessary or even helpful to his cause. <em>[Id. </em>at 609-610.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that allowing the defendant to exercise this right may increase the risk and ease of a defendant\u2019s conforming his testimony, but concluded that the danger is not sufficient to justify burdening the defendant\u2019s decision whether and when he will testify. <em>Id. </em>at 611.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Because the defendant has a right to hear all the state\u2019s evidence, as well as his own evidence, before deciding whether to testify, court procedures that burden exercise of this right have been regarded as violative of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \"[T]he right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>McMann v Richardson, </em>397 US 759, 771, n 14; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 2d 763 (1970),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and this right is denied when the government interferes with the ability of counsel to make the \"important tactical decision,\u201d <em>Brooks v Tennessee, supra </em>at 612, whether and when the defendant will take the stand.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> McWhorter\u2019s rights were burdened because exercise of his constitutional right to testify last subjected him to insinuations that he testified when he did to commit perjury by conforming his testimony to that of the preceding witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Such insinuations constitute a penalty on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>exercise of constitutional rights. Few cases have dealt directly with the question whether comment on the defendant\u2019s opportunity to perjure himself by exercising his right to testify last is an infringement of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965), is sufficiently analogous to this case to require recognition that constitutional error was committed. In <em>Griffin, </em>the prosecutor stressed the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and urged upon the jury the inference that such failure demonstrated the defendant\u2019s inability to deny his guilt. Holding such prosecutorial comment violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the United States Supreme Court deemed the statement \"a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Court in <em>Griffin </em>focused its inquiry on whether Griffin had been \"compelled ... to be a witness against himself.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The instant case also calls into question the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. For the purpose of \"penalty analysis,\u201d however, there is little, if any, valid distinction between the privilege against self incrimination and the right to counsel.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In both <em>Griffin </em>and the instant case, prosecutorial comments sought to raise an unfavorable inference from the exercise of a defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right. Especially where the guilt of the accused turns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>largely on the credibility of the witnesses, such comment constitutes a \"penalty\u201d on the free exercise of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In <em>Griffin </em>the inference was that unless the defendant were guilty he would not have exercised his Fifth Amendment right and refused to testify. Here the inference is that unless McWhorter needed to hear the testimony of the other witnesses so that he could conform his testimony to theirs he would not have exercised his constitutional right to testify at the conclusion of all the evidence. Justice Hugo Black\u2019s concurring remarks in <em>Grunewald v United States, </em>353 US 391, 425-426; 77 S Ct 963; 1 L Ed 2d 931 (1957), are apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">[There are] no special circumstances that would justify use of a constitutional privilege to discredit or convict a person who asserts it. The value of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The majority respond to the argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments infringe on the accused\u2019s right to be present at trial by relying on <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757, 764; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966), which held that the taking of a blood sample by a physician at police direction from the defendant over his objection after his arrest for drunken driving did not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Schmerber, </em>and related cases, <em>United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and <em>Gilbert v California, </em>388 US 263; 87 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Ct 1951; 18 L Ed 2d 1178 (1967),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> concerning identification procedures, were decided on the ground that the evidence was <em>non-testimonial </em>and outside the scope of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Schmerber </em>and its progeny in that what is at issue is not the identification of the defendant, but rather the substantive content of his testimony. At the risk of being tautological, testimony is testimonial not physical.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The majority relies on cases from other jurisdictions. In <em>State v Robinson, </em>157 NJ Super 118; 384 A2d 569 (1978), <em>cert den </em>77 NJ 484; 391 A2d 498 (1978), an intermediate appellate court ruled that comments by the prosecutor in closing argument that testimony by the defendant \" 'comported with the other stories that were presented in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>which I would point at and say it looks incredible to me\u2019 \u201d was a comment on the witnesses\u2019 credibility and did not deprive the defendant of his right to confront witnesses or to be present at trial. This opinion is unconvincing because of the court\u2019s failure to consider the presumption of innocence and the Fifth and Sixth Amendment arguments on which the lower court, 145 NJ Super 159; 366 A2d 1371 (1976), based its decision, as well as its failure to consider that there was no evidence in the record to indicate that the defendant fabricated his testimony.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>Reed v Texas, </em>633 SW2d 644 (Tex App, 1982), the court simply declared that a comment similar to the comment at issue here was \"reasonable.\u201d In <em>State v Howard, </em>323 NW2d 872 (SD, 1982), the court did not address the constitutional issues and simply concluded that the comment challenged the defendant\u2019s credibility. The courts in <em>New Mexico v Hoxsie, </em>101 NM 7; 677 P2d 620 (1984), and in <em>State v Martin, </em>101 NM 595; 686 P2d 937 (1984), relied, without discussion, on the decision in <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">I find more persuasive the decisions of the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> particularly the well-reasoned opinion in <em>People v Fredericks, </em>125 Mich App 114; 335 NW2d 919 (1983), which have uniformly held that such comments are improper.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The state contends in <em>McWhorter </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s comments, if error, were harmless. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The state must \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 24; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). An error of constitutional dimension is not harmless if \"there is a reasonable possibility that [it] might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy v Connecticut, </em>375 US 85, 86-87; 84 S Ct 229; 11 L Ed 2d 171 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In <em>McWhorter, </em>because the critical issue was McWhorter\u2019s knowledge and participation in the plan before the fact, his credibility as a witness was a central issue. Most of the persons who testified for the people acknowledged their complicity in the commission of the offense. This is not a case where the evidence against the defendant was otherwise \"so overwhelming\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that the constitutional error did not, beyond a reasonable doubt, contribute to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning the defendant\u2019s order of testimony would appear to have been directed to, and may have had the effect of, raising in the jurors\u2019 minds at least the inference that McWhorter was perjuring himself so as to appear not guilty. Such an inference might tend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cause the jury to disbelieve McWhorter\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In sum, where the record does not establish that the defendant provided a statement before the trial and he does not testify before the conclusion of all the evidence, a comment by the prosecutor that the defendant testified last with the innuendo \u2014there is no other reason to make the argument \u2014that he perjured himself, is an unconstitutional comment on a matter not in evidence, and on the defendant\u2019s failure earlier to give a statement, and is also violative of the presumption of innocence and of the defendant\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">I would affirm in <em>Buckey, </em>and remand for a new trial in <em>McWhorter.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> MCL 750.520g(2); MSA 28.788(7((2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\"> Immediately before this statement, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\"If you\u2019ll recall his cross-examination testimony you\u2019ll recall that he testified that he was present at the preliminary examination back in December of 1981. He sat through the whole thing, he heard Debbie DeFord testify, he heard one of the boys testify, and he also admitted that he\u2019d reviewed, to some extent anyway, the police report in connection with this case. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with his doing that, per se, reviewing the police report, but the point is, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the defendant knew \u2014 and also he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the last witness to testify in this case \u2014 he knew before he took the witness stand, completely, what the People\u2019s proofs were going to be. He knew completely what they were. He also admitted that he sat through proceedings in this case back in February of this year. All of our witnesses, except Trooper Stayer, testified at that time. He [the defendant] indicated on the witness stand he heard them all testify. He testified, himself, back then. He was cross-examined at that time. He indicated that he later heard all the remarks that both I made and his attorney made, concerning that testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The prosecutor continued that there was evidence that Buckey had perjured himself;</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\"Now, there is abundant proof in this case that the defendant, in fact, cooked up an explanation around our proofs. Now, here is just one example of \u2014 of this. Now, if you recall the evidence of Detective Harkin, before the preliminary examination, before Brian Guettler testified, before the police report had even been completed, back on November 9th, 1981, when Detective Harkin interviewed the defendant he told Detective Harkin that absolutely nothing took place on the ground outside the Jeep. He said that he only got out of the Jeep twice, once to urinate, and once to walk over to the boys [sic] car. After he sits through the preliminary examination, after he hears Brian Guettler testify, after he gets a chance to review the police report, however, he begins to say that something did happen on the ground outside the Jeep. Now, he had to come in here and testify that Debbie DeFord took a swing at him, and kicked at him, simply because he could not ignore the testimony of those four young boys. And, if you don\u2019t think he\u2019d lie to you, think again. If you\u2019d look at the lies he told Detective Harkin, you\u2019d know that the truth doesn\u2019t mean much to him. I mean, he told a lie about nothing taking place on the ground outside the Jeep. In those circumstances it was in his best \u2014 he felt it was in his best interest to lie to Detective Harkin. He also believes that it\u2019s in his best interest to lie to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\"> MCL 750.349, 750.157a; MSA 28.581, 28.354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\"><em> </em>MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> The evidence at trial established that McWhorter had been retained by Douglas Suess to represent his parents and Patrick Kenney who had been arrested in Florida while driving trucks which contained substantial quantities of marijuana. The marijuana was being shipped to other states, including Michigan, as part of an operation apparently run by Suess and Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Nixon owed Suess his share of the proceeds from marijuana sales which had accumulated during the course of the venture. Suess intended to 'pay McWhorter with some portion of these proceeds; however, Nixon refused to provide him with any money. When Nixon refused to pay Suess, McWhorter told him to be more emphatic and forceful with Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">McWhorter offered Snyder an opportunity to work off fees which Snyder owed him. McWhorter asked Snyder to follow Nixon and to scare him into giving Suess some money. Snyder proved to be unable to accomplish the task and suggested recruiting some help. The pair sought assistance from Postelwaite.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Snyder, Suess, Postelwaite, Nixon, and McWhorter all met at McWhorter\u2019s office. Patrick Kenney and McWhorter\u2019s secretary, Charlene Crouch, were also present. At this point, the testimony of McWhorter and of the state\u2019s witnesses diverge. According to Mc-Whorter, at some point after a discussion among the parties in the basement conference room at McWhorter\u2019s office, McWhorter left with Kenney and Crouch to have lunch at a local restaurant. Nixon testified that shortly after their departure, he emerged from the meeting room and was assaulted by Snyder and Postelwaite. Postelwaite testified that he and Snyder intended to extract information from Nixon regarding money owed Suess. Various forms of severe physical abuse failed to produce results, and, at some point, Snyder and Postelwaite concluded that they did not want to remain in McWhorter\u2019s office because someone might arrive.
