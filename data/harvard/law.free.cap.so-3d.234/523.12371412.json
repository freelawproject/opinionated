Taylor, now known as Valerie Backus,\" collided with an automobile driven by Lindsey V. Wheeler, now known as Lindsey Woodard. Lindsey and Valerie were injured. On December 2, 2009, Lindsey filed in the St. Clair Circuit Court a complaint against Valerie and against Lindsey\u2019s uninsured-motorist carrier in which Lindsey requested an award of damages resulting from, she alleged, Valerie\u2019s negligent, wanton, reckless, and willful conduct. Lindsey requested a jury trial. Valerie filed an answer in which she asserted that the accident had resulted from her inability to respond to a sudden emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">A jury trial was held.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 9, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Valerie, and, that same day, the circuit court entered a judgment on the verdict. On February 15, 2016, Lindsey filed a postjudgment motion, seeking a new trial. After a postjudgment hearing, the circuit court entered an order (\u201cthe postjudgment order\u201d) determining, among other things, that Lindsey had waived the right to complain\" about any alleged confusion caused by a jury instruction regarding the sudden-emergency doctrine. The post-judgment order reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201c[Lindseyj\u2019s last ground is that the jury\u2019s verdict-was against, and inconsistent with, the great weight of the evidence-presented at trial. [Valerie] counters that \u2018there, was more than enough \u201cevidence which if believed justified the verdict\u201d in this case.\u2019 A review of the transcript of [Valeriej\u2019s trial testimony ... shows the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c(i) the accident made the basis of this lawsuit was a rear-end collision ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201c(ii) [Valeriej\u2019s vehicle struck [Lind-seyj\u2019s vehicle from the rear ...[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201c(in) [Valerie] saw [Lindseyj\u2019s brake . lights but was unable to stop in ' time or avoid the accident ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8AI\">\u201c(iv) [Lindseyj\u2019s memory of the accident was not entirely clear . ..;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACUy\">\u201c(v) [Lindsey] did not stop in- emergency fashion ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AChf\">\u201c(vi) [Valerie] testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u2018\u201cQ.

When [Lindsey\u2019s attorney] was taking your deposition he asked.you do you remember seeing [Lindsey] in front of you and you said I do, she stopped suddenly, and I hit her.

Yes sir.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAMYH\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-21\">\u201cThis Court .is aware that jury verdicts are presumed to be correct and that a motion for new trial on the ground that a verdict is against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>weight of the evidence should be carefully scrutinized.... However, the rule that jury verdicts are presumed to be correct does not override the rule that allows a trial court to grant a new trial if justice requires in cases where the verdict is wholly wrong. Clinton v. Hanson, 435 So.2d 48 (Ala. 1983). See also Glanton v. Huff[,] 404 So.2d 11 (Ala. 1981), and Gribble v. Cox, 349 So.2d 1141 (Ala. 1977).

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED as follows: .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c1. [Lindsey]\u2019s Motion for New Trial is hereby GRANTED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">' Valerie filed a timely notice of appeal to this court on June 10, 2016. W\u00e9 transferred the appeal to our supreme court for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; the appeal was transferred back;to this court pursuant to \u00a7 12-2-7(6), Ala. Code 1975. Valerie seeks our review, of whether the circuit court erred by granting Lindsey\u2019s motion for- a new trial. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">A trial court may grant a new trial when it \u201cbelieves that justice demands that a new trial be granted on the weight and preponderance ground.\u201d Jawad v. Grariade, 497 So.2d 471, 477 (Ala. 1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">\u201cIn the landmark case Jawad v.

Farnell, 775 So.2d 789, 791 (Ala. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">Before the jury entered the courtroom, Lindsey\u2019s attorney informed the circuit court that he neither intended to present any arguments nor expected to offer any jury instructions oh the claims of wantonness or willfulness. The majority of the testimony at the trial focused on damages for Lindsey\u2019s injuries. Regarding the claim for damages based on negligence, Lindsey, who admitted more than once that she had an -incomplete memory of th\u00e9 a\u00e9cident,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that, on the night of the accident, she had been completely stopped*'in \u201ca pretty heavy amount of traffic-,\u201d waiting for the vehicle affront of her to turn left-into :a- shopping-center entrance when- the accident occurred. Valerie testified' that\u201d she had seen Lindsey\u2019s brake lights but that she 'had been unable to - stop - in time to avoid the accident.-Valerie said: \u201cI tried to stop, but it wasn\u2019t successful^] and I hit her.\u201d \u2022 In her deposition testimony, which she read aloud to the jury, Valerie testified that Lindsey had not stopped in'ah\u2019\u201cemergency fashion,\u201d that she had' not \u25a0 heard Lindsey\u2019s tires squeal, and that Lindsey had done nothing wrong. However, as noted in the postjudgment order, Valerie re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>plied \u201cYes, sir\u201d to her attorney\u2019s question: \u201c[Lindsey] stopped suddenly, and you couldn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The circuit-court judge instructed the jury regarding the burden of proof, provided a definition for and listed the elements of the tort of negligence, and said that, if the accident had been caused by a sudden emergency, then the \u201cverdict must be in favor of [Valerie].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In this appeal \u2014 admittedly it is a close call \u2014 we conclude that the circuit court plainly and palpably erred in granting Lindsey\u2019s motion for a new trial. In reaching our conclusion, we have considered the fact that the jury verdict is supported by some evidence of a sudden emergency; however, we are unconvinced that the jury\u2019s verdict rested exclusively on that determination. It is equally plausible that the jury determined, based on the instructions given, that Valerie had not been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">A review of the jury charge reveals that the circuit-court judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cIn order for you to decide whether or not [Valerie] is responsible, you must decide three issues: Number 1, whether [Valerie] was negligent; Number 2, whether [Lindsey] was harmed; and Number 3, whether or not [Valerie] is responsible for the harm that [Lindsey] suffered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAb6N\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cIf ... you do not find all three of these issues, then you must find- for [Valerie].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzhd\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">If you are reasonably satisfied from the evidence that the accident that is made the basis of this lawsuit was proximately caused by a sudden emergency, which was not the fault of [Valerie], then your verdict must be in favor of [Valerie].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzgH\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk about negligence. Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent harm to oneself or to others. So negligence is the failure to use reasonable care. A person\u2019s conduct is negligent when he or she does something that a reasonably prudent person would not do in a similar situation, or if he or she fails to do something that a reasonably prudent person would have done in that particular situation. The reasonably prudent person that we are talking about is the reasonably prudent person that will be the twelve of you sitting as a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cNow, you must decide if [Valerie] was negligent in this case. There is no presumption of negligence arising out of the fact that an accident occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">The circuit-court judge also substantially quoted Alabama Pattern Jury Instruction-Civil (\u201cthe APJI\u201d) \u00a7 26.04 (3d ed. 2015), saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201c\u00c1 driver must keep a lookout for others, and he or she must use reasonable care to anticipate the presence of others. A driver is negligent if he or she fails to see what was there to be seen, or otherwise fails to discover a vehicle or other person that he or she should have discovered in time to avoid hitting it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">The record indicates that, during its deliberations, the jury requested a clarification of the definition of \u201cnegligence.\u201d The circuit-court judge offered the language provided by the APJI \u00a7 28.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cNegligence is the failure to use reasonable care to prevent harm to oneself or others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cA person\u2019s conduct is negligent when (he/she) either does something that a reasonably prudent person would not do in a similar situation, or (he/she) she fails to do something that a reasonably prudent person would have done in a similar situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">It appears likely that, based on that language and the scant testimony provided, the jury of lay persons could have determined that Valerie had not been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Furthermore, there were conflicting statements regarding the circumstances of the accident: (1) Lindsey\u2019s statement that she was completely stopped, (2) Valerie\u2019s statement that Lindsey had not stopped in an \u201cemergency fashion,\u201d and (3) Valerie\u2019s statement that Lindsey .had stopped suddenly. The resolution of conflicts -in the evidence rests solely with the trier of fact, in this case, the jury. See Sharrief v. Gerlach, 798 So.2d 646, 651 (Ala. 2001) (citing Jones v. Baltazar, 658 So.2d 420, 422 (Ala. 1995), citing in turn James v. Woolley, 523 So.2d 110, 112 (Ala. 1988)). We conclude that the jury properly exercised its duty to resolve conflicts, find the facts, and express its findings in its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Thus, the verdict was not against the great weight or preponderance of the evidence; therefore, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion by granting Lindsey\u2019s motion for a new trial. The May 6, 2016, order of the circuit court granting a new trial is reversed, and the cause is remanded for the circuit court to vacate the May 6, 2016, order and to reinstate the February 9, 2016, judgment \u00e9n-tered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-7\">Pittman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b575-8\">Donaldson, J., concurs specially.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b575-9\">Thompson, P.

The Alabama Supreme Court has held that \u201c[djenying, and to a more limited extent granting, a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Carter v. Henderson, 598 So.2d 1350, 1354 (Ala. 1992). When a motion for a new trial is based on the trial judge\u2019s perception of the weight of the evidence and not on procedural or substantive errors or irregularities, the trial court\u2019s discretion is. more limited, and, if such a motion is granted/ our greatest deference should be in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">In Shows v. Jamison Bedding, Inc., 671 F.2d 927, 930 (5th Cir. 1982), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth'Circuit explained the scope of the trial court\u2019s discretion in deciding whether to set aside a jury\u2019s verdict and grant a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuuU\">\u201cTh[e] deferential standard of - review has largely arisen from the consideration of cases in which motions for new trials have been denied. ... When the trial judge has refused to disturb a jury verdict, all the factors that govern our review of [the trial judge\u2019s] decision favor affirmance. Deference to the trial judge, who has had an opportunity to observe the witnesses and to consider the evidence in the context of a living trial rather than upon a cold record, operates in harmony with deference to the jury\u2019s determination of the weight of the evidence and the constitutional allocation to the jury of questions of fact. ... \"When the trial judge sets aside a jury verdict and orders a new trial, however, our deference to [the trial judge] is in opposition to the deference due the jury. Consequently, in -this circuit as in several others, we apply a broader review to orders granting new trials than to orders denying them. ... And where a new trial is granted on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, , we exercise particularly close scrutiny, to protect the litigants\u2019 right to a jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">In Redd v. City of Phenix City, 934 F.2d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir. 1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-16\">\u2018When a [trial] court grants a new trial because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, [the appellate] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>.court\u2019s review will be extremely stringent to protect/a party\u2019s right to a jury trial. ... This is particularly true when the new trial is premised upon sufficiency of the evidence as opposed to some factor which may have infected the .eyi-dence itself. ... When there is. some support for a jury\u2019s.verdict, it is irrelevant what we or the . [trial] judge would have concluded.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">In Lind v. Schenley Industries, Inc., 278 F.2d 79, 90 (3d Cir. 1960), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c[W]here no undesirabl\u00e9 or pernicious element has occurred or been introduced into the trial and the trial judge nonetheless grants a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the trial judge in negating the jury!s verdict has, to some extent at least, substituted his judgment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses for that of. the jury. Such an action effects,a denigration of the jury system and to the extent that new trials are granted the judge takes over, if he does not usurp, the prime -function of the jury as the-trier of the facts. It then becomes .-the dqty of the appellate tribunal to \u2022 exercise a closer degree of scrutiny and supervision than is the case where, a new trial is granted because of some undesirable or pernicious influence obtruding into the trial. Such a. close scrutiny is required in order to protect the litigants\u2019 right to jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In Tyler v. Davis, 196 So.3d 258 (Ala. Civ. App. 2015), a motor-vehicle-accident case, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but awarded only $100 in damages. The-trial judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial because- the trial judge determined that the damages \u201c \u2018were so inadequate as to indicate that the verdict [was] the result of passion, prejudice, or other improper motives such as the injection of [inadmissible evidence] and inapplicable defenses ....\u2019\u201d Id. at 259. The trial judge specifically listed the reasons why the verdict was tainted. This court reversed and ordered the jury verdict to be reinstated. I dissented and stated: \u201cThe trial judge personally observed and. heard the statements of counsel and the testimony of the witnesses, and the trial judge personally observed the reactions of the jurors. Because of the trial judge\u2019s decidedly superior vantage point to make a finding as to whether those events improperly tainted the jury verdict, I would affirm.\u201d Id. at 265 (Donaldson, J., dissenting). The trial judge\u2019s determination that the jury verdict was tainted because of \u201cundesirable or pernicious elements]\u201d both perceived and articulated by the trial judge was due our greatest deference. See Redd, 934 F.2d at 1215 n.3 (\u201cIf a trial judge grants a new trial because of prejudice .,., then this court\u2019s review will not be as rigorous. This pays tribute to our jury system. Our system of justice seeks a jury verdict arising from a trial free' of impropriety.\u201d).'</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In contrast, the jury verdict in this case was not found to be tainted but was set aside based on a judicial perception of the weight of the evidence to support it. Our standard of review is that \u201can order granting a motion for new trial on the sole ground that the verdict is against the great weight or preponderance of the evidence will be reversed for abuse of discretion where on review it is easily perceivable from the record that the jury verdict is supported by the evidence.\u201d Jawad v. Granade, 497 So.2d 471, 477 (Ala. 1986). The trial court charged the jury that \u201c[t]here is no presumption of negligence arising out of the fact that an accident occurred.\u201d The jury was told that it was entitled to weigh the evidence and to assess the credibility of the witnesses. As noted by the main opinion, the trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had =to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>defendant was negligent before it could return a verdict for the plaintiff. The jury apparently was not, as charged by the trial judge, \u201creasonably satisfied from the evidence\u201d that the defendant did \u201csomething that a reasonably prudent person would not do in a similar situation, or ... fail[ed] to do something that a reasonably prudent person would have done in a similar situation.\u201d That decision was for the jury to make. See Jones v. Baltazar, 658 So.2d 420 (Ala. 1995) (holding that whether motorist whose vehicle struck another vehicle from the rear was negligent was a question for the jury). Accordingly, applying the standard of review, established in Jawad v. Granade, 497 So.2d at 477, it is \u201ceasily perceivable\u201d that the verdict was supported by the evidence cited in the main opinion, even though the verdict is certainly subject to earnest disagreement.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ako-dedup-1\">THOMPSON, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANdk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"ai6-dedup-0\">I would affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting Lindsey Wheeler\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was. against the great weight or preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"azr-dedup-0\">\u201c\u2018The decision whether to grant or to deny a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 CSX Transp., Inc. v.
