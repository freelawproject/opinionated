(\u201cthe daughter\u201d) in December 2011. The daughter tested positive for cocaine at birth. K.R., R.G.\u2019s aunt, adopted the daughter at that time. R.G. gave, birth to C.G. (\u201cthe son\u201d) in September 2013, and, shortly afterward, the Shelby County Department of Human Resources (\u201cDHR\u201d) received.a report alleging that R.G. had been abusing drugs and neglecting the son,, and, in January 2014, it received a report alleging that K.R. had been hospitalized after overdosing on Valium and that she was unable to care for the daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">The Shelby Juvenile Court adjudicated the daughter and the son (\u201cthe children\u201d) dependent and awarded their custody to DHR (case number JU-13-548.01 and case number JU-14-274.01). DHR first placed the children in foster care, and, later, it placed them with K.R.; however K.R. and C.M., K.R.\u2019s boyfriend, absconded with the children and concealed their whereabouts from DHR from March 2014 until December 2015. In the meantime, L.M., who is the appellant and the adult daughter of C.M., filed in the-juvenile , court petitions (case number JU-13-548.03 and case number JU-14-274.02), seeking custody of the children. L.M., as explained in more detail infra, is a cousin of both R.G and K.R. In December 2015 K.R. died from a drug overdose,- the location of the children was revealed to DHR, the daughter disclosed that she had been sexually abused, and the children were temporarily placed iri the \u201cKirksey home\u201d before being returned to foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">A total of nine actions were filed in the juvenile court. Five actions were filed by various parties regarding the son: case number JU-13-548.01, case number JU-13-548.02 (filed by K.R., who is deceased), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>case number JU-13-548.03, case number JU-13-548.04, and case number JU-13-548.05 (a termination-of-parental-rights action filed by DHR). Four actions were filed by various parties regarding the daughter: case number JU-14-274.01, case number JU-14-274.02, case number JU-14-274.03, and case number JU-14-274.04 (a termination-of-parental-rights action filed by DHR). The juvenile court consolidated the actions, and, on April 20, 2016, it entered one judgment in seven of the actions, but not in the termination-of-parental-rights actions. Ultimately, the judgment was certified as final, pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ala. R. Civ. P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The juvenile court concluded that L.M. is the children\u2019s cousin;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, it denied L.M.\u2019s custody petitions, noting that L.M. had had limited contact with the children. On May 3, 2016, L.M. filed timely notices of appeal. This court consolidated appeal number 2150658, regarding the son, and appeal number 2150659, regarding the daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">L.M. argues that she is a relative entitled to priority over a nonrelative in considering an award of custody of the children, and she argues that DHR \u201cdeliberately sabotaged\u201d her ability to establish a relationship with the children. Thus, because she contends on appeal only that the juvenile court erred by denying her petitions for custody of the children, our review of these appeals is limited to issues arising from case number JU-13-548.03 (L.M.\u2019s petition for custody regarding the son) and case number JU-14-274.02 (L.M.\u2019s petition for custody regarding the daughter).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Rogers &amp; Willard, Inc. v. Harwood, 999 So.2d 912, 923 (Ala. Civ. App. 2007) (\u201cThis court will not consider on appeal issues that are not properly presented and argued in brief.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201c \u2018In matters concerning child custody and dependency, the trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed correct on appeal and will not be reversed unless plainly and palpably wrong.\u2019 Ex parte T.L.L., 597 So.2d 1363, 1364 (Ala.

Additionally, in Ex parte Anonymous, 803 So.2d 542 (Ala. 2001), the Alabama Supreme Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201c \u2018The ore tenus rule provides that a trial court\u2019s findings of fact based on oral testimony \u201chave the effect of a jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d and that \u201c[a] judgment, grounded on such findings, is accorded, on appeal, a presumption of correctness which will not be disturbed unless plainly erroneous or manifestly unjust.\u201d Noland Co. v.

C.H., 963 So.2d 114, 119 (Ala. Civ. App. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">L.M. argues that, because she is \u201cthe only relative resource available,\u201d the juvenile court erred by declining to award custody of the children to her. The goals of the Alabama Juvenile Justice Act, \u00a7 12-15-101 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, include \u201cpreserv[ing] and strengthening] the family of the child whenever possible\u201d and providing \u201ca preference at all times for the-preservation of the family.\u201d \u00a7 12-15-101(b)(1) and (8), Ala. Code 1975. Section 12-15-314(a)(3)c., Ala. Code 1975, provides, in pertinent part, that a willing, fit, and able relative shall have priority for placement or custody over a nonrelative unless the juvenile court finds it not in the best interests of the child. Section 12-15-301(13) defines a \u201crelative\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201c[a]n individual who is legally related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption within the fourth degree of kinship, including only a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, grandparent,. great grandparent, great-aunt, great-uncle, -great great grandparent, niece, nephew, grandniece, grandnephew, or a stepparent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">L.M. does not contend that the children are her first cousins. L.M. testified that K.R. and a person identified as \u201cD.\u201d are her first cousins. (D. is R.G.\u2019s mother.) Thus, the juvenile court correctly determined that the children are not L.M.\u2019s first cousins; however, it incorrectly determined that' the children are related to L.M. \u201cto the 4th degree of blood relations.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the finding that the children were within the fourth degree of kinship to L.M. is error, DHR, the prevailing party, could not have properly filed a notice of appeal regarding that error. \u201c[W]here a judgment is wholly in a party\u2019s favor and there is nothing prejudicial in the judgment no appeal lies to the prevailing party.\u201d Personnel Bd. of Jefferson Cty. v. Bailey, 475 So.2d 863, 865-66 (Ala. Civ. App. 1985). The juvenile court\u2019s error did not prejudice L.M. because its finding that she was related to the children \u201cto the 4th degree of blood relations\u201d was favorable to her position. -We cannot reverse the juvenile court\u2019s judgment based on its erroneous conclusion that L.M. was a \u201crelative\u201d of the children, pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-301(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Next, L.M. argues that the juvenile court erred by concluding that she was not a suitable custodian because, she says, DHR failed to initiate a proper or adequate investigation regarding her ability to meet the needs of the children. L.M. asserts that DHR actively sabotaged her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>efforts to build a relationship with the children by, she says, denying her supervised visitation, which had been ordered by the juvenile court, in order to claim that, she was a stranger to the children. Indeed, in a December 12, 2015, shelter-care order, the juvenile court had ordered DHR to. provide supervised visitation between the children.and L.M. The transcript contains the following exchange that took place between the mother\u2019s attorney and ' Star Pope, a DHR employee, at the trial;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-3\">\u201cQ; You heard [L.M.] state that she had asked for visitation, and she was told that that was not a good idea, not a possibility. Did you hear her testimony of that.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\u201cA: Yes, I heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amb-dedup-0\">\u201cQ: Do you know who said that to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai7S\">\u201cA: She contacted me and requested visitation. I told her we would address it after the home study. When I did the home study and went , over all the reasons thaLDHR wasn\u2019t supportive of her petition, I informed her that DHR wouldn\u2019t be in agreement with visitation with her at. this point, .that the judge would have to make that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cQ. Was there an order in January granting her visitation with these kids?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anad-dedup-0\">\u201cA.vNo. There was an order in December at the shelter care saying that she may haver \u2014 it\u2019s not prohibited but not that she was entitled to the visitation and there was an [Individualized Service Plan] in January that addressed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Pope said that she had performed a second home study on L.M.\u2019s home on March 9, 2016. Pope said that the home was adequate and that L.M. appeared to have the ability to financially support the children; regardless, L.M.\u2019s home was \u201cnot found to be favorable for the placement of children,\u201d and the home-study report includes an allegation that L.M. had been aware, of the location of the children during the time that DHR could not locate the children. According to Pope,. the daughter had reported knowing L.M., which had suggested to. DHR that L.M. had been in contact with the children, that she had deceived DHR, and that she had lacked protective capacity. L.M. testified that she had had some contact with C.M. while he and K.R. had had the children \u201cin hiding,\u201d that she had asked C.M. to let her have the children, but that C.M. had never told her where the children were located. L.M. said that she had not seen the daughter since October 2013, and she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think if I'was in a lineup [the daughter] could pick me out or if I was sitting in the room that she would even look at me like she knew me.\u201d Pope testified that L.M. was not a proper custodian because either the children did not know L.M. or, if they \u2022 knew her, like the daughter had claimed, L.M. had participated in concealing them whereabouts. Pope said that L.M. intended to remain in contact with C.M. and. that L.M., had said that C.M. had done nothing to put the children at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">L.M, said- that her- husband had been at work and.unable to participate in the home study; however, she claimed that he had told her that an award of custody of the children was \u201cfine with him.\u201d Pope testified that she had contacted L.M.\u2019s husband by telephone because she had needed information regarding L.M.\u2019s husband\u2019s income and that he had informed her that he did not think that the children belonged in his home and had politely refused to provide any additional information. Pope noted in the\u2019 home-study report that L.M.\u2019s husband had \u201crespectfully decline[d] the desire to provide or confirm ... that he is not in agreement [with] the children being placed in the care and custody of his wife.\u201d L.M.\u2019s husband did not appear at the hearing because, according to L.M., he was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Although we do not condone DHR\u2019s unilateral decision to deny L.M.\u2019s court-or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>dered supervised visitation, we conclude that the juvenile court could have properly determined that L.M. was not a-suitable custodian for reasons Other than her- lack of a relationship with the children. Despite L.M.\u2019s denials, Pope\u2019s testimony tended to demonstrate that L.M.\u2019s husband had not supported her desire for an award of custody of the children and that, even though she had had contact with C.M. during the time, that DHR could not locate the children, L.M. had refused to disclose C.M.\u2019s or the children\u2019s whereabouts. The juvenile court apparently resolved the factual disputes in favor of DHR, and it concluded that custody of the children should not be awarded to L.M. Our standard of review prevents us from reweighing the evidence and substituting our judgment for that of the juvenile court. Ex parte R.E.C., 899 So.2d 272, 279 (Aa. 2004) (quoting Delbridge v. Civil Serv. Bd. of Tuscaloosa, 481 So.2d 911, 913 (Ala. Civ. App. 1985)) (stating that an appellate court does not \u201c \u2018reweigh the testimony and substitute its own judgment for that of the trier of fact\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\">In conclusion, we reject L.M.\u2019s argument that she is a relative of the children as that term is defined by \u00a7 12 \u2014 15\u2014301(13), and we affirm the judgment of the juvenile court, which declined to award custody of the children to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">2150658 \u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"ADdY\">2150659 \u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b585-6\">Thompson, P.

On remand from this court, the juvenile court entered two orders certifying the judgment as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ala, R. Civ. P. When an action involves multiple claims or parties, Rule 54(b) gives the trial court the discretion to \"direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of th\u00e9 claims or parties.\u201d If a judgment is properly certified as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), an appeal will lie from that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">. The judgment reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\"[L.M.] is the biological 3rd cousin to the minor children and legally the 2nd cousin to [the daughter], [L.M.] is related to the minor children to the 4th degree of blood relations.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\">.L.M. purported to appeal the judgment regarding case number JU-13-548.01, case number JU-13-548.02, case number JU-13-548.03, case number JU-13-548.05, case number JU-13-274.01, case number JU-13-274.02, and case number JU-13-274.04.

Section 12-15-301 was amended by Act No. 2016-129, Ala. Acts 2016, effective July 1, 2016. Before the amendment, the definition of \"relative\u201d was found in \u00a7 12-15-301(11); as part of the amendment,\u2019\u00a7 12-15-301(11) renumbered as \u00a7 12-15-301(13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">. See Alabama State Pers. Bd. v. Garner, 4 So.3d 545, 553-54 (Ala. Civ. App. 2008)(ex-plaining the method for computing the degrees of kinship). In this case, the datighter was adopted by BCR.; therefore, under the law, L.M.\u2019s and K.R.'s grandparents are the daughter\u2019s- great-grandparents. Counting the degrees of relationship between the daughter and the daughter\u2019s and L.M.\u2019s common ancestors, the daughter's great-grandparents, yields three degrees of relationship. Counting from the common ancestors, L.M.\u2019s grandparents, to L.M. yields two additional degrees of relationship. Therefore, the daughter and L.M. are related to one another in the fifth degree. The son\u2019s great-great-grandparents are L.M.\u2019s grandparents.. Counting the degrees of relationship between the son and the son\u2019s and L.M.\u2019s common ancestors yields four degrees of relationship. Counting from, the common ancestors, L.M.\u2019s grandparents, to L.M., the son\u2019s great-great grandparents, yields two additional degrees of relationship. Therefore, the son and L.M. are related to one another in the sixth degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
