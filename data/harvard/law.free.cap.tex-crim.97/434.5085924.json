Upon the evidence introduced under such plea his punishment was fixed at confinement in the penitentiary for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">No attack was made upon the law in the court below, but for the first time in this court the contention is urged that the law under which conviction was had is unconstitutional, in that in defining the offense the Legislature omitted the exceptions contained in the constitutional amendment under which the law was passed. This exact point has been settled adversely to appellant\u2019s contention in No. 8212, Walker v. State, opinion April 2, 1924; No. 8379, Sproules v.
