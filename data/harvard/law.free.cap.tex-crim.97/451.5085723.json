The affidavit filed with the magistrate states that affiant \u201chas reasons to believe\u201d that the accused is a fugitive from justice in the State of Oklahoma; said affidavit does not state anywhere, in addition to the above, \u201cand does believe,\u201d etc. Had the affidavit been in the latter form it would have been held sufficient. Brown v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 451; Clark v. State. 23 Texas Crim. App., 260; Hall v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">An affidavit in the form of that now before us in which the affiant states only that he \u2018-\u2018has reason to believe etc., has uniformly been held insufficient by the courts of this State. Smith v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 411; Justice v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 462; Green v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 50. Appellant lays stress on Ex Parte Goodman, 79 Texas Crim. Rep., 67, 182 S. W. Rep., 1120, but we observe that said decision apparently involves confusion of the rules applicable to a case arising under the preliminary arrest of one as a fugitive from justice under Arts. 1090-1099, C. C. P. with those rules applicable to the extradition of a fugitive under Art. 1088, id.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Believing the affidavit insufficient to form the basis for holding the appellant in this case for the reason above mentioned, the judgment will be reversed and the appellant ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\n<em>Discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
