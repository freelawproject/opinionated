In regard to this it appears from the testimony of Miller\u2019s father, who was introduced as a witness in behalf of appellant, that John Miller had gone to the State of California and is now residing there. No effort is reflected by the record to obtain his deposition. It is made to appear that appellant learned that Miller had gone from Texas some time before the trial. Our law provides a way in which the testimony of one who is permanently out of the State may be secured on behalf of one accused of crime, but he is not absolved from the use of due diligence in getting same. The motion to quash the indictment seems to present no new matter. It presents the question that the amendment to Sec. 31, Chapter 78 of the Second Called Session of the Thirty-seventh Legislature is null and void because of the alleged fact that the hill undertakes not only to amend said chapter but also undertakes to amend Art. 865-b of the Acts of 1913. We are cited to no authorities holding in accord with the contention made by appellant and none are known to us. We would not think a bill whose entire subject matter related to amending the law rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tive to intoxicating liquors would be open to the objection made to this amendment, to-wit: that it related to more than one subject. The other questions raised by appellant in his motion to quash have all been settled against him by decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Finding no error in the.record, an affirmance will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"ASI\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">May 7,1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b448-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATD\">Appellant insists that we were not justified by the record in that portion of our opinion wherein we stated: \u201cIt is made to appear that appellant learned that Miller had gone from Texas some time before the trial. Our law provides a way in which the testimony of one who is permanently out of the State may be secured on behalf of one accused of crime, but he is not absolved from the use of due diligence in getting same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">From the testimony of the father of witness Miller we quote: \u201cMy son is now making his permanent home in California. . . . The past four years I -have lived in about a mile and a half of him (appellant) \u201d. Referring again to his son, witness said: \u201cHe had an interest in a crop with me and I sold the last bale of cotton he was interested in on the 7th of December this last year; he left that day; I sold the bale of cotton in the morning and deposited the money in the bank for him and he left that evening.\u201d Appellant was recalled to the witness stand and testified as follows: \u201cI had John M. Miller subpoenaed as a witness in this case; I knew that he had been subpoenaed. I do not remember, just when I first learned that he had left Jones County, but it was some little time back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">We thus learn from the record that appellant lived a mile and a half from the home of witness and his father; that witness left Jones County for California on the 7th day of December, 1922; that all the parties lived in the .country. That a month and two days after the departure of John Miller for California this case was tried and appellant presented his application for a continuance because of the absence of John Miller. He says while a witness that he knew John Miller had left the county some time back. Knowing this he made no effort to obtain the deposition of said witness. This seems to establish beyond controversy an entire lack of diligence. The law presumes that what is wanted is the testimony, not merely a continuance. This is the only point presented in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Believing that no error was committed, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
