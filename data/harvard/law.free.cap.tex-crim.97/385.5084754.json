An inspection of the statement of facts sustains the grounds of the State\u2019s motion. We regret the condition of the record, but we must insist that the law be complied, with in preparing it in order that the already heavy burden on this court be not added to. All that has been said in Fenton v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 366, 248 S. W., 363; Jenkins v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 375, 247 S. W., 861; James v. State, (No. 7639, not yet reported) is equally applicable to the statement of facts in the present case, and the State\u2019s motion must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The only bills of exception relate to criticism of the charge given and the failure to give one requested charge. These matters cannot he appraised in the absence of the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">An affirmance of the judgment is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">[Rehearing denied May 7, 1924.
