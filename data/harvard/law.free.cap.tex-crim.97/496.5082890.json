Appellant had filed an application for such suspended sentence and introduced proof that he was under twenty-five years of age. We have held that proof of indictment or conviction for offenses, neither felonies nor involving moral turpitude, is not competent either for purposes of impeachment or as affecting the issue of suspended sentence. In the admission of such testimony, and in the instruction to the jury that they might consider same as affecting the issue of suspended sentence, the learned trial judge fell into error. Johnson v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 582, 241 S. W. Rep., 484; Garrison v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 541, 252 S. W. Rep., 511; Alexander v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep., 497, 255 S. W.
