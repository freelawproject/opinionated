Officers went to appellant\u2019s house with a search warrant and found in his kitchen behind the stove a barrel of soured mash and hidden under the floor a used still and in various places a large number of bottles each containing the odor of whisky and some of them a small quantity of it. According to the testimony of one of the officers appellant admitted to him that he had been making whisky with the mash and apparatus found. This seems to fully meet the demands of the law, and believing that it supports the verdict of the jury, an affirmance will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">June 11, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b567-15\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"APW\">Appellant complains vigorously of the insufficiency of the testimony and asserts that he made an exculpatory statement to witness Winters which was brought out by the State, and he claims the State to be bound thereby. Reference to the testimony of witness Winters when recalled discloses that the statement referred to in appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing was brought out by appellant himself upon cross-examination. The record shows that the officers who went to appellant\u2019s house on the occasion in question found there the raw material in the shape of mash and the equipment in the shape of a recently used still, and some of the finished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>product as evidenced by small quantities of whisky in the great number of bottles, jars, etc., that were found in trunks, dresser drawers, washstands and other places in the house. It further shows that appellant denied knowledge of anything until he saw the officers were about to locate the still under the floor when he expressed 'surprise that some negro had hid a still under his house. One witness testified that from the looks and smell of the still it had been recently used. We quote what another witness testified/ as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cThe defendant 'told me it would make whisky; he said he made the beer and then cooked it off and made whisky out of it. He told me that it would make you drunk; he told me that night if you drank enough of that beer it would make you drunk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We think the testimony sufficient, and the motion for rehearing will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
