Only one bill of exceptions is found in the record.

In the absence of the facts proven it is impossible for us to appraise the worth of this bill. It appears that the prosecuting officer was stating his conclusion and without the facts we must assume that the conclusion was drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">No error appearing from the record, and affirmance of the judgment is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
