The term \u201cwilfully or without justification,\u201d as used in Article 640a, Penal Code, apply as well to the provisions of said article declaring one guilty thereunder who \u201cneglects or refuses to provide for the support and maintenance\u201d of his wife or children as to the one denouncing desertion of them. The motion to quash was based upon the further proposition that the names of the children whom appellant was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>deserting were nowhere stated. This criticism is also well taken. See Irving v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep., 615, 166 S. W., 1166. Notwithstanding the defects in the information the charge authorized a conviction for the desertion of the wife 1 \u2018 and children, \u2019 \u2019 and . also for neglect or refusal to provide for their maintenance and support. The charge was properly excepted to and a special charge designed to correct the error was requested and refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Our able State\u2019s Attorney has confessed error relative to the matters discussed. As we concur in his views, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
