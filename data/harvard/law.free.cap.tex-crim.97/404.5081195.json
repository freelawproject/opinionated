This latter fact was in testimony from a doctor and was not controverted. The pistol was used as a firearm. We do not think it necessary for the court in the charge to instruct the jury in such case that the pistol was a deadly weapon, or to submit to them the question as to whether it was in fact such weapon. Gallaher v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 266; Lofton v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 270; id 296; Hartfield v. State, 61 Texas Crim. Rep., 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">The record is before us without any bills of exception. An exception was taken to the charge, which exception was approved and filed and presents appellant\u2019s complaint at paragraph seven of the court\u2019s charge because it permitted the jury to convict of aggravated assault in the absence of proof of facts which constituted such assault. We do not think the charge, as a whole open to the exception taken and that when paragraph seven is considered in connection with the remainder of the charge and the undisputed facts in the case, no error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Believing from the record that appellant has had a fair trial, an affirmance will be ordered-</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">\n<em>Afflrmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
