The alleged purchaser testified positively to a sale of whisky by appellant, and the evidence of two officers who witnessed their conduct strongly supports the main State witness. Appellant denied making any sale <em>of </em>whisky, and if the jury had accepted his testimony and that of his witnesses as true, an acquittal would have followed; but the jury accepted the State\u2019s evidence as reflecting the true state of facts, and it fully warrants the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
