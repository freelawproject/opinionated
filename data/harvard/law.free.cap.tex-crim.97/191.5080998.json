State, No. 8131, opinion handed down March 26, 1924. The prosecution ivas under Article 548 of our Penal Code, punishment for a violation of which is fixed by statute at a fine of not less than ten nor more than twenty-five dollars. The trial court instructed the jury that they might assess a punishment of not less than den nor more than fifty dollars, and the verdict fixed the penalty at the latter amount. This has been universally held to be a fundamental error. See authorities cited in the ease of Bryan v. State, supra. There are other errors complained of which will probably not occur upon another trial of the case and a discussion of which is pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">For the error mentioned the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
