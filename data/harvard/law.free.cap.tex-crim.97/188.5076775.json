It was no valid objection to the information herein that in separate counts same charged different violations of said statute, of kindred character, same being misdemeanors. Witherspoon v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 65; Gould v. State, 66 Texas Crim. Rep., 421, 147 S. W. Rep., 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We do not think the information defective for failure to allege what language was used by appellant in aiding the voter. The statute penalizes him if he aid any voter in a language other than the English language, and the information advised the accused that at a particular time and place he aided a named voter in making out his ballot and that in so doing he used language other than the English language. The object of this law is evidently to prevent fraud in elections. The judges, officers and citizens of this State generally should know the English language and, therefore, should know what was being said by any particular officer to a voter offering to vote and desiring assistance in making out his ballot, but such other officers might not know the language used in so aiding, if it be a foreign language. To require that the information or indictment should plead, and the proof show, what other language was used, would not aid the accused and would not more specifically point out the offense committed, and such requirement might seriously hamper the enforcement of the law and practically render it ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Being of opinion that no error appears in the record, an affirmance must be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>Afirp^ed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
