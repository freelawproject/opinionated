According to his testimony he, on the 15th day of March, purchased from the appellant a quart of corn whisky and paid therefor the sum of five dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-21\">Appellant\u2019s testimony was in substance this: He had agreed to furnish the witness Duncan with five or ten gallons of whisky at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>a time, once a month, so that he might supply a \u201cbunch\u201d of friends. According to the agreement between them, appellant was to receive eight dollars per gallon and Duncan was to sell it for sixteen dollars per gallon and then deliver to appellant one-half of the profit. Under this contract, .appellant, according to his testimony, had made three trips to Duncan\u2019s store and delivered a total of six gallons of whisky, and Duncan had complied with the terms of the agreement, namely, to pay eight dollars per gallon on delivery and four dollars\u2019 profit after the sales took place. Appellant denied the sale of the quart of wihsky for five dollars, and Duncan denied the transaction or agreement as detailed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">. The only question raised upon this appeal is the complaint of the refusal of the court to charge the jury upon the law Of accomplice testimony as applied to the witness Duncan. The court did charge the jury thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the defendant and J. E. Duncan, about the first week in February, 1923, entered into an agreement by which the defendant was to furnish whisky to J. E. Duncan, and that J. E. Duncan was to dispose of said whisky and that defendant and J. E. Duncan would divide profits, then you are charged that if such agreement was entered into, then the testimony of J. E. Duncan as to the delivery of any whisky to him by the defendant under such agreement, if any, would be accomplice testimony, and in this connection, you are charged that if the defendant delivered whisky to J. E. Duncan but same was delivered to him, only under said agreement, if any, you will acquit the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">This paragraph is deemed adequate to protect the interests of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The judgment is affirmed. -</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">May 21, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b136-10\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ADyj\">It is insisted that the charge quoted in the original opinion did not suffice for the customary charge on accomplice testimony. The alleged purchaser, (the only state\u2019s witness) denied any such agreement relative to whisky as was testified to by appellant. There was no corroboration of the state\u2019s witness as to the sale. The learned trial judge realized that if appellant\u2019s version of the matter was true the alleged purchaser was in fact criminally connected with the seller and therefore an accomplice witness, and there being no corroboration the state\u2019s case must fall. This is precisely what he told the jury. When the record is devoid of corroborating evidence why tell the jury there must be corroboration be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>fore conviction could be had. Why not tell them if they find the only state\u2019s witness to be an accomplice they must acquit?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
