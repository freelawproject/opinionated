They bought it from \u00e1 man named Bodkin and claimed they had it sold for eighty dollars. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">The indictment is in form which has heretofore often been held by us sufficient, and there was no error in overruling the motion to quash same. A special charge requesting the court to tell the jury that it is unlawful to transport liquor for purposes of sale and that the jury should acquit if they had a doubt as to whether such was the purpose of the transportation, was properly refused, as were all of the other special charges which appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">The verdict as originally returned was regarded as informal and was rewritten by the district attorney and then read to the jury, and the learned trial judge asked them and each of them if that was their verdict, to which they replied, yes. There was no error in this proceeding. The State witnesses in this cause are specifically removed from the character of accomplices, by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">No error appearing in the record, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">April 30, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b133-5\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Acn\">The only complaint made is that we failed to discuss the matter of accomplices. The question of accomplices or accomplice testimony was not raised in any way in the trial court. The only way in which we would consider it at this time \"would be as to the sufficiency of the testimony. In view of the motion we have again examined the record and find that the conviction is amply supported by the testimony of Bessie Bodkin and her mother, neither of whom appear to have had anything to do with the liquor, the transportation of which constitutes-the offense charged against appellants. The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
