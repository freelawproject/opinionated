We do not regard a discussion of the subject proper. It is usual in applications for bail that the facts surrounding the transaction are but partially and imperfectly developed, and this may be true of. this case. The circumstances under which one may make an arrest without a warrant are set out in the statute. See Title 5, C. C. P. Many of the decisions of this court construing the statutes are collated in Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, pp. 133-135; see also Burkhart v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 228. The propriety of refraining from a discussion of the legal questions in this character of case has often been asserted by this court. That practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>has generally been adhered to unless in \"the given ease there is some reason for a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">The judgment is reversed and the relator granted bail in the sum of $7,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
