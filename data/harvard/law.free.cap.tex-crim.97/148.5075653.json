He also observed the appellant carrying water. Later, the officer, in company with others, went to the home of the appellant and finding him there, asked him the whereabouts of the \u201cchoc beer\u201d which he was making that afternoon. Appellant replied that it was near the door. One of. the officers looked at the place, designated and found there \u201ca ten-gallon keg of sour mash and stuff.\u201d Appellant was then asked the whereabouts of the \u201cfinished stuff.\u201d When asked if he, had any more, he declared that he did not, but later the officer found some more. There was more liquor in the \u25a0 tub in which the mash had been cooking earlier in the day. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>were also found on the premises fifteen gallons of choc beer which was warm. The liquid found on the premises was analyzed and found to contain eight and a fraction per cent of alcohol by volume. There was also evidence that \u201cchoc beer\u201d was intoxicating, the percentage of alcohol being above that in the beverage known as \u201clager beer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Appellant\u2019s testimony was to the effect that he was merely starting to make \u201cchoc beer\u201d; that the arrest interrupted his operations; that according to the process' of making it, it was required to cool before the ingredients necessary to complete it were put in it; that his arrest was made while the liquid was still hot. He also testified that when the officers arrived with a search-warrant, they said: \u201cHave you got any choc\u201d; that he replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and pointed it out to them. He had not previously manufactured such an article. He said it was not made to sell or to transport it; that it was not intoxicating. He further said that in warm weather it took about four days to make \u201cchoc beer,\u201d and in winter it took longer time; that to complete the article which he had in the tub, it would have to have hops, yeast and sugar put in it besides the articles that were in it at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Objection was made to the receipt in evidence of the declarations of the appellant to which we have adverted upon the ground that they constituted a verbal confession made while appellant was in custody and unwarned. The declarations are apparently admissible under the exceptions to the statute on confessions, which reads thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">... or, unless in connection with said confession, he makes statements of facts or circumstances that are found to be true, which conduce to establish his guilt, such as the finding of secreted or stolen property, or the instrument with which he states the offense was committed.\u201d (Art. 810, C. C. P.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">See Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 756, note 12, and cases cited; also Broz v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 137; Branch\u2019s Ann Texas P. C., Sec. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
