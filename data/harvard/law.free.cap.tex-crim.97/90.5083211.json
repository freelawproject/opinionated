' A motion was made to quash this indictment because the exceptions were negatived conjunctively, the word \u201cand\u201d being used instead of the word \u201cor\u201d. The learned trial judge erroneously overruled the motion to quash based on said defect in the indict- \u25a0 ment, for which error the judgment of the trial court must be. reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed. Davis v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 300, 250 S. W. Rep., 1029 and authorities there cited, supports the proposition advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">For the reason mentioned the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
