The indictment charges an attempt by force to rape a woman. The charge of the court appears to conform to the law. There are no bills of exception in the record, and the only statement of any exception to the court\u2019s charge is in the broadest terms possible, and evinces an entire lack of conformity to the requirements of Article 735, C. C. P. There is a special charge in the record marked \u201crefused\u201d and an exception noted, but in the absence of a statement of facts it is impossible for us to ascertain whether said charge was called for by the facts or not. The matters set up in the motion for new trial are not supported in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
