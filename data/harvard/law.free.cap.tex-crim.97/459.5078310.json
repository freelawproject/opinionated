He stated that he believed some of the jurors were members of such organization and prejudiced against him, and wished to interrogate the respective jurors in order to ascertain these matters. The court declined to permit him to do so. Appellant\u2019s proposition is that he should have been accorded the right to make the investigation in order that he might intelligently have exercised the peremptory challenges accorded him under the statute. The State\u2019s attorney concedes that the learned trial judge was in error in the ruling complained of. The following cases are directly in point: Reich v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 449, 251 S. W., 1072; Benson v. State, 95 Texas Crim Rep., 311; 254 S. W., 793; Belcher v. State, 257 S. W., 1097; Welk v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep., 373; 257 S. W., 1098. Many authorities will be found cited in the foregoing cases, among them being Kerley v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 199, 230 S. W., 163, in which the scope and purpose of \u201cperemptory\u201d challenges are discussed at some length. For' the error mentioned the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Other questions presented may not arise upon another trial and will not be considered. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
