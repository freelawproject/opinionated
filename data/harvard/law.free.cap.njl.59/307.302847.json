THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b347-6\">If there be degrees of reasonable doubt, the definition of such degrees is a matter of no moment in the administration of criminal justice, for if, after carefully weighing the evidence, the jury finds its judgment unconvinced of guilt, a state of reasonable doubt exists, the benefit of which must be given to the accused without reference to its degree. It was erroneous, therefore, to charge the jury in a criminal case that <em>\u201c </em>any reasonable doubt must be given to the defendant, but it must be a very reasonable one,\u201d for such a direction permitted, if it did not require, the jury to refuse to the accused the benefit of such a doubt unless it was of the highest or at least of a very high degree.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">On error tp the Atlantic Sessions.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b347-8\">Argued at June Term, 1896, before Beasley, Chief Justice, and Justices Mague, Garrison and Lippincott.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-9\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>William D.

Eor this reason his conviction was wrong, and the judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
