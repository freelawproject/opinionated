Colie.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-7\">For the plaintiff, <em>Irwin W. Schultz.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b110-9\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-H\">This is a demurrer to the first count in the-plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">This count, stripped of merely formal words, is: That the-defendant \u201c promised forthwith and without notice or demand, to pay, and the said plaintiff, at the special instance and request of the defendant, agreed to accept <em>a sum of money, </em>to-wit, the sum of four hundred and eighty dollars, in consideration of a settlement of a claim that said plaintiff had against said defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The count then sets forth that the defendant, by reason of the aforesaid promise, became liable to pay the said sum without notice or demand; that the defendant has not paid the-said sum, and that an action thereby hath accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The count is bad. The promise of the defendant is without consideration. The <em>\u201c </em>settlement \u201d said to be the consideration does not extinguish a prior cause of action, if any such existed; it deprives the promisee of nothing and is of no avail to the promisor. Even such promise as there was is-not the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s suit, for his agreement was to accept a sum of money, not a promise to pay such sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Declarations defective in like respects are illustrated in the cases of <em>Conover </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>54; <em>Union Locomotive and Express Co. </em>v. <em>Erie Railway Co., </em>8 <em>Id. </em>23; Farmers\u2019 <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>44 <em>Barb. </em>641; <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>3 <em>Pick. </em>83; <em>American notes to </em>3 <em>White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Lead. Cas. Eq. (5th Am. ed.) </em>406, case Stapleton <em>v. </em>Stapleton.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">In the. case in hand a notice annexed to the narr. restates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>action as being based upon a settlement of a loss on a fire policy. This cannot' be noticed upon demurrer. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Vreeland, </em>9 <em>Vroom </em>366.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It serves, however, as a concrete illustration of the inadequacy of this style of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The demurrer is sustained, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
