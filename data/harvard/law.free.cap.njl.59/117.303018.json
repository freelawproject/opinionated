He was not entitled to it except for the performance of those duties, and having accepted it he cannot now, with seven years\u2019 salary in his pocket, successfully claim that the fees and expenses which the law allows him have not been paid by the county</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The <em>mandamus </em>should be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
