Resort cannot be had to the copy of the paper annexed to the declaration to show that fact; it is technically no part of the declaration. To enable the defendant to take \u2022advantage of the alleged defect, the body of the declaration .must refer to the instrument sued on as so annexed; it thereby becomes part of the pleading. Otherwise the court cannot, -on demurrer, take notice of it. <em>Gen.
