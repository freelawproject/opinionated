Lawrence.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-9\">For the defendants, <em>William D. Edwards.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b87-11\">Magie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEg\">If the matters set up in the plea demurred to availed as a defence against the notes whereon the judgment now sued on was recovered, it is obvious that they could have been interposed as a defence in that action. That fact is decisive of the question raised by this demurrer. For nothing is better settled than that the validity of judgments cannot be impeached for any supposed defect or irregularity in the \u25a0transaction on which they were founded, and therefore no \u2022defence can be interposed to an action on a judgment upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>matters existing before its recovery. That this doctrine is applicable to all judgments recovered in the same state or in any other state of the Union has never been questioned. <em>Chit.
