THE OCEAN GROVE CAMP MEETING ASSOCIATION.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-7\">The ninth section of \u201cAn act conferring certain powers of government on boards of trustees, hoards of directors or managers of any camp-meeting association,\u201d &amp;e. <em>{Gen. Stat., p. </em>347), authorizes suits to be brought for the collection of penalties, incurred for the violation of ordinances passed by such associations, before any justice of the-peace, police justice or officer specially commissioned possessing the powers of police justices. <em>Held, </em>following <em>White </em>v. <em>Neptune Oily, </em>27 <em>Vroom </em>222, that the proceedings prescribed by this section are civil suits in the courts for the trial of small causes, and are not reviewable by <em>certiorari </em>in those cases in which the parties are given an appeal to-the Court of Common Pleas by the provisions of the Justices\u2019 Courts act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b409-9\">Argued at June Term, 1896, before Justices Depue, Van Syckel and Gummere.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-10\">For the prosecutor, <em>Claude V.

The ordinance violated was passed under the authority of \u201cAn act conferring certain powers of government on boards of trustees, boards of directors or managers of any camp meeting association,\u201d Ac. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1894, <em>p. </em>140. By the terms of this .act any person who violates any provision of an ordinance passed under its authority may be sued by the association for \u2022.the penalty prescribed in such ordinance, before any justice \u25a0of the peace, police justice or officer specially commissioned and possessing the powers of police justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In the case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Neptune City, </em>27 <em>Vroorn </em>222, this court, in construing a statutory provision similar to that just referred to, held that the court designated by the act as the forum where such suits should be prosecuted was not a tribunal newly created by the statute itself, but was the preexisting and well-known Justice\u2019s Court. Judgments of that court, except those obtained by confession, are only reviewable by appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, and cannot be removed into this court by <em>certiorari </em>for the correction of any supposed error therein, unless it appears that the justice was without jurisdiction. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1882, \u00a7 96. In the case before us it appears by the record and proceedings sent up with the writ that the justice had jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit and also over the parties with reference to that subject-matter. That being so, we feel constrained to hold, under the authority of <em>White </em>v. <em>Neptune City, supra, </em>that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this case was improvidently issued and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The prosecutor is entitled to costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
