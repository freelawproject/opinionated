In the years 1894 and 1895 the assessor exempted from taxation five acres, with the buildings thereon, and assessed one hundred and fifteen acres, on which are erected some of the buildings necessary for the uses of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The five acres exempted would hold all the buildings erected upon the entire tract of one hundred and twenty acres, but it does not appear that five acres can be so set off as to contain all the buildings on the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">By force of the fifth section of the act of 1894 <em>(Gen. Stat., p. </em>3320), exemption is claimed not only for the five acres and the buildings thereon, but also for the buildings upon the remaining one hundred and fifteen acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The said fifth section exempts \u201c all colleges, academies or seminaries of learning, public libraries, school-houses, buildings erected and used for religious worship, buildings used as asylums or schools for the care, cure, nurture, maintenance and education of feeble-minded or idiotic persons and children, provided such institutions are duly incorporated under the laws of this state, and the land whereon the same are situate, necessary to the fair use and enjoyment thereof, not exceeding five acres for each one, the furniture thereof and the personal property used therein,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>497, under the act of 1851 <em>(Pamph.
