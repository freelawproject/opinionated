It is distinctly averred that the $200 were obtained by means of the false pretences.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">The third alleged infirmity in the indictment is that the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>false pretence charged is such that a person of ordinary pru\u2022dence and caution would not be deceived by it. To this it is a sufficient answer that it is of common knowledge that many persons have been deluded by a like artifice. Laws are made to protect weak-minded and credulous as well as \u2022sagacious persons. The wise and wary can protect themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"ABi\">The writ should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
