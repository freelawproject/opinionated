L., p. </em>224), authorizing the transfer of suits from Circuit Courts to the Courts of Common Pleas, cannot be interpreted to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Pleas; the authority given to the Pleas extends no further than <em>\u201c </em>to hear causes so transferred in like manner as if the same had been originally brought in said court.\u201d The jurisdiction over mechanics\u2019 lien cases is vested exclusively in the Circuit Courts, and if brought originally in the Pleas could not be heard there at all. Hence, by the legislative test above cited, such cases cannot be heard by the Pleas when transferred thereto from the Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Upon application to the justice of the Supreme Court holding the Circuit, the cause may be remanded for trial therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
