Gray appeals from his conviction for failure to display license plates and a certif\u00edcate of registration regarding the cement pumper he was driving. We find no merit to the appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">{\u00b6 3} Gray is employed by Hydracrete Pumping Company as a driver of one of its 18 cement pumpers. According to the stipulated facts, a cement pumper consists of a pumping apparatus that is placed on a boom or crane, which is permanently attached to a truck chassis. A single power source operates both the truck engine and the pumping equipment. The pumper is self-transporting: it travels to various construction sites via public streets and highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">{\u00b6 4} Gray was driving the pumper on July 23, 2002, on 1-90 near Martin Luther King Boulevard, when he was stopped and cited for failure to display license plates, in violation of Cleveland Codified Ordinance (\u201cC.C.O.\u201d) 435.09, failure to display a certificate of registration for the vehicle, in violation of C.C.O. 435.09(a) and R.C. 4549.18, and failure to wear a seat belt, in violation of C.C.O. 437.27(B)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">{\u00b6 5} Gray moved to dismiss the citations, arguing that the cement pumper was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as defined in R.C. 4501.01(B), but was construction equipment, which was not subject to licensing or registration requirements. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>trial court denied the motion, finding in a five-page opinion that, although the cement pumper was construction equipment, because it was being operated on the general highway at the time of the citation, it was also a motor vehicle, subject to licensing and registration requirements for motor vehicles and commercial drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">{\u00b6 6} Gray thereafter pled no contest, and the trial court found him guilty. He was fined $50 each for the license-plate and certificate-of-registration violations and $25 for the seat-belt violation. The sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 7} In his sole assignment of error, Gray argues that the cement pumper is not a motor vehicle as defined in R.C. 4501.01(B), and that he, therefore, should not have been cited for failure to display license plates. He also argues that because the pumper is not a commercial vehicle, he should not have been cited for failure to display a certificate of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4501.01(B) defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cany vehicle, including mobile homes and recreational vehicles, that is propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power or power collected from overhead electric trolley wires. Motor vehicle does not include motorized bicycles, road rollers, traction engines, power shovels, power cranes, and other equipment used in construction work and not designed for or employed in general highway transportation. * <em>At</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 9} Although the cement pumper is \u201cequipment used in construction work,\u201d it is designed for use on the general highway so that it can travel from site to site. In fact, at the time Gray was stopped, the vehicle was traveling on 1-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 10} This court held in <em>Putka v. Parma </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 647, 630 N.E.2d 380, that a backhoe, which was being driven from a garage to a work site, constituted a motor vehicle subject to city and state laws governing the regulation of motor vehicles, because at the time of the incident, it was being operated on a public road. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he exempted vehicles must be used for their intended purposes in order for the exemption to lie. * * * An exemption cannot be given based on what a vehicle\u2019s supposed function should be, but what it was being used for at the time of the incident.\u201d Id. at 651, 630 N.E.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 11} The \u201cuse test\u201d employed in <em>Putka </em>was reviewed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Muenchenbach v. Preble Cty. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 141, 742 N.E.2d 1128. The court upheld the \u201cuse standard,\u201d holding that \u201c[a] use standard may be applied to determine whether a vehicle constitutes excepted construction equipment because that exception is subject to the qualification that such equipment not be \u2018employed in general highway transportation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>{\u00b6 12} In the instant case, although the cement pumper\u2019s intended function is to pump cement, Gray was driving it from one construction site to another on the public highway when he was cited. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 4501.01(B) and the above case law, at that time, the pumper was being used as a motor vehicle and was required to display license plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 13} We also find that the cement pumper is a commercial vehicle pursuant to R.C. 4506.01(E)(6) and, therefore, subject to the requirement that a certificate of registration be displayed pursuant to R.C. 4549.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4506.01(E)(6) defines a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aut-dedup-0\">\u201cCommercial motor vehicle means any motor vehicle designed or used to transport persons or property that meets any of the following qualifications: [any] single vehicle or combination of vehicles that is designed to be operated and to travel on a public street or highway and is considered by the federal highway administration to be a commercial motor vehicle, including but not limited to, a motorized crane, a vehicle whose function is to pump cement, a rig for drilling wells, and a portable crane.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 15} The cement pumper satisfies all three requirements. First, the pumper is designed to be self-transporting, i.e., it transports the attached crane and pumping apparatus to the various sites and therefore is designed to transport property. Second, it was designed to travel on public streets or highways in order to get from site to site. Finally, pursuant to R.C. 4506.01(E), it is a vehicle designed to pump cement. Therefore, because the pumper satisfies these requirements, Gray was required to display a certificate of registration pursuant to R.C. 4549.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 16} Although Gray has cited federal law and IRS rulings in contesting his conviction, we find these cases to be unpersuasive because it is within the province of state law to define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201ccommercial motor vehicle\u201d as set forth in state statutes. <em>Scott v. Bank One Trust Co., N.A. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 39, 42-43, 577 N.E.2d 1077; <em>State ex rel. Black v. White </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 58, 65, 7 O.O. 165, 5 N.E.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 17} Gray\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-11\">Kenneth A. Rocco, A.J., and Diane Karpinski, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\">. Gray is not appealing the seat-belt violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">. The court further held that the <em>Putka </em>use standard was limited in application because the \"use standard can do no more than vitiate the particular exception that justifies its application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>in the first place; it cannot apply to reformulate a definition of motor vehicle provided by the General Assembly.\u201d Id. at 148, 630 N.E.2d 380.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
