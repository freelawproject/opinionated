Defendant, John N. Baba, filed an answer and counterclaim. On May 10, 2001, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment and, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment, based upon a settlement agreement entered into previously between the plaintiffs - and defendant on March 30, 1999, and on the basis of an absence of serious emotional distress arising out of any act defendant committed after the date of the March 30, 1999 release. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on May 10, 2001. Defendant then filed a motion to strike. By decision and entry dated June 21, 2001, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike. The trial court also denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 2} On November 5, 2001, defendant filed a motion in limine requesting the court to exclude evidence relating to defendant\u2019s behavior toward plaintiffs prior to the execution of the settlement agreement and also evidence of defendant\u2019s conviction for menacing by stalking. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion regarding the menacing-by-stalking conviction; however, the court stated that plaintiffs would be allowed to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution, evidence that he had been placed on probation, and evidence that defendant\u2019s probation officer had determined that he had violated the terms of his probation. The trial, court also determined that plaintiffs would be permitted to introduce into evidence a limited number of the sexually graphic, violent, and abusive letters that defendant had sent to plaintiffs prior to March 30, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to trial before a jury on February 12, 2002. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to plaintiffs\u2019 claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate emotional distress that was severe and debilitating as required. The court also directed a verdict in favor of defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence, fraud, depression, and malice. The trial court allowed the jury to consider plaintiffs\u2019 claim for breach of contract. The trial court further found that plaintiffs had demonstrated that defendant had committed the common-law tort of stalking and instructed the jury accordingly. The jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs, awarding both compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees. Defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; however, this motion was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, defendant filed a notice of appeal in this court asserting the following 17 assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law in failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>. {\u00b6 6} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to specific statutes, rules, and controlling authority by permitting plaintiffs to introduce evidence of misdemeanor criminal charges brought against defendant and his alleged conviction (which at the time was on appeal and was later reversed on appeal) and conditions of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred, acted contrary to law, and abused its discretion by permitting testimony by the supervisor of defendant\u2019s former probation officer and by permitting testimony of a city prosecutor who was not even involved in the criminal case relating to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[4.] The trial court erred, acted contrary to law, and abused its discretion by permitting plaintiffs to read and testify to, and introduce into evidence the contents of letters written to them by defendant when plaintiffs had settled their civil claim related to the letters and had executed a release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[5.] The trial court erred, acted contrary to law, and abused its discretion by permitting plaintiffs to introduce into evidence of matters which had been settled by the parties and for which plaintiffs had released defendant from liability including evidence of the alleged conduct of defendant upon which the misdemeanor charges were based as to plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[6.] The trial court erred, acted contrary to law, and abused its discretion by permitting plaintiffs to introduce into evidence Internet public message board postings which defendant did not admit to writing when the sole foundation for relevancy of the postings was plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that they believed defendant wrote the postings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[7.] The trial court erred, acted contrary to law, and abused its discretion by permitting improper opinions by lay witnesses that public message board postings posted under several different names were all written by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[8.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award damages for plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress on their breach of contract claim in the absence of any evidence of severe or debilitating emotional distress, the absence of which the trial court had previously correctly ruled precluded any recovery by plaintiffs on tortious infliction of emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[9.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award damages for plaintiffs\u2019 claimed emotional distress when plaintiffs introduced no expert testimony whatsoever related to their emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[10.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that as a matter of law the Settlement Agreement among the parties was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>contract which the parties understood the breach of which was likely to result in psychological damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[11.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award punitive damages for plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim when plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief did not include a request for such damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[12.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by giving the jury an \u2018eggshell skull\u2019 instruction that defendant was required to take plaintiffs as he found them, even though plaintiffs\u2019 alleged predisposition to emotional distress had been the subject of a previous settlement with defendant, and plaintiffs had released defendant from liability for that predeposition, necessarily including any \u2018eggshell skull\u2019 resulting therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[13.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award plaintiffs damages for a common law tort action of \u2018stalking,\u2019 even though plaintiffs failed to plead such a tort in their complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[14.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award plaintiffs punitive damages for a common law tort action of \u2018stalking,\u2019 when R.C. 2307.60 specifically prohibits such an award in a statutory civil action based upon violation of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[15.] The trial court erred and acted contrary to law by instructing the jury that it could award punitive damages for mere, ordinary insult to plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[16.] The trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict as to plaintiff Spurgoeon [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[17.] The trial court erred and abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney without conducting an evidentiary hearing as to the reasonableness and amount of such fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">{\u00b6 22} Although at trial counsel for defendant made every effort-to confine the evidence submitted to the jury to events which took place after March 1999, it is impossible to review the case without taking into account those acts which occurred prior to March 1999. The trial court found and, as will become apparent, this court agrees, that the events which took place after March 1999 could not have been viewed by the jury and cannot be viewed by this court in isolation without considering the nature of the events which occurred prior to March 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">{\u00b6 23} The origin of plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit dates back to 1996 when defendant began the course of action which ultimately led to defendant being charged with menacing by stalking. Over a period of two years, defendant sent -approximately 100 letters to plaintiffs, the content of which was obscene, derogatory, violent, and pornographic. Many of the letters sent to plaintiffs contained sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>explicit, disturbing, and disgusting language. Other letters were violent and threatening in nature, such as one received by plaintiff Spurgeon stating that she should commit suicide and that he hoped she would b\u00e9 raped. During this time, defendant also telephoned plaintiff Stockdale frequently and even came to her home and knocked on the door. Eventually, plaintiffs learned defendant\u2019s identity and he was charged with menacing by stalking. Ultimately, defendant pled no contest to the charges, was placed on probation, and entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs whereby he paid them a total of $14,500 and agreed to end all contact with plaintiffs. Specifically, subparagraph (F) of the settlement agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cBaba agrees to never contact either Stockdale or Spurgeon, by any method, either in person, through the United States Mail, or through telephonic or computer email contact, or by and through third parties, excepting attorneys in the event of a good faith allegation of a breach of this agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 25} Plaintiffs also signed a release from all claims and rights of action which they either now had or which may accrue arising out of the contact and/or relationship between the plaintiffs and defendant, including personal injuries, damage and lawsuits which were presently known as well as those which were unknown but which may develop or be discovered in the future for defendant\u2019s actions prior to the signing of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 26} Despite the criminal action, being placed on probation, the settlement agreement, and the financial penalties, defendant began posting messages to a local internet message board in January 2000. The website to which defendant began posting messages was \u201cCringe.com,\u201d which is a website utilized by local Columbus musicians. Both plaintiffs had been and were members of local Columbus area bands. It had been through the Cringe.com website that defendant had originally obtained personal information about plaintiffs that enabled him to contact plaintiff Stockdale. Plaintiff Stockdale was the contact person for two bands of which she was a member. Plaintiff Stockdale began seeing postings on the website\u2019s message board, which can be described as insulting, especially towards female bands and female band members, as well as spiteful, even hateful. Several of these postings mentioned plaintiff Stockdale by name. Over the course of two months, the postings became increasingly aggressive. The postings were signed by fictitious names, including the following: \u201cMathias,\u201d \u201cMS,\u201d \u201cCaligula,\u201d \u201cRoger St. Jean Smythe,\u201d \u201cLittle Boots,\u201d \u201cCC DeMarco,\u201d \u201cCAL,\u201d and \u201cDon Pijote.\u201d Defendant did admit, at some point in time, that he posted the messages that were signed under the fictitious name \u201cDon Pijote.\u201d At trial, plaintiffs were permitted to submit postings under the other fictitious names as well, as it was plaintiffs\u2019 belief that, because of the style of the writing and the word choice utilized, the defendant had indeed posted those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>messages as well. Plaintiffs testified that, after receiving approximately 100 letters from defendant over the course of two years and after talking with him on the telephone, they were acquainted with his writing and speaking styles. The trial court determined that the jury could review the letters as well as the website postings and determine for themselves whether defendant had indeed posted other messages at the Cringe.com website besides those postings which he acknowledged he did post.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 27} Between January and February 2000, approximately 80 messages were posted to the Cringe.com website that plaintiffs assert were authored by defendant. Plaintiff Stockdale testified that, at the same time the website postings began, she then began receiving unidentified telephone calls. She and plaintiff Spurgeon both testified concerning how frightened, anxious, and terrified they had felt prior to March 1999, when they signed the settlement agreement with defendant. Both plaintiffs testified that, although they both believed that their lives had been forever changed and that they would never be the same again, both of them felt hopeful that they could put the matter behind them. Plaintiffs testified that, after signing the settlement agreement, they believed that the matter was over and that they no longer had a reason to worry about defendant harassing, threatening, and terrorizing them further. However, when the website postings began in January 2000, both plaintiffs testified that all the fear, anxiety, and stress came back and that, in some ways, it was even worse. Both plaintiffs testified that they now believe that defendant does not know the limits and that he is not able to control his obsessive, hateful attitude and behavior towards them. Both plaintiffs testified that they found themselves again looking over their shoulders all of the time wondering whether defendant was there watching them. Both plaintiffs testified that, in addition to other life stresses that perhaps caused them to have difficulty sleeping, that the renewed contact with defendant caused them to be more frightened. Plaintiff Stockdale testified that she had received counseling before March 1999, but that, because of her schedule, insurance problems, and the fact that her counselor was no longer available, she was not able to continue with, increase, or renew her counseling in January 2000. Other witnesses testified that both plaintiffs had seemed to feel better after the settlement agreement had been signed in March 1999, and that they both had a sense of hope. However, the witnesses testified that, when the website postings began in January 2000, plaintiffs were noticeably upset, frightened, anxious, and nervous and that they had a sense of disbelief that defendant would actually contact them again.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 28} Plaintiff Stockdale testified that she contacted defendant\u2019s probation officer regarding the website postings. All of the insulting, derogatory, personal postings made under any and all fictitious names stopped after she contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>defendant\u2019s probation officer. Anita Bush, the supervisor for defendant\u2019s probation officer, testified that the probation department considered defendant\u2019s conduct to be a violation of the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 29} Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and asserted the following causes of action: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (2) negligence and/or negligence per se; (3) breach of contract; and (4) depression, fraud, and malice. As stated previously, the trial court had denied both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment. At the close of evidence, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the causes of action of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and depression, fraud, and malice, but permitted the jury to consider the breach-of-contract claim as well as a civil-stalking claim. The jury verdict was unanimous in favor of plaintiffs and the jury awarded plaintiffs $10,000 each on their breach-of-contract claim, and $25,000 each in punitive damages, as well as attorney fees. Thereafter, defendant filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiff Stockdale filed a pro se notice of appeal asserting that the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Inasmuch as plaintiff Stock-dale has failed to file a brief or otherwise make any arguments asserting her cross-appeal, the matter is deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 30} In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant him summary judgment as to plaintiffs\u2019 claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 31} Summary judgment, Civ.R. 56, is a procedural device designed to terminate litigation and to avoid a formal trial where there is nothing to try. It must be awarded with caution, resolving all doubts and construing evidence against the moving party, and granted only when it appears from the evidentiary material that reasonable minds can reach only an adverse conclusion as to the party opposing the motion. See <em>Norris v. Ohio Std. Oil Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 1, 24 O.O.3d 1, 433 N.E.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 32} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment may be rendered where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment may not be rendered unless it appears that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the parties against whom this motion is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 33} The moving party has a burden of showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact as to the critical issues. The opposing party has a duty to submit affidavits on the material submitted by Civ.R. 56(C) to show genuine issues for trial. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Defendant argued in his motion and argues again here that, pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as well as their deposition testimony, neither plaintiff demonstrated that she suffered emotional distress to an extent which is compensable pursuant to Ohio law. Defendant argues that plaintiffs cannot recover for their emotional distress under any cause of action, asserting that Ohio permits recovery only for severe or extreme emotional distress. Defendant cites <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 453 N.E.2d 666. In <em>Yeager, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court recognized the cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court described the nature of the serious and emotional distress required in order to recover for infliction of emotional distress in Ohio as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cOne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes serious emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.\u201d Syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 36} Defendant also cites <em>Powell v. Grant Med. Ctr., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-443, 771 N.E.2d 874, wherein this court upheld the trial court\u2019s entry granting summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress. In <em>Powell, </em>plaintiffs were children of the decedent whose body had been damaged, after her death, when a tray in the hospital morgue had broken, causing the decedent\u2019s body to fall. The decedent had fallen on her face and had sustained bruising and a laceration. Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking to recover damages for emotional distress allegedly suffered as a result of the injuries to the decedent\u2019s body arising from its fall to the floor and the hospital\u2019s handling of the incident. The trial court concluded that, although the decedent was plaintiffs\u2019 mother, plaintiffs did not come forward with evidence that their feelings rose to the level of a serious or debilitating injury and that they had presented no evidence that defendant acted intentionally or had any knowledge that the telescoping trays were malfunctioning or would collapse and cause the decedent to fall. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 37} On appeal, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. This court noted that in <em>Paugh v. Hanks </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 72, 6 OBR 114, 451 N.E.2d 759, the Ohio Supreme Court explained the standard of \u201cserious\u201d emotional distress, in a cause of action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c* * * By the term \u2018serious,\u2019 we of course go beyond trifling mental disturbance, mere upset or hurt feelings. We believe that serious emotional distress describes emotional injury which is both severe and debilitating. Thus, serious emotional distress may be found where a reasonable person, normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>constituted, would be unable to cope adequately with the mental distress engendered by the circumstances of the case. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA non-exhaustive litany of some examples of serious emotional distress should include traumatically induced neurosis, psychosis, chronic depression, or phobia. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 40} This court went on to note that expert opinion is frequently helpful in proving the genuineness of a plaintiffs claim; however, this court noted that expert medical testimony was not required and that a plaintiff could submit their own testimony as well as the testimony of lay witnesses acquainted with plaintiff as to any marked changes in the emotional or habitual makeup of plaintiff following a defendant\u2019s allegedly culpable conduct. Last, this court noted that the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the emotional distress is to be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 41} This case presented a unique, one-of-a-kind fact pattern for the trial court to consider. Upon consideration of defendant\u2019s motion, it was already apparent to the trial court that a decision would have to be made, at trial, as to whether plaintiffs would be permitted to present evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct prior to March 1999. In conjunction with that, it was clear that evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 emotional state prior to March 1999 might be relevant in a trial. Although it was unclear, at that point in time, how much emotional distress plaintiffs were going to be able to demonstrate, it was clear that plaintiffs did have evidence to submit going to all of the elements of the cause of action. Specifically, the trial court noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cIn order to defeat a motion for summary judgment on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a party must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(1) the actor either intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should have known that actions taken would result in serious emotional distress to the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(2) the actor\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(3) the actor\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs psychic injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(4) the mental anguish suffered by the plaintiff is serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">{\u00b6 47} <em>\u201cAshcroft v. Mt. Sinai Medical Center </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 359 [588 N.E.2d 280].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cDefendant contends that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Defendant\u2019s actions in posting to the Internet message board [were] extreme and outrageous, even if the content of his quotation was offensive. However, Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>tiffs\u2019 claim is not based solely on the fact that his message was offensive or vulgar; rather, it is based largely on the fact that they believed Defendant was again stalking them despite having faced criminal charges for his behavior. Plaintiffs fear that Defendant is so obsessed with them, that he would risk imprisonment in order to contact them. (Stockdale depo. p. 128.) The Court finds that whether Defendant\u2019s actions were extreme and outrageous is a question of fact. Defendant further argues that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they suffered a severe and debilitating mental injury as the result of his conduct. However, upon review of the evidence presented, the Court finds that this is also an issue to be determined by the trier of fact. Therefore, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 49} Based upon a review of the record and given the fact that this case is one of first impression, the trial court found, and this court agrees, that the evidence plaintiffs had presented, prior to the trial, was sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant. As such, this court finds that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 50} Defendant\u2019s second, third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are interrelated and will be addressed together. Defendant contends that the trial court erred by permitting plaintiffs to introduce evidence of misdemeanor criminal charges brought against defendant and his alleged conviction, by permitting the supervisor of defendant\u2019s former probation officer and a city prosecutor to testify involving the nature of the criminal case relating to defendant, and by permitting plaintiffs to read, testify to, and introduce into evidence the contents of letters written to them by defendant prior to the signing of the settlement agreement in March 1999, as well as evidence and testimony regarding defendant\u2019s actions prior to March 1999 for which plaintiffs had released defendant from liability. For the reasons that follow, these assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 51} Central to these assignments of error is the issue of whether it was permissible to permit plaintiffs to introduce any evidence regarding defendant\u2019s conduct prior to March 1999, as well as evidence concerning the emotional harm caused plaintiffs by virtue of his pre-March 1999 behavior. As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise provided. See Evid.R. 402. Pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A), \u201c[ajlthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 52} Evid.R. 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>{\u00b6 53} \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court enjoys broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and will not be reversed absent a clear abuse that materially prejudices the opposing party. <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126. In the application of the abuse-of-discretion standard, a court sitting in review may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 55} In his second and third assignments of error, defendant contends that plaintiffs should not have been permitted to introduce evidence of the misdemean- or criminal charges, which had been brought against him for menacing by stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">{\u00b6 56} Defendant asserts that Evid.R. 803(21) does not permit a misdemeanor conviction or convictions on a no-contest plea from ever being introduced into evidence. Evid.R. 803 provides exceptions to the hearsay rule and notes that the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cJudgment of previous conviction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cEvidence of a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty (but not upon a plea of no contest or the equivalent plea from another jurisdiction), adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment, but not including, when offered by the Government in a criminal prosecution for purposes other than impeachment, judgments against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">{\u00b6 59} Defendant argues that his misdemeanor conviction, a no-contest plea, was not admissible into evidence under Evid.R. 803(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">{\u00b6 60} However, Evid.R. 404(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">{\u00b6 62} Upon review of the transcript, this court notes that the trial court went to great lengths to ensure that plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>witnesses did not testify regarding defendant\u2019s actual conviction for menacing by stalking. Instead, witnesses testified that charges had been brought against defendant for menacing by stalking. Thereafter, defendant entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs whereby he promised never to have any contact with them again and they promised not to speak to anyone about the circumstances which led up to defendant being charged with menacing by stalking. Further, testimony was elicited that defendant had been placed on probation and that defendant\u2019s probation officer had considered his conduct in making the postings to the website to be a violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 63} Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, this evidence was relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 case, and the trial court did not err in admitting this evidence. Part of plaintiffs\u2019 argument, demonstrating their serious emotional distress, was that the threat of possible prison time was insufficient to restrain defendant from engaging in stalking behavior again. Obviously, any evidence that plaintiffs presented regarding anything that happened prior to March 1999 was going to be prejudicial to defendant to a certain extent. However, the trial court concluded, and this court agrees, that a certain amount of pre-1999 evidence was necessarily admissible in plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 64} The admissibility of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and only the clearest abuse of discretion will result in a reversal of a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159, 17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490. Reversal under this standard requires a showing that the trial court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Nothing in this record indicates that the trial court\u2019s decision in permitting evidence concerning the charges brought against defendant and the fact that he had been placed on probation, constituted an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 65} With regard to the prosecutor who testified, defendant argued at trial that he should not be permitted to testify because his testimony would inflame the jury and because he was not provided the witness list. Loc.R. 43.04 of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cAny witnesses not disclosed in compliance with this rule may not be called to testify at trial, unless the Trial Judge orders otherwise for good cause and subject to such conditions as justice requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 67} Counsel argued that the prosecutor was not on the witness list. In response, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel noted that the city prosecutor who had served on defendant\u2019s criminal case was no longer with the office and that a different prosecutor was being called to testify. The court permitted the prosecutor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>testify provided that his testimony was confined to those things of which he had knowledge and that the testimony was permissible, as the court had previously determined that plaintiffs could establish the fact that criminal charges had been filed against defendant and that defendant had been placed on probation. Because the witness list did include the name of the prosecuting attorney who had actually prosecuted the criminal case against defendant, this court finds that there was no prejudice against defendant and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting his testimony, as it did not violate the nature of Loe.R. 43.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 68} Defendant also contends that Anita Bush, the supervisor of defendant\u2019s probation officer, should not have been permitted to testify. Again, because the trial judge indicated that plaintiffs would be permitted to establish the fact that criminal charges of stalking had been filed against defendant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting her to testify. Bush did nothing more than testify based upon the records that she had in her possession, which were kept in the ordinary course of business. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting this evidence, and defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 69} In his fourth and fifth assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in permitting plaintiffs to present evidence of his actions prior to March 1999. Specifically, plaintiffs were permitted to read from and introduce into evidence 12 of the letters that defendant had sent to plaintiffs during the two-year period prior to the signing of the settlement agreement in March 1999. Plaintiffs testified that defendant had sent them over 100 letters during this time. There were two reasons why plaintiffs presented this testimony: (1) so that the jury could understand how the website postings made by defendant in January and February 2000 could have caused them serious emotional distress; and (2) so that the jury could see for itself defendant\u2019s writing style and determine whether defendant was responsible for more than the 26 website postings which defendant admitted that he had made. Defendant points to the fact that plaintiffs had released defendant from any claims which they had or may have against defendant arising out of any conduct of defendant prior to March 1999, the day of the agreement. Defendant contends that it was obvious that plaintiffs were attempting to be compensated for pre-March 1999 behavior and that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to permit this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 70} The trial court determined that the evidence was relevant and, as Evid.R. 401 provides, relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise prohibited. Although defendant contends that his conduct prior to March 1999 is completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>irrelevant, the trial court disagreed, and this court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">{\u00b6 71} Viewing the website postings made by defendant in isolation, without considering defendant\u2019s prior conduct, these website postings would be described as opinionated, rude, too personal, and angry, and that they took on an increasingly aggressive and negative attitude. Without knowing that defendant had spent two years stalking and harassing plaintiffs, it would be impossible to understand why plaintiffs were asserting claims for emotional distress. However, when one realized that defendant had engaged in a pattern of conduct for two years harassing and stalking these women, sending them obscene, pornographic, violent letters, making numerous telephone calls to them, and showing up at their homes, then one could begin to see how any renewed conduct by defendant would cause plaintiffs emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 72} The bottom line is that defendant\u2019s prior conduct was relevant to the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 case and, even though the presentation of that evidence was prejudicial to defendant, its probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to defendant. As plaintiffs testified, prior to signing the agreement with defendant in March 1999, they were fearful, felt threatened, were terrified, took measures to ensure that they were never alone, left lights on, were always looking over their shoulders, had difficulty sleeping, sought counseling, and they were anxious all of the time. In March 1999, when they signed the settlement agreement with defendant, both plaintiffs testified that they believed the matter was over and done with and that defendant would never bother them again. Ten months later, defendant made postings on the website, which were seen by plaintiff Stockdale and which, as she testified, terrified her all over again. Both plaintiffs testified that, in January and February 2000, all the feelings that they had before the settlement agreement was signed came back to them. They testified further, however, that the feelings were actually worse because, in March 1999, plaintiffs actually had hope that the matter was settled. Now both plaintiffs realized that defendant did not know the limits of the law and that he was not able to control his obsessiveness with them. The trial court did not err and did not abuse its discretion in permitting plaintiffs to present these letters and to testify as to the contents of them, and defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 73} In his fifth assignment of error, defendant objects to the fact that plaintiffs were permitted to testify to and to admit into evidence copies of the website postings found at Cringe.com. Defendant argues that he admitted only to making 26 of the more than 80 postings to this website, those postings made under the name \u201cDon Pijote.\u201d Over counsel\u2019s objections, plaintiffs were permitted to present copies of website postings made under other fictitious names, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>which plaintiffs believed had actually been made by defendant. Plaintiffs testified that, in the two-year period that defendant had been harassing and stalking them, plaintiffs had become quite familiar with defendant\u2019s writing and speech styles. Both plaintiffs testified that, based upon the way defendant wrote and spoke, they believed that he had made more than the 26 website postings that he admitted to making. Furthermore, plaintiff Stockdale testified that, after she contacted defendant\u2019s probation officer regarding the website postings, all of the website postings under all of the fictitious names ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 74} The trial court reviewed the matter and determined that it would permit plaintiffs to present a limited number of the website postings under names other than \u201cDon Pijote\u201d and that the jury could determine for itself whether defendant had made those postings.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 75} Again, this court finds that the evidence was relevant and that, although the evidence was prejudicial to defendant, its probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant. Furthermore, defendant argues that postings made to a public website are directed to the public at large and they cannot constitute \u201ccontact\u201d under the terms of the settlement agreement. Both the trial court and this court disagree. Defendant first gained access to plaintiffs through the Cringe.com website. Defendant knew that plaintiffs were musicians and that they were members of the local area bands. Furthermore, defendant specifically knew that plaintiff Stockdale visited the website. Defendant posted messages in a place where he knew, or had reason to know, that plaintiff Stockdale would see them. Defendant\u2019s actions constituted contact as described by the agreement. As such, defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 76} In his sixth and seventh assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred by permitting plaintiffs to introduce into evidence the website postings made to Cringe.com. Defendant alleges that it was wrong to admit them when the full foundation for their relevancy was plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that they believed that defendant wrote the postings and that the trial court permitted improper opinion by lay witnesses that the message board postings under several different names were all actually made by defendant. For the reasons that follow, this court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 77} Evid.R. 701 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>{\u00b6 79} In <em>State v.

In <em>Crane v. Lakewood Hosp. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 129, 658 N.E.2d 1088, the Eighth District Court of Appeals described the types of cases in which lay witnesses can properly testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c[I]t has long been recognized that a lay witness can testify to how fast a car was going, how big an article was, and similar observations based on common experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c \u2018Where the testimony is based on recited personal observations, a non-expert can express opinions about another\u2019s insanity, <em>Weis v.

The trial court disagreed and so does this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 85} Plaintiffs initially received over 100 letters from defendant. Plaintiff Stockdale spoke to defendant on the telephone numerous times. Both plaintiffs testified that defendant had a unique style of writing and speaking. They noted his Victorian choice of words and his tendency to hyphenate words that would otherwise not be hyphenated. Furthermore, they testified about the nature of his writing. Both plaintiffs testified that the tenor of defendant\u2019s letters often changed so that he would almost be friendly at some times and then be hostile and violent at other times. They testified that they believed that defendant was responsible for more than 80 website postings made to Cringe.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">{\u00b6 86} This court finds that the requirements of Evid.R. 701 were met and that their opinions were rationally based on their perception and that their opinions were helpful to a clear understanding of their testimony and the determination of facts at issue. As such, defendant\u2019s sixth and seventh assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>{\u00b6 87} Defendant\u2019s eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are interrelated and will be addressed together. Defendant argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could award damages for plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress on their breach-of-contract claim. Defendant contends that, having granted defendant\u2019s request for directed verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim, the trial court had concluded that plaintiffs did not present evidence of severe or debilitating emotional distress and could not recover under their breach-of-contract claim cause of action. Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could award damages for plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress in the absence of expert testimony relating to their emotional distress. Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that, as a matter of law, the settlement agreement was a contract that the parties understood the breach of which was likely to result in psychological damage. For the reasons that follow, this court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 88} The purpose of the jury charge is \u201cto state clearly and concisely the principles of law necessary to enable the jury to accomplish the purpose desired.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Astorhurst Land Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 268, 272, 18 OBR 322, 480 N.E.2d 794. The jury charge must be considered as a whole and a reviewing court must determine whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. West </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 208, 560 N.E.2d 165. The decision to include or exclude a particular instruction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Cabe v. Lunich </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 598, 602, 640 N.E.2d 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 89} The trial court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cThe Plaintiffs claim that the Defendant breached or broke the contract. A contract is breached when one party, without just cause, fails or refuses to perform his agreement even though the other party performed as they were required to under the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cIn general, words in a contract are given their plain and ordinary meaning according to our common usage in daily life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cIf you find by the greater weight of the evidence that the contract existed between the Plaintiffs and Defendant, and that the Defendant broke it or breached it, then you must decide whether this caused Plaintiffs to suffer any damage and if so, in what amount. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 93} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cNow, generally, the term losses does not include mental suffering. We\u2019re talking about the contract. There is an exception to this rule where the mental suffering was caused by the intentional or reckless breach of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>to render services of such a character, or to perform or act in such a way that the Defendant had reason to know that the breach might cause psychological damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cThe general rule for measuring damages is that the party whose contract has been breached without their fault is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for the loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cNow, if you find that the Defendant breached or broke the contract you will decide what amount of money will fairly and reasonably compensate Plaintiffs for, either one of them individually, for their actual loss resulting from the breach of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cPlaintiffs have the right to be placed in the position in which they would have been if the contract had been fully performed. You will decide by the greater weight of the evidence what losses Plaintiffs have suffered by the Defendant\u2019s violation of the terms of the contract and injuries to Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cNow, these losses or damages may include loss of earnings, the effect the Defendant\u2019s actions had on the mental or psyche well-being of Plaintiffs, and their ability or inability to maintain their former quality of life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 99} The crux of defendant\u2019s argument is that, since the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress on the basis that plaintiffs did not present evidence that was sufficient to support a finding of serious emotional distress as it relates to that particular cause of action, the trial court essentially determined that plaintiffs had likewise failed to present sufficient evidence that they suffered \u201cserious emotional disturbance\u201d for purposes of maintaining their action for damages as a result of defendant\u2019s breach of contract. In essence, defendant argues that both causes of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress and the damages claim for serious emotional disturbance arising from a breach of contract, are identical in terms of the proof necessary to demonstrate the requisite injury. On the other hand, plaintiffs argue that the two causes of action are not identical and that the contract itself was one that it was understood by the parties that a breach would cause serious emotional disturbance to the aggrieved party or parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 100} In <em>Kishmarton v. William Bailey Constr., Inc. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 226, 754 N.E.2d 785, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether emotional-distress damages could be recovered in a breach-of-contract action where there was no contemporaneous physical injury. In answering that question in the affirmative, the court adopted the Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981) 149, Section 353, Comment <em>a, </em>which permits recovery in breach-of-contract cases for emotional distress without bodily injury under certain circumstances. The Restatement and the comment thereto provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>{\u00b6 101} \u201cLoss Due to Emotional Disturbance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cRecovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cComment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 104} <em>\u201ca. Emotional disturbance. </em>Damages for emotional disturbance are not ordinarily allowed. Even if they are foreseeable, they are often particularly difficult to establish and to measure. There are, however, two exceptional situations where such damages are recoverable. * * * In the second exceptional situation, the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result. Common examples are contracts of carriers and innkeepers with passengers and guests, contracts for the carriage or proper disposition of dead bodies, and contracts for the delivery of messages concerning death. Breach of such a contract is particularly likely to cause serious emotional disturbance. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 105} Pursuant to the Reinstatement, recovery for emotional disturbance may be permitted where the contract or the breach of the contract is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result. Upon review of the settlement agreement- in this particular case, the trial court found, and this court agrees, that the nature of the contract itself is such that it is apparent that the parties were aware that any breach of the contract would have likely resulted in serious emotional disturbance. This particular contract is intensely personal in nature. The reason for the contract was to prevent any further emotional harm from occurring to plaintiffs and to keep plaintiffs from embarrassing or otherwise humiliating defendant by discussing the nature of his conduct and the nature of the agreement with people who were not a party to the contract. At the time that the contract was entered into, it was already apparent that defendant had caused emotional harm to plaintiffs and, although, by way of signing the agreement, plaintiffs released defendant from any liability for the emotional harm that had already occurred to them, it was apparent that any further contact from defendant would be likely to cause additional emotional harm to these plaintiffs. Most contracts are not this personal in nature; however, this court finds that the nature of this particular contract is such that the parties were aware that any breach of the contract was likely to result in serious emotional disturbance to the parties. This is implied both in the nature of the contract as well as the nature of defendant\u2019s violation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 106} Part of defendant\u2019s argument seems to be that he contends that this court previously said that the emotional distress necessary to maintain a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is the same as the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>action for emotional distress arising out of the breach-of-contract claim. See <em>Powell, </em>supra. However, defendant\u2019s characterization of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Powell </em>is mistaken. As stated previously, the <em>Powell </em>case involved the mishandling of plaintiffs\u2019 mother\u2019s body after the mother had died. The decedent\u2019s body had fallen when a tray in the morgue malfunctioned and the decedent\u2019s face was bruised and she sustained a laceration. In granting summary judgment in favor of the hospital, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had not shown that their feelings rose to a level of a serious or debilitating injury to satisfy the requirement' for the cause of action of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Upon reviewing the record, this court agreed and specifically noted that the alleged cause of plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress was inexplicably related to the decedent\u2019s death and that, in that particular case, expert testimony was necessary to establish a substantial cause of the relationship between the postmortem injuries to the decedent\u2019s body, as distinguished from the actual death of decedent, and the serious emotional distress purportedly suffered by plaintiffs. Furthermore, this court noted that plaintiffs did not present lay witnesses to testify that the injuries to the decedent visibly upset plaintiffs and impacted their grieving process, and there was no testimony from witnesses claiming that plaintiffs showed marked emotional changes in their behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 107} With regard to the breach-of-contract issue, the trial court found that-there was no evidence that plaintiffs had paid consideration for any promise by the hospital to take care of the decedent and that the evidence showed that the hospital was performing its obligations to care for the decedent when the unfortunate accident occurred. Therefore, the trial court granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 breach-of-contract claim. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that a contract had been established with the hospital because the hospital had promised to look after and care for decedent until the funeral home arrived to pick up the corpse. This court noted that, other than an allegation that a representative from the hospital informed plaintiffs that arrangements would be made with the funeral home to pick up their deceased mother, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for breach of contract did not set forth specific terms of an agreement and did not allege that the hospital had received viable consideration as part of the agreement. Furthermore, this court noted that, even if plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence of a contract and the hospital\u2019s breach of that contract, plaintiffs could not sustain their breach-of-contract claim because, as noted, plaintiffs failed to establish that they suffered serious emotional distress as a result of the hospital\u2019s handling of the decedent\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 108} Defendant uses this portion of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Powell </em>as an absolute statement of law that plaintiffs must show exactly the same level of emotional harm to recover under theories of intentional infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>distress and serious emotional disturbance as a result of a breach of the contract. The statements made by this court were dicta and did not stand for a pronouncement of the state of the law. Instead, turning back to the Restatement, and looking at the facts of this particular case, including the nature of the contract, this court finds that it was implied that a breach of this particular contract would result in serious emotional disturbance to the aggrieved party or parties. In the present case, this court finds that there was evidence that was sufficient, not only to send the issue to the jury but also to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Plaintiffs testified that they became very emotionally distraught when the website messages appeared, and that all of the fear and anxieties that they felt prior to the signing of the settlement agreement in March 1999 returned. As such, plaintiffs testified that they had difficulty sleeping, felt that they were under a great amount of stress, feared for their lives, felt intimidated and scared, were terrified, were concerned that defendant was out there watching them, remembered defendant\u2019s comment in a letter that he would never let this issue with them die, and felt as if defendant would never be able to control his obsessive behavior where they were concerned. Plaintiff Stockdale testified that she wanted to go back to counseling but that the counselor she had used previously was no longer available. Due to the complexities of life, plaintiff Stockdale did not attempt to begin a relationship with a new counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">{\u00b6 109} In part, defendant appears to be arguing that, since plaintiff Stockdale called defendant\u2019s probation officer within two months of his contacting them through the website postings, there is no way that plaintiffs could have suffered any serious emotional disturbance. This court disagrees. There was evidence that plaintiffs felt exactly the same way they felt before signing the settlement agreement of March 1999 but that, in some ways, their fears were worse now because, in 1999, they had hope that the matter would end. The fact that plaintiffs did not permit defendant\u2019s renewed contact with them to continue for an extended period of time so that they would have greater emotional harm is not, and should not be, a determining factor on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 110} Because serious emotional disturbance is implied by the very personal nature of this contract\u2019s specific terms, and because serious emotional disturbance is implied in the very nature of defendant\u2019s breach of this contract, and because plaintiffs did present evidence that their emotional harm as a result of defendant\u2019s renewed contact with them was the same as it had been in March 1999, this court finds that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to go to a jury and that the trial court correctly instructed the jury. Therefore, defendant\u2019s eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>{\u00b6 111} In his eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth assignments of error, defendant challenges various other jury instructions given by the court. Specifically, the eleventh, fourteenth, and fifteenth assignments of error address the issue of punitive damages and cover issues such as whether punitive damages must be specifically pleaded or claimed in order to be awarded, whether R.C. 2307.60 precludes the recovery of punitive damages, and whether punitive damages could be recovered in a breach-of-contract case. In the twelfth assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant was required to take plaintiffs as he found them even though plaintiffs\u2019 alleged predisposition to emotional distress had been the subject of the prior settlement. In his thirteenth assignment of error, defendant contends that the court erred by instructing the jury that it could award plaintiffs damages for a common-law tort action of \u201cstalking\u201d even though plaintiffs did not plead such a tort in their complaint. For the reasons that follow, this court overrules these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 112} In his eleventh assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court should not have instructed the jury regarding punitive damages because plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had not included a request for such damages. Without addressing whether plaintiffs were required to include such a request for such damages in their complaint, a review of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint indicates that plaintiffs did, in fact, seek an award for punitive damages. Paragraph 18 of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 113} \u201c18. In committing the acts described in this complaint, defendant was guilty of oppression, fraud, and malice. As a result, plaintiff is entitled to an award of exemplary or punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 114} Defendant cites <em>DeCastro v. Wellston City School Dish Bd. of Edn. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 197, 761 N.E.2d 612, for the proposition that punitive damages are not recoverable in an action for breach of contract absent extraordinary circumstances and then asserts that plaintiffs failed to plead or prove any extraordinary circumstances in this case. This court disagrees. Not only did plaintiffs\u2019 complaint include a request for punitive damages, but plaintiffs did plead and submit evidence of extraordinary circumstances. The actions of defendant prior to the signing of the settlement agreement in March 1999, and his subsequent actions in January and February 2000, were certainly extraordinary and well beyond the scope of what one would define as ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 115} Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could award plaintiffs damages for a common-law tort action of \u201cstalking\u201d even though plaintiffs had failed to plead that tort in the complaint. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 116} In Ohio, punitive damages are not recoverable for the breach of a contract unless the conduct constituting the breach is also a tort for which punitive damages are recoverable. See <em>DeCastro, </em>supra. However, plaintiffs are not required to plead the related but independent tort. In <em>Goldfarb v. The Robb Report, Inc. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 134, 655 N.E.2d 211, this court stated, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cDefendant is correct that as a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable in an action for breach of contract. <em>Digital &amp; Analog Design Corp. v. N. Supply Co. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 36, 45-46, 540 N.E.2d 1358. However, an exception exists where the breach of contract is accompanied by a connected, but independent tort involving fraud, malice or oppression. <em>Saberton v. Greenwald </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 414 [32 O.O. 454, 66 N.E.2d 224]; <em>Carrera v. Sandman </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 422, 426, 584 N.E.2d 753; <em>R &amp; H Trucking Inc. v. Occidental Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 269, 2 OBR 298, 441 N.E.2d 816; Annotation, Punitive Damages for Breach of Contract (1933), 84 A.L.R. 1345. While the cases do not specifically address the issue, they suggest that in such a case the independent tort need not be pleaded or the jury be instructed as to the tort. See <em>Garrett v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Mo.App.1974), 520 S.W.2d 102; <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Kelly </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 343, 352, 623 N.E.2d 1303; <em>R &amp; H Trucking, </em>supra; <em>Grybauskas v. Associated Estates Corp. </em>(1976), 51 Ohio App.2d 231, 236, 5 O.O.3d 363, 367 N.E.2d 881. However, in order for the issue of punitive damages to properly be submitted to the jury, the party seeking punitive damages must present not only evidence of a breach of contract, but also evidence of conduct constituting a connected, but independent tort, together with evidence of fraud, malice or oppression. See <em>Garrett; Arthur Young; R &amp; H Trucking; Grybauskas, </em>supra. As a result, whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury on punitive damages in the present case turns on whether the record contains evidence that defendant (1) breached its contract with plaintiff; (2) committed a connected tort independently of the breach of contract; and, in so doing, (3) acted fraudulently, maliciously or oppressively toward plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 118} In the present case, plaintiffs presented evidence that defendant breached the settlement agreement by posting messages on the website. Although defendant admitted only to making the posting under one name, the trial court permitted plaintiffs to submit evidence of other postings which they believed were attributable to defendant as well. Further, the record showed that all of the postings, under various fictitious names, stopped after plaintiffs contacted defendant\u2019s probation officer. Second, the trial court determined that defendant\u2019s conduct in breaching the contract also constituted the common-law tort of stalking. Third, evidence was presented and the jury could have found that defendant\u2019s action in contacting plaintiffs again, after the settlement agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ment was agreed to, constituted a malicious act demonstrating defendant\u2019s ill will and hatred towards plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">{\u00b6 119} Furthermore, defendant also argues that punitive damages cannot be awarded based on \u201cinsult.\u201d With regard to punitive damages, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cNow, if you find for the Plaintiffs and award damages, nominal or actual, you may also consider whether you will separately award punitive damages. If you do not find actual or nominal damages, you cannot consider punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cPunitive damages may be awarded against the Defendant as a punishment to discourage others from committing similar wrongful acts. You are not required to award punitive damages to the Plaintiffs or Plaintiff, and you may not do so unless you find by the greater weight of the evidence that the Defendant acted with intent to insult or with actual malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 122} \u201cInsult means any act or remark that is consciously, deliberately or intentionally scornful or humiliating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cAnd malice is a state of mind characterized by hatred, ill will, or in a spirit of revenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cNow, if you award punitive damages, the amount should be fair and reasonable under all of the facts and circumstances. It should not be excessive nor influenced by passion, sympathy, or prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 125} First, as stated previously, punitive damages may be awarded in an action for breach of contract if there are extraordinary circumstances. <em>DeCastro, </em>supra. The circumstances involved in the present case were extraordinary. Second, punitive damages may be awarded where the breach of contract is accompanied by a connected, but independent, tort involving malice. A review of the record demonstrates that plaintiffs submitted evidence of malice on the part of defendant. This is not a situation where the defendant\u2019s behavior could be characterized as causing simply humiliation or mere insult. See <em>Yeager, </em>supra. Viewing the jury instructions as a whole, this court finds that the inclusion of this instruction did not mislead this jury in a matter materially affecting defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">{\u00b6 126} Defendant also argues that R.C. 2307.60 specifically precludes an award of punitive damages in the present case. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">{\u00b6 127} R.C. 2307.60 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cAnyone injured in person * * * by a criminal act has, and may recover full damages in, a civil action unless specifically excepted by law, may recover the costs of maintaining the civil action and attorney\u2019s fees if authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>by any provision of the Rules of Civil Procedure or another section of the Revised Code or under the common law of this state, and may recover punitive or exemplary damages if authorized by section 2315.21 or another section of the Revised Code. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 129} The plain language of R.C. 2307.60 makes it clear that punitive damages can be recovered if a person is injured by the criminal acts of another. However, the record of conviction, unless obtained by confession, is not to be used as evidence in the civil action. R.C. 2307.60 is merely a compilation of the common law in Ohio that a civil action is not merged in a criminal prosecution which arose from the same act or acts. Under the facts herein, R.C. 2307.60 neither precludes nor specifically authorizes an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 130} In the present case, the trial court concluded that there had been stalking. Menacing by stalking is a criminal offense. The trial court acknowledged that there were no jury instructions relating to stalking as a tort action; however, the trial court determined that, based upon the facts of the present case, there was an actionable cause of action based upon the stalking. Again, defendant continues to argue that his actions prior to the signing of the settlement agreement were and are completely irrelevant; however, the trial court disagreed. While plaintiffs were not entitled to recover for their emotional distress that occurred prior to the signing of the settlement agreement, nothing precluded them from maintaining an action against defendant when he resumed contact with them. Defendant continues to argue that the website posting did not actually constitute \u201ccontact\u201d and, as such, there was no breach of contract; however, the facts of this particular case support the trial court\u2019s findings and instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 131} Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant took plaintiffs where he found them. Defendant again argues that he is being punished for his actions that occurred prior the signing of the settlement agreement. Defendant\u2019s argument ignores the fact that he had every reason to know that these plaintiffs were particularly fragile emotionally and, as stated previously, any intentional contact with them would cause further emotional harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 132} The entire premise of defendant\u2019s argument hinges on his theory that plaintiffs\u2019 weakened condition resulted from defendant\u2019s conduct prior to the signing of the settlement agreement and that the settlement agreement precludes plaintiffs from recovering for any damages caused by defendant\u2019s conduct prior to the signing of that agreement. While defendant is correct that plaintiffs could not recover for damages caused by defendant\u2019s conduct prior to the signing of the settlement agreement, defendant is incorrect in arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant took plaintiffs where he found them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Defendant\u2019s conduct, in breach of the contract, caused these plaintiffs, whom he had reason to know would be susceptible to further emotional distress if he contacted them, to suffer additional emotional distress. The settlement agreement is not a shield behind which defendant may hide and escape liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 133} For all of the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 134} In his sixteenth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict as to plaintiff Spurgeon. The entire basis for defendant\u2019s argument is that he had no reason to know that plaintiff Spurgeon would access the website and defendant points to page 374 of the transcript where plaintiff Spurgeon testified that she had never had contact with defendant. For the reasons that follow, this court overrules defendant\u2019s sixteenth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 135} A motion for a directed verdict must be denied if there is substantial, competent evidence supporting the position of the parties opposing the motion so that reasonable minds might reach different conclusions based upon the evidence. <em>Apel v. Katz </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 11, 697 N.E.2d 600. This court finds that the record contained the requisite evidence to support the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for a directed verdict as to plaintiff Spurgeon as well as the jury\u2019s verdict in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 136} In turning to page 374 of the transcript, plaintiff Spurgeon was being questioned concerning a letter defendant had sent her wherein he indicated that he had sent plaintiff Stockdale a letter that he asked plaintiff Stockdale to forward on to plaintiff Spurgeon. In that letter, defendant provided information to plaintiff Spurgeon as to what time of day she could best reach him by telephone. Plaintiff Spurgeon then testified that she did not have defendant\u2019s phone number and that she had never contacted defendant. The testimony at page 374 indicates only that plaintiff Spurgeon never had telephone contact with defendant and does not support defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff Spurgeon testified that she never had any contact with defendant whatsoever. In fact, plaintiff Spurgeon specifically testified that she personally had seen the postings made by defendant and that those postings had a harmful, negative impact on her. Furthermore, the record indicates that it was through this website that defendant originally gained access to plaintiffs. Furthermore, he knew that plaintiffs were members of bands and that the various bands posted information on this website. Based upon the evidence, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to plaintiff Spurgeon, and defendant\u2019s sixteenth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>{\u00b6 137} In his seventeenth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to plaintiffs without conducting an eviden-tiary hearing as to the reasonableness and amount of such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 138} On February 15, 2002, the trial court held a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney fees to determine their reasonableness. The trial court accepted the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and concluded that, as an attorney, she was an expert to testify on the reasonableness of her fees. Furthermore, counsel for defendant did not object to an hourly rate of $150. Counsel did object that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not present an itemized list detailing the amount of time that she spent working on plaintiffs case. Counsel for defendant was permitted, in essence, to testify herself. The trial court considered the testimony of the two attorneys and determined that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was indeed asking for an excessive amount of attorney fees. As such, the trial court awarded what it determined to be a reasonable amount and awarded $35,000. Defendant has not shown that the trial court\u2019s award is excessive or that it constitutes an abuse of discretion. A trial court has broad discretion to determine the appropriate amount of an award of attorney fees and, absent an abuse of discretion, such an award should not be reversed. <em>Atwood Resources, Inc. v. Lehigh </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 293, 648 N.E.2d 548. Defendant has not shown an abuse of discretion here. Defendant\u2019s seventeenth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 139} Based on the foregoing, defendant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-8\">Lazarus and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
