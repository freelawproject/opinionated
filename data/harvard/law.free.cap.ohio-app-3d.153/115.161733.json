Appellees are Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc., the estate of John Mercer, and John David Mercer.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">{\u00b6 2} On February 23, 2001, appellants filed a civil suit for compensatory and punitive damages, raising claims of negligence or intentional misconduct, trespass, negligence/intentional infliction of emotional distress, and absolute/qualified nuisance. The complaint named the appellees and two others as defendants. The complaint arose from defendants\u2019 alleged dumping of hazardous waste on a nearby property, known as the Mercer Farm, and the resulting cleanup project. On February 26, 2001, appellants filed a first amended class action complaint seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, based on the same tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">{\u00b6 3} Subsequently, on March 4, 2002, appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss appellants\u2019 claims for stigma damages, alleging a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In the motion, appellees argued that stigma damages, defined as damages resulting from a diminution in the value of one\u2019s real property because of a public perception that the property may be contaminated with a dangerous or toxic substance, are not recoverable in the absence of physical damage to a plaintiffs property. On April 23, 2002, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion. On June 14, 2002, the trial court amended its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>judgment entry to correct a clerical error in the April 23, 2002 judgment entry and to add Civ.R. 54(B) language.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b64} It is from the June 14, 2002, judgment entry that appellants appeal, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred by dismissing on the pleadings plaintiffs\u2019 damages claim based on the change in fair market value of their property directly resulting from defendants\u2019 extensive dumping of hazardous and toxic waste, which is alleged to constitute a tort of nuisance, negligence, and/or intentional misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA. Plaintiffs are not required to show any physical invasion of their property to recover damages on nuisance claims, as distinct from trespass claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cB. Unreasonable noises, odors, and other forms of blight are grounds for nuisance claims based on interference with use or enjoyment of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cC. Nuisance claims can be premised on negligent or intentional misconduct that interferes with plaintiffs\u2019 use or enjoyment of their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cD. Reduction in fair market value of plaintiffs\u2019 property resulting directly from interference with use or enjoyment of their property is a standard measure of damages for nuisance claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cE. Defendants\u2019 portrayal of this case as involving mere \u2018stigma\u2019 ignores the real and immediate economic harm from their misconduct, which has interfered with the use or enjoyment of plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">{\u00b6 11} In their sole assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred when it dismissed appellants\u2019 claim for damages, which was based upon the change in fair market value of their property as a result of the dumping of hazardous and toxic waste on nearby property.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court dismissed the first count of appellants\u2019 amended complaint, pursuant to appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Appellants alleged the following in count one of the first amended complaint: \u201cAs a direct and proximate result of the defendants\u2019 negligent and/or intentional misconduct in supplying, transporting, handling and dumping of hazardous waste at the Mercer Toxic Waste Dump, as well as their concealment of same, the defendants have caused a diminution in the value of Plaintiffs\u2019 property, as well as incidental and consequential damages, the amount of which have not yet been determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">{\u00b6 13} In dismissing appellants\u2019 first count, the trial court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe defendants claim that there is no viable claim recognized in Ohio for stigma damages since no physical damage to the plaintiffs properties has occurred. This Court finds that under Ohio law, stigma damages cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>recovered unless there is actual, physical damage to a plaintiffs property. See, <em>Chance v. BP Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 17, 670 N.E.2d 985.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 15} Our standard of review on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is de novo. <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 229, 551 N.E.2d 981. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605 N.E.2d 378. The court will look only to the complaint to determine whether the allegations are legally sufficient to state a claim. Id. In order for the trial court to dismiss a complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), the court must find beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support his claim for relief. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753. Under a de novo analysis, we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Byrd v. Faber </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 60, 565 N.E.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 16} We find that the Ohio Supreme Court case of <em>Chance v. BP Chemicals, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 17, 670 N.E.2d 985, is dispositive. In <em>Chance, </em>plaintiffs filed a suit on behalf of citizens of the city of Lima, Ohio, who owned an interest in property near BP Chemical\u2019s 200-acre chemical refinery in Lima, Ohio. Plaintiffs claimed that hazardous liquid waste from BP\u2019s \u201cdeepwell\u201d disposal process migrated below their property. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and general and punitive damages based upon theories of trespass, nuisance, negligence, strict liability, and fraudulent concealment. The trial court bifurcated the litigation into separate liability and damage phases. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court issued a directed verdict to' BP on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for fraud, nuisance, and ultrahazardous activity. The jury returned a verdict in favor of BP on plaintiffs\u2019 trespass claim. The case was appealed and affirmed by the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 17} Upon reaching the Ohio Supreme Court, the court affirmed the directed verdict regarding the issues of nuisance, fraud, and ultrahazardous activity. The court noted that \u201cappellants had no evidence of specific problems at appellee\u2019s site other than speculative opinion testimony that problems may arise in the future.\u201d Thus, the court agreed that there was no evidence of nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 18} The court then addressed the appellants\u2019 trespass claim, finding that trespass required a showing of physical damages or interference with use.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">{\u00b6 19} The court went further, however, and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the plaintiffs the opportunity to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>evidence of speculative stigma damages. Specifically, plaintiffs sought to present evidence that environmental stigma associated with deepwells had a negative effect on plaintiffs\u2019 property values due to the public perception that there may have been hazardous liquid waste under plaintiffs\u2019 properties and that the hazardous liquid waste may be dangerous. The court held that in proving damages, the trial court was correct in requiring plaintiffs to prove some physical damage or interference with use proximately caused by the deepwells as part of their trespass case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 20} <em>Chance </em>foreclosed a showing of damages based upon the decrease in a property\u2019s fair market value caused solely by environmental stigma. That is exactly what appellants sought in count one of their complaint. Appellants alleged a diminution of their property\u2019s value due to dumping of toxic waste on a nearby property by defendants without alleging any actual damage or harm to their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 21} Appellants ask this court to limit <em>Chance </em>to cases involving trespass. Appellants concede that actual, physical damage is an element of trespass that a plaintiff would be required to show. Appellants argue that because appellants brought a claim of nuisance, for which physical damage is not an element, <em>Chance </em>would be inapplicable. We disagree. We find that a reading of <em>Chance </em>demonstrates that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding was not limited to trespass claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, we find <em>Chance </em>went further and held that pure environmental stigma, defined as when the value of real property decreases due solely to public perception or fear of contamination from a neighboring property, does not constitute compensable damages in Ohio. Rather, a plaintiff must show actual harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Further, appellants point this court to our decision in <em>DeSario v. Industrial Excess Landfill, Inc. </em>(1991), 68 Ohio App.3d 117, 587 N.E.2d 454, and its progeny. In <em>DeSa\u00f1o, </em>the actual issue before the court was certification of a class. However, in considering the certification of the class, this court implicitly approved of the underlying claims of diminished property values due to the operation and use of a landfill in which toxic waste was deposited. In any event, we find that any precedential value of <em>DeSario </em>was superceded by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Chance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, this court finds that stigma damages are not available in the state of Ohio. Appellants also attempt to raise issues regarding their nuisance claim. In count four of appellants\u2019 complaint, appellants allege a nuisance based in part on noxious fumes, odors, and irritants as well as excessive and irritating noise. However, the trial court did not dismiss nor rule on appellants\u2019 nuisance claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We want to make it clear that should appellants show damage or interference such as to establish a claim of nuisance, the resulting damage may not necessarily be defined as mere stigma damages, because stigma damages are defined as a drop in property value based solely upon fear and public perception alone. Should appellants ultimately prove a claim of nuisance, appellants would be entitled to damages resulting from the nuisance itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 24} Appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 25} The judgment of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-9\">Farmer, P.J., and Boggins, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">. <em>Chance v. BP Chemicals, Inc. </em>(Mar. 30, 1995), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 66622, 66645, and 67369, 1995 WL 143827.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. {\u00b6 a} Specifically, the <em>Chance </em>court held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 b} \"[W]e find that some type of physical damages or interference with use must have been demonstrated for appellants to recover for a trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 c} <em>\"Additionally, </em>appellants in essence argue that even if the trial court was correct in requiring them to prove \"actual\u201d damages as an element of their trespass claim, the trial court erred by unduly restricting what type of damages they were required to demonstrate. For example, appellants argue that the trial court should have allowed appellants to present evidence that environmental stigma associated with the deepwells had a negative effect on appellants' property values due to the public perception that there may have been injectate under appellants' properties and that the injectate may be dangerous. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the circumstances of this case in foreclosing appellants from presenting evidence of speculative stigma damages. Therefore, the trial court was correct in requiring appellants to prove some physical damages or interference with use proximately caused by the deepwells as part of their trespass claim in the circumstances of this case, thus placing on appellants the burden of establishing that the injectate interfered with the reasonable and foreseeable use of their properties.\u201d <em>Chance v.
