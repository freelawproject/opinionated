(\u201cmother\u201d), for return of custody. This court reverses and remands.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 2} Mother gave birth to D.R. on February 21, 2001. D.R. was born two months premature. At the time of her daughter\u2019s birth, mother was unemployed and suffering from chronic fibromyalgia. Mother lived with her two teenage daughters, and their home lacked heat and was not equipped to accommodate a premature baby. Mother had not received any prenatal care while pregnant, and she did not have a regular physician or pediatrician to monitor and treat the medical conditions caused by D.R.\u2019s premature birth. Mother was also unfamiliar with how to care for a premature baby when D.R. was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 3} On March 7, 2001, Summit County Children Services Board (\u201cCSB\u201d) filed a dependency and neglect complaint and took custody of D.R. at the hospital. The juvenile court granted CSB emergency temporary custody, and D.R. was placed with grandmother. An adjudication hearing was held, and by stipulated agreement, D.R. was found to be a dependent child under R.C. 2151.04. The allegations of neglect were dismissed. Mother\u2019s two teenage daughters were also found to be dependent, and CSB was awarded temporary custody of all three children. CSB continued D.R.\u2019s placement with grandmother, and the teenage girls were placed with their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 4} At the adjudication hearing, mother received a reunification case plan that listed the requirements she must meet in order to regain custody of D.R. Mother\u2019s case plan provided that she obtain a full-scale assessment at Portage Path Behavioral Health, obtain suitable housing and meet the needs of her children, complete a drug and alcohol assessment, attend battered women support groups, and submit to random urine screens.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">{\u00b6 5} On September 20, 2001, grandmother filed a motion seeking legal custody of D.R. CSB filed a motion for change of disposition from temporary to legal custody of D.R. to grandmother on January 17, 2002. That same day, mother filed a motion for return of custody of D.R., as well as her two teenage daughters. A custody hearing was held on July 17, 2002. Following the hearing, the juvenile court found that (1) mother had fully complied with her reunification case plan, (2) mother had remedied the problems that caused her to lose custody of D.R., and (3) the evidence presented did not establish that she was an unsuitable mother for D.R. The court denied both grandmother\u2019s and CSB\u2019s motions, granted mother\u2019s motion, and ordered the return of custody of D.R. to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Grandmother obtained a stay of this order and timely appealed, setting forth one assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cThe juvenile court\u2019s return of legal custody of the minor child [D.R.] to appellee [mother of D.R.] and denial of appellant\u2019s motion for legal custody is against the manifest weight of the evidence and is an abuse of discretion as the return of legal custody to appellee is both detrimental to the child and against the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 7} In her sole assignment of error, grandmother asserts that the juvenile court abused its discretion in returning legal custody of D.R. to mother. Following an adjudication that D.R. was a dependent child, D.R. was placed in the temporary custody of CSB. On July 17, 2002, the trial court held another dispositional hearing. The pending motions before the trial court were mother\u2019s motion for legal custody of D.R., grandmother\u2019s motion for legal custody, and CSB\u2019s motion that D.R. be placed in the legal custody of grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 8} In its judgment entry granting legal custody to mother, the trial court indicated that it was bound by <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, which provided in its syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">\u201cIn an R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) child custody proceeding between a parent and a nonparent, the hearing officer may not award custody to the nonparent without first making a finding of parental unsuitability \u2014 that is, without first determining that a preponderance of the evidence shows that the parent abandoned the child, that the parent contractually relinquished custody of the child, that the parent has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child, or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court concluded that it was required by <em>Perales </em>to give mother\u2019s request for legal custody preference over grandmother\u2019s motion, unless a preponderance of the evidence established that mother was unsuitable, based on one of the four reasons listed in <em>Perales. </em>The trial court found that the evidence had failed to establish that mother was unsuitable. Because the trial evidence did not satisfy the unsuitability hurdle, it appears that that the trial court did not even consider grandmother\u2019s request, for legal custody. Because the trial court applied the wrong legal standard in considering these motions for legal custody, this court must reverse and remand for a new dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court was mistaken in its belief that, at this dispositional hearing, it could not award legal custody to a nonparent without first finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>parent unsuitable. The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Perales, 52 </em>Ohio St.2d at 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Baker v. Baker </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 805, 813, 682 N.E.2d 661,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by their explicit language, apply only to legal custody proceedings filed pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(2), which applies to private custody actions between presumptively fit parents and nonparents. That is not the type of proceeding that was conducted below.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 11} The dispositional hearing at issue was held to determine whether the then-current disposition of D.R., who had already been adjudicated a dependent child and placed in the temporary custody of CSB, should be changed to place the child in the legal custody of either mother or grandmother. Such a proceeding is governed by an entirely different statutory scheme from R.C. 2151.23(A)(2), which governed the legal custody motions at issue in <em>Perales. </em>The requirement of <em>Perales </em>that a trial court first find a parent unsuitable before awarding legal custody of the child to a nonparent does not apply to dispositional hearings following an adjudication that the child is abused, dependent, or neglected. <em>In re Farrow, </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-837, 2002-Ohio-3237, 2002 WL 1377798; <em>In re McQuitty </em>(May 5, 1986), 12th Dist. No. CA85-04-016, 1986 WL 5151.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201cAlthough the suitability of the parents to have custody of the child is a factor that courts hearing child dependency and neglect actions pursuant to Chapter 2151 must consider, courts need not expressly find the parents to be unsuitable before awarding custody to a nonparent.\u201d <em>In re Johnson </em>(Mar. 29, 1995), 4th Dist. No. 94CA2003, 1995 WL 146064.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio Supreme Court has never extended <em>Perales </em>to legal custody decisions in cases of abuse, dependency, or neglect under R.C. Chapter 2151. In fact, in <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E.2d 1034, the Supreme Court held that once a child has been adjudicated dependent, as defined in R.C. 2151.04, the trial court\u2019s dispositional orders are primarily concerned with the best interests of the child. Id. at 103, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E.2d 1034. Although the court recognized that a \u201cbest interests\u201d analysis may necessarily be intertwined with the concept of parental fitness, \u201cthe fundamental or primary inquiry at the dispositional phase of these juvenile proceedings is not whether the parents of a previously adjudicated \u2018dependent\u2019 child are either fit or unfit.\u201d Id. at 106, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 13} The <em>Cunningham </em>court confined its analysis to the requirements of the dependency and neglect statutes for, unlike the custody dispute at issue in <em>Perales, </em>trial courts in child dependency and neglect cases are guided by a fairly comprehensive statutory scheme. See Id. at 102-103, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>1047. The explicit language of R.C. 2151.353, which applies to dispositional orders after the child has been adjudicated abused, dependent, or neglected, did not then (and does not now) include any requirement that the trial court make a further finding of parental unfitness before implementing any of the enumerated dispositional alternatives. Id. at 103, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. The <em>Cunningham </em>court did not judicially add protection of the parent\u2019s rights that the legislature had failed to address, as the court did in <em>Perales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 14} The dependency-and-neglect provisions of R.C. Chapter 2151 seek to balance parental rights with the best interests of the child. <em>In re Johnson, </em>4th Dist. No. 94CA2003. Consequently, an adjudication of dependency must be established by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id. R.C. 2151.04 defines a \u201cdependent child\u201d as any child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">\u201c(A) Who is homeless or destitute or without adequate parental care, through no fault of the child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201c(B) Who lacks adequate parental care by reason of the mental or physical condition of the child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201c(C) Whose condition or environment is such as to warrant the state, in the interests of the child, in assuming the child\u2019s guardianship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">\u201c(D) To whom both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201c(1) The child is residing in a household in which a parent, guardian, custodian, or other member of the household committed an act that was the basis for an adjudication that a sibling of the child or any other child who resides in the household is an abused, neglected, or dependent child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">\u201c(2) Because of the circumstances surrounding the abuse, neglect, or dependency of the sibling or other child and the other conditions in the household of the child, the child is in danger of being abused or neglected by that parent, guardian, custodian, or member of the household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">{\u00b6 15} An adjudication of dependency implies that the parents are unsuitable. <em>In re Johnson. </em>Each of the above statutory reasons for finding a child dependent tends to encompass the final <em>Perales </em>reason for finding a parent unsuitable, \u201cthat an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.\u201d <em>Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047 at syllabus; see, also, <em>In re Justice </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 78, 13 O.O.3d 139, 392 N.E.2d 897; <em>Linger v. Weiss </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 97, 101, 386 N.E.2d 1354 (implying that an adjudication that a child is neglected necessarily encompasses a consideration of parental fitness and the child\u2019s best interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2151.353(A) sets forth the dispositional alternatives available to the trial court following an adjudication of dependency. Those alternatives include: \u201c(3) [a]ward[ing] legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal custody of the child[.]\u201d As in the case of the subsection at issue in <em>Cunningham, </em>there is no requirement in the statute that the parent be found unsuitable before the trial court considers legal custody to a nonparent. The statute seems to place them on equal footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 17} Consequently, the trial court should have considered each of the motions for legal custody of D.R. based on a best-interest standard, without the additional hurdle that grandmother first establish mother\u2019s unsuitability. Because the trial court failed to apply the correct standard, this court reverses and remands for a new dispositional hearing. The assignment of error is sustained accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 18} Grandmother\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the juvenile court is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-9\">Slaby, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A4\">Carr, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">. The trial court indicated that <em>Baker </em>applied here as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-13\">. Although Mother stipulated to dependency here, she had the opportunity to contest the issue, which would have required CSB to present clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
