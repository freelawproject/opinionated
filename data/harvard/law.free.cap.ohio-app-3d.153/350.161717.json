He had some administrative responsibilities, but also counseled all types of people, from children to adolescents to adults. When Wagner was hired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>it was not the hospital\u2019s policy to do reference checks prior to making the offer of employment. Thus, the human resources department did not attempt to conduct a reference check on Wagner until after he was offered employment. When it conducted the reference cheek, the hospital sent out a form letter to some of Wagner\u2019s previous employers as well as to one of his personal references. Some of those references were returned to the hospital. However, Wagner\u2019s immediately previous place of employment, Western Reserve Care System, did not return a reference. It was the hospital\u2019s policy not to follow up on references that were not returned due to the litigious environment surrounding such recommendations. However, Wagner\u2019s immediate supervisor, the hospital\u2019s director of social services, Betsy Williams, called someone at Western Reserve and that person gave her a positive oral recommendation of Wagner. Hospital personnel concede that Wagner would not have been hired if Western Reserve had given a negative reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 3} After Wagner had been employed at the hospital for a few years, Williams began to hear concerns from his coworkers about some of his behavior. For instance, some of those coworkers had expressed how odd it was that Wagner spent such a large amount of his time with the children he was counseling, even outside the hospital environment. Williams confronted Wagner about those concerns and he agreed to limit his visits with patients to hospital hours and one followup visit. She also warned Wagner against getting involved in the family-related activities of his minor patients. Wagner agreed to comply with Williams\u2019s requests and, after speaking with Wagner about those concerns, no one ever informed Williams that Wagner had resumed those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 4} In November 1991, someone told Williams that they were surprised that Wagner was working for the hospital, considering what had happened at Western Reserve. This raised questions in Williams\u2019s mind. The person did not tell Williams the substance of what happened and she could not find any information to substantiate what little the person had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 5} On January 3, 1992, Wagner submitted a letter of resignation to the hospital to become effective on January 30, 1992. Apparently, Wagner was seeking employment at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. Shortly thereafter, on January 8, 1992, the hospital\u2019s vice-president of human resources, John Lenzi, received a phone call from his counterpart at Western Reserve, Bill Cummings, and Western Reserve\u2019s labor attorney, John Stein. Western Reserve had received a phone call from someone attempting to conduct a reference check on Wagner. Mistakenly believing that the hospital was the potential employer who was actually conducting the reference check, Cummings and Stein called Lenzi to make him aware that while Wagner was employed at Western Reserve there were some problems concerning Wagner\u2019s associations with young children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>outside the hospital. It appears that in 1987, the police informed Western Reserve that Wagner had been accused of exposing himself and molesting children and those accusations were being investigated at that time. After being asked about this by Western Reserve, Wagner admitted that he was under investigation by the police. As a consequence of Western Reserve\u2019s finding this information out, Wagner resigned his employment on the condition that Western Reserve would state to those conducting reference checks in the future that he had voluntarily resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 6} After hearing this information, Lenzi called Williams and her immediate supervisor, Karen Kazel, into his office to discuss the situation. Lenzi never told Williams exactly what he was told by Western Reserve, only that Western Reserve called and said the hospital should not hire Wagner. The three decided to make January 10, 1992, Wagner\u2019s last day with the hospital. However, they agreed that Wagner should be paid through January 30, 1992. In order to ensure that Wagner did not successfully rescind his resignation, the position of assistant director of social services was eliminated and those functions were spread among other members of the department. Lenzi also called his counterpart at St. Elizabeth\u2019s about what he had found out. At no time did anyone at the hospital inform Wagner that the hospital had found out the reason he left Western Reserve. It also did not inform either Wagner\u2019s present or former patients of the reason Wagner was no longer employed at the hospital. The hospital did not report its suspicions to any authority. As Kazel and Lenzi both stated, the hospital\u2019s goal was to pay Wagner off and get him out of the hospital as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 7} In 1989, while Wagner was working at the hospital, F.C.\u2019s father, Eric Douglass, took him to the hospital for counseling. F.C. was seven years old at the time and his parents had just divorced. Eric thought that counseling would help F.C. cope with that divorce. F.C.\u2019s counselor at the hospital was Wagner. After a few sessions, F.C. no longer visited Wagner at the hospital. However, Wagner maintained a continuing relationship with F.C. outside the hospital. He would pick F.C. up and take him and other children on day trips to amusement parks, swimming, and other activities. Eric assumed that this was an extension of the counseling the hospital was providing him. Thus, he never questioned whether this relationship was condoned by the hospital. He never received a bill for the counseling F.C. received either inside or outside the hospital. Eric also never learned that Wagner had quit his employment with the hospital in January 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 8} In July 1995, Wagner invited 13-year-old F.C. to his house in Youngstown for a weekend stay, the first time F.C. would be spending the night at Wagner\u2019s residence. F.C. asked his 15-year-old cousin, S.K., if he would go as well. S.K. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>asked his mother, Kathy, if he could go. Kathy was acquainted with Wagner and the hospital\u2019s other social service people through her work in a nursing home. She understood that the visit was to involve Wagner in some professional manner with her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">{\u00b6 9} Kathy called Williams to ask her advice on whether S.K. should accompany F.C. to Wagner\u2019s residence. Kathy\u2019s understanding of the conversation was that Williams gave a positive reference about Wagner, that Wagner \u201cwould be good.\u201d Williams did not tell Kathy about any suspicions about Wagner or that Wagner was no longer employed at the hospital. Based in part on Williams\u2019s statements, Kathy allowed her son to accompany F.C. to Wagner\u2019s residence for the weekend. That weekend, and over the course of the next few months, Wagner gave the two boys marijuana and beer and either masturbated or performed oral sex on them. He then threatened the boys with harm if they either told anyone what was going on or refused to return for future visits. Eventually, both F.C. and S.K. disclosed how they had been molested. Wagner was later convicted of crimes relating to the molestation of these boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 10} Subsequently, appellants filed a complaint against the hospital that alleged nine causes of action: negligent hiring, respondeat superior, negligent entrustment, two counts of negligence, negligent supervision, violations of rights protected by statute and regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Following discovery, the hospital moved for summary judgment against appellants, claiming that they could demonstrate no genuine issues of material fact on any of their nine claims. Appellants responded to that motion. The hospital then filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. Contemporaneous with that reply memorandum, the hospital moved to strike the affidavit of appellants\u2019 expert witness, Dr. Bernard Katz, contending that the affidavit failed to comply with the requirements of Civ.R. 56(E) and Evid.R. 702. Appellants never responded to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 11} Subsequently, the trial court entered an \u201cAnnouncement of Decision.\u201d In that entry, the court stated that it intended to sustain the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It refrained from issuing its actual opinion and order \u201cbecause of the press of other court business\u201d and canceled the final status conference and the trial, both of which had already been scheduled. It further clarified that this entry was not intended to be a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court later entered its final opinion and judgment entry. Within that entry, the trial court first granted the hospital\u2019s motion to strike Katz\u2019s affidavit, finding that the affidavit failed to meet the requirements of either Civ.R. 56(E) or Evid.R. 702. The trial court then granted the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that no material issues of fact remained on any of appellants\u2019 nine claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Appellants set forth five assignments of error. Appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion when it held that Plaintiffs expert, Dr. Bernard Katz, was not qualified to testify about administrative [sic] including procedures and excluding his testimony and affidavit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 15} Because the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to strike Katz\u2019s affidavit may substantially affect our analysis of the remaining assignments of error, appellants\u2019 last assignment of error will be addressed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 16} In their fifth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it struck Katz\u2019s affidavit for its failure to comply with Civ.R. 56(E) and Evid.R. 702, as Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae and his deposition establish his qualifications to render an expert opinion in this case. The hospital argues that appellants\u2019 failure to file a response to the motion to strike the affidavit waives this argument on appeal. It then argues that even if appellants had properly responded to the hospital\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court properly granted the motion because Katz\u2019s affidavit contains numerous legal conclusions, such as the hospital \u201cacted in an egregious, negligent, wanton and reckless manner\u201d and whether the hospital complied with Ohio law, and renders expert opinions on issues in which he is not qualified as an expert. In their reply brief, appellants contend that they were not given the opportunity to respond to the motion to strike and, thus, they did not waive their ability to raise this assignment of error. They also reiterate their argument that Katz was qualified to render the expert opinions found in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 17} Before addressing the substance of this assignment of error, we must first address the hospital\u2019s contention that appellants have waived this assignment of error. The hospital argues that appellants\u2019 failure to file a responsive memorandum to the motion to strike Katz\u2019s affidavit is a failure to call the trial court\u2019s attention to an error that could have been avoided or corrected and, thus, appellants may not raise any objections to the hospital\u2019s motion to strike on appeal. However, the cases the hospital relies upon when making its argument do not apply to the present situation. For instance, the hospital cites <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus, for the proposition that \u201c[a]n appellate court need not consider an error which a party complaining of the trial court\u2019s judgment could have called, but did not call, to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court\u201d and to <em>Stores Realty Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 41, 43, 70 O.O.2d 123, 322 N.E.2d 629, for the proposition that appellants\u2019 objections to the motion to strike may not be raised on appeal. These cases deal with the failure to initially raise an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>before the trial court, not with the failure to respond to an issue raised by an adverse party. For example, these are appropriate cases to cite when a party has failed to object to certain testimony, see <em>McDonald &amp; Co. Securities., Inc., Gradison Div. v. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease &amp; Related Disorders Assn., Inc. </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 358, 365, 747 N.E.2d 843, or has failed to move for a change of venue, see <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 258, 754 N.E.2d 1129. However, they do not specifically address whether an adverse party waives any arguments relating to a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion if that party has failed to explain why it believes that the motion should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 18} In other cases, Ohio\u2019s appellate courts have not agreed with the hospital\u2019s argument. For example, in <em>Sharma v. Hummer </em>(Apr. 27, 2001), 6th Dist. No. WD-00-047, 2001 WL 460281, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed four affidavits, apparently in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The defendants then moved to strike those four affidavits. The court initially noted that the plaintiffs never filed any documents in response to the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. Without addressing whether the plaintiffs failure to file a response to the motion to strike waived any arguments the plaintiffs may want to raise, the court affirmatively addressed whether the affidavits were properly struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 19} We agree with the result in <em>Sharma </em>because a party\u2019s attempt to introduce an affidavit into evidence is sufficient to preserve any arguments that party may on appeal have about that affidavit\u2019s admissibility. Given this conclusion, the hospital\u2019s claim that appellants have waived this argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 20} In the substance of this assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it struck Katz\u2019s affidavit because that affidavit complied with the procedural and evidentiary rules governing the admissibility of expert opinion affidavits during summary judgment proceedings. A trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to strike is within its sound discretion and will not be overturned on appeal unless the trial court abuses its discretion. <em>Early v. Toledo Blade </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 302, 318, 720 N.E.2d 107; <em>Foreclosure of Liens for Delinquent Land Taxes by Action Taken in Rem v. Parcels of Land Encumbered with Delinquent Tax Liens </em>(Feb. 9, 2000), 7th Dist. No. 96-489-CA, at 2, 2000 WL 184256. Similarly, the decision regarding the admission of testimony of an expert witness lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed unless the trial court abuses that discretion. <em>Scott v. Yates </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 219, 221, 643 N.E.2d 105. An abuse of discretion constitutes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is \u201cso palpably and grossly violative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason, but rather of passion or bias.\u201d <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">_ {\u00b6 21} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), a court may not consider any evidence when ruling on a motion for summary judgment unless it conforms with Civ.R. 56. According to Civ.R. 56(E), \u201c[sjupporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d Thus, affidavits containing opinions, like the one in this case, must meet the requirements in the Rules of Evidence governing the admissibility of opinions. <em>Tomlinson v. Cincinnati </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 66, 4 OBR 155, 446 N.E.2d 454, paragraph one of the syllabus. In this case, appellants do not attempt to argue that Katz\u2019s opinion would be admissible under Evid.R. 701 governing the opinions of lay witnesses. Indeed, Katz\u2019s affidavit itself purports to be that of an expert witness. Thus, in order for this affidavit to be considered in ruling on the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it must meet the requirements of Evid.R. 702. In order to comply with Civ.R. 56(E) and Evid.R. 702, an expert affidavit must set forth the expert\u2019s credentials and the facts supporting the expert\u2019s opinion which would be admissible into evidence. <em>Hall v. Fairmont Homes, Inc. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 424, 434, 664 N.E.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 22} The parties\u2019 initial disagreement is over whether the trial court, and therefore this court, may rely upon Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae in determining whether he is qualified to render his expert testimony, as appellants failed to attach Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae to his affidavit. Katz\u2019s affidavit gives a brief example of his qualifications as an expert. It then refers to an \u201cattached\u201d curriculum vitae as further proof of his bona fides. However, appellants failed to attach that document to the affidavit. Civ.R. 56(E) provides that \u201c[s]worn or certified copies of all papers or parts of papers referred to in an affidavit shall be attached to or served with the affidavit.\u201d If a paragraph makes reference to a document which is not properly attached under Civ.R. 56(E), then a trial court may properly strike that paragraph. <em>Wall v. Firelands Radiology, Inc. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 313, 336, 666 N.E.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants argue that Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae is properly before the court when it is ruling on the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment because it was attached to their disclosure of expert witnesses filed on October 11, 2001. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 24} Civ.R. 56 allows a court to consider only \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action\u201d when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Civ.R. 56(C). A disclosure of expert witnesses does not fit any of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"> {\u00b6 25} \u201cThe proper procedure for introducing evidentiary matter not specifically authorized by Civ.R. 56(C) is to incorporate it by reference in a properly framed affidavit pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E).\u201d <em>Biskupich v. Westbay Manor Nursing Home </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 220, 222, 515 N.E.2d 632. \u201cThe requirement of Civ.R. 56(E) that sworn or certified copies of all papers referred to in the affidavit be attached is satisfied by attaching the papers to the affidavit, coupled with a statement therein that such copies are true copies and reproductions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Corrigan v. Seminatore </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 459, 467, 20 O.O.3d 388, 423 N.E.2d 105. The referenced papers may also be \u201csworn or certified\u201d by a certification contained within the paper itself. <em>Olverson v. Butler </em>(1975), 45 Ohio App.2d 9, 12, 74 O.O.2d 11, 340 N.E.2d 436. Finally, it is well settled that unauthenticated documents which \"are not sworn, certified, or authenticated by way of affidavit have no evidentiary value and may not be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Citizens Ins. Co. v. Burkes </em>(1978), 56 Ohio App.2d 88, 95-96, 10 O.O.3d 119, 381 N.E.2d 963; <em>Sparks v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(Jan. 16, 1998), 6th Dist. No. E-97-007, 1998 WL 15929.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">(\u00b6 26} Here, the record does not demonstrate that Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae was properly served or certified. It is not self-authenticating under Evid.R. 902. Likewise, there is no statement in the record that this document is a true reproduction. Thus, neither the trial court nor this court may rely upon Katz\u2019s curriculum vitae in determining whether he was qualified to be an expert in this case. See <em>Buzzard v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Sys. of Ohio </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 632, 636, 745 N.E.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">(\u00b6 27} After determining that we may not rely on Katz\u2019s affidavit when deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion when it struck that affidavit, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it struck that affidavit. Many of the \u201copinions\u201d contained in that affidavit were unsupported conclusory statements. In addition, Katz\u2019s affidavit and deposition demonstrate that he was not qualified to render many of the other opinions contained in that affidavit. Finally, the remainder of that affidavit is largely irrelevant. Accordingly, the affidavit did not comply with Civ.R. 56(E) and Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 28} It is improper for an expert\u2019s affidavit to set forth conclusory statements and legal conclusions without sufficient supporting facts. <em>Wall v. Firelands Radiology, Inc., </em>106 Ohio App.3d at 335-336, 666 N.E.2d 235; <em>Davis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Schindler Elevator Corp. </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 18, 21, 647 N.E.2d 827; Evid.R. 704; Evid.R. 705. Letting expert witnesses make these types of unsupported conclusions creates the possibility, if not the probability, of misinterpretation of the legal standard by the witness and the factfinder\u2019s inability to perceive this misinterpretation. <em>Gannett v. Booher </em>(1983), 12 Ohio App.3d 49, 53, 12 OBR 190, 465 N.E.2d 1326, at fn. 4. However, pursuant to Evid.R. 704, an expert\u2019s opinion is not objectionable solely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact if that opinion is otherwise admissible. It must be kept in mind that opinions that embrace an ultimate issue must still be both relevant and helpful to the trier of fact. <em>Lambert v. Shearer </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 266, 276, 616 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 29} An example of a case in which an expert made an ultimate conclusion in his affidavit submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment that which the court found proper is <em>Smith v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 567, 600 N.E.2d 325. In <em>Smith, </em>an expert affidavit filed by plaintiffs in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment recited that in the expert\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe negligence of the [defendant] was the proximate cause of the [plaintiffs] injuries, * * * but for the negligence of [the defendant] [the plaintiff] would not have been injured * * * [and] without their negligence the * * * ultimate injury to [the plaintiff] would not have occurred.\u201d Id. at 570, 600 N.E.2d 325. The First District noted that the affidavit in question \u201cexpressly identified the list of depositions, statements * * *, and documents upon which the expert relied\u201d when making his determination. Id. Because the affidavit contained both the expert\u2019s opinion and the data upon which the expert expressly relied, it was sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Id. at 571, 600 N.E.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 30} In contrast, portions of this affidavit state the legal conclusion that the hospital was negligent and deviated from the standards of care but does not give any clue as to what the hospital was negligent of, i.e., it does not describe what standard of care the hospital failed to meet. This is not particularly helpful to the trier of fact, as appellants assert various negligence actions arising from different standards of care in this case. Thus, the trial court did not err when it struck the portions of Katz\u2019s affidavit that make unsupported conclusory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 31} As stated above, we also conclude that Katz was not qualified to render many of the remaining opinions in his affidavit. When deciding whether an expert is qualified to render the opinions found in an affidavit in support of summary judgment, a court may look to other evidentiary matter, including depositions of the affiant not previously filed in the court. See <em>Cleveland Clinic Found. v. Commerce Group Benefits, Inc. </em>(Mar. 28, 2002), 8th Dist. No. 79907, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>2002 WL 485764; <em>Williams v. 312 Walnut Ltd. Partnership </em>(Dec. 13, 1996), 1st Dist. No. C-960368, 1996 WL 741982. Ohio\u2019s standards regarding the admissibility of expert opinions are relatively lenient as to a determination of who is an expert but relatively strict in governing the admissibility of the expert testimony. <em>State v. Rangel </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 291, 295, 747 N.E.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 32} To qualify as an expert, the witness must have some \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d Evid.R. 702(B). An expert\u2019s testimony must either relate to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispel a misconception common among lay persons. Evid.R. 702(A). \u201cNeither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness. The individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function.\u201d <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150, citing <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128; <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909. Finally, the witness is an expert only if his or her testimony \u201cis based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d Evid.R. 702(C). When applying this prong of Evid.R. 702, the trial court acts as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to ensure that the proffered information is sufficiently reliable. See <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238; <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469; <em>State v. Nemeth </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 211, 694 N.E.2d 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 33} As Katz\u2019s- affidavit attests, he is a board-certified forensic psychiatrist who is or has been an associate clinical professor of psychiatry, the medical director of a hospital for the criminally insane, the chief psychiatric consultant for the Department of the Army, the senior clinical supervisor at a hospital, and the medical director and psychiatrist-in-chief of the outpatients\u2019 clinic for an institute. He has also previously testified as an expert both for plaintiffs and defendants in both civil and criminal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 34} Katz claims that the expertise he brings to this case is due to his \u201cexperience as a psychiatrist and as a clinical administrator\u201d and he does have experience which, on the surface, would appear to qualify him as an expert in this case. For example, most of his experience has been as a chief medical officer of various hospitals and psychiatric clinics. Additionally, he has given expert testimony in previous medical malpractice cases, which have included claims of faulty hiring practices. Finally, as chief medical officer of a hospital, it was his responsibility to ensure that the hospital hired properly qualified people.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Although Katz\u2019s experience indicates that he may be able to testify as an expert in this case, a closer examination of his deposition testimony reveals his lack of expertise with the issues involved in this case. For example, he testified that cases involving claims of faulty hiring practices are not the typical cases in which he is involved. Furthermore, he does not know the law in Ohio regarding reference checks. Katz\u2019s affidavit claims that the hospital\u2019s actions in hiring Wagner did not meet the applicable standard of care, but admits that he does not know what standards exist in the various employment organizations with respect to employment procedures. He has never worked in human resources nor is he acquainted with federal law regarding employment practices. He does not even know whether written standards governing employment practices exist. Finally, Katz did not remember testifying as an expert in a case that involves an allegation relating to the employment of someone who has a background such that they should not have been hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 36} As the hospital concedes, these facts demonstrate that Katz appears to be eminently qualified to give an expert opinion on issues such as the quality of the mental health care given to a particular patient. The hospital argues that this is not the issue in this case and that Katz is not competent to give expert testimony on the administrative procedures surrounding the hospital\u2019s employment practices. We agree. For instance, Katz clearly cannot testify as to bad record-keeping procedures in human resources, bad hiring or firing procedures relating to record checks, or the hospital\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Ohio law. In addition, some statements, such as the conclusion that the hospital \u201cconsciously and intentionally * * * covered up and deceptively hid their suspicions of Timothy Wagner\u201d are factual conclusions rather than expert opinions and, thus, should be stricken. Finally, after examining depositions Katz did not have the opportunity to see, his statements about the hospital\u2019s \u201coutpatient\u201d practices appear to be based on incorrect facts, as the hospital did not treat psychiatric patients in an \u201coutpatient\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 37} In addition to those opinions that Katz was clearly not qualified to make, an examination of his deposition demonstrates that he is not qualified to make other statements, which, on first blush, appear to be proper. For instance, he states that the hospital \u201cfailed to implement the proper standards to evaluate Timothy Wagner on a routine basis and did not effectively check his progress.\u201d As these statements relate to his experience as the medical director of psychiatric facilities, it appears that he would be qualified to render this opinion. However, an examination of his deposition demonstrates that he based this conclusion on facts not in the record, i.e., that Wagner was treating people on an outpatient basis that was approved by the hospital. Finally, many of Katz\u2019s statements appear to be crafted in such a way as to create some sort of duty on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the hospital. This is, of course, improper, as the existence of a legal duty is a question of law, not of fact. <em>Laurent v. Flood Data Serv., Inc. </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 392, 400, 766 N.E.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 38} For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it struck Katz\u2019s affidavit. Many of the statements are improper legal conclusions, an attempt to create a legal duty, or opinions that Katz is not qualified to render.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 40} In their remaining assignments of error, appellants challenge the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to the hospital. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121. This court\u2019s review is, therefore, de novo. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is only proper when the movant demonstrates that, viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmovant, reasonable minds must conclude that no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. \u201c[T]he moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for motion, and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact or material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 296, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party has the reciprocal burden of specificity and cannot rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleadings. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 41} In order to recover on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, the defendant breached that duty, and the breach of the duty proximately caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Chambers v. St. Mary\u2019s School </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 563, 565, 697 N.E.2d 198. Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the hospital negligently carried out the duties it owed to them. In response, the hospital argues that it owes them no duty; even if it did, it did not breach that duty; and even if it did, the breach was not the proximate cause of appellants\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 42} It is axiomatic that duty is an essential element of a cause of action for negligence. <em>Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling Ctr. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 284, 293, 673 N.E.2d 1311. While the scope and extent of a duty is a question of fact, the existence of such a duty is a question of law. <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265. A duty may be established by common law, legislative enactment, or by the particular facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and circumstances of the case. <em>Eisenhuth v. Moneyhon </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 367, 53 O.O. 274, 119 N.E.2d 440, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 43} Appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion when it held that the defendant was granted summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact and issues of law as to whether defendant violated Ohio Revised Code 2151.421.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 45} Appellants argue that the hospital violated the provisions of R.C. 2151.421 and, therefore, should be liable to the Douglasses and the Pahanishes for Wagner\u2019s acts. R.C. 2151.421(A)(1)(a) provides persons, such as the ones employed at the hospital, who, acting in their official or professional capacity, know or suspect that a child under eighteen years of age has suffered or faces a threat of suffering any physical or mental wound, injury, disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect of the child, must immediately report that knowledge or suspicion to the public children services agency or a municipal or county peace officer in the county in which the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred. Thus, each person listed in the statute has an independent obligation to report suspected abuse. Appellants argue that the hospital and its employees should have reported then-suspicions of Wagner, especially after Kathy\u2019s phone call to Williams concerning whether S.K. should be allowed to spend time with Wagner. .</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 46} R.C. 2151.421 was enacted to safeguard children from abuse. <em>Brodie v. Summit Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 112, 119, 554 N.E.2d 1301. Thus, anyone who violates R.C. 2151.421(A)(1) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. R.C. 2151.99(A). R.C. 2151.421 sets forth a specific duty to report knowledge or suspicions of child abuse; thus, the failure to perform that duty is actionable and the plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that they fall within the class of individuals the statute was designed to protect. <em>Hite v. Brown </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 606, 617, 654 N.E.2d 452; <em>Curran v. Walsh Jesuit High School </em>(1995), 99 Ohio App.3d 696, 699, 651 N.E.2d 1028. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the action required by R.C. 2151.421 is not directed at or designed to protect the public at large, but intended to protect a specific child who is reported as abused or neglected. <em>Brodie v. Summit Cty. Children Serv. Bd., </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 119, 554 N.E.2d 1301. Thus, R.C. 2151.421 imposes a duty that is owed solely to the minor child who the person responsible for reporting abuse knew or suspected was a victim of abuse or neglect. <em>Curran v. Walsh Jesuit High School, </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 700, 651 N.E.2d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 47} The hospital did not have the statutory duty to report Wagner when he quit his employment. At that time, the hospital had no reason to know or suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that any particular child was being abused or in danger of being abused by Wagner. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 48} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 49} Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion when it held that the defendant was granted summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact as to plaintiffs claims that defendant was negligent in hiring Timothy Wagner as a counselor and permitting Timothy Wagner to counsel the minor Plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe party seeking to prevail on a claim for the negligent hiring, supervision and retention of an employee by an employer must show: (1) the existence of an employment relationship; (2) the employee\u2019s incompetence; (3) the employer\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of such incompetence; (4) the employee\u2019s act or omission causing the plaintiffs injuries; and (5) the employer\u2019s negligence in hiring or retaining the employee as the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries.\u201d (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.) <em>Steppe v. Kmart Stores </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 454, 465, 737 N.E.2d 58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 52} In this case, at the time appellants suffered their alleged injuries, an employment relationship did not exist between Wagner and the hospital. Additionally, there was no evidence to establish that prior to hiring Wagner, the hospital knew or should have known that Wagner was incompetent. Therefore, appellants failed to establish a claim of negligent hiring or retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 53} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 54} Appellants\u2019 first and second assignments of error state respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion when it held that the defendant was granted summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact that plaintiffs agents, John Lenzi, Karen Kazel, and Elizabeth Williams, were negligent [in a way] that caused the minor plaintiffs to be sexually molested by defendant\u2019s former counselor, Timothy Wagner. (Respondeat Superior.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion when it held that the defendant was granted summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact that it was foreseeable that Salem Community Hospital\u2019s counselor-child molester would molest other children, since Salem Community Hospital\u2019s agents failed to warn Douglass and Pahanish.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">{\u00b6 57} The remainder of the duties that appellants argue the hospital allegedly breached arise out of the common law and the particular facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of the case. The essential question a court must answer when determining whether a duty exists is whether the plaintiffs interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Morgan, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 297-298, 673 N.E.2d 1311. Appellants argue that the hospital owed various duties to them. For instance, they argue that the hospital had the duty to protect them from Wagner\u2019s actions. A duty to act affirmatively for another\u2019s aid or protection does not exist absent some \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties that justifies the imposition of a duty. Id. at 293, 673 N.E.2d 1311, citing 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 116-130, Sections 314-319. Accordingly, appellants argue that a special relationship existed between themselves and the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Evans v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 724, 680 N.E.2d 161, the dissent in that case explained that exceptions can arise to the general rule of nonliability for the acts of third parties. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe other exception to the general rule of nonliability for the acts of third parties is that an actor owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect those with whom the actor has a special relationship from the conduct of third persons. See <em>Fed. Steel &amp; Wire Corp. v. Ruhlin Constr. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 171, 173-174, 543 N.E.2d 769, 772 (citing cases). Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 122, Section 315, states the rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c \u2018There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c \u2018(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c \u2018(b) <em>a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cSection 314A of the Restatement lists four specific \u2018special relationships\u2019 and the following caveat: \u2018The Institute expresses no opinion as to whether there may not be other relations which impose a similar duty.\u2019 The comments to Sections 314 and 314A express the same idea, that courts may recognize additional special relationships to expand the exception to the general rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c \u2018The result of the [general] rule has been a series of older decisions to the effect that one human being, seeing a fellow man in dire peril, is under no legal obligation to aid him, but may sit on the dock, smoke his cigar, and watch the other drown. Such decisions have been condemned by legal writers as revolting to any moral sense, but thus far they remain the law. It appears inevitable that, sooner or later, such extreme cases of morally outrageous and indefensible conduct will arise that there will be further inroads upon the older rule.\u2019 Section 314 of the Restatement, Comment c, paragraph 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>{\u00b6 65} * * The relations listed are not intended to be exclusive, and are not necessarily the only ones in which a duty of affirmative action for the aid or protection of another may be found. * * * The question is therefore left open by the Caveat * * *.

Any number of considerations may justify the imposition of duty in particular circumstances, including the guidance of history, our continually refined concepts of morals and justice, the convenience of the rule, and social judgment as to where the loss should fall.\u201d \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Mussivand [v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265, 269-270].\u201d <em>Evans v. Ohio State Univ., </em>112 Ohio App.3d at 753-754, 680 N.E.2d 161 (Lazarus, J., concurring and dissenting in part).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 69} In this case, there was such a special relationship between the hospital and appellants that when the inquiry was made about Wagner the hospital owed appellants the duty to warn them about him. Eric Douglass saw Wagner on a professional basis while Wagner was employed by the hospital. S.K\u2019s mother believed that S.K\u2019s visit with Wagner was to involve Wagner in some professional manner. When S.K\u2019s mother called the hospital to ask its advice on whether S.K. should accompany F.C. to Wagner\u2019s residence, her understanding was that she was given a positive reference about Wagner. She was not told about any suspicions about Wagner or that he was no longer employed at the hospital. While the hospital may not have had an affirmative duty to disclose to all former patients or clients that were involved with Wagner about his past history, when inquiry was made and it was asked for advice concerning him, it was bound to offer that advice in a non-negligent manner. In this instance, it clearly did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Additionally, appellants have succeeded in making a more general claim of negligence pursuant to 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 323, negligent performance of an undertaking to render service, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cOne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c(b) the harm is suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 74} The theory of recovery under Section 323(b) is that \u201cwhen one undertakes a duty voluntarily, and another reasonably relies on that undertaking, the volunteer is required to exercise ordinary care in completing the duty.\u201d <em>Kerr-Morris v. Equitable Real Estate Invest. Mgt., Inc. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 331, 335, 736 N.E.2d 552. In other words, \u201c[a] voluntary act, gratuitously undertaken, must be * * * performed with the exercise of due care under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Briere v. Lathrop Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 166, 172, 51 O.O.2d 232, 258 N.E.2d 597. This theory of negligence does not require proof of a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, or proof of somewhat overwhelming circumstances. This type of negligence follows the general rules for finding negligence, with the addition of one extra element of proof, that of reasonable reliance by the plaintiff on the actions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 75} One of the theories of recovery that appellants have set forth in their complaint is that Betsy Williams, the hospital\u2019s director of social services, gratuitously offered a recommendation to Kathy Pahanish, mother of S.K., regarding a former employee of the hospital, Wagner. Even if we accept the argument that Williams had no preexisting duty to protect Kathy Pahanish or her son, once Williams decided to give a recommendation about Wagner, she was required to exercise due care in giving the recommendation. Appellants believe that Williams did not exercise due care, resulting in injury to the minor children. These allegations mirror the elements of the tort of negligent performance of an undertaking to render service.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 76} The negligence action described in 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 323(b) has been recognized in Ohio. See <em>McMullen v. Ohio State Univ. Hosp. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 332, 338, 725 N.E.2d 1117; <em>Brodie v. Summit Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 554 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 77} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first two assignments of error have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>{\u00b6 78} The judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed in part and affirmed in part, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-6\">Waite, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b400-7\">DeGenaro, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b400-8\">DeGenaro, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 79} I must disagree with the majority\u2019s resolution of this case because its conclusion regarding appellants\u2019 first and second assignments of error ignores a fundamental premise of negligence law. More specifically, it fails to recognize that because there is no genuine issue as to whether Wagner\u2019s acts were foreseeable to the hospital, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the hospital on all of appellants\u2019 claims. Instead, the majority concludes that the hospital was not entitled to summary judgment on appellants\u2019 common-law negligence claims because a genuine issue exists regarding whether the hospital was in a special relationship with appellants and therefore had a duty to warn appellants about Wagner when S.K\u2019s mother called Williams regarding the children\u2019s visit to Wagner\u2019s residence. I find it unnecessary either to agree or disagree with this conclusion, since appellants have failed to demonstrate for the purposes of summary judgment that Wagner\u2019s acts were foreseeable to the hospital, and I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 80} The majority\u2019s opinion fails to mention that the existence of common-law duties generally depends upon the foreseeability of the injury. <em>Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling Ctr. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 284, 293, 673 N.E.2d 1311. If the injury is not foreseeable, then whether a special relationship existed between the parties is immaterial because there would still be no duty to protect. Foreseeability is defined as whether a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from the performance or nonperformance of an act. Id. If a person can foresee neither any danger of direct injury nor any risk from an intervening cause resulting from his or her actions, then that person is simply not negligent. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. HULS Am., Inc. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 270, 287, 714 N.E.2d 934. Thus, even if appellants establish a special relationship between themselves and the hospital, their claim against the hospital would fail if the injury is not foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">{\u00b6 81} In this case, appellants were injured by the criminal conduct of a third party. Generally, courts will not require the prudent person to expect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>criminal activity of others. <em>Fed. Steel &amp; Wire Corp. v. Ruhlin Constr. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 171, 174, 543 N.E.2d 769. But courts will hold a party liable for a third person\u2019s criminal conduct when the totality of the circumstances are \u201csomewhat overwhelming\u201d that the criminal conduct is foreseeable. See <em>Evans v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 724, 742, 680 N.E.2d 161; <em>Reitz v. May Co. Dept. Stores </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 188, 193-194, 583 N.E.2d 1071. The foreseeability of a criminal act depends on the knowledge of the defendant, which must be determined by the totality of the circumstances. Evans, 112 Ohio App.3d at 742, 680 N.E.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 82} <em>Evans </em>best illustrates the degree to which a third party\u2019s criminal act must be foreseeable before a defendant will be held liable. In <em>Evans, </em>a man, Waites, had been convicted of gross sexual imposition and corruption of a minor. After his release from prison, a county 4-H board hired him as a goat expert to be a speaker at pre-fair clinics and a judge at the 4-H fair. The state 4-H organization learned of his criminal history and informed the county 4-H board of its concerns. The county 4-H board continued to have Waites as a speaker after learning of the state organization\u2019s concerns but used him for the last time in the spring of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 83} In November 1991, the plaintiffs daughter joined 4-H. The daughter asked one of her 4-H advisors to recommend a person who could assist her with her goats and that advisor suggested Waites. When the advisor recommended Waites, the child had already seen him at two 4-H club meetings. That advisor did not know of Waites\u2019s previous convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 84} During the spring of 1992, Waites would come over to the child\u2019s house \u201cevery so often\u201d to help her with her goats. One day, Waites offered to take the child to get a goat. When he and the child reached his house, he molested her. He was subsequently tried and convicted of various counts of kidnapping, corruption of a minor, rape, and felonious sexual assault involving four minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 85} After she was molested, the child\u2019s mother proceeded to file a complaint against the county and state 4-H organizations, claiming failure to warn, negligent hiring, negligent retention, and negligent supervision. After a trial, the trial court entered judgment for the defendants. The appellate court affirmed that decision, finding that the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that Waites\u2019s actions were not foreseeable. It reasoned that Waites\u2019s duties as a judge and speaker and his degree of contact with children were limited, that the incident occurred over one year after Waites stopped working for the county 4-H organization, and that the assault did not occur at a 4-H event. \u201c[W]e are unable to conclude that a duty of care extended to every member of 4-H who Waites may have come in contact with following his fair and clinic employment.\u201d Id. at 743, 680 N.E.2d 161. Thus, even though the county 4-H organization knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Waites had been convicted of gross sexual imposition and corruption of a minor, his actions were not foreseeable and the defendant could not be held liable under any theories of recovery. Id. at 749, 680 N.E.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 86} This case presents this court with a situation in which it is even more difficult to conclude that the third party\u2019s conduct was somewhat overwhelmingly foreseeable than it was in <em>Evans. </em>In <em>Evans, </em>Waites had actually been convicted of gross sexual imposition and corruption of a minor before the local 4-H organization hired him as a speaker and a judge. See, also, <em>Doe v. Beach House Dev. Co. </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 573, 737 N.E.2d 141 (It was not foreseeable that a boy with an extensive history of delinquent conduct would sexually assault a younger boy); <em>Doe v. Blaney </em>(Dec. 29, 1995), 1st Dist. No. C-950093, 1995 WL 763623 (It was not foreseeable that a man with a history of alcohol problems who had been imprisoned for unspecified sexual contact with a seven-year-old female would molest a seven-year-old boy). Here, there had been allegations that Wagner had exposed himself and molested children and a police investigation into those allegations, but no conviction. Those allegations were made in 1987, eight years before S.K\u2019s mother called Williams. In that eight-year period, no one had made similar allegations against Wagner.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 87} Given the state of the law in Ohio, it is difficult to see how any court could find it somewhat overwhelmingly foreseeable that any person who is alleged to have molested children will do so in the future. This is best demonstrated by an examination of child custody and sexual predator law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 88} Some parties have sought a change of custody based on allegations of sexual abuse in child custody cases. For example, in <em>Stover v. Plumley </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 839, 682 N.E.2d 683, a former husband sought custody of children from his former wife due to alleged sexual molestation by the former wife\u2019s current husband. The appellate court held that the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse did not alone warrant a change of custody. Id. at 843, 682 N.E.2d 683. They are merely a factor a court could consider when deciding whether to change custody. Id. <em>Stover'</em>s rationale is significant in this case because of its rejection of the idea that allegations of sexual abuse toward children automatically mean that the alleged offender may be treated differently under the law. If an allegation of sexual abuse alone is not sufficient to keep a child away from ah alleged offender, then how is it somewhat overwhelmingly foreseeable that someone will commit a criminal act in the future when they have only been the subject of a police investigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 89} This principle is most clearly demonstrated in Ohio\u2019s sexual predator laws. A sexual predator is defined as someone who has been <em>convicted </em>of a sexually oriented offense and is likely to engage.in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. R.C. 2950.01(E) and 2950.09(B)(3). A sexual preda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tor classification must be based on more than the fact that the offender has been convicted of a sexually oriented offense. <em>State v. Eppinger </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 158, 743 N.E.2d 881. Thus, Ohio has rejected the idea that it is likely that an offender is likely to commit a second sexually oriented offense merely because they have been convicted of a first sexually oriented offense. If a conviction for a sexually oriented offense does not mean that the offender is likely to commit another sexually oriented offense in the future, then how can we hold that the hospital could foresee that Wagner would commit a sexually oriented offense because there were allegations that he had committed these sexually oriented offenses in the past? Accordingly, I would hold that a medical facility does not owe a duty to protect the public or its former patients from the criminal acts of former employees when it had only heard of allegations that the former employee had engaged in similar criminal acts in the past without additional facts and circumstances demonstrating that it was somewhat overwhelmingly foreseeable that the former employee would engage in those criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 90} Given this conclusion, it is unnecessary to determine whether a special relationship existed between the hospital and appellants. Even if the hospital did have the type of special relationship with appellants necessary to create a duty to protect, since Wagner\u2019s criminal acts were not foreseeable the hospital could not have violated that duty. See <em>HULS Am., </em>supra (if a person cannot foresee any danger of direct injury, then that person is simply not negligent). The majority ignores this fact when concluding that a duty to protect existed in this situation. It states that a special relationship existed and, therefore, the hospital had the duty to give its advice in a non-negligent manner. But the majority fails to explain how the evidence was somewhat overwhelming that Wagner\u2019s criminal conduct was foreseeable. Because the existence of a duty depends upon the foreseeability of the injury and Wagner\u2019s criminal conduct was not foreseeable, it is immaterial whether a special relationship existed between the hospital and appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 91} I recognize the grievousness of the injuries appellants have suffered and understand their frustration with the hospital. But I cannot let the fact that appellants have suffered such severe injuries determine whether the hospital should be held liable for those injuries. In January 1992, it learned that Wagner was accused of some sexual misconduct in 1987, and soon thereafter Wagner no longer worked for the hospital. Wagner was never accused of any other sexual misconduct between 1987 and July 1995, when S.K\u2019s mother talked to Williams. Ohio law recognizes that an allegation of sexual misconduct does not mean that it is somewhat overwhelmingly foreseeable that someone will commit a criminal act conforming with those allegations. Because this type of criminal conduct is not foreseeable under these facts, the hospital did not owe appellants a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>protect them from Wagner. Because the hospital did not owe a duty to appellants, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the hospital. Accordingly, I would find that appellants\u2019 assignments of error are all meritless and would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
