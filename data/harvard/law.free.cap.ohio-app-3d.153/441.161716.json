Dolan, filed a complaint raising numerous causes of action against defendants-appellees, St. Mary\u2019s Memorial Home, Society of the Transfiguration, and Sister Rachel Phillips. The trial court granted summary judgment against Dolan on all her claims. She has appealed that judgment only as to her claims for wrongful/retaliatory discharge and promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">{\u00b6 2} Dolan was the director of nursing at St. Mary\u2019s, a licensed nursing home. The Society of the Transfiguration was an Episcopal religious community that owned and operated St. Mary\u2019s. Sister Rachel Phillips was the administrator of St. Mary\u2019s and Dolan\u2019s direct supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">{\u00b6 3} Dolan was discharged from her employment as director of nursing at St. Mary\u2019s for insubordination. The appellees presented evidence that Dolan had contacted the family of a resident without first informing Sister Rachel, in violation of St. Mary\u2019s policy. When Sister Rachel confronted Dolan about this alleged violation, Dolan acknowledged calling the family. Sister Rachel said that she would give Dolan \u201cone more chance\u201d if she would promise never to contact a resident\u2019s family without her permission. Dolan responded that she did not think that it was a reasonable or appropriate promise to make and that she could not keep the promise because there were too many times that she needed to talk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>residents\u2019 families. Sister Rachel then told Dolan that her employment was terminated. Sister Ann Margaret, Sister Rachel\u2019s superior in the Society of the Transfiguration, confirmed to Dolan that she was being discharged from her employment at St. Mary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 4} Dolan presented evidence that the policy that she had allegedly violated had never been enforced. She testified that she had contacted the families of residents on numerous occasions without first contacting Sister Rachel because Sister Rachel had no medical training and many residents and their family members were not comfortable with Sister Rachel. Dolan believed that it was her ethical duty as a nurse to keep the residents\u2019 families informed of the residents\u2019 conditions. Further, other employees of the nursing home had often found it necessary to contact residents\u2019 families without first informing Sister Rachel and had done so without any adverse consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 5} Dolan also presented evidence that Sister Rachel was verbally and emotionally abusive to the residents and that the residents feared retaliation if they complained. Consequently, Dolan had reported her conduct to Pro Seniors, an advocacy group dedicated to protecting the rights of senior citizens, and ultimately to the Ohio Department of Health. Subsequently, investigators came to St. Mary\u2019s and concluded that the residents\u2019 rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 6} Sister Rachel was incensed upon learning of the complaints and began interrogating staff members to find out who had complained. Dolan met with Sister Ann, who was aware of the problems with Sister Rachel\u2019s behavior. Dolan told Sister Ann that she had expressed her concern about Sister Rachel\u2019s treatment of residents and staff to the investigators. Sister Ann suggested that she and Dolan meet with Sister Rachel to discuss the issues with her. Dolan was reluctant, but Sister Ann told her of the need for honesty and assured her that she would not suffer any retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 7} The meeting occurred a short time later, and Dolan expressed her concerns about Sister Rachel\u2019s behavior and about the complaints that she had received from residents and staff about that behavior. Sister Rachel became angry at the meeting and attempted to place the blame on residents and staff for complaining. Following the meeting, Sister Rachel confronted Dolan regarding her \u201caccusations,\u201d but Dolan told her that she could not talk at that time because of her duties. A few weeks later, the incident in which Dolan contacted the resident\u2019s family without informing Sister Rachel occurred, and Sister Rachel told her, \u201cThat\u2019s just one more thing you\u2019ve done,\u201d before insisting that she promise not to contact the residents\u2019 families and subsequently firing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 8} In this appeal, Dolan presents two assignments of error for review. In her first assignment of error, she states that the trial court erred in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>summary judgment in favor of the appellees on her claim for wrongful discharge. She argues that she presented evidence from which reasonable minds could conclude that the appellees had fired her for reporting Sister Rachel\u2019s abusive behavior, in violation of a clear public policy that encourages the reporting of patient abuse at nursing homes, and that the alleged reason for her discharge was pretextual. We find this assignment of error to be well taken, although not precisely for the reasons Dolan has argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> {\u00b6 9} To set forth a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, an employee must allege facts demonstrating that the employer\u2019s act of discharging the employee violated a \u201cclear public policy.\u201d <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, paragraph two of the syllabus. The Ohio Supreme Court has adopted an analysis involving four elements in a wrongful-discharge case. The first two elements are (1) that a clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, in a statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the clarity element); and (2) that dismissing employees under circumstances involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element). These two elements involve questions of law. <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 69-70, 652 N.E.2d 653; <em>Chapman v. Adia Services, Inc. </em>(1997), 116 Ohio App.3d 534, 541-542, 688 N.E.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 10} Dolan contends that a clear public policy is embodied in R.C. 3721.10 through R.C. 3721.17, commonly known as the nursing home patients\u2019 bill of rights. See <em>Elder v. Fischer </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 209, 220, 717 N.E.2d 730; <em>Belinky v. Drake Ctr., Inc. </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 497, 503, 690 N.E.2d 1302. These statutes provide that nursing home residents have the right to be free from abuse and to be treated with courtesy and respect. They provide remedies and procedures for those whose rights have been violated and prevent retaliation against those who report a violation of a resident\u2019s rights. Dolan contends that these statutes manifest a clear public policy that encourages the reporting of patient abuse and the protection of those who participate in the reporting of such abuse. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 11} It is the second prong of the test, the jeopardy element, that presents a problem in this case. In arguing that her termination jeopardized the public policy set forth in the patients\u2019 bill of rights, Dolan relies upon <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 677 N.E.2d 308. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court held that Ohio\u2019s whistleblower statute, R.C. 4113.52, does not preempt a common-law cause of action against an employer who discharges or disciplines an employee in violation of that statute, and that the remedies available under R.C. 4113.52 for violations of that statute and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>remedies available for the tort of wrongful discharge are cumulative. Id., paragraphs two and four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio Supreme Court distinguished <em>Kulch </em>and cautioned against reading it broadly in <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, at \u00b6 18-19. In that case, the plaintiff contended that he was wrongfully discharged for exercising his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Section 2601 et seq., Title 19, U.S.Code. While the court agreed that the FMLA expressed a clear public policy in favor of allowing an employee to take medical leave, it held that the jeopardy element was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 13} In analyzing this element, the court stated, \u201cAn analysis of the jeopardy element necessarily involves inquiring into the existence of any alternative means of promoting the particular public policy to be vindicated by a common-law wrongful-discharge claim. * * * Where, as here, the sole source of the public policy opposing the discharge is a statute that provides the substantive right <em>and </em>remedies for its breach, \u2018the issue of adequacy of remedies\u2019 becomes a particularly important component of the jeopardy analysis.\u201d (Emphasis sic; citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 15. It went on to state, \u201cSimply put, there is no need to recognize a common-law action for wrongful discharge if there already exists a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests. * * * In that situation, the public policy expressed in the statute would not be jeopardized by the absence of a common-law wrongful-discharge action in tort because an aggrieved employee has an alternate means of vindicating his or her statutory rights and thereby discouraging an employer from engaging in the unlawful conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 14} The court held that the FMLA contained a comprehensive remedial scheme that \u201cprovides an employee with a meaningful opportunity to place himself or herself in the same position the employee would have been absent the employer\u2019s violation of the FMLA.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17. Thus, an adequate remedy existed, and, therefore, the court refused to recognize a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy based solely on a discharge in violation of the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 15} Dolan relies upon R.C. 3721.17(G), which provides for a fine of up to $1,000 if a nursing home or its employee retaliates against an individual exercising the rights set forth in R.C. 3721.10 to 3721.17. This statute does not provide an adequate remedy and would be inadequate to meet the jeopardy element.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 16} But R.C. 3721.22(A) requires a licensed health professional to report suspected abuse of nursing-home residents to the Ohio Director of Health. R.C. 3721.24(A) provides that \u201c[n]o person or government entity shall retaliate against an employee * * * who, in good faith, makes a report of suspected abuse or neglect of a resident * * *.\u201d R.C. 3721.24(C) provides that \u201c[a]ny person has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>cause of action against any person or government entity for harm resulting from violation of division (A) * * If a court finds that a violation has occurred, it may order injunctive relief and award damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 17} Following the reasoning of <em>Wiles, </em>Dolan has a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests. The public policy embodied in R.C. Chapter 3721 of protecting the rights of nursing-home residents and of others who would report violations of those rights would not be jeopardized in the absence of a common-law wrongful-discharge tort. Consequently, Dolan may not recover in a wrongful-discharge action when the public policy is based on the reporting of abuse in a nursing home. Her remedy lies in an action for retaliatory discharge pursuant to R.C. 3721.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 18} Dolan has appealed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment against her on the fifth count of her complaint. That count contained a claim both for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and for retaliatory discharge under R.C. Chapter 3721. Our review of the record shows that Dolan sufficiently pleaded and argued the issue of retaliatory discharge so that it is now properly before us. .</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 19} To establish a prima facie case for retaliatory discharge under R.C. 3721.24, the employee must show the following: (1) the employee engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employee was the subject of adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action. To meet this test, the employee must show that the activity was protected, that the employer knew about the activity, and that the alleged retaliation followed closely in time to the protected activity. <em>Hoeffel v. Henry Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(Sept. 16, 1996), 3d Dist. No. 7-95-9, 1996 WL 518115, citing <em>Neal v. Hamilton Cty. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 670, 677, 622 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 20} If the employee meets his or her burden to show these elements, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the reason for the discharge was legitimate. If the employer can establish a legitimate reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was pretextual. Id. To avoid summary judgment, the employee must present some evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was untrue. <em>Surry v. Cuyahoga Comm. College, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 528, 2002-Ohio-5356, 778 N.E.2d 91, at \u00b6 24 and \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 21} Dolan presented evidence showing that she had reported Sister Rachel\u2019s patient abuse to Pro Seniors and ultimately to the Department of Health. Sister Rachel knew about Dolan\u2019s involvement with the investigation following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>meeting between Dolan, Sister Rachel, and Sister Ann. Dolan suffered an adverse employment action shortly after that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 22} Dolan' also presented evidence tending to show that the reason for her firing, insubordination for refusing to promise Sister Rachel that she would never contact \u00e1 family member without first contacting Sister Rachel, was a pretext and that the real motivation for her firing was her report regarding patient abuse. Her evidence showed that Sister Rachel was angry about the investigation and sought to punish whoever had made the report. She even went so far as to cut the hours of another employee she had previously thought was the culprit. After the meeting between Sister Rachel, Sister Ann, and Dolan, Sister Rachel was angry and told Dolan, \u201cYou will talk to me about these accusations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 23} Further, the policy on which Sister Rachel relied in discharging Dolan was not in writing. Dolan and other employees of St. Mary\u2019s stated that they had never heard of this policy, that they had often contacted members of residents\u2019 families without Sister Rachel\u2019s knowledge, and that they were not subjected to adverse action. Dolan presented the affidavit of an expert with 15 years of experience in nursing-home administration. The expert stated that he had never heard of a similar policy and that such a policy would prevent nurses from doing their jobs properly and could even be dangerous. He described St. Mary\u2019s policy as \u201cirrational and ill-founded\u201d and stated that it was improper for an administrator to ask a director of nursing to promise never to contact a resident\u2019s family without first contacting the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 24} Consequently, we hold that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether the appellees\u2019 reason for Dolan\u2019s discharge was pretextual and whether Dolan was discharged in retaliation for reporting patient abuse. Reasonable minds could reach different conclusions on those issues, and the appellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Doan v. Southern Ohio Administrative Dist. Counsel, Internatl. Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftworkers </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 482, 488-489, 763 N.E.2d 639; <em>Hoeffel, </em>supra. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in their favor on the issue of retaliatory discharge. See <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293-294, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Stinespring v. Natorp Garden Stores, Inc. </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 213, 215-216, 711 N.E.2d 1104. Accordingly, we sustain Dolan\u2019s first assignment of error, and we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the fifth count of Dolan\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 25} In her second assignment of error, Dolan states that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees on her claim of promissory estoppel. She contends that the evidence showed that she had relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to her detriment on Sister Ann\u2019s promise of protection from retaliation. This assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 26} Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, an employer may be prevented from discharging an employee if the employer has made promises upon which an employee has reasonably relied. <em>Trader v. People Working Cooperatively, Inc. </em>(1994), 104 Ohio App.3d 690, 695, 663 N.E.2d 335; <em>Lehmann v. AAA Cincinnati </em>(Mar. 26, 1999), 1st Dist. No. C-980163, 1999 WL 162151. The test is whether the employer should have reasonably expected its representation to be relied upon by its employee, and, if so, whether the expected action or forbearance actually resulted and was detrimental to the employee. <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150, paragraph three of the syllabus. Praise regarding job performance or discussion of future career development are insufficient to establish promissory estoppel. The statement must be a specific promise of continued employment. <em>Helmick v. Cincinnati Word Processing, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 131, 543 N.E.2d 1212, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Trader, </em>supra, 104 Ohio App.3d at 695, 663 N.E.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 27} Sister Ann acknowledged that she had promised Dolan that she would not allow Sister Rachel to retaliate against her for speaking openly in a meeting to discuss issues raised by the investigation. Dolan was reluctant to speak but agreed to do so because of Sister Ann\u2019s promise. Shortly after the meeting, Sister Rachel fired Dolan. Dolan called Sister Ann and reminded her of her promise to protect her. Sister Ann told her that she was sorry and that she would look into the matter. A short time later, Sister Ann called and confirmed that Dolan was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 28} Thus, Dolan presented evidence of a specific promise on which she had relied in speaking freely in front of Sister Rachel. Consequently, genuine issues of fact existed on the issue of promissory estoppel. Reasonable minds could reach different conclusions on that issue, and the appellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the seventh count of Dolan\u2019s complaint, and we sustain Dolan\u2019s second assignment of error. See <em>Dresher, </em>supra, 15 Ohio St.3d at 293-295, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Helmick, </em>supra, 45 Ohio St.3d at 136-137, 543 N.E.2d 1212; <em>Stinespring, </em>supra, 127 Ohio App.3d at 215-216, 711 N.E.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 29} In sum, we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment entered in favor of the appellees on Dolan\u2019s claims for retaliatory discharge and promissory estoppel. Since she has not raised any assignments of error related to the summary judgment granted in favor of the appellees on her other five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>claims, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in all other respects. We remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-6\">Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
