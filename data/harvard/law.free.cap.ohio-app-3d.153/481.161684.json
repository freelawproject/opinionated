The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 2} On February 24, 2001, appellee Wilson was injured in a car-pedestrian accident as he walked out of a bar in Zanesville, Ohio. At the time of the accident, Wilson\u2019s wife, Serena Wilson, was employed by Buckeye Motor Lodge. Buckeye held a commercial auto policy and a commercial umbrella policy issued by Selective. The policy period for both policies ran from June 1, 2000, to June 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 3} The driver of the vehicle involved in the accident was Todd Wolfe. Wilson thereafter sued Wolfe in a separate action in Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas. In the case sub judice, Selective filed a declaratory judgment action on June 8, 2001, seeking a ruling that Wilson had no right to uninsured and/or underinsured motorist coverage. Selective filed a motion for summary judgment on August 2, 2001. On February 4, 2002, Wilson filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted this cross-motion on March 20, 2002, finding that Wilson was entitled to coverage under both the commercial auto and commercial umbrella policies. Selective\u2019s motion for summary judgment was simultaneously denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant timely appealed therefrom and herein raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. Defendant-appellee, Eddie Wilson, is not an \u2018insured\u2019 under the commercial auto/UIM policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cII. Defendant-appellee, Eddie Wilson, is not an \u2018insured\u2019 under the commercial umbrella liability policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 7} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. As such, we must refer to Civ.R. 56, which provides: \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to the above rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence that demonstrates that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264. See, also, <em>Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 292, 725 N.E.2d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 9} We will apply the aforesaid standard of review to both assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 10} In its first assignment of error, Selective contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Wilson, on the grounds that Wilson was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the commercial auto policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, the Ohio Supreme Court found a corporation\u2019s employees to be insureds and therefore entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>commercial automobile liability policy that designated the corporation as the named insured and that defined \u201cinsured\u201d to include \u201cyou\u201d and \u201c[i]f you are an individual, any family member.\u201d The court therein stated that \u201cuninsured motorist coverage, mandated by law pursuant to R.C. 3937.18, was designed by the General Assembly to protect persons, not vehicles.\u201d Id. at 664, 710 N.E.2d 1116, citing <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group, Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 639 N.E.2d 438, paragraph one of the syllabus. The court reasoned that it would be meaningless to limit protection solely to a corporate entity which cannot occupy or operate a motor vehicle or suffer bodily injury or death. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court thus concluded that the term \u201cyou,\u201d while referring to plaintiffs decedent\u2019s employer, also included the employees, since a corporation can act only by and through live persons. Id. at 666, 710 N.E.2d 1116. In the later case of <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 N.E.2d 1142, the Ohio Supreme Court found that the insurance policy in question afforded underinsured motorist coverage for bodily injury to a family member of an insured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 12} In the case sub judice, Selective\u2019s commercial auto policy at issue includes a UIM endorsement containing the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cB. Who is An Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c1. If the Named Insured is designated in the Declarations as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201ca. An individual, then the following are \u2018insureds\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201c(1) The Named Insured and any \u2018family member\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c(2) Anyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substituid for a covered \u2018auto\u2019. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">\u201cb. A partnership,. limited liability company, corporation or any other form of organization, then the following are \u2018insureds\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">\u201c(1) Anyone \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto\u2019. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">\u201c(2) Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by another \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant notes that the aforesaid provision does not utilize the term \u201cyou\u201d as did the insurance contract at issue in <em>Scott-Pontzer. </em>Appellant thus argues that the trial court misinterpreted <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>and <em>Ezawa </em>by deeming the terms \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cnamed insured\u201d as ambiguous. We recently addressed a virtually identical \u201cWho is An Insured\u201d policy provision in <em>Egelton v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>Stark App. No. 2002CA00157, 2002-Ohio-6176, 2002 WL 31521528.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that case, the plaintiff was injured when a car crashed into a restaurant in which he was standing. Plaintiff was employed by a company insured under a commercial automobile policy issued by United States Fire Insurance Company. The named insured listed in the common policy declarations page was plaintiffs employer, \u201cGo Jo Industries,\u201d a corporation. In light of the \u201cWho is An Insured\u201d policy provision, after reviewing the schedule of covered autos under the business auto policy, we concluded that plaintiff was not occupying a covered auto at the time of the accident; therefore, plaintiff was not an insured under U.S. Fire\u2019s policy. We therefore found that the trial court erred in finding coverage under the policy and granting summary judgment to plaintiff. Id. at 5; see, also, Price <em>v. Ayers, </em>Stark App. No. 2002CA00124, 2002-Ohio-5479, 2002 WL 31260062.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the case sub judice, the commercial policy common declaration page lists the named insured as \u201cBuckeye Motor Lodge Inc[.] dba Holiday Inn of Zanesville.\u201d The named insured is further identified as a corporation. Applying our reasoning in <em>Egelton, </em>we look to paragraph B(1)(b) of the aforecited \u201cWho is An Insured\u201d provision of Selective\u2019s commercial auto policy\u2019s UIM endorsement. Clearly, paragraph B1)(b)(1) is inapplicable, as Wilson was a pedestrian. Further, as Wilson does not present a consortium claim arising from bodily injury to another insured, paragraph B(1)(b)(2) is also inapplicable. We therefore find that reasonable minds could only conclude that Wilson was not an insured under Selective\u2019s policy, the language of which removes the underlying ambiguity found in <em>Scott-Pontzer. </em>See, also, <em>Alexander v. Seward, </em>Ross App. No. 02CA2658, 2002-Ohio-6348, 2002 WL 31630842.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 15} Wilson argues in response to appellant Selective\u2019s position that the \u201cWho is An Insured\u201d provision at issue is violative of R.C. 3937.18, as written at the time of the accident in question, and is likewise contrary to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Martin v. Midwestern, </em>supra. In <em>Martin, </em>the court held that \u201c[a]n automobile liability insurance policy provision which eliminates uninsured motorist coverage for persons insured thereunder who are injured while occupy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ing a motor vehicle owned by an insured, but not specifically listed in the policy, violates R.C. 3937.18 and is therefore invalid.\u201d Id., paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>Martin </em>thus stands for the proposition that UIM coverage cannot be taken from an insured while occupying a vehicle owned by the insured but not listed in the policy. However, we find that Selective\u2019s policy provision in the case sub judice neither \u201celiminates\u201d UIM coverage respecting Wilson nor acts as an illegal exclusion. Ohio law recognizes a distinction between an <em>exclusion </em>from coverage under the liability portion of an insurance policy and a <em>condition </em>for coverage. See <em>Luckenbill v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 501, 506, 758 N.E.2d 301. We find <em>Martin </em>inapplicable to the facts of the case sub judice, as Wilson failed to establish that he is an insured under the Selective policy. Accord Woods <em>v. Owners Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 1, 2000), Ross App. No, 99CA2486, at 7, 2000 WL 133850: \u201cIn this case, [plaintiff] Woods is not covered under the Policy\u2019s uninsured motorist clause because he is not an insured under the Policy. The denial is not based on a vehicle exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 16} We therefore find error in the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Wilson, and in the denial of summary judgment in favor of Selective, regarding the commercial auto policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 18} In its second assignment of error, Selective contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Wilson, on the grounds that Wilson was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the commercial umbrella policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 19} Former R.C. 3937.18(L)(2) includes in the definition of an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance \u201c[a]ny umbrella liability policy of insurance written as excess over one or more policies described in division (L)(l) of this section.\u201d A right to UIM coverage under an umbrella policy flows directly from the right to coverage under an auto policy. See, e.g., <em>Jump v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Nov. 2, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 18880, 2001 WL 1345954. A review of the \u201cWho is an Insured\u201d section of the Selective Umbrella Policy reveals that Wilson does not qualify as an \u201cinsured\u201d under any of the categories listed. Moreover, even if an ambiguity were found to exist, in the absence of any extended or \u201cfamily member\u201d policy language as per <em>Ezawa, </em>supra, coverage would be limited to Wilson\u2019s wife, Serena, who was the actual employee of Selective\u2019s insured. Therefore, Wilson\u2019s claim for umbrella coverage should also have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>{\u00b6 20} We hold that the trial court erred in granting of summary judgment in favor of Wilson and in denying summary judgment in favor of Selective, regarding the commercial umbrella liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 22} For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Muskingum County, Ohio, is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-8\">Gwin, P.J., and Edwards, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-15\">. {\u00b6 a} The policy provision in <em>Egelton </em>read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-16\">{V b} \"1.
