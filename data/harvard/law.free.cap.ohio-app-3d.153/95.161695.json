Painter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 1} A public utility backbilled its customer for unmetered gas consumption over a 23-month period. The need to backbill was caused by the public utility\u2019s mistakes. We are asked to decide whether the public utility met its burden of proof as to the amount of the bill, whether the public utility\u2019s customer could assert the equitable-defenses of laches and estoppel to preclude its obligation to pay for the unmetered services it received, and whether these issues fell under the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. We conclude that the public utility demonstrated the amount of unmetered gas used, that application of laches or estoppel to preclude payment of the utility bill would violate public policy, and that the defenses raised by the customer fell under the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. We also conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict as to the amount owed for the unmetered consumption of 144,479 CCF of gas was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company (\u201cCG&amp;E\u201d), sued appellant, Joseph Chevrolet Company (\u201cJoseph\u201d), seeking $79,549.38 for unmetered gas consumption from March 5, 1996, through February 19, 1998. Both parties filed summary-judgment motions, which the trial court denied. CG&amp;E argued in its motion that the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d) had exclusive jurisdiction over any matter that Joseph could assert as an affirmative defense, in particular CG&amp;E\u2019s failure to monitor its equipment, the correctness of CG&amp;E\u2019s bill for unmetered usage, and Joseph\u2019s liability for the usage. In its summary-judgment motion, Joseph contended that CG&amp;E was precluded from collecting the unpaid balance because of laches, estoppel, and CG&amp;E\u2019s inability to prove the amount of unmetered gas consumption. In its motion to reconsider the denial of summary judgment, CG&amp;E also asked the trial court to stay the proceedings and to instruct Joseph to file a complaint with PUCO. The trial court denied the motion, and the case went to trial. A jury found for CG&amp;E and awarded $79,549.38 in damages. Joseph moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, or a remittitur. The trial court denied Joseph\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">I. CG&amp;E\u2019s Mistakes Result in Backbilling Joseph for Gas Usage</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">A. A Tight-and-Tally Inspection</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 3} Joseph, a Chevrolet dealership, occupied two buildings, each separately metered and billed by CG&amp;E. The meter at issue was installed on June 5, 1995, and was connected to Joseph\u2019s work facility and body repair shop. The meter registered no gas usage for June and July 1995. On January 4, 1996, CG&amp;E measured gas usage of 35,761 CCF. (CCF represents 100 cubic feet of gas.) The next meter reading, taken on March 5, 1996, indicated gas usage of 33,885 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>CCF. A CG&amp;E employee noticed that the meter was reading backwards and requested a \u201ctight and tally\u201d inspection. The tight-and-tally inspection took place on March 8, 1996, and the inspector reported that the meter was tight and tally. This inspection entailed a visual examination of the meter to determine whether the hands on the dials were tight and properly moving, but CG&amp;E did not inspect the meter to determine whether it was correctly measuring gas usage. The meter also passed an unidentified test in April 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">B. Continued Unmetered Gas Usage</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 4} For the next several months, the gas usage recorded by the meter was in either single or double digits. Consumption for December 1997, January 1998, and February 1998 was registered at zero. During that time, CG&amp;E billed Joseph for the reflected gas usage, and Joseph paid its bills. In February 1998, CG&amp;E issued another work file on the meter. That same month, CG&amp;E replaced the meter, concluding that It was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">C. CG&amp;E Loses Track of Joseph\u2019s Account</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 5} Joseph\u2019s account should have been forwarded to CG&amp;E\u2019s revenue-protection group for rebilling. Because of a merger and resulting internal confusion, the account was not forwarded. Sometime in January 1999, CG&amp;E discovered that mistake and on February 11, 1999, Thomas Jump, a CG&amp;E billing analyst, sent notice to Joseph that it would be billed for unmetered gas consumption from March 5, 1996, through February 19, 1998. The notice requested that Joseph contact Jump if it had any questions concerning the billing. Joseph did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">D. The Necessity of a Rebilling by a Public Utility</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 6} Jump testified that rebilling was necessary because CG&amp;E was a regulated industry, and because PUCO encouraged it to keep its rates as low as possible. According to Jump, if a customer that had used unmetered gas did not reimburse CG&amp;E, the lost amount would be rolled into the rates and \u201ceveryone [would have] to pay for it.\u201d CG&amp;E\u2019s Gas Service Regulations filed with PUCO (PUCO Gas No. 18, Sheet Nos. 23.4 and 24.5) provided that nonreceipt of bills did not affect a customer\u2019s obligation for payment and that undercharges could be computed on the basis of a consumer\u2019s prior or later use \u201cin accordance with the rates in effect during the period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">E. Estimating Unmetered Gas Usage</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 7} Jump estimated Joseph\u2019s unmetered gas usage for the period of March 1996 to February 19, 1998, by using a sample period from February 1998 to February 1999. (He used subsequent usage and not prior usage because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>subsequent usage was more readily available to him and because the previous meter\u2019s malfunctioning made prior readings suspect.) He used heating degree-days (an accepted industry method for estimating usage that takes into account temperature fluctuations) for the sample period plus the amount of gas used during the sample period and compared those figures with the degree-days when the meter was not registering. That provided Jump with an estimate of usage over a period of time based on Joseph\u2019s usage patterns and the degree-days. Jump estimated a usage of 144,479 CCF. Jump testified that the rates for gas in effect from 1996 to 1998 were applied to the estimated usage. After giving Joseph a credit of $3,220.82, the amount Joseph had paid for the applicable period, CG&amp;E billed Joseph $79,549.38. Eighteen months after sending the notice letter, CG&amp;E sued Joseph to collect for the unpaid usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">II. Joseph\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 8} Joseph did not argue below that it had not consumed the gas, only that CG&amp;E could not prove the amount of gas that it had used during the unmetered period. It also argued that it should be relieved from its payment obligation under the common law doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel because of CG&amp;E\u2019s negligence in failing to maintain and to monitor the gas meter, failing to notify Joseph that the meter was malfunctioning, and failing to timely bill it for unmetered gas consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 9} In its appeal Joseph raises three assignments of error. It contends that the trial court erred by (1) failing to grant it a directed verdict, (2) refusing to instruct the jury on laches and estoppel, and (3) failing to grant it judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 10} Although we ultimately determine that Joseph is entitled to a new trial because the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, we address Joseph\u2019s first and third assignments because they raise sufficiency issues. We also address Joseph\u2019s second assignment because the issue is likely to reappear during the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">III. CG&amp;E\u2019s Cross-Assignments</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 11} CG&amp;E raises three cross-assignments under App.R. 3(C)(2). It contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant its summary judgment motion. It also contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant its motion for a directed verdict at the end of its case-in-chief. Last, CG&amp;E argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant its motion for directed verdict after the presentation of all the evidence. CG&amp;E\u2019s arguments in support of its cross-assignments challenge the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction over Joseph\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>{\u00b6 12} App.R. 3(C)(2) allows an appellee to support the trial court\u2019s judgment on grounds that the trial court rejected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under App.R. 3(C)(2) and R.C. 2505.22, we may consider cross-assignments only if we have otherwise determined to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An assignment of error brought without a notice of appeal \u201cmay be used by the appellee as a shield to protect the judgment of the lower court but may not be used by the appellee as a sword to destroy or modify that judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We address the cross-assignments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">IV. Joseph\u2019s Motions for Directed Verdict and Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict Were Properly Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 13} Joseph\u2019s first two assignments challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of its motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We review a ruling on either motion under the same standard. Both motions present a question of law by challenging the sufficiency of the evidence; thus, they are reviewed de novo. Accordingly, \u201c[wjhere there is substantial competent evidence favoring the nonmoving party so that reasonable minds might reach different conclusions,\u201d motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and directed verdict must be denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the common standard of review applies to different stages in the trial proceedings, we address Joseph\u2019s first and third assignments before we address its second assignment. Because our ultimate disposition is based on the facts addressed in Joseph\u2019s first assignment, we address Joseph\u2019s third assignment first.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A. Joseph\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 14} In its third assignment, Joseph argues that it was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the usage number indicated on the invoice was attributed to the period from March 5, 1996, through March 5, 1998, thus erroneously including 14 additional days after the installation of the new meter. But the evidence before the jury also included testimony as to how CG&amp;E calculated the usage and how the calculation was limited to the period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>March 1996 to February 1998. Further, CG&amp;E\u2019s Exhibit 14 provided that although the rebill dates were March 5, 1996, through March 5, 1998, Joseph\u2019s gas usage was actually calculated for the period from March 6, 1996, through February 18, 1998, and that the amount used during that time equaled 14,4479 CCF. Thus, there was substantial, competent evidence supporting a finding for CG&amp;E, the nonmoving party, upon which reasonable minds could reach different conclusions. We overrule Joseph\u2019s third assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">B. Joseph\u2019s Motion for Directed Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 15} In support of its first assignment, Joseph contends that there was no evidence of the rates in effect for the gas it allegedly used during the applicable period. The parties placed in evidence the bills received by Joseph for the applicable period, which contained the rates for those months. We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that there was evidence sufficient to defeat Joseph\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. We find no merit in Joseph\u2019s first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 16} We acknowledge that the rates applied by CG&amp;E to the amount of unbilled usage were set as a matter of law for the applicable periods of time. The legislature has determined that public utilities must be highly regulated and has set forth the framework of that regulation in R.C. Title 49. The rates charged to a public utility\u2019s customers are fixed. PUCO has authority to administer and enforce the provisions of R.C. Title 49, and under R.C. 4905.30 \u201cevery public utility in the state is required to apply for PUCO approval of tariff schedules that detail the rates, charges, and classifications of their services.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This requirement exemplifies what is known as the filed-rate doctrine, which, under R.C. 4905.33, \u201cmandates that a public utility must charge the tariff rates approved by the PUCO,\u201d unless permitted otherwise under PUCO\u2019s supervision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, \u201ca utility has no option but to collect the rates set by the commission and is clearly forbidden to refund any part of the rates so collected.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rates published with PUCO are the lawful rates until the Ohio Supreme Court sets them aside as being unreasonable or unlawful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>C. The Jury\u2019s Verdict Was Against the Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">{\u00b6 18} But that does not end our analysis. Although the trial court properly denied Joseph\u2019s motions, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence on the issue of the amount owed by Joseph. Accordingly, Joseph should have been granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 19} While App.R. 12(A) states that we need only address errors raised and briefed, \u201cnothing prevents a Court of Appeals from passing upon an error which was neither briefed nor pointed out by a party.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When this occurs, \u201cfactual conclusions reached by a Court of Appeals must be based upon evidence in the record.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are not precluded from considering \u201csuch issues in the interest of justice that have not been raised by the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While fairness generally dictates that we give the parties an opportunity to brief the issue, we believe that the opportunity is unnecessary in this case. The record that was before the trier of fact is before us. There is nothing new that the parties can add. In reviewing the record, we have determined that the verdict is not supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While CG&amp;E offered evidence concerning the gas usage, the evidence of the rates was unclear at best. Thus, we reverse the judgment against Joseph and remand for a new trial on the amount of money Joseph owes CG&amp;E for unmetered gas usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">V. The Doctrines of Laches and Estoppel Are Inapplicable to a Public Utility</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 20} In its second assignment, Joseph challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury on the doctrines of estoppel and laches. Jury instructions are proper if they correctly state the law as applied to the facts of the case and if \u201creasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 21} Joseph was not entitled to its requested instructions because the doctrines are inapplicable to public utilities as a matter of law. Application of estoppel and laches would violate a universal public policy of equal treatment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>public utility\u2019s customers. Support for our conclusion is found in the conclusions of a majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue, two Ohio cases, and Ohio\u2019s statutory prohibition against price discrimination by a public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A. Other Jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 22} Other jurisdictions have considered whether a consumer of a public utility\u2019s service can assert the defense of equitable estoppel or laches to preclude the utility from collecting the full amount due when the consumer has been underbilled. The majority of courts have held that their public-utility laws forbid the use of common-law defenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They have concluded that the public policy of maintaining equality among consumers without preferential privileges \u201c \u2018super-cedes the ordinary doctrine of estoppel [or laches], so far as that would interfere with the accomplishment of the dominant purpose of the act. It does not permit the inequality of rates to arise indirectly through the application of estoppel, which it was the aim of the act to suppress directly.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, where a statute requires a public utility to charge similarly situated customers according to a standard rate schedule, it contravenes public policy to preclude a public utility from collecting the full amount due for its services, even where the public utility has negligently underbilled its customer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 23} As explained by one commentator, \u201cThe general utility rule provides that in instances of mistaken underbilling by a public utility, the erring company holds not only the right, but the obligation, to collect the underpayment. Neither the reason for the underbilling nor the impact on the customer will mitigate the effect on the operation of this rule. In refusing to rely on mistake and estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in the underbilling context, most courts reason that invoking equitable estoppel [or laches] against a public utility would violate the strong public policy against discriminatory rates. * * * Courts will not consider a utility\u2019s responsibility for an underbilling when determining whether the utility may collect an additional amount due from a customer. Neither negligence nor willful misrepresentation relieves the utility of the right or the responsibility to collect the rates established by the tariff. A tariff is legislative in character. Once approved by a state public utility commission, it possesses the same binding effect as a statute. Accordingly, rates are mandatory; a utility has no discretion to change them unless the change is presented to and approved by the regulatory commission.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">B. Ohio Support</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 24} Ohio\u2019s public-utility statutes clearly set forth a public policy that public utilities cannot discriminate among their customers. A public utility must file its rate schedules with PUCO.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The public utility is forbidden to collect a different rate than that specified in the schedules.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, a public utility cannot directly or indirectly collect less from customers in like circumstances, for like or substantially similar services.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is to prevent a public utility from using its monopoly power \u201cto force higher rates on some customers in order to subsidize lower rates given to other, more favored customers.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The policy against discrimination is maintained even where a customer may not have the means to pay the rate. Where a public utility\u2019s low-income customer participates in a Percentage of Income Payment Plan (PIP) that allows a percentage of the customer\u2019s income to be paid for services in lieu of the regular monthly charges, the plan does not preclude a suit by the utility for any outstanding arrearages.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the plan \u201c \u2018does not constitute free service or a rebate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Allowing a customer to pay less because of a malfunctioning meter results in the public utility\u2019s service not being supplied \u201cunder a given rate structure\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> because the customer with the malfunctioning meter is paying less than a customer with a properly working meter for the same amount of gas. Accordingly, Ohio has determined that the practice of backbilling for gas used during the time a meter has failed to adequately measure consumption is not improper.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The legislature, while limiting backbilling of residential customers to 365 days immediately prior to the date the utility remedies the meter inaccuracy,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> has placed no similar limitation on nonresidential meter inaccuracies. Nor do CG&amp;E\u2019s regulations supply one.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 26} The Ohio Supreme Court has explained that any unfairness for backbill-ing \u201crelate[s] to the public served by the utility, and not just to the customers being backbilled.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It has held that in the absence of statutory authority, there can be no one-year limitation on backbilling based on the public utility\u2019s negligent failure to discover a defective metering of consumption.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This is because \u201c[pjublic utilities are not like private corporations.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If the utility is limited, the cost of the unbilled service is spread \u201cto all the utility\u2019s customers, rather than to the customers who actually used the service the utility provided. The parties at fault do not pay, the public does.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 27} The Ohio Supreme Court recognized this policy in 1920 when it determined that PUCO was without jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of a contract between a customer and a utility company where the customer sought a rate different than the scheduled rate. The court concluded that to allow the consumer to be charged at less than the scheduled rate would constitute discrimination in contravention of the express provisions of the public-utility statutes.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Our court recognized this policy in 1929 and held that an action for reparations against a public carrier was not allowable. We concluded that the claim was nothing more than an indirect attempt to compel the carrier to charge less for its service than what was specified by its rate schedule. We determined that to allow a lesser charge violated the statute that forbade a railroad to charge more or less compensation than that specified in its rate schedule.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 29} We sympathize with the situation of a business being \u201csandbagged\u201d by a large unforeseen bill. But to allow Joseph to assert equitable estoppel or laches would allow it to relieve itself of the obligation to pay for the gas it consumed, thus permitting it to pay less for the same service than other customers had paid during the same time. This would be in direct contravention of the public policy embodied in the public-utility statutes. The legislature is aware of undercharging due to metering inaccuracy under the utility\u2019s control.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It has determined that only residential customers are entitled to some protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 30} This is one of those situations where absolute equity must \u201cgive way to the greater overall good. In adopting a comprehensive scheme of public utility rate regulation the Legislature has found it impossible to do absolute justice under all circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The trial court correctly refused to charge the jury on estoppel and laches. We overrule Joseph\u2019s second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">VI. Cross-Assignments: PUCO Does Not Have Exclusive Jurisdiction over Joseph\u2019s Defenses</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 31} CG&amp;E\u2019s three cross-assignments raise subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While a cross-assignment may not be a proper means by which to raise the issue in this case, the issue itself can be raised at anytime.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 32} PUCO does have exclusive jurisdiction over the majority of issues involving a public utility.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In fact, R.C. 4905.26 expressly confers jurisdiction on PUCO to review certain complaints by \u201cany person, firm, or corporation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>against a public utility. But PUCO does not have exclusive jurisdiction to decide complaints filed by a public utility against its customers.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction over CG&amp;E\u2019s claim against Joseph for the unpaid gas usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 33} In contrast, \u201c[t]he General Assembly has provided a rather specific procedure by which customers may challenge rates or charges of a public utility that are \u2018in any respect\u2019 unjust, unreasonable, or unlawful, and has designated the commission as the appropriate forum before which such claims are to be heard.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus PUCO has exclusive jurisdiction over claims concerning the charges and services of a public utility.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 34} Whether PUCO has exclusive jurisdiction depends on whether we characterize the defenses asserted by Joseph as claims of unjust or unreasonable rates or services. Joseph did not file a counterclaim asserting that CG&amp;E\u2019s rates or services were unjust or unreasonable or inadequate. Instead, it asserted the defenses of equitable estoppel and laches and questioned CG&amp;E\u2019s ability to prove usage in order to avoid CG&amp;E\u2019s claim for the amount owed. If Joseph had filed a counterclaim challenging the reasonableness, adequacy, or justness of the rates CG&amp;E had charged or of the services it had provided, PUCO would have been the proper forum. Because Joseph\u2019s defenses were common-law defenses (even though we find them inapplicable here) that challenged rates or services, we find no merit in CG&amp;E\u2019s contention that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Joseph\u2019s defenses. We overrule CG&amp;E\u2019s cross-assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 35} Thus, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for a new trial on the issue of the amount of money Joseph owes CG&amp;E for the unmetered gas it used.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-9\">Sundermann, P.J., and Winkler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">.
