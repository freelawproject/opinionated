On January 13, 1999, Remer was scheduled to begin her 2:00 p.m. shift at Kroger. There was snow and freezing rain that day and the temperature was approximately six degrees Fahrenheit. Remer arrived for work nearly 20 minutes before the start of her shift. At the time, Kroger had a policy that prohibited employees from clocking into work more than eight minutes before their scheduled shift. Finding that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>was too early to clock in, Remer decided to return to her car to go to the bank. While leaving, Remer slipped and fell on ice on the cart ramp at the store entrance, fracturing her left patella.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 3} Remer filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which the district hearing officer allowed. This decision was vacated by the staff hearing officer on August 24, 2000. The Industrial Commission refused further review on September 19, 2000, and Remer filed an appeal with the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas on October 13, 2000. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by the parties. The trial court found that Remer was within the zone of her employment at the time of her injury and therefore was entitled to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{114} Kroger sets forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee Joyce Remer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying appellant The Kroger Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment when the undisputed material facts establish Ms. Remer\u2019s fall did not occur in the course of her employment with The Kroger Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 6} A review of the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is de novo, and, thus, we apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment will be granted only when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C). The burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists falls upon the party who moves for summary judgment. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 294, 662 N.E.2d 264. However, once the movant supports his or her motion with appropriate evidentiary materials, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 111, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 7} This appeal turns on whether Remer was injured while in the course of her employment. An employee is entitled to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund if the employee sustains an injury, \u201cwhether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). The alleged injury must satisfy both elements: \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271. The phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d is used to determine whether the required nexus between the employment relationship and the injurious activity exists and involves the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Ruckman v. Cubby Drilling, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 117, 120, 689 N.E.2d 917. \u201cThe arising out of\u2019 element contemplates a causal connection between the injury and the employment. Id. at 121-122, 689 N.E.2d 917, citing <em>Fisher, </em>supra, at 277-278, 551 N.E.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 8} A \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test was created to determine whether in a particular case there is a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the employment to justify participation in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96. The test requires an analysis of the \u201cfacts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 9} Kroger argues first that, while Remer may have been on its property, she was not performing an act required by employment and therefore was not in the course of her employment at the time of her injury. In support of this \u201cno benefit\u201d argument that Remer was not acting within the course of her employment, Kroger relies on <em>Indus. Comm. v. Ahem </em>(1928), 119 Ohio St. 41, 162 N.E. 272. In <em>Ahern, </em>the claimant was employed as a saleslady on the first floor of a department store. A store policy permitted employees to go to other departments before 10:00 a.m. to purchase items for their personal use. Ahem had left the first floor to go to the rug department on the fourth floor to buy a rug. As she was inspecting a rug, it slipped from under her, causing her to fall backwards. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected Ahern\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation, stating that \u201cin the course of employment\u201d means \u201can injury sustained in the performance of some required act done directly or indirectly in the service of the employer.\u201d <em>Ahern, </em>119 Ohio St. at 45, 162 N.E. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 10} Since <em>Ahern, </em>decided over 70 years ago, the Ohio Supreme Court has altered the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d definition. Specifically, compensation has been broadened to include employees injured within the \u201czone of employment\u201d or those injured while participating in an employer-sponsored event. See <em>Kohlmayer v. Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 10, 53 O.O.2d 6, 263 N.E.2d 231. The \u201czone of employment\u201d rule concentrates on the location of the employee at the time of the injury and is an exception to the coming-and-going rule, which generally precludes compensation for employees injured while traveling to and from a fixed work situs. The term was defined in <em>Merz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1938), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>134 Ohio St. 36, 39, 11 O.O. 414, 15 N.E.2d 632, as \u201cthe place of employment and the area thereabout, including the means of ingress thereto and egress therefrom, under control of the employer.\u201d In <em>Marlow v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 18, 23, 39 O.O.2d 11, 225 N.E.2d 241, the Ohio Supreme Court examined the line of zone-of-employment cases and specifically declined to overrule them in favor of a general proposition that compensation is authorized only for injuries sustained while employees perform some act or duty in the service of the employer. As a result, an injured employee need not be performing job duties for the injury to be \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d Id. See, also, <em>Sebek v. Cleveland Graphite Bronze Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 693, 698, 36 O.O. 282, 76 N.E.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 11} Kroger argues next that the zone-of-employment exception does not apply because of the timing of Renter\u2019s injury: she was not leaving after completing a work day. The \u201czone of employment\u201d rule, however, has been applied before, during, and after an employee\u2019s work hours. See <em>Indus. Comm. v. Henry </em>(1932), 124 Ohio St. 616, 180 N.E. 194 (claim allowed for employee killed on railroad tracks adjacent to employer\u2019s premises while returning to work after meal); <em>Thompson v. Crestmont Nursing Home N. Corp. </em>(Nov. 21, 2001), 8th Dist. No. 79385, 2001 WL 1479238 (claim allowed for employee attacked by co-worker in front of nursing home before starting shift); <em>Rock v. Parma Bd. of Edn. </em>(Nov. 1, 2001), 8th Dist. No. 79268, 2001 WL 1353247 (claim allowed for employee who slipped and fell in parking lot upon return from a personal errand and before clocking in).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 12} Along with at least an indirect benefit to an employer, the critical issue appears to be the location of the employee\u2019s injury. In this case, it is undisputed that Remer was injured on the cart ramp at the entrance to the Kroger store, an area Kroger owned and controlled. Therefore, Remer was injured within the \u201czone of employment.\u201d She came to the Kroger store to start her work shift but did not actually clock into work upon her arrival because Kroger\u2019s policy prohibited employees from clocking in more than eight minutes before their shift.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Remer was not violating any conditions of her employment when she was injured. She was complying with company policy by waiting to clock in. An injury occurs in the course of, and arises out of, the employment if the injury follows as a natural incident of the work and as a result of exposure occasioned by the nature, conditions, and surroundings of the employment. <em>Sebek, </em>148 Ohio St. at 697-698, 36 O.O. 282, 76 N.E.2d 892. Thus, we conclude that Remer was in the course of her employment at the time of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Kroger finally argues that even if Remer was in the course of employment at the time of her injury, she deviated from the course of her employment when she left the store to run a personal errand. On this point, we look to the place where her injury occurred and agree with the reasoning expressed in <em>Lemming v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 194, 534 N.E.2d 1226. In <em>Lemming, </em>the claimant left the university building where she worked to run an errand during her morning break. While walking to her car but while still on her employer\u2019s property, Lemming was hit by an automated traffic gate. The First Appellate District, in ruling for Lemming, stated, \u201c[W]e do not believe that intention [to leave the premises] would become a determinative factor until after she actually passed beyond the perimeter of the campus.\u201d Thus, since the claimant was still on her employer\u2019s premises when she was injured, she was within the zone of employment and entitled to compensation. In this case, Remer was still on Kroger\u2019s property when she slipped and fell. While it may have been her intention to leave, Remer had not yet deviated from the course of employment when the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 14} By any measure, Remer\u2019s injury occurred within the course of her employment, entitling her to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund. Kroger\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken, and, thus, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Mark L. Pietrykowski, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b542-8\">Peter M. Handwork, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">.
