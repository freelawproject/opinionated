Miller, guilty of failure to comply with the lawful order of a police officer, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(A), a misdemeanor of the first degree, and guilty of operating a commercial vehicle in violation of an out-of-service order, in violation of R.C. 4506.04(A)(2), a misdemeanor of the first degree. The trial court additionally found appellant guilty of operating a vehicle without displaying a 2002 IFTA sticker, in violation of R.C. 5728.02, a minor misdemeanor. Appellant was sentenced to 180 days in jail on each of his convictions as to R.C. 2921.331 and R.C. 4506.04, to be run concurrently, 165 days of which were suspended, and he was fined $500 as to each count. Appellant was also ordered to pay a fine of $100 with respect to his failure to display an IFTA sticker. Appellant was placed on probation for 36 months. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reyerse in part appellant\u2019s convictions and the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Appellant\u2019s convictions arose as a result of a commercial vehicle inspection, which occurred on February 28, 2002, and was conducted by Motor Carrier Enforcement Inspector Harold A. Emnett, who was with the State Highway Patrol and Department of Public Safety. Appellant was driving a tractor-trailer combination, with two trailers, when he was stopped for a safety inspection in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot on Dutch Road in Lucas County, Ohio. Eventually, appellant was arrested, and the truck and trailers were towed by VJ\u2019s Towing to VJ\u2019s storage lot in Perrysburg, Ohio. Emnett ultimately placed appellant\u2019s tractor-trailer out of service due to the load\u2019s not being properly secured. Additionally, appellant was given citations by the Ohio State Highway Patrol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>(\u201cHighway Patrol\u201d) for gross overload of a motor vehicle and for failing to display a 2002 IFTA sticker. Despite these violations, and without making the repairs necessary to bring his truck into compliance, appellant allegedly drove his truck off VJ\u2019s lot in Wood County, Ohio, and onto State Route 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant appeals his convictions and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c1. The trial court committed prejudicial error by overruling the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c2. The trial court committed prejudicial error by overruling appellant\u2019s Rule 29 directed to the \u2018out of service order.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA. The state failed to prove a prima facie case that MCEI Emnett possessed the authority to issue an \u2018out of service\u2019 order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cB. The state failed to prove a prima facie case that MCEI Emnett issued a lawful \u2018out of service\u2019 order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c3. The trial court committed prejudicial error by overruling appellant\u2019s Rule 29 motion as to the \u2018failure to comply\u2019 charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c4. The trial court committed prejudicial error by not granting appellant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars and precluded appellant from demonstrating that the prosecution of appellant for a violation of ORC \u00a7 2923.331 [sic, 2921.331] was an unlawful attempt to impose multiple convictions for the same conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c5. Convicting appellant of violating both ORC \u00a7 2923.331 [sic, 2921.331] and ORC \u00a7 4506.04 is unlawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c6. The trial court committed prejudicial error in overruling the appellant\u2019s Rule 29 motion as to the IFTA sticker charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c7. The trial court committed prejudicial error by admitting State\u2019s Exhibit 16 (the VHS recording of the events following the traffic stop).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error concerns his motion to suppress, which was denied by the trial court. Appellant argues that the stop of his vehicle and its removal to Wood County violated his Fourth Amendment rights. With respect to the stop, appellant argues that it was unconstitutional insofar as it was not authorized by Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-13. Appellant further argues that the warrantless inspections allowed by R.C. 5503.34 and Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-13 are unconstitutional because the discretion of the inspectors is not limited with respect to \u201ctime, place, and scope,\u201d as required by <em>Neiv York v. Burger </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 691, 702, 107 S.Ct. 2636, 96 L.Ed.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">{\u00b6 14} When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of the trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>and evaluate the credibility of a witness. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 105, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583. This court is bound to accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Davis </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 114, 117, 726 N.E.2d 1092. Applying those facts, we must then independently determine as a matter of law whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard. <em>State v. Klein </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 488, 597 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 5503.34 provides, in part, that \u201c[uniformed employees of the commercial motor vehicle safety enforcement unit may stop commercial motor vehicles for the exclusive purpose of inspecting such vehicles to enforce compliance with orders and rules of the public utilities commission * * The United States Supreme Court, however, has held, in part, that a statute providing for warrantless searches must limit the discretion of the inspecting officers in \u201ctime, place, and scope.\u201d <em>New York v. Burger </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 691, 702, 107 S.Ct. 2636, 96 L.Ed.2d 601, citing, <em>United States v. Biswell </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 311, 315, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 16} Clearly, R.C. 5503.34, in and of itself, places no limitations on the discretion of the safety inspectors and \u201cconveys virtually complete discretion on the motor vehicle safety enforcement unit in deciding which trucks it will stop and when they may be stopped.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 718, 739 N.E.2d 1159. In <em>Landrum, </em>the court held that absent compliance with Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-13(0, the random detention and inspection of a vehicle, pursuant to R.C. 5503.34, is unconstitutional. See, also, <em>State v. Van Hoose </em>(Dec. 15, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 18287, 2000 WL 1838764. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-13(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(C) Authorized employees of the commission\u2019s transportation department shall utilize the following criteria in determining which documents, motor vehicles, and cargo to inspect and which employees of an offeror or motor carrier to interview: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(5) Any uniform statistical selection procedure, such as every fifth motor vehicle or every motor vehicle entering an inspection site * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 19} At the suppression hearing, Emnett testified that on February 28, 2002, when he decided to conduct a commercial vehicle inspection, he. first chose the number 3 and then began counting commercial vehicles that passed him on U.S. 24. Appellant\u2019s truck was the third commercial vehicle to pass Emnett and, thus, was selected by Emnett to be inspected. Richard McGrath, a doctor of statistics, testified on appellant\u2019s behalf that a \u201cuniform statistical selection procedure\u201d was comparable in the field of statistics to a \u201csystematic sample.\u201d McGrath described a traditional systematic sample as follows: \u201cthe number of items is predetermined and you have a list of the entire population that will be sampled from, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>then a starting point is randomly selected.\u201d McGrath also testified that the number that is selected for the sampling is decided before the sampling is done.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court held that Emnett implemented a uniform statistical selection procedure by selecting the number 3 before beginning to count the commercial vehicles that drove past him on U.S. 24. We agree. Emnett\u2019s preselection of the number 3 provided him with a neutral criterion to use when selecting a vehicle to inspect and complies with one of the two examples of a \u201cuniform statistical selection procedure\u201d as specified by Ohio Adm.Code 4901-2-5-13(C)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant, however, argues that despite Emnett\u2019s preselection of the number 3, Emnett still had complete discretion as to time, place, and scope. As such, appellant argues that the search and seizure of his truck was unconstitutional. We disagree and find that the vehicle inspection was properly limited in time insofar as it was conducted during Emnett\u2019s shift. We also find that it was properly limited in scope insofar as Emnett implemented a uniform statistical selection procedure to choose appellant\u2019s vehicle. We further find that the stop was properly limited as to location insofar as appellant\u2019s truck entered an \u201cinspection site,\u201d as required by Ohio Adm.Code 4901-2-5-13(C)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 22} Ohio Adm.Code 4901-2-5-13(C)(5) specifies that \u201cevery fifth motor vehicle or every motor vehicle entering an inspection site\u201d can be selected. Appellant argues, however, that \u201cinspection site\u201d is not defined and, therefore, there was no limitation on Emnett\u2019s discretion as to place. Although \u201cinspection site\u201d is not defined, we find that, pursuant to R.C. 1.49, in order to determine the intention of the legislature, we may consider \u201c[t]he common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects.\u201d The former version of Ohio Adm.Code 4901-2-5-13(C)(5) stated, in part, that any uniform statistical selection procedure \u201cshall be used when operating at a * * * temporarily fixed inspection location on public property * * \u201cAs used in this rule, \u2018temporarily fixed inspection location\u2019 shall include a portion of a public highway being patrolled by employees of the commission\u2019s transportation department.\u201d Although no longer included in the Ohio Administrative Code, we find this language instructive as to what was intended by \u201cinspection site.\u201d Insofar as Emnett conducted his uniform statistical selection procedure while patrolling a portion of public highway, to wit U.S. 24, we find that Emnett did not have unfettered discretion as to the location of the inspection site.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant additionally argues in his first assignment of error that the impounding of his vehicle was unconstitutional. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s truck was towed only after he had been arrested for obstruction of official business and for failure to comply with a lawful order of an officer. According to Trooper Robert Ashenfelter, when subjects are taken into custody and no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>on the scene, a decision is made whether to tow the vehicle to protect the vehicle, its contents, the property owner\u2019s interests, and the state of Ohio from liability. Ashenfelter testified that appellant\u2019s vehicle was towed from McDonald\u2019s parking lot to VJ\u2019s secured storage lot \u201c[b]ecause we\u2019re not going to post a guard around it 24 hours a day to watch it and the owner of the vehicle was not there or a representative of the company.\u201d Based on the facts and Ashenfelter\u2019s testimony, we find that the impounding of appellant\u2019s truck was routine, authorized by standardized procedures, and necessary from a security standpoint. See <em>Colorado v. Bertine </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 367, 375-376, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we find appellant\u2019s first assignment of error not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for a directed verdict as to charge of violating an out-of-service order. Specifically, appellant argues that (1) the state failed to prove a prima facie case that Emnett possessed the authority to issue an out-of-service order, and (2) the state failed to prove a prima facie case that Emnett issued a lawful out-of-service order.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 26} Pursuant to R.C. 5503.34, the Superintendent of the Highway Patrol may appoint staff to the commercial motor vehicle safety enforcement unit to \u201cstop commercial motor vehicles for the exclusive purpose of inspecting such vehicles to enforce compliance with orders and rules of the public utilities commission * * As evidenced by state\u2019s exhibit No. 1, Emnett was appointed by the Superintendent of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, by virtue of the authority vested by R.C. 5503.34, to the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enforcement Unit. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-07 states that \u201cemployees of the state highway patrol designated by the superintendent to conduct commercial vehicle inspections, may declare \u2018out of service\u2019 * * * [a]ny motor vehicle which by reason of its mechanical condition or loading would likely cause an accident or breakdown * * *.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the prosecution established that Emnett was authorized, pursuant to his appointment by the Superintendent of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the applicable statutory and Administrative Code sections, to declare appellant\u2019s truck out of service due to his load\u2019s being improperly secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant, however, additionally argues that the out-of-service order issued by Emnett was unlawful insofar as the sticker Emnett affixed to appellant\u2019s truck failed to contain a list of necessary repairs. Further, although the out-of-service sticker stated that appellant was to \u201c[c]orrect all violations as noted on the OSP inspection report,\u201d appellant argues that he was never provided the inspection report and, therefore, was not clearly and unequivocally notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>what behavior was prohibited by the out-of-service order, thereby denying him due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">{\u00b6 28} With respect to placing a vehicle \u201cout of service,\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4901:2-5-07(D) states that \u201c[vjehicles declared \u2018out of service\u2019 may be marked with an appropriate sticker, which shall not be removed until the vehicle is no longer out of service.\u201d Additionally, Section 396.9, Title 49, C.F.R., states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(c)(1) Authorized personnel shall declare and mark \u2018out of service\u2019 any motor vehicle which by reason of its mechanical condition or loading would likely cause an accident or a breakdown. An \u2018Out of Service Vehicle\u2019 sticker shall be used to mark vehicles \u2018out of service\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(c)(2) No motor carrier shall require or permit any person to operate nor shall any person operate any motor vehicle declared and marked \u2018out of service\u2019 until all repairs required by the \u2018out of service notice\u2019 have been satisfactorily completed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 31} In this case, while at VJ\u2019s lot, and after inspecting appellant\u2019s truck, Emnett declared the truck out of service due to an insecure load. Specifically, Emnett determined that the size and number of chains being used to secure the steel coils on appellant\u2019s trailers were insufficient based upon the weight of each coil. Emnett testified that, in the presence of Andy Williams, an employee at VJ\u2019s Towing, he placed out-of-service stickers on the driver\u2019s side of each trailer. Emnett stated that he filled out each sticker with the inspection report number, his signature, and the date of the inspection. Emnett then went to the Maumee Police Department and, in the presence of Trooper Ashenfelter, notified appellant that his truck was out of service due to the load securement. Emnett testified that he told appellant that the load needed to be \u201cproperly secured.\u201d Emnett also testified that he knew that appellant understood the nature of the out-of-service order because appellant \u201cstarted arguing with [Emnett] about the securement of the coils because [appellant] was afraid he was going to damage the coils.\u201d Emnett further testified that the written inspection report was not completed until the following day because he needed additional information from the carrier before completing his report. However, once it was complete, Emnett testified that the report was sent to the motor carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 32} Trooper Ashenfelter also testified that appellant was notified regarding the nature of the out-of-service order. Specifically, Ashenfelter testified that Emnett instructed appellant that he needed to get \u201ca multitude of things\u201d taken care of before driving his truck, including properly securing his load, which did not have enough chains or straps on the coils to keep them securely in place. Ashenfelter testified that appellant\u2019s response to Emnett was that, with respect to the truck\u2019s being overweight, \u201call he needed to do was separate the trailers to make it legal,\u201d and with respect to the load securement, \u201che could have somebody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>bring chains up,\u201d but he did not like to because the chains \u201cwould damage the steel coils.\u201d Ashenfelter also testified that Trooper Charles Grizzard told appellant that \u201ceverything needed to be brought up per the inspectors to have everything certified before he could drive it, whether it be the chains and everything else.\u201d According to Ashenfelter, appellant responded to Grizzard that \u201che knew what he had to do at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 33} Ashenfelter further testified that after appellant was released from the Maumee Police Department, appellant came to the Highway Patrol post to get a release form, an HP60, to get his truck released from VJ\u2019s storage lot. Appellant presented his 2002 IFTA sticker and was issued an HP60, which would, according to Ashenfelter, enable appellant to \u201cmake any necessary corrections to the vehicle before driving it.\u201d At the time the HP60 was being issued, Ashenfelter testified that he again told appellant that \u201che needed to make the load legal and he needed to have it properly secured.\u201d Appellant responded to Ashenfelter that \u201cmy buddy\u2019s out there in a pickup truck and I\u2019ve got chains and stuff to secure it from there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 34} Trooper Grizzard also testified that he informed appellant regarding the nature of his vehicle violations and the reasons for its being placed out of service. Grizzard testified that he told appellant that he \u201cwas going to issue [appellant] a citation for gross overload of a motor vehicle, failure to display an IFTA violation, and also that he needed to take care of the out-of-service violations that were going to be explained to him by Inspector Emnett.\u201d Grizzard informed appellant that \u201cthe vehicle had to be made legal for weight, first of all, which was the vehicle had to be in compliance with the 80,000 pounds of gross weight that any tractor trailer is afforded without a special hauling permit, that the * * * 2002 IFTA sticker had to be displayed in the truck and that any out-of-service orders that he was going to be issued had to be taken care of.\u201d Grizzard also told appellant that \u201cany type of deviation from that would be grounds for failure to comply with [Grizzard\u2019s] order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">(\u00b6 35} With respect to the HP60, Grizzard testified that in order to obtain an HP60, appellant \u201chad to show the IFTA sticker and comply with all [Grizzard\u2019s] previous orders, which [were] (1) to make the vehicle of legal weight, and (2) to make sure all violations of the motor carrier regulations were taken care of, specifically the out-of-service ones, which would be the chains on the coils.\u201d Grizzard further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe HP60 was just going to be to show the IFTA sticker. And then, when he took the HP60 down to VJ\u2019s, he would have shown that he has complied with one aspect of that and that he \u2014 the reason that he went then and got it was so he didn\u2019t have to go back and forth, which I respect. That was a lot of driving all the way from Perrysburg out to Swanton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201cBut he was going to have to still comply with the other orders, which was (1) break the trailers apart and the [inaudible] weight, and (2) fix the trailer, i.e., the chains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThat was the whole purpose of having it \u2014 it was a receipt showing, from the highway patrol, that we have made him comply in order to make it legal to drive on the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 39} Andy Williams testified that he saw Emnett place the out-of-service stickers on the trailers while at VJ\u2019s lot. Williams also testified that he told appellant, at approximately 1:30 a.m. on March 1, 2002, when appellant came to pick up his truck, that he \u201cneeded to split the trailers to make it legal and chain his coils on there.\u201d Williams also told appellant that \u201che could bring the truck around the front and separate the trailers.\u201d Williams suggested this because he did not want to wait around all night for appellant to return for the other trailer, which Williams would have had to do had the second trailer been left in the secured lot. According to Williams, appellant sat in the cab of his truck for 10-20 minutes while letting the air build up on his truck, never got out to look in the trailers or at his load, and never secured the coils of steel with additional chains. After 10-20 minutes, appellant drove out of the lot and within a minute and a half, without having split the trailers, had pulled out onto State Route 25, heading south.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 40} Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant was not denied due process by the issuance of the out-of-service order. According to Emnett, the out-of-service stickers clearly identified the inspection report number, which contained the specific violation information, Emnett\u2019s name, and the date of the offense. We further find that Emnett completed the written inspection report within a reasonable amount of time after placing appellant\u2019s truck out of service. Moreover, based on the testimony of the witnesses, we find that even without being handed the written report, appellant was clearly and unequivocally notified regarding the nature of the out-of-service order and what steps had to be taken to rectify the violations. Accordingly, we find appellant\u2019s second assignment of error not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 41} Appellant argues in his third assignment of error that the trial court committed prejudicial error by overruling appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion with respect to the \u201cfailure to comply\u201d charge. Specifically, appellant argues that because there was no lawful out-of-service order, Trooper Gizzard\u2019s order to appellant to rectify the out-of-service order before operating his vehicle was not lawful. Additionally, appellant argues that \u201cthe unconditional written release for appellant\u2019s vehicle renders any oral admonitions ambiguous and raises a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the \u2018order\u2019 itself.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>{\u00b6 42} As discussed above, we find that appellant\u2019s vehicle was lawfully placed out of service due to an improperly secured load. Insofar as R.C. 4506.15(G) prohibits persons from violating an out-of-service order, we find that a state trooper has the authority to enforce an out-of-service order. We also find that, in addition to being ordered to rectify the load violation associated with the out-of-service order, appellant was ordered by Grizzard not to operate his truck until the overweight violation had been rectified. Neither violation was rectified by appellant prior to driving his truck on State Route 25. We further find that appellant\u2019s truck was released pursuant to an HP60 form with the clear instruction that prior to driving his truck, he must rectify the overweight and insecure load violations. Moreover, we find that appellant represented that he knew what needed to be done and was prepared to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 43} Having found that appellant failed to comply with the lawful order of a police officer, we find that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on the \u201cfailure to comply\u201d charge. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 44} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by not granting appellant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars. Appellant argues that because he was not provided the identity of the police officer with whose order appellant had failed to comply, the substance of the order, or the method by which it was communicated to appellant, appellant erroneously proceeded under the belief that the state was going to attempt to convert Inspector Emnett into a police officer. Appellant asserts that this lack of notice and information interfered with his ability to file appropriate motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cIn a criminal prosecution the state must, in. response to a request for a bill of particul\u00e1rs or demand for discovery, supply specific dates and times with regard to an alleged offense where it possesses such information.\u201d <em>State v. Sellards </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 17 OBR 410, 478 N.E.2d 781, syllabus. However, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that the purpose for giving a bill of particulars is \u201cto elucidate or particularize the conduct of the accused,\u201d but not \u201cto provide the accused with specifications of evidence or to serve as a substitute for discovery.\u201d <em>Sellards </em>at 171, 17 OBR 410, 478 N.E.2d 781. Additionally, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he purpose of the bill of particulars is to inform an accused of the exact nature of the charges against him so that he can prepare his defense thereto.\u201d <em>State v. Fowler </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 362, 364, 22 O.O.2d 416, 189 N.E.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 46} In response to appellant\u2019s request for a bill of particulars in this case, the state replied that the complaint \u201cadequately provided defense counsel with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the specific nature of the offense, the date of the offense, and the specific place of the offense.\u201d The complaint in this case states that appellant, \u201con or about the 1st day of March, 2002, did knowingly fail to comply with a lawful order of a police officer. To wit: did drive a comm, vehicle after being order[ed] not to until repairs were completed.\u201d Trooper Grizzard signed as \u201ccomplainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 47} We find that appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for a bill of particulars insofar as the complaint adequately notified appellant regarding the exact nature of the charges against him, thereby enabling him to prepare for his defense. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s request. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 48} Appellant argues in his fifth assignment of error that it was plain error for the trial court to convict him of multiple offenses arising out of the same conduct. Specifically, appellant argues that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, as embodied in R.C. 2941.25(A), to convict him of both of the allied offenses of R.C. 2921.331 and R.C. 4506.04. Appellant failed to raise this issue in the trial court and therefore waived all but plain error in this regard. See <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 56, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 49} R.C. 2941.25 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">(\u00b6 52} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \u201cin order for two crimes to constitute allied offenses of similar import, * * * [t]he offenses and their elements must correspond .to such a degree that commission of the one offense will result in the commission of the other.\u201d <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 128, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, citing <em>State v. Donald </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 73, 11 O.O.3d 242, 386 N.E.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">{\u00b6 53} We find that no such correspondence exists between R.C. 2921.331 and R.C. 4506.04. R.C. 2921.331(A) requires that there had to exist a lawful order of a police officer with which appellant failed to comply, whereas, to be convicted of R.C. 4506.04, there had to be an out-of-service order issued that appellant violated. Insofar as their elements do not overlap, we find that these two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>statutory sections are by no means indivisible, even though they happen to apply to the same conduct in this case. This is not a situation where a violation of R.C. 2921.331 will result in a violation of R.C. 4506.04. See <em>Logan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 54} Moreover, we note that Trooper Grizzard did not solely order appellant to make the necessary repairs pursuant to the out-of-service order; rather, Grizzard also ordered appellant to rectify the separate violation of gross overload of a motor vehicle prior to driving the truck. Additionally, as a condition to receiving an HP60 release of his truck, appellant was ordered to make all necessary repairs before driving it. Hence, we find that there were additional orders with which appellant failed to comply that were separate and apart from the out-of-service order.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, we find that R.C. 2921.331 and R.C. 4506.04 are not allied offenses of similar import. We further find that, regardless of the existence of an out-of-service order, appellant failed to comply with the lawful order of a police officer, to wit, appellant operated his truck before rectifying the overweight violation ordered by Trooper Grizzard. Accordingly, we find that appellant has not demonstrated that plain error exists. Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 56} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his Crim.R. 29 motion as to the IFTA sticker charge. The state responds that appellant failed to make a Crim.R. 29 motion with respect to the IFTA charge and, therefore, waived any issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 57} A party waives any error, absent plain error, as to sufficiency of the evidence by failing to timely file a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal. <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 25, 535 N.E.2d 1351; and <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894. Nevertheless, \u201c[wjhether a sufficiency of the evidence argument is reviewed under a prejudicial error standard or under a plain error standard is academic.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(July 14, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17891, 2000 WL 966161. Regardless of the standard used, \u201c \u2018a conviction based on legally insufficient evidence constitutes a denial of due process,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541, citing <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31, 45, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, and <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, and should therefore be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 58} Sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law as to whether the evidence is legally adequate to support a verdict as to all elements of a crime. <em>Thompkins </em>at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. In making this determination, an appellate court must determine whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 59} Upon thoroughly reviewing the record in this case, we find that there is no evidence presented that appellant drove his truck in Wood County, Ohio, without displaying his 2002 IFTA sticker. Appellant clearly had such a sticker, insofar as he presented it at the time he requested an HP60 form releasing his vehicle. Williams was the only witness who could have testified whether he saw appellant\u2019s sticker displayed when appellant left VJ\u2019s Towing; however, the state never asked Williams about the IFTA sticker. Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 60} In his seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by admitting state\u2019s.exhibit No. 16, which was the VHS recording of the events following the traffic stop in Lucas County, Ohio. Appellant argues that the state failed to establish that the recording was authentic, accurate, and trustworthy. Additionally, appellant argues that the material in the recording was highly inflammatory and prejudicial because appellant\u2019s behavior at the scene of the traffic stop constituted evidence of other bad acts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 61} Evid.it. 404(B) provides, in part, that \u201c[e]vidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d We find nothing in the record to support appellant\u2019s assertion that the VHS recording was offered to prove appellant\u2019s character in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith when he violated an out-of-service order and failed to comply with the lawful order of an officer. We further find that Trooper Ashenfelter properly authenticated the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 62} Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the recording was offered to prove that appellant acted in conformity with his character, with respect to the charges in this case, we find that the publication of the recording to the jury was not prejudicial. All aspects of the incident that could be heard on the VHS recording had already been testified to by witnesses. As such, even if the recording was improperly given to the jury, appellant suffered no prejudice from its publication because the information contained therein was merely duplicative of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. We therefore find that any potential error by the trial court was harmless. Accordingly, we find appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">{\u00b6 63} On consideration whereof, this court finds that appellant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial with respect to the convictions based on R.C. 2921.331(A) and R.C. 4506.04(A)(2). The judgment of the Perrys-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>burg Municipal Court is therefore affirmed with respect to these convictions. We further find that appellant was prejudiced with respect to the conviction based on R.C. 5728.02. We therefore reverse appellant\u2019s conviction based on failure to display an IFTA sticker and vacate his sentence in this regard. Court costs of this appeal are assessed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-5\">Handwork, P.J., and Pietrykowski, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
