The jury found Josie Coe, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of escape in violation of R.C. 2921.34(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-17\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-18\">\u201cThe evidence presented at Josie Coe\u2019s trial was insufficient and against the manifest weight of the evidence in violation of her right to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cJosie Coe was denied her state and federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial when the trial court gave the jury improper \u2018acquittal first\u2019 instructions and placed the same instruction on the verdict forms in violation of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article I, Sections 5 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201cJosie' Coe was denied her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution when her trial attorney failed to make a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case, or at the close of the defense case, or before the case was given to the jury, and when her trial attorney failed to object to the trial court\u2019s improper \u2018acquittal first\u2019 jury instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">{\u00b6 3} On December 15, 2001, appellant was arrested in Meigs County for driving while under the influence. Appellant was uncooperative, belligerent, and physically abusive with the arresting officers. In an attempt to subdue appellant, the officers maced her and wrestled her to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">{\u00b6 4} Because the jail facilities in Meigs County do not accommodate women, the Meigs County Sheriffs Office decided to transport appellant to the Washington County Jail. The arresting officers called Meigs County Sheriffs Deputy James Stacy to transport appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">{\u00b6 5} Deputy Stacy cuffed appellant\u2019s hands in the front of her body, placed her in a transport van, and departed for Marietta. As the deputy approached Belpre, appellant began complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Deputy Stacy decided to stop at a truck stop to adjust appellant\u2019s handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">{\u00b6 6} Shortly after leaving the truck stop, Deputy Stacy received a phone call from the Meigs County Sheriffs Office advising him that a knife was missing from the area where appellant had washed the mace away from her face. The caller cautioned the deputy that appellant may have taken the knife. Deputy Stacy thus decided to stop at a gas station in Belpre to check to see whether appellant had the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">{\u00b6 7} Once the deputy stopped the van at the gas station, the van door opened and appellant started exiting the van. Deputy Stacy tried to return appellant to the van, but she was uncooperative. Appellant yelled and screamed at the deputy that she did not \u201cwant to go\u201d and complained that her handcuffs were too tight. Appellant remained uncooperative and Deputy Stacy warned her that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>she refused to cooperate and return to the van, he would mace her. Deputy Stacy ultimately used the mace and then decided to call for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">{\u00b6 8} Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Seabolt arrived on the scene and tried to help Deputy Stacy to subdue appellant. Appellant continued to be uncooperative, however. After the trooper threatened to mace her again, she decided to return to the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">{\u00b6 9} Belpre Police Sergeant Earnest D. Clevenger also arrived at the gas station. Sergeant Clevenger noticed that appellant did not want to return to the van. The sergeant observed appellant sit in the van\u2019s doorway with her feet on the ground. Sergeant Clevenger stated that once Deputy Stacy and Trooper Seabolt persuaded appellant to return inside the van, she kept trying to exit and opening the door. He stated that each time the officers slid the door shut, appellant reached out, grabbed it, and pulled it open.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">{\u00b6 10} During the encounter, Trooper Seabolt advised Deputy Stacy that the Washington County Jail would not accept an inmate who had been maced unless the inmate first went to the hospital. Trooper Seabolt stated that he would escort Deputy Stacy to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">{\u00b6 11} As Deputy Stacy drove toward the hospital, the van door opened. The door opened when the van rounded a curve at approximately forty to forty-five miles per hour. When the deputy heard the door open, he applied the brakes, which forced the door to shut. The door then opened again and appellant fell out of the van while hanging on to the door handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">{\u00b6 12} On February 14, 2002, the Washington County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging appellant with escape, in violation of R.C. 2921.34(A)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant initially entered a guilty plea, but subsequently withdrew her plea, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">{\u00b6 13} On June 25, 2002, the trial court held a jury trial. The state presented the testimony of Deputy Stacy, Trooper Seabolt, and Sergeant Clevenger, all of whom testified that appellant was uncooperative throughout her journey to the Washington County Jail and that appellant\u2019s actions and words indicated that she did not want to go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">{\u00b6 14} After closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury on both escape and a lesser included offense of disorderly conduct. In advising the jury how to consider the greater and lesser offenses, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">\u201cIn the event you find the Defendant, Josie Coe, not guilty of the charge of escape, then and only in that event, you must continue your deliberations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>determine whether or not the Defendant, Josie Coe, is guilty of the lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court further instructed the jury how to complete the verdict forms for both the greater and lesser offenses. The court quoted the verdict form, with interjections in italics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201c \u2018We, the undersigned jurors, upon the concurrence of all of our members\u2019 <em>\u2014a verdict has to be unanimous in a criminal </em>case\u2014 \u2018find that the Defendant, Josie Coe, is\u2019 \u2014there\u2019s an asterisk and a blank line, right down here it says, \u2018insert in ink, either \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 as you determine the case to be.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">$ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">\u201cIf you find her not guilty, you skip the second part and go to the third part, which is lesser included. And that is, \u2018In the event you find the Defendant, Josie Coe, not guilty of the charge of escape as charged in [the] indictment, then and only then, you must continue your deliberations to consider whether or not the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all of the essential elements of the lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s instructions and expressed satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">{\u00b6 17} On June 25, 2002, the jury found appellant guilty of escape. The trial court subsequently sentenced appellant to eleven months in prison. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">{\u00b6 18} In her first assignment of error, appellant asserts that insufficient evidence exists to support her conviction and that her conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant essentially complains that because no direct evidence exists that she opened the door, the evidence was insufficient and against the manifest weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">{\u00b6 19} We initially note that appellant failed to move for a Crim.R. 29(A) judgment of acquittal. In the past, this court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and numerous other Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>appellate courts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relying primarily upon <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 25, 535 N.E.2d 1351,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 162, 163, 14 O.O.3d 403, 398 N.E.2d 781,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have held that if a criminal defendant fails to timely file a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, the defendant waives any error, absent plain error, as to sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In two apparently little-recognized cases, however, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that a failure to timely file a Crim.R. 29(A) motion during a jury trial does not waive an argument on appeal concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 346, 744 N.E.2d 1.163; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992) 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 223, 594 N.E.2d 595. In both <em>Jones </em>and <em>Carter, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court stated that the defendant\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea preserves his right to object to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence. Id. Moreover, because \u201ca conviction based on legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>insufficient evidence constitutes a denial of due process,\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541, a conviction based upon insufficient evidence would almost always amount to plain error. See <em>State v. Hermann, </em>Erie App. No. E-01-039, 2002-Ohio-7307, 2002 WL 31888210, \u00b6 24; <em>State v. Casto, </em>Washington App. No. 01CA25, 2002-Ohio-6255, 2002 WL 31538799; State v. Arrowood (Sept. 27, 1993), Pike App. No. 93CA505, 1993 WL 386328, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, in the case sub judice, although appellant failed to file a Crim.R. 29(A) motion for judgment of acquittal, we will nonetheless consider her argument that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to support her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">{\u00b6 21} When an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence, the inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (stating that \u201csufficiency is a test of adequacy\u201d); <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 66, 752 N.E.2d 904 (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>[1979], 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492). Furthermore, a reviewing court is not to assess \u201cwhether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring). Reviewing courts will not overturn convictions on sufficiency-of-evidence claims unless reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, in reviewing sufficiency-of-the-evidence claims, courts must remain mindful that the elements of an offense may be established by direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. See <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 568 N.E.2d 674. Circumstantial and direct evidence are of equal evidentiary value. See <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (\u201cCircumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value. In some instances certain facts can only be established by circumstantial evidence.\u201d). When reviewing the value of circumstantial evidence, we note that \u201cthe weight accorded an inference is fact-dependent and can be disregarded as speculative only if reasonable minds can come to the conclusion that the inference is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Wesley v. The McAlpin Co. </em>(May 25, 1994) Hamilton App. No. C-930286, 1994 WL 201825, (citing <em>Donaldson v. Northern Trading Co. </em>[1992], 82 Ohio App.3d 476, 483, 612 N.E.2d 754).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 23} Employing the above standard, we believe that in the case sub judice, the state presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed escape. R.C. 2921.34(A)(1) sets forth the offense of escape. The statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201c(A)(1) No person, knowing the person is under detention or being reckless in that regard, shall purposely break or attempt to break the detention, or purposely fail to return to detention, either following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period, or at the time required when serving a sentence in intermittent confinement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant focuses her sufficiency argument on whether the state presented sufficient evidence to establish that she purposely broke or attempted to break her detention. Appellant claims that because no one saw appellant open the door, insufficient evidence exists to establish that she purposely broke or attempted to break her detention. We disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 25} The state presented ample circumstantial evidence that appellant opened the door and thus that she purposely broke or attempted to break her detention. Obviously, appellant did not want to go to jail. Appellant was uncooperative with all of the law enforcement officers that she encountered. She screamed that she did not \u201cwant to go.\u201d She refused to return to the van when so instructed. She sat defiantly in the van\u2019s doorway when the officers tried to persuade her to return the van. Moreover, common sense suggests that van doors do not spontaneously open. The jury viewed the van and could have determined, upon viewing the van, that the door could not have opened on its own or that appellant could not have hit it by accident. The jury was in the best position to see the van and determine the facts. We are ill-equipped to second-guess the jury\u2019s decision. See, e.g., <em>State v. Noling </em>(2002), 98 Ohio St.3d 44, 54, 781 N.E.2d 88 (stating that the jury has the primary responsibility to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 26} Consequently, we disagree with appellant that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that she purposely broke or attempted to break her detention. Rather, we believe that the record contains sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s escape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant further claims that her conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. When an appellate court considers a claim that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court must dutifully examine the entire record, weigh the evidence, and consider the credibility of witnesses, while bearing in mind that credibility generally is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve. See <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 67, 752 N.E.2d 904; <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 80, 24 O.O.3d 150, 434 N.E.2d 1356; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Once the reviewing court finishes its examination, the court may reverse the judgment of conviction only if it appears that the fact finder, in resolving conflicts in evidence, \u201c \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>[1983], 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717). If the state presented substantial evidence upon which the trier of fact reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the essential elements of the offense had been established, the judgment of conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 28} After our review of the record in the case sub judice, we find substantial, competent, and credible evidence upon which the trier of fact reasonably could conclude that the state established, beyond a reasonable doubt, the essential elements of escape. The jury did not clearly lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 29} As we stated above, the state presented ample evidence to show that appellant did not want to go to jail and the lengths that she went to in her attempt to avoid going to jail. While we again note that no direct evidence exists to show that appellant opened the door, circumstantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant, indeed, opened the door. Appellant was the only person who had access to the door handle when the door opened. Common sense suggests that doors do not open of their own accord. Given the foregoing, we cannot state that the jury committed such a miscarriage of justice that we must reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 31} In her second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions and verdict forms amounted to improper \u201cacquittal first\u201d instructions. Specifically, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>structed the jury that it must first acquit appellant of the greater offense (escape) before it could consider the lesser offense (disorderly conduct).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">{\u00b6 32} Initially, we note that appellant failed to object to either the jury instructions or to the verdict forms. Therefore, absent plain error, appellant has waived the argument concerning the trial court\u2019s alleged improper acquittal first instructions. See Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 33} Under Crim.R. 52(B), \u201c[pjlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d For a reviewing court to find plain error, the following three conditions must exist: (1) an error in the proceedings; (2) the error must be plain, i.e., the error must be an \u201cobvious\u201d defect in the trial proceedings; and (3) the error must have affected \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d i.e., the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial. See, e.g., <em>Noling </em>98 Ohio St.3d at 56, 781 N.E.2d 88; <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2001), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 257, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 200, 749 N.E.2d 274. Furthermore, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that Crim.R. 52(B) is to be invoked \u201cwith the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 111, 559 N.E.2d 710; see, also, <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. A reviewing court should consider noticing plain error only if the error \u201c \u2018 \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano </em>[1993], 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508, quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson </em>[1936], 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 34} When a reviewing court examines a trial court\u2019s jury instructions, \u201c \u2018a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 396, 721 N.E.2d 52 (quoting <em>Cupp v. Naughten </em>[1973], 414 U.S. 141, 146-147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368; <em>State v. Price </em>[1979], 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 14 O.O.3d 379, 398 N.E.2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus); see, also, <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 200, 203, 616 N.E.2d 921. Thus, the reviewing court must consider the jury instructions \u201cas a whole\u201d and then determine whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. West </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 208, 560 N.E.2d 165; see, also, <em>State v. Noggle </em>(2000), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>140 Ohio App.3d 733, 750, 749 N.E.2d 309. We conduct our review of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">{\u00b6 35} A trial court may not instruct a jury that it must unanimously acquit a criminal defendant of a greater offense before it may consider a lesser offense. See <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph three of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 71. In <em>Thomas, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that while \u201c[a] jury must unanimously agree that the defendant is guilty of a particular criminal offense before returning a verdict of guilty on that offense,\u201d the jury need not unanimously agree that the defendant is not guilty of the crime charged before considering a lesser included offense. Id. Rather, the court stated that if the jury is unable to agree on a verdict with respect to the greater offense, it may consider the lesser offense. Id. Thus, a jury instruction does not constitute an improper acquittal-first instruction if the instruction does not require unanimous acquittal on the crime charged before the jury may consider the lesser included offense.

The court held that the instruction was not prejudicial to the defendant because it had \u201cnegligible coercive potential\u201d and spoke to the \u201cjury\u2019s inability to find, whether unanimously or not, a certain element of a greater offense.\u201d Id. Since the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>Thomas, </em>the court has had several occasions to review alleged acquittal first instructions.

In concluding that the foregoing instruction did not constitute an improper acquittal-first instruction, the <em>Stallings </em>court noted that the trial court \u201cnever suggested that the jury must unanimously find the accused not guilty of aggravated murder before considering the lesser offense of manslaughter.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>State v.

The court stated that \u201c[t]here should have been no doubt in the jurors\u2019 minds that they need not unanimously dismiss the aggravated murder charge before they could address the lesser charge.\u201d Id.

The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201cIf you find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the offense of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen, your Verdict must be Guilty. If you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the essential elements of the offense of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen, then your Verdict must be Not Guilty. \u201cIf you find the Defendant Guilty of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen, you need not consider the lesser-included offense of Gross Sexual Imposition of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen. However, if you find the Defendant Not Guilty of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen, you must consider the lesser-included offense of Gross Sexual Imposition of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 54} The <em>Villa </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\u201cHad the trial court stopped there, we might agree with the state that the instruction did not expressly require the jury to unanimously agree on the rape charge before considering the gross sexual imposition charge. However, the trial court continued, stating, \u2018The second Verdict Form you have \u2014 and again, <em>you will not consider this </em>\u2014 this <em>second Verdict Form unless you find the Defendant Not Guilty of the offense of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen.\u2019\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>{\u00b6 55} The court concluded that the above instruction \u201cclearly required the jury to acquit Villa on the rape charge before considering the gross sexual imposition charge.\u201d The court therefore concluded that the instruction constituted an improper acquittal-first instruction. The court ultimately, however, determined that the trial court\u2019s subsequent curative instruction remedied the error in giving the acquittal-first instruction. During deliberations, the jury submitted the following question to the trial court: \u201cYour Honor, if we cannot come to a unanimous decision on the Rape charge of [the victim], are we allowed to go to the charge G.S.I.?\u201d The court replied, \u201cYes, you must reach a unanimous verdict.\u201d The parties eventually agreed that the trial court\u2019s answer was incorrect. Within a half hour of the earlier answer, the court then called the jury into the courtroom and read the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe court, after further research, has concluded that you may consider the lesser:included charge of Gross Sexual Imposition of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen, if you cannot reach a unanimous Verdict on the charge of Rape of a Person Under the Age of Thirteen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 56} The appellate court thus concluded that the trial court\u2019s final instruction on the matter was correct and cured the defect with the prior instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 57} In the ease at bar, we believe that the trial court\u2019s instruction constitutes an improper acquittal-first instruction. In advising the jury how to consider the greater and lesser offenses, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cIn the event you find the Defendant, Josie Coe, not guilty of the charge of escape, then and <em>only in that event, </em>you must continue your deliberations to determine whether or not the Defendant, Josie Coe, is guilty of the lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">{\u00b6 58} The above instruction is somewhat similar to the instruction that the <em>Villa </em>court found to constitute an improper acquittal first instruction. The above instruction, however, also incorporates the \u201cif you find\u201d language that other appellate courts have concluded complies with <em>Thomas. </em>At this juncture, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the above instruction, standing alone, constitutes an improper acquittal-first instruction. Instead, we believe that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury as to how to complete the verdict forms, when coupled with the above instruction, constitutes an improper acquittal-first instruction. In instructing the jury how to complete the verdict forms, the trial quoted the verdict form, and included an interjection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\u201c We, the undersigned jurors, upon the concurrence of all of our members\u2019 <em>\u2014a verdict has to be unanimous in a criminal case </em>\u2014 \u2018find that the Defendant, Josie Coe, is\u2019 \u2014there\u2019s an asterisk and a blank line, right down here it says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u2018insert in ink, either \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 as you determine the case to be.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 59} Thus, from the above instructions it appears that a reasonable juror could be confused whether a unanimous not guilty verdict must be reached before the jury could consider the lesser included offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The distinguishing feature from the case at bar and the cases noted above that did not find the trial court\u2019s instructions to constitute improper acquittal-first instructions is that nowhere in any of those cases did the trial court suggest to the jury that a verdict must be unanimous. Moreover, we note that our review of the transcript reveals that the trial court did not include in its jury instructions the third paragraph of the Ohio Jury Instruction lesser-included-offense instruction regarding the jury\u2019s inability to agree on a verdict on the more serious offense and the jury\u2019s proper consideration of the lesser offense. While we recognize that jury instructions must be viewed as whole, we believe that the above isolated instruction tainted the jury\u2019s understanding of whether it had to unanimously agree on a verdict on the greater charge before considering the lesser charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">{\u00b6 60} Thus, in the case sub judice we believe that a sufficient danger exists that the jury interpreted the above instruction to require a unanimous acquittal on the greater charge before it could consider the lesser charge. We therefore conclude that the trial court prejudicially erred when it instructed the jury that a verdict must be unanimous. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">{\u00b6 61} In her third assignment of error, appellant argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly move for a Crim.R. 29(A) judgment of acquittal and for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s \u201cacquittal-first\u201d instructions. Reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of convictions on ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v.

To prove that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense, a defendant must establish \u201cthat counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; see, also, <em>Bradley, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cTo show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">{\u00b6 64} Moreover, when a reviewing court considers an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, the reviewing court should not consider what, in hindsight, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>have been a more appropriate course of action. See <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 85, 656 N.E.2d 643 (stating that a reviewing court must assess the reasonableness of the defense counsel\u2019s decisions at the time they are made). Rather, the reviewing court \u201cmust be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. As the <em>Strickland </em>court stated, a reviewing court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d Id., 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; see, also, <em>State v. Hamblin </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 524 N.E.2d 476, certiorari denied (1988), 488 U.S. 975, 109 S.Ct. 515, 102 L.Ed.2d 550 (stating that a properly licensed attorney is presumed competent and that the appellant bears the burden to establish counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 65} With the foregoing principles in mind, we will now review appellant\u2019s arguments that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by (1) failing to move for a judgment of acquittal and (2) failing to object to the trial court\u2019s \u201cacquittal first\u201d instructions. First, we disagree with appellant that trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance in failing to move for a judgment of acquittal prejudiced appellant\u2019s case. As we stated under appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the record contains sufficient evidence concerning the elements of escape. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a judgment of acquittal would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings below and, therefore, appellant has not suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 66} Second, inasmuch as we concluded that the trial court\u2019s \u201cacquittal first\u201d instructions constituted plain error, we find no need to consider whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 67} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. We hereby reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-9\">Peter B.

We note that the Ohio Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the proposition set forth in <em>Roe, </em>that a criminal defendant\u2019s failure \"to timely file a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal\u201d waives a sufficiency of the evidence argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">. Overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Lazzaro </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 261, 667 N.E.2d 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">. {\u00b6 a} The rationale for requiring a criminal defendant to timely file a Crim.R. 29(A) motion at trial is to call the trial court\u2019s attention to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence and allow the error to be corrected, if possible. See, generally, <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 455, 653 N.E.2d 285; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 174, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Gordon </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 45, 57 O.O.2d 180, 276 N.E.2d 243, at paragraph two of the syllabus. As the court stated in <em>Seven Hills v. Willits </em>(Dec. 2, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 75444, 1999 WL 1087484:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">\"A court may only prevent or correct potential errors when they are timely brought to the court\u2019s attention. A defendant should not be permitted to benefit from an alleged error by waiting to raise the objection until there is no opportunity for the trial court to correct it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ\">{\u00b6 b} As an example, we can conceive of a criminal case in which the prosecution fails to present evidence regarding venue. If the defendant moves for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defendant brings to the trial court's attention the prosecution\u2019s failure to present evidence regarding venue. The trial court may then either grant the defendant\u2019s motion and dismiss the case or it may, under certain circumstances, permit the prosecution to reopen its case and to present evidence regarding venue. If, however, the defendant fails to timely file a Crim.R. 29(A) motion and instead waits until appeal to raise the prosecution's failure to present evidence regarding venue, the error cannot be corrected at the trial court level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">. The prosecution did not challenge on appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a lesser included offense of escape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">. Section 413.21 of the Ohio Jury Instructions, entitled \"lesser included instruction,\" provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\"You must consider the offense charged in the indictment. If you find that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the offense of (the greater offense), your verdict must be guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\"However, if you find that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of (the greater offense), then your verdict must be not guilty of that offense; and in that event, you will continue your deliberations to decide whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the lesser included offense of (the lesser offense).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\"If all of you are unable to agree on a verdict of either guilty or not guilty of (the greater offense), then you will continue your deliberation to decide whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the lesser included offense of (the lesser offense).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
