The will is dated June 11, 1914, and the codicil January .10, 1921. His daughter, the contestant, is the sole surviving child. To her he gave \u201ctwo hundred thousand dollars in cash, free of all federal and state inheritance taxes,\u201d and \u201ctwenty thousand dollars per annum in quarterly payments.\u201d The issue is, whether the testator was of sound mind when the will and codicil were executed. In the Probate Court the contestant filed a written offer of proof, supplemented by oral statements. Later testimony, which was given by a well known alienist, it was agreed, would be corroborated by another alienist, if called upon to testify. A stenographer was appointed under G. L. c. 215,'\u00a7 18. The statements of counsel and the testimony of the physicians are part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The framing of issues for a jury, on a petition for the proof of a will, under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 16, is a matter for the sound discretion of the court. It is unnecessary to recite the evidence; an examination of it does not show an abuse of discretion. The judgment of the probate judge was exercised wisely and his decision should not be reversed. <em>Wilbar </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>249 Mass. 568. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>250 Mass. 400. <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>251 Mass. 175. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Guarente, </em>253 Mass. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Although it is our duty to examine the evidence and decide the question according to our own judgment, giving due weight to the finding of the judge, a finding made by him, after hearing the witnesses and the offers- of proof made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>counsel, is to be carefully regarded and will not be set aside unless plainly wrong. <em>Wilbar </em>v. <em>Diamond, supra. Connell </em>v. <em>Sokoll, </em>247 Mass. 203. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>247 Mass. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
