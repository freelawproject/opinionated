The Industrial Accident Board on review (the report of the board member containing all the material evidence) reversed the board member and found that the employee had not sustained the burden of proving that he had suffered such injury. The Superior Court reversed the decision of the board and affirmed that of the board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Whether such injury was received was on this record a pure question of fact. There was ample evidence, which need not be recited, to support the finding of the board. The finding of the board is final in these circumstances. It supersedes the finding of the board member. The Superior Court has no authority to review the finding of the board and adopt that of the single member in preference to that of the board. Its only function is to determine as matter of law what kind of a decree ought to be entered upon the decision made by the board. <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, 502. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51, 52. <em>Fitzgibbon\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 473, 474. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The decree was wrong in form as well as in substance. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 493. <em>Cowden\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 66, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\n<em>Decree to be entered in favor of the insurer.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
