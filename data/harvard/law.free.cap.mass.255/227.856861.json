It is alleged in the petition \u201cThat on January 9, 1925, the time for the filing of the defendant\u2019s exceptions was extended to February 4, 1925; that the defendant\u2019s exceptions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>not filed on or before that date; that some time subsequent to February 4, 1925, the defendant prepared a motion to the effect that the time for the \u2018presenting the bill of exceptions to the court for allowance\u2019 be extended to and including February 10, 1925; that this motion was assented to on February 7, 1925, by Joseph J. Leonard, Assistant District Attorney; that this motion was presented to Bishop, Judge, on February 9, 1925, who made the following indorsement thereon, \u2018The time for the filing of the bill of exceptions expired before this motion was presented to the court. If, under these circumstances, the court has the authority to do so, then the above motion is approved and allowed and the time for the allowance of exceptions is extended to and including Tuesday, February 10, 1925.\u2019 The bill of exceptions was filed on February 9, 1925.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The trial judge has no power to revive the right of a defendant in a criminal case to file exceptions after the time for filing exceptions as previously limited has expired. The language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 31, in this particular is the same as that of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113. That point is settled. <em>Hack </em>v. <em>Nason, </em>190 Mass. 346. <em>Barnard Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Eugen C. Andres Co. </em>234 Mass. 148, 152. <em>C. F. Hovey, petitioner, </em>254 Mass. 551. The right of the defendant to file exceptions had come to an end before the exceptions here sought to be established were filed. Since the exceptions were not filed within the time allowed by law, the petition to establish their truth cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
