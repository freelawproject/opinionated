This portion of the railway was operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for about nine months prior to April, 1917, and then was discontinued by reason of financial difficulties. The several plaintiffs attached the real estate of the street railway company in Plymouth in actions of contract in October and December, 1917, and recovered judgments. Executions issued, seizure was made on property of the street railway company described in part as a \u201cprivate right of way fifty feet in width owned by\u201d the street railway company and otherwise sufficiently identified, levy was suspended on execution and sale thereof was made on another execution in April, 1921. In the meantime a receiver of the street railway company by order of the court sold to the defendant all its real and personal estate, with exceptions not here material, the real estate being sold \u201csubject to any liens of attachment.\u201d In September, 1920, the defendant removed the rails and other appliances from the private right of way and sold them. That constitutes the conversion alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The record fails to disclose the nature of the right of the street railway company in the land where these steel rails and appliances were laid other than to say that this portion of the railway was \u201cconstructed on a private right of way\u201d and \u201cover private land.\u201d In 1916 a street railway company might \u201cpurchase or lease private land or rights therein or thereover\u201d or take by eminent domain \u201cany land or rights in land\u201d for the construction of its tracks upon compliance with the statutes. St. 1906, c. 463, Part III, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 46. See now G. L. c. 161, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 58. There is nothing in the record to indicate the nature of the right, if any, acquired by the street railway company over this private right of way. Whether the street railway company had any right in the land where these rails were laid at the time/of the attachments, or of the sale upon execution, is wholly matter of speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\"><em>In each case judgment is to be entered for the defendant on the </em>verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
