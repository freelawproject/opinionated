Michael J. Carney testified that when he saw the dog on fire, coming from the Stewart estate, the defendant was inside of the fence near a gate through which the dog ran; that the defendant was alone at this time; that when asked by the witness \u201cWho did it,\u201d he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cstarted to laugh\u201d; that \u201cWhen he [the defendant] saw I meant it, he said, 'It\u2019s a damn shame.\u2019 \u201d The defendant was the night watchman on the Stewart estate, on which there was a \u201cmain house with three other houses,\u201d and a barn. About thirty minutes after eleven o\u2019clock on the night in question, the defendant, when interviewed by police officers of the city of Newton, told them that he had not been on the estate all night; that \u201che had been to a restaurant in Newton, and that when he came back he learned about the dog.\u201d He testified that when he met Carney he (Carney) asked him if he knew about the dog; that he asked, \u201cWhat dog\u201d; that Carney said, \u201cthe dog which had just run out of the yard,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cthat he had just come into the yard, and that there wasn\u2019t any dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApxJ\">The jury could have found that the defendant was upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the premises when the dog escaped; that he had the opportunity to commit the offence; and it was not essential for the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant had the ex-elusive opportunity to commit it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>160 Mass. 542, 551. They also could have found that the defendant\u2019s statements concerning his absence from the premises and his knowledge of the events were intentionally false, and were- made to divert suspicion from himself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spezzaro, </em>250 Mass. 454, 457, and cases cited. From the defendant\u2019s conduct and speech and all the circumstances in the case, his guilt could be inferred. The motion for a directed verdict was denied properly. There was no error in the refusal to give the defendant\u2019s requests for instructions, nor in the judge\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"APC\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
