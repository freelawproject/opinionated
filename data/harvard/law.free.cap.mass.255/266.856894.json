The driver of an automobile following the truck of the defendant, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that the street was up grade as he was travelling, that the truck was going from twelve to fifteen miles an hour, that when he first noticed the plaintiff he was running in front of an electric car approaching from the opposite direction; \u201cthat the plaintiff was running as hard as he could with his head down; that he was running pretty fast for a boy of his years\u201d; that as far as he could see \u201che didn\u2019t look at anything\u201d; that the electric car stopped suddenly and avoided hitting the boy; that the truck then was about ten or fifteen feet away; \u201cthat the plaintiff continued to run fast and without apparently looking at the truck, ran directly in front of it; that from the manner in which the plaintiff ran, it looked . . . as if an accident was unavoidable; . . . that the driver of the truck tried to avoid hitting the boy . . . that from the time . . . [he] saw the boy run in front of the electric car from the truck driver\u2019s left, the speed of the truck seemed to diminish and it stopped in about ten or fifteen feet, and at the same time swerved to the right and brought' the right front wheel just about in the gutter.\u201d When it stopped, the plaintiff was under the running board back of that wheel. A verdict was rightly directed for the defendant. <em>Rizziitelli </em>v. <em>Vestine, </em>246 Mass. 391. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Mutrie, </em>247 Mass. 316. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>223 Mass. 449. <em>Nager </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>240 Mass. 211. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>226 Mass. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
