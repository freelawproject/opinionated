The defendant at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s detention interrogated him as to his name, residence, the name of the insurance company by which he said he was employed, as well as where he was and what he was doing \u201clast night about this time.\u201d At the police station in response to the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry why he was detained, the defendant took him to the sergeant\u2019s desk, and said, \u201cI am placing this man under arrest for being a suspicious person.\u201d The plaintiff was then \u201cbooked,\u201d and after his pockets had been searched, and \u201chis valuables\u201d taken \u201cthe sergeant, when he saw the money, suggested that plaintiff bail himself out.\u201d The plaintiff declined, and was taken by police officers to a cell. But the plaintiff was never \u201ctaken before a district court or trial justice to be examined and prosecuted\u201d as provided in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">There was evidence that certain personal property had been stolen the night before by breaking and entering a building in the vicinity, and that the person committing the crime probably used a small car, as the window through which entrance was effected was some distance from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ground, and that the defendant had made an investigation of the circumstances. The offence was a felony. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 20; c. 274, \u00a7 1. It is settled that if the defendant as a police officer had reasonable cause to suspect that the plaintiff was guilty of a felony he had the right to arrest him without a warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Phelps, 209 Mass. 396, 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The defendant, called as a witness by the plaintiff, was asked on cross-examination, \u201cDid you consider the plaintiff might have been guilty of that crime? \u201d The question was excluded and the defendant excepted. The defendant\u2019s counsel however then said, \u201cI will change the form of the question,\u201d and asked, \u201cdid you believe at any time that Mr. Wax was guilty of a crime?\u201d \u201cYes, sir . . . ,\u201d and in response to other questions gave his reasons for that belief. The defendant therefore suffered no prejudicial error. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>186 Mass. 456, 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The present action is not for malicious prosecution, a wrong distinct from that of false imprisonment, which consists in imposing by force or threats an unlawful restraint upon freedom of movement. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>144 Mass. 365. If the arrest was found illegal, the detention at the station and in a cell was also illegal, and a continuing tort for which the defendant is responsible. <em>Bath </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>145 Mass. 274. It follows, that the restraint of the plaintiff against his will was wrongful, and constituted a false imprisonment unless justification was shown by the defendant on whom the burden of proving it rested. The defendant\u2019s sixth request that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was no probable cause for the arrest on the part of the defendant, or that it was done maliciously could not have been given. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>10 Cush. 418. <em>Bath </em>v. <em>Metcalf, supra. Jackson </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>173 Mass. 94. The third request, that \u201cit will be inferred from the facts and from the absence of evidence to the contrary that the defendant\u2019s conduct was in pursuance of his authority and in accordance with it,\u201d was also denied rightly. These questions were for the jury under appropriate instructions. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>7 Gray, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The defendant by the thirteenth request asked the judge to rule, \u201cThat the defendant is not bound to show in his justification that a felony was actually committed to render the arrest lawful. He is sufficiently within his rights if he suspects one on his own knowledge of facts or on facts communicated to him by others, and thereupon he has reasonable grounds to suspect that the accused has been guilty of felony, the arrest is not unlawful.\u201d It was a correct statement of the law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>209 Mass. 396, 404. But the judge was not required to give this request as framed, and the following instructions sufficiently safeguarded the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u201cNow the fact, if it be a fact, upon the evidence, that at the time of the arrest the police officer suspected that this man had been guilty of a felony, . . . which I understand to be the claim, of the suspicion that existed in the mind of the officer at that time, the fact that he believed that this man was involved in a break which occurred somewhere in that neighborhood on the night before, \u2014 the fact, I say, that he may have suspected him of that is not conclusive by way of exonerating him of his action. . . . The question as to whether or not he acted in good faith in what he believed to be in the performance of his duty or whether he acted maliciously and the intent with which his action was taken, whether it was merely the good intent of a really loyal officer performing his duty and protecting the citizens of the town or otherwise, is not an issue which determines the responsibility here. The fact he entertained suspicion against this person is material so far as it goes but it doesn\u2019t go far enough unless the suspicions that he entertained were reasonable suspicions, and that I think is the crux of this case. And with respect to the ordinary rule which is laid down in most of the cases in regard to what is reasonable, what is a reasonable cause for suspecting a person of having committed a felony as defined by the courts is: \u2018Probable cause is a reasonable ground of suspicion of guilt, or guilt suspected, by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious and prudent man in entertaining an honest belief that a party is guilty.\u2019 And if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>acted on such information as would induce a reasonably prudent man to believe the plaintiff guilty he was not liable. In other words, did the defendant in this case in what he did in the way of putting the plaintiff under arrest, have before him such evidence or information, either in what he saw or what they told to him with respect to the plaintiff, as to justify a reasonably cautious and prudent man in suspecting the plaintiff of having been involved in the breaking and entering of a store some distance down the same street? . . . If the defendant under all the circumstances acting as a reasonably cautious and prudent person, was justified in entertaining those suspicions in view of all the circumstances disclosed, then that is an adequate and sufficient defence in this case. It would not make any difference as to whether or not it might afterwards turn out that the party whom he arrested was innocent. Nevertheless, if his conduct or actions were of such an apparently compromising character as to justify a reasonable person in suspecting him of complicity in a felony, that is sufficient to justify the officer.\u201d 1</p>\n<p id=\"AnE2\">If the plaintiff chose to waive the statutory requirement he could consent to his release without being taken before a court or magistrate, and discharge any claim he otherwise might have had against the defendant. <em>Keefe </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>213 Mass. 476, 482. The defendant pleads such a release under seal, with a further provision releasing the defendant from any liability. The evidence of the circumstances under which the release was obtained was conflicting. While the sergeant testified that the defendant signed of his own free will, the jury on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony would have been warranted in finding, that the plaintiff was searched, and the sergeant when he saw the money suggested, \u201cthat plaintiff bail himself out.\u201d The plaintiff asked \u201chow much it would cost,\u201d and was told $2. He replied, \u201cThis thing wouldn\u2019t cost me a red cent.\u201d The plaintiff was then taken to a cell by several officers and after he had been there two hours an officer visited him and said, \u201cWell, it seems we know who you are, but you will have to sign a paper, \u201d and a colloquy followed. The plaintiff inquired as to the nature of the paper, and was then told, \u201cWe want you to sign a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>paper if you want to get out. It is simply a paper you want to get out with your consent.\u201d The plaintiff declined, and was told to \u201cthink it over. \u201d \u201cWell, have you thought it over about signing a paper to get out?\u201d The plaintiff said, \u201cI will tell you, I want to get out. I have two children at home. There is a housekeeper with them and they are worried when I don\u2019t get home at a certain hour. I suppose I will have to sign if I want to get out. I am not signing any paper willingly.\u201d \u201cIf that is the only way I can get out I will sign it, I am signing the paper because it is you tells me to sign it, who the other man is I don\u2019t know.\u201d The plaintiff was then led from the cell to the sergeant\u2019s desk, who told him to sign it. The plaintiff signed the alleged release, received his \u201cvaluables\u201d and money, walked into the yard, and drove his car out. It was for the jury to determine whether the plaintiff voluntarily executed and delivered the release, or whether he was induced to act in the belief pressed upon him and reiterated by the officer, that unless he signed he could not regain his freedom. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>155 Mass. 233. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Thissell, </em>240 Mass. 541. It also was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff was led to believe by the officer\u2019s representations that the paper was only a waiver of arraignment, when it also contained a release of the defendant from all civil liability. <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The refusal of the defendant\u2019s first request that on all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover shows no error of law. The defendant excepted \u201cto the charge relative to the release.\u201d It is contended the instructions were erroneous. In examining the charge no error is found. The instructions were sufficiently full and clear. \u201c\u2018If it is found that the plaintiff consented to his release without being brought before a magistrate and waives this requirement of the law and discharges the defendant against any claim for damages, then the jury must find for the defendant.\u2019 I am reading one of the defendant\u2019s requests. So, as far as this phase of the case is concerned, the issue turns upon your determination of the \u2022 circumstances under which that release was signed, because the plaintiff says that, while that may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>true in the case of the release, [if] it has been voluntarily executed by the plaintiff, in this particular case the general rule would not apply because this was not a case of voluntary release but a release which was obtained from the plaintiff by coercion or duress and where he was in such a condition that he was practically told that he would have to sign that release in order to be released from his confinement in the cell. With respect to that issue the principle involved, is, I think, fairly and adequately covered in the opinion of the court in another case and I will read from that opinion inasmuch as it seems to bear on this issue: \u2018The plaintiff argues that in the case at bar consent or request was obtained by the procurement of the defendant and unfairly. Undoubtedly when a party is under arrest any agreement or arrangement that he may make to waive any further proceeding and to release any damages he may be entitled to if such proceedings are not taken is one to be carefully scrutinized. It would be a question for the jury to decide whether it was fairly and intelligently made or whether it was procured by false representation or by any coercion exercised or by means of the fact that the party making them was then under arrest. If so procured the party would not be bound by it.\u2019 That is the issue in regard to this release. If the release was executed by the plaintiff of his own volition and of his own free will and accord, free from coercion or restraint existing either from words or from any circumstances which may have existed at the time, it constitutes a complete defence to any action now brought. If, on the other hand, the release was procured by coercion, by means of the fact that the party making the release was then under arrest, or otherwise, then the release would not affect the rights of the parties in this action and should be disregarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The exception, \u201cto your charge as to when the arrest took place\u201d not having been argued need not be considered, and, finding no reversible error, the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
