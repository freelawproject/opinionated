Paniagua\u2019s crime was found to be murder of the first degree and his punishment was fixed as life imprisonment. Appellant Wattie was found guilty of second degree murder and he was sentenced to imprisonment for the term prescribed by law. A codefendant, Robert Calvillo, also was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to prison. He has not appealed. Paniagua died during the pendency of these appeals and his appeal was dismissed on June 12,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Appellant Wattie contends that prejudicial error was com- \u25a0 mitted (1) when the court admitted into evidence the statements given to the police by appellant and Calvillo following their arrest; and (2) when the court admitted the testimony of a fellow prisoner concerning statements made to him by Paniagua in the county jail where both men were awaiting trial. Appellant argues that if these extrajudicial statements had not been received in evidence, it is reasonably probable that the jury might have found him guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. We find no merit in either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Quite apart from the admissions made by the several defendants in their extrajudicial statements, the other uncontradieted, direct and unquestionably competent evidence was so overwhelming that the proof of the guilt of all three defendants was realistically conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The record portrays an unusually sordid picture. It shows that the three defendants had spent the afternoon of February 10, 1965, drinking wine with Frank Rochin, the victim of the murder, in an area near a crossing of the Pacific Electric and Santa Fe railroad tracks. At approximately 4:30 p.m. of that afternoon they were seen placing wood upon a large and intense fire from which the victim\u2019s feet were protruding. An autopsy revealed that although the victim had sustained certain rather severe injuries to his head before he was placed under heavy bedsprings and set afire, the cause of death was heat burns of the head, torso, arms and legs. Contributing to death was a searing of the lining membranes of the larynx arid a swelling of the air passages into the lungs causing him \u201ct\u00f3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>choke up and die.\u201d These findings definitely established that the deceased had been alive and breathing while in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Blood of the victim\u2019s type, as well as hairs from his head, were found upon defendants' shoes and clothing. A witness observed defendants kicking something in \"sort of a drainage ditch\u201d near the railroad tracks and thereafter saw them carrying someone who was unable to walk to the spot where the victim was subsequently cremated. Later in the evening of February 10, 1965, police officers stopped a group of six or seven men, including Paniagua and Calvillo, walking in the area and inquired of them as to their activities that day. Paniagua denied that he had been near the railroad tracks, asserting that he had been home all day. Calvillo made similar false statements. When the men's hands were examined Paniagua\u2019s and Calvillo\u2019s were found to bear \u201cgrayish black smudges\u201d resembling marks made by charcoal or ashes and \u201creddish brown spots.\u201d When asked about the latter spots Paniagua stated that he had \u201cjust killed a chicken. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Paniagua and Calvillo were arrested and fully advised of their constitutional rights to remain silent, to have the assistance of counsel at all stages in the proceedings, that they need not answer any questions asked of them but if they did <em>\u201c</em>anything said by them could be used in subsequent proceedings. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Following his arrest, while Paniagua was seated alone in a room with a \u201cone-way glass,\u201d he was seen licking his hands. In his.subsequent statement to the police Paniagua admitted that he had been drinking wine at the scene of the murder but asserted that he had returned home at about 3 p.m. and cleaned up the yard. Subsequently he went for a walk with a friend and was arrested. When advised that samples of the bloodstains on his hands would be examined and if they were not chicken blood he would not be able to \u201cfool\u201d the chemical tests, Paniagua said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, because it doesn\u2019t prove anything anyway.\u201d Trousers, shoes and socks found in Paniagua\u2019s residence were stained with blood of the victim\u2019s type. The blood on Paniagua\u2019s hands was determined to be human blood although its type could not be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Calvillo made a free and voluntary statement with full knowledge of his constitutional rights in which he admitted that he and his codefendants had been sharing wine purchased by the victim. He stated that \u201cabout 4:00 or 4:30\u201d the victim had. ref used to give Paniagua a drink from his most recently purchased bottle and therefore Paniagua took it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>from him. When the victim became angry and began calling his companions names, Paniagua hit him in the face, whereupon the victim fled, running along the side of the railroad tracks. The three defendants pursued him and when they caught him they knocked him down and kicked him repeatedly in the head and body. They then carried him back to the place where they had been drinking and where a fire was burning in a barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Defendants then decided to \u201cfinish him off\u201d so that he \u201cwon\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d They covered him with boards, added the bedsprings and more boards over them and then \"dumped the barrel of fire onto the pile of boards\u201d and \u201che started burning up.\u201d The victim could be heard moaning while the flames consumed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">After the parties had left the scene, appellant Wattie apparently suffered remorse and blamed Paniagua for what they had done and told him that he intended \u201cto put the finger\u201d on him to the police. Paniagua then struck appellant in the head several times with a rock and left him in a ditch beside the tracks while he returned to his house where he changed his shoes, socks and trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The following evening appellant Wattie also made a statement to the police in the Los Angeles County General Hospital where he was being treated for the head injuries inflicted by Paniagua following the murder. Following a full <em>voir dire </em>hearing the trial court expressly found that this statement was freely and voluntarily given after appellant had been advised of his constitutional rights in accordance with the rule enunciated in <em>People </em>v. Dorado, 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361],</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">His statement substantially corroborated that given by Calvillo except that he tried to cast the primary responsibility for the murder upon his companions. That is, although he admitted kicking the victim in the head and standing by the fire hearing the victim \u201cgrunting\u201d as the flames consumed him, he asserted that it was Calvillo\u2019s idea to burn the victim and that it was Calvillo who had put the fire from the barrel onto the victim\u2019s pyre. After they left the scene appellant told Paniagua that he was going to \u201cfinger him,\u201d whereupon Paniagua hit him above the left eye, knocldng him unconscious. At the time he made his statement appellant said he was then \u201cin control of\u201d his \u201csenses\u201d and that the medication he had been given was not pills that \u201cput\u201d him \u201cout\u201d and he remembered \"everything\" he told the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>. In addition to the foregoing evidence, the prosecution called one Glenn Walton as a witness. Walton testified that on June 4, 1965, he was a prisoner in the Los Angeles County jail awaiting trial on charges of robbery and issuing checks without sufficient funds to honor them. He was in a \u201ctank\u201d with some 35 other prisoners including Paniagua. Walton testified that although he had only completed the ninth grade in school, he had taken certain correspondence school law courses and intended to represent himself in his impending criminal cases. As a result the other inmates sometimes called him \u201clawyer\u201d and asked his opinion on various problems of their own. Walton testified that he never solicited these confidences since they interfered with his efforts to prepare his own case. He had never been asked by the police to obtain any information from his fellow prisoners and at the time of his conversations with Paniagua he had no intention of disclosing the contents thereof to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">During several conversations with Walton, Paniagua told him what evidence had been produced at his preliminary hearing and, based thereon, Paniagua expressed his opinion concerning the proof the prosecution would be able to make at his trial. He also told Walton the details of what actually had occurred. He told how he and two others had knocked the victim down and kicked and \u201cstomped\u201d him; how they had carried him across the tracks and put him down by the can where they had a fire going that day; how they had piled wood on top of the victim and set it afire because he was \u201cno good\u201d and they \u201chad to get rid of the body;\u201d how the victim was moving and moaning and groaning while they were adding wood to the fire; how they had sat around the fire drinking wine for an hour or so while the body was being consumed by the flames; how, when they left the scene, appellant had said that \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have done that or something\u201d and Paniagua \u201cgot mad at that and hit him in the head; \u2019 \u2019 how he had then returned to his house and changed clothes and washed his hands to get the blood off.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Appellant was the only defendant who took the stand and, while he did not deny committing the murder, he testified that he had been too drunk to remember the events surrounding the victim\u2019s death and had merely repeated to the officers who questioned him the facts they had already related to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Obviously the foregoing evidence abundantly sustains the jury\u2019s verdicts as to each defendant. In Paniagua\u2019s case the evidence establishes that the killing was wilful, deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and premeditated and further that the victim was intentionally killed by a method designed to produce pain and suffering sufficient to constitute torture. Murder so perpetrated is murder of the first degree. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The intent to cause a victim to suffer in murder by torture may be inferred from the circumstances of the killing including the condition of the deceased\u2019s body and the admissions of a defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turville, </em>51 Cal.2d 620, 632 [335 P.2d 678]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Misquez, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 471, 480 [313 P.2d 206], See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>38 Cal.2d 556, 561 [241 P.2d 224], where the defendant poured gasoline on the victim and ignited it, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>50 Cal.2d 778, 789 [329 P.2d 907], where the defendants, to avenge ejection from a bar, poured gasoline on the floor and ignited it, killing a victim by asphyxia and severe burns.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The necessary wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation may be inferred from a variety of circumstances. Such circumstances include considerations of the method causing death, the means of disposing of the body and efforts to prevent its identification, the conduct of a defendant prior to and after the crime, the lack of provocation, the act of dragging a victim from one place to another where a murderous attack is continued, and the persistence in continuing an ultimately fatal attack. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rittger, </em>54 Cal.2d 720, 730 [7 Cal.Rptr. 901, 355 P.2d 645]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>30 Cal.2d 694, 701 [185 P.2d 11]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Eggers, </em>30 Cal.2d 676, 686 [185 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 193, 197 [344 P.2d 333].)  If the findings of fact which are implicit in the verdict are supported by the facts established and the reasonable inferences therefrom, then such findings are conclusive on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 458, 497 [1 Cal.Rptr. 600].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Similarly, the facts established in the instant record are unquestionably sufficient to sustain the jury's determination that appellant was guilty of murder of the second degree. Appellant admitted kicking the victim and blood and hairs from his head were found on appellant\u2019s shoes. He was seen to assist the others in carrying the victim back to the fire, and even if his relatively self-serving explanation as to what transpired thereafter was to be accepted at face value, he eoncededly stood passively by while the victim of the joint assault in which he had participated was being burnt alive by his associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Appellant\u2019s contention regarding the asserted inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>missibility of the testimony of the witness Walton is wholly unmeritorious since there is no evidence whatsoever to support the basic assumptions upon which it is based. That is, appellant argues that Paniagua\u2019s conversations with Walton were protected by the attorney-client privilege provided by Code of Civil Procedure, section 1881, subdivision 2, and further, relying on <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199], that Walton was an agent for the prosecution who deliberately elicited Paniagua\u2019s statements from him in violation of his constitutional right to representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">However, the only evidence on the subject, which was not controverted in any fashion by Paniagua, establishes that at all times Paniagua knew that Walton was not a lawyer, that Walton told him that he was not a lawyer, that Walton advised him to seek the advice of a lawyer and told him that he would be a fool to try to handle the case himself. We, therefore, need not consider appellant\u2019s abstract speculations concerning the possibility that an attorney-client privilege might exist where one person falsely claims to be an attorney and another person in reliance thereon divulges damaging information to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Similarly, there is no evidence tending to establish that Walton was an agent of the police. Walton clearly and convincingly testified that he had never sought any information from any prisoner and had no intention of communicating to the police the information they imparted to him at the time he received it. Walton testified that in discussing his own case with the officers after his conversations with Paniagua, he made some casual mention of Paniagua\u2019s case which led the officers to ask him to make a statement to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>do so because he wanted \u201cto straighten out\u2019\u2019 his own life and believed that complete honesty was a necessary prerequisite thereto. <em>The </em>police promised him no reward nor any leniency in connection with his own problems in return for his cooperation and he expected none. Since the undisputed facts in the instant case establish that Walton was not acting in cooperation or complicity with the state, Paniagua\u2019s statements to him clearly were outside the proscription of <em>Massiah. (People </em>v. <em>Pricc, </em>63 Cal.2d 370, 378 [46 Cal.Rptr. 775, 406 P.2d 55]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Teale, </em>63 Cal.2d 178, 184-185, 195-196 [45 Cal.Rptr. 729, 404 P.2d 209]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 358, 371 [49 Cal.Rptr. 772] et seq.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 807, 810-812 [46 Cal.Rptr. 412].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Nevertheless, although the statements of each defendant were properly admissible in evidence against such defendant, appellant is correct in his contention that the trial court erred in failing to conform to the new rules regulating the use of extrajudicial statements subsequently promulgated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, 530-531 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265]. The partial retroactivity of these rules was established in <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>66 Cal.2d 330, 335-337 [57 Cal. Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d 545], This error, however, does not require automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In <em>Aranda </em>the court stated at pages 526-527; \"The giving of such instructions [that a confession implicating both defendants is to be considered only against the declarant], however, and the fact that the confession is only an accusation against the nondeclarant and thus lacks the shattering impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of a self-incriminatory statement by him [citation] preclude holding that the error of admitting the confession is always prejudicial to the nondeclarant.\u201d That is to say, even in a case such as <em>Aranda </em>where the confession in issue should never have been admitted into evidence in the first instance, and its receipt automatically required a reversal of the judgment as to Aranda\u2019s codefendant, the declarant, it was still necessary to apply California Constitution, article VI, section 13, before determining whether or not a reversal was required as to Aranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In <em>Aranda, </em>\u201csome doubt\u201d was east upon the evidence tending to identify appellant Aranda as one of the two robbers. He took the stand and testified to his innocence and his testimony was partially corroborated by that of a police officer. Moreover, apart from his codefendant\u2019s confession, \u201cNo evidence linked the two [defendants] together at any other time relevant to the commission of the robbery.\u201d (P. 531, fn. 10.) Under these circumstances, the court concluded that the judgment should be reversed as to Aranda, who had consistently maintained his innocence, as well as to his codefendant who had confessed but whose confession was improperly obtained in violation of the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On the other hand, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 330, the court concluded that a violation of the <em>Aranda </em>rule did not require a reversal as to Charles even though a reversal was ordered as to his codefendant whose confession obtained in violation of <em>Dorado </em>implicated Charles. Charles, unlike Aranda, had himself confessed to the crime charged and his confession was properly received in evidence against him. In addition, the evidence <em>aliunde </em>the confessions, was strongly demonstrative of Charles \u2019 guilt. The court passed upon this question in the following language at pages 337-338:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cAs we have previously indicated, however, failure to adhere to the <em>Aranda </em>procedure constitutes reversible error only if it causes prejudice. Although we find no such prejudice here as to either defendant, the record fails to dispel Boddie\u2019s contention that his confession, unlike that of Charles, was obtained in violation of <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Dorado. </em>As we later explain, the introduction of Boddie\u2019s inadmissible confession constituted error as to both defendants; that error was automatically prejudicial as to Boddie but not as to Charles. We have therefore concluded that the conviction of Boddie, but not that of Charles, must be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cTurning first to the basic <em>Aranda </em>violation, we consider crucial the fact that each defendant\u2019s case was completely shattered by his own detailed confession, corroborated by the eyewitness testimony of the robbery victim. In this setting, the fact that each defendant was also implicated by his eodefendant\u2019s confession cannot realistically have contributed to either conviction. Although the present case was tried by a judge sitting without a jury, we need not decide whether that fact alone would here preclude the requisite showing of prejudice, since we find no reasonable probability in this case that even a jury would have returned a more favorable verdict for either defendant if, as required by <em>Aranda, </em>the defendants had been tried separately or each confession had been \u2018edited\u2019 to include no references damaging to the nondeclarant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>66 Cal.2d 536, 558-559 [58 Cal.Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908], in which consistent confessions by each of three defendants were received in evidence, the court disposed of the <em>Aranda </em>error in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cIn view of the other competent and overwhelming evidence against both Hill and Saunders, the codefendants\u2019 confessions could not have had any reasonable bearing on the convictions. Hill\u2019s confession of September 23, individually admissible against him, shows the depraved and senseless manner in which he elected to kill his victim. Saunders\u2019 statements of September 19 and particularly of September 23, when considered ivith other direct and circumstantial evidence independent of his codefendants\u2019 extrajudicial statements, admittedly constitute a confession and clearly establishes his guilt under the felony-murder doctrine. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles [supra] ante, </em>pp. 330, 338 [57 Cal.Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d 545].) In addition to the confessions, Madorid\u2019s testimony of the participation of each defendant in the crimes was incriminating and substantial. Niehoff testified as to the very incriminating conduct and statements made by defendants while he was forced to drive them to Las Vegas, and Mr. Woslc and other persons testified concerning Hill\u2019s and Madorid\u2019s conduct at the liquor store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cWhen the impact of the foregoing is weighed against the codefendant confessions, vitiated by the trial court\u2019s instructions that the jury should not consider them as evidence against the nondeclarants (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 690, 702 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365]), we must conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the jury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>would have returned a more favorable verdict for either TTill or Saunders if, as required by <em>Aranda, </em>they had been tried separately. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a713; <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, [supra] ante, </em>pp. 330, 332 [57 Cal.Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d 545]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) A reversal as to either defendant thus cannot be predicated on this ground.\u201d (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>66 Cal.2d 482, 494 [58 Cal.Rptr. 361, 426 P.2d 929] et seq. where the evidence of guilt was so \u201cextremely close, [that] \u2018any substantial error tending to discredit the defense, or to corroborate the prosecution, must be considered as prejudicial.' [Citation.] \u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">As we have previously indicated, the evidence against appellant apart from his own confession, and those of his codefendants, was exceedingly strong. He was seen Melting something in an area where blood of the victim\u2019s type was later discovered. Similar blood stains were found upon his shoes, the upper right leg of his trousers and upon his shirt. A nine inch dark brown human head hair, approaching black, was found \u201cdraped over\u201d both the interior and exterior side of his shoe. A human leg hair also was found on one of his shoes, and these hairs were so similar to each other and to another found upon codefendant Calvillo\u2019s shoes that they could have come from the same individual. The victim\u2019s sister described his hair as being of the the type found on appellant\u2019s shoe. Further, appellant was seen and identified as sitting beside the fire while the victim\u2019s body was being consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In his own confession, appellant admitted kicking the deceased twice during the period he was on the ground and later listening to him \u201cgrunting\u201d as he was being burned alive. Somewhat paradoxically the statements of appellant\u2019s codefendants tended to aid appellant in that they confirmed and stressed those aspects of his involvement that might have gained him some consideration from the jury. They corroborated his claim of being intoxicated and his statement that he had expressed feelings of remorse after the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Perhap Paniagua might reasonably have argued that he had been prejudiced by the <em>Aranda </em>error here involved since, absent the parties\u2019 several extrajudicial statements, there would be little basis for finding him more culpable than his companions. However, such error was. certainly not prejudicial to appellant. We, therefore, dispose of this aspect of appellant\u2019s appeal in the following apposite paraphrase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 330, 338:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUZ\">\u201cTurning first to the basic <em>Aranda </em>violation, we consider crucial the fact that each defendant\u2019s ease was completely-shattered by his own detailed confession, corroborated by the eyewitness testimony of [the independent witnesses]. In this setting, the fact that each defendant was also implicated by his codefendant [s\u2019] confession cannot realistically have contributed to [his own] conviction. . . . [W]e find no reasonable probability in this case that [the] jury would have returned a more favorable verdict for [appellant] if, as required by <em>Aranda, </em>the defendants had been tried separately or each confession had been \u2018 edited \u2019 to include no references damaging to the non-declarant [s]. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Finally, we find nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>64 Cal. 2d 310, 324-325 [49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911], which would require a reversal in the instant case. Although this case was tried before the decision in <em>Conley </em>and therefore the suggested instruction set forth in footnote 4 was not given, appellant concedes that \u201cmanslaughter instructions were given as well as instructions on voluntary intoxication . . .

Now, it is not clear to me just how this conversation turned with the officer on the robbery matter\u2014turned to the homicide case which Mr. Paniagua was involved in. How did that come up, precisely, if you remember? A. I was saying something about\u2014he said, \u2018Well, you are handling your own ease,\u2019 is what the robbery officer said, and I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 And said something\u2014he said, \u2018I bet you that you\u2014 . . .\u2019\u2014you know, better get a private counsel. And I told him I was thinking about it because I was being, you know, a lot of the time disturbed by the inmates in the jail while I was working on my own case. And I said there\u2019s one up there that kept bothering me quite often on a murder, and kept asking for legal advice, or some such. I said, \u2018Guys like that . . .\u2019 and I believe that was the way I termed it\u2014I said, \u2018 Guys like that make it sort of rough,\u2019 I said, \u2018to work on my own case.\u2019 So then some of the details of it came out and- Q. Just a minute now. That\u2019s what I am asking you. You say some of the details came out. How did they come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>out? A. Just in tlie manner I tried to explain to you. Q. Well, they just sort of boiled right out of you or out of the officer, or out of who? You say some of them came out. Now, I don\u2019t understand it. A. Well, the remarks that I made were concerning people disturbing me while I was working on my own ease. I just happened to mention one guy that had been disturbing me most that was in there for a murder charge, and he kept trying to elicit information or answers from me. Q. The officer then started asking you about the facts of the other man\u2019s ease? A. No. I had said something about it; he was in for killing a guy in Norwalk, burned him to death, and that he had said that he was going to beat it because the other guy had signed a confession, or something, but they were going to make him look bad in court. So then he told me just to sit there. He said, \u2018Just sit there.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I will call somebody else.\u2019 And that\u2019s \"when I spoke to Mr. Sholund. Q. Were you asked at that time if you would be willing to come down and testify against Mr. Paniagua? A. Yes. Q. When was that? A. That was after the statement was taken, I believe. Q. Did you ever ask the officer at any time if he would be willing to speak a good word for you or try to help you in the processing of your ease? A. No, I did not. Q. You never asked him if he would help at all? A. No, I didn\u2019t. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
