The judgment was entered following an order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend. The Appellate Department of the Superior Court for Los Angeles County-reversed the judgment with directions and, on its own motion certified to this court, pursuant to rule 63, California Rules of Court, that a transfer appears necessary to settle an important question of law. We transferred the case for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The question of law to be settled is: Does a joint payee of a check have a cause of action against a collecting bank which pays a check payable to joint payee signing his own name and forging that of the other joint payee? The appellate department answered this question in the affirmative for the reasons set forth in the opinion prepared by that court by Judge Aiso, in which Judge Meyers concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We believe that the decision of the appellate department is correct for the reasons stated in Judge Aiso\u2019s opinion, and now adopt that opinion as the opinion of this court. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cThe question posed by this appeal is: Does a joint payee of a cheek having a cause of action against a collecting bank<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has paid a check made payable to joint payees bearing an indorsement effected by one joint payee signing his own name and forging that of his joint payee? We hold \u2018yes\u2019 under both the Negotiable Instruments Law (former sections of the Civil Code, now repealed but applicable to this case) and the California Commercial Code\u2014Commercial Paper provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cThe facts alleged by plaintiff in his first amended complaint in essence are: Plaintiff is a materialman, which sold lumber products to defendant Timberline Roofing Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for use on a construction project owned and built by Air-Tare (a joint venture group, not a party to this action). To insure that the subcontractor defendant Timberline Roofing Company would pay plaintiff for its material furnished, Air-Tare drew four checks here involved on the First Western Bank and Trust Company (not a party herein), each made payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>to the order of the subcontractor Timberline Roofing Company And plaintiff Harry H. White Lumber Co., Inc., and delivered said checks to the joint payee Timberline Roofing Company, Timberline indorsed its name and then forged plaintiff\u2019s indorsement on each of those checks, presented them to and received payment thereon from defendant Crocker-Citizens National Bank, a collecting bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThe four cheeks with respective dates of issue and of amounts are as follows: 1. December 10, 1964, $2,133.34 2. December 17, 1964, $746.66 3. December 24, 1964, $960 4. January 15,1965, $1,920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cPlaintiff avers an interest in the four cheeks in the amount of $2,472, representing the unpaid balance due and payable to it for lumber products sold to the joint payee, defendant Timberline Roofing Company, and that it has been damaged in that amount by the collecting bank\u2019s actions with reference to those four checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\"The Uniform Commercial Code superseded the Civil Code sections embodying the Negotiable Instruments Law, as of January 1, 1965. The first three checks are governed, therefore, by provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and the last check by the Uniform Commercial Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cGrounds on Which Demurrer Was Sustained</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint was in two counts: count one: in essence set forth the facts outlined above, and count two: was a common count for money had and received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cThe defendant collecting bank (Crocker-Citizens National Bank) interposed demurrers, general and special, to the complaint and to each count separately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cThe minute order sustaining the general demurrer reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u2018 On March 8, 1967, court orders Demurrer sustained without leave to amend; on grounds: Obligations of defendant, if any, have been discharged.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">\u201cThe trial court apparently accepted the demurring defendant\u2019s theory that the cases of <em>Cober </em>v. <em>Connolly </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 741 [128 P.2d 519, 142 A.L.R. 367], and <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1926) 256 Mass. 281 [152 N.E. 82], and Civil Code, sections 3200, subdivision (4) and 1475<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>governed.  In so doing, the trial court misconstrued the applicability of the California authorities mentioned to the facts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and circumstances of this ease. The <em>Dewey </em>case is not binding upon us and, in this instance, not persuasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\"Checks Governed by Negotiable Instruments Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cThe <em>Cober </em>case, supra, was a suit between the maker of a note and a joint payee who had received no benefit from a performance in kind which one of his other joint payees had received in lieu of money from the maker. No question of negotiation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the instrument was there involved.  Here, the collecting bank was not a party to the sale of lumber products to the subcontractor, joint payee Timber line Roofing Company. The defendant bank\u2019s rights, if any, came only through negotiation of the cheeks. Hence, it is our view that the statutory provisions here applicable are Civil Code, sections 3122 and 3104, rather than sections 3200, subdivision (4), and 1475.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\"Section 3122 (U.N.I.A., \u00a741) provided: 'Where an instrument is payable to the order of two or more payees or indorsees who are not partners, all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\"Section 3104 provided: \u2018When a signature is forged or made without authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto, can be acquired through or under such signature, unless the party, against whom it is sought to enforce such, right, is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cAlthough no mention is made of these code sections in the opinion, it has been held where a negotiation apparently took place that the underlying obligation (for which the joint payee check was given in payment) was not discharged by payments on an indorsement effected by one of two joint payees without authority of the other. <em>(Helgeson </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(App. Dept., Superior Court, San Francisco, 1953) 116 Cal.App.2d Supp. 925 [255 P.2d 484].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cThere appears to be no California ease specifically construing Civil Code, section 3122, in the light of Civil Code, section 3104. However, the overwhelming weight of authority in the other jurisdictions holds the collecting bank liable to a joint payee whose signature has been forged, where the collecting bank has paid a negotiable instrument made payable to the order of joint payees and presented to it without compliance with section 41 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3122). <em>(Kaufman </em>v. <em>State Savings Bank </em>(1908) 151 Mich. 65 [114 N.W. 863, 864]; <em>Crahe </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust &amp; Sav. Bank </em>(1920) 295 Ill. 375 [129 N.E. 120, 12 A.L.R. 92]; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank of Chicago </em>(1939) 299 Ill.App. 290 [20 N.E.2d 121]; <em>Ocala Nat.

Bank </em>(1929) 197 N.C. 526 [150 S.E. 34, 37] ; <em>Midland Sav. &amp; Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Tradesmen\u2019s Nat. Bank </em>(10th Cir. 1932) 57 F.2d 686, 693-694; <em>Wormhoudt Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1942) 231 Iowa 928 [2 N.W.2d 267, 270]; <em>Fulton Nat. Bank of Atlanta </em>v. <em>Didschuneit </em>(1955) 92 Ga.App. 527 [88 S.E.2d 853].) The theory of these eas\u00e9s is that the. indorsement was defective and hence -passed .no.\"title in the checks to the indorsee or subsequent holders. <em>The Wormhoudt Lumber Co. </em>and <em>Fulton National Bank </em>eases, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>arose out of building construction circumstances similar to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201cIf <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1926) <em>supra, </em>256 Mass. 281 [152 N.E. 82], be construed as holding directly contrary to the two groups of cases cited above, it does not impress us as persuasive. It has been severely criticized as erroneous. (See: Beutel\u2019s Brannan on Negotiable Instruments (7th ed., 1948) at p. 633; 1 Stan. L. Rev. 730, 733, fn. 16 (1949).) Furthermore, it is doubtful whether it would be followed in Massachusetts today. (Cf. <em>Gill Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Freedman </em>(1959) <em>infra, </em>339 Mass. 303 [158 N.E.2d 863, 866].)  Where there is a choice in the area of commercial law we prefer adoption of the line of cases which comports with the purpose, intent, and custom of the mercantile and financial circles in making cheeks payable to joint payees. The cardinal purpose for so doing is to prevent either payee from transferring the instrument or receiving money on it without the concurrence of the other. (See: 8 N.C.L. Rev. 46, 48 (1929); 1 Stan. L. Rev., <em>supra, </em>730, 737-739 (1949).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cHeretofore, the California courts have held that where a single payee\u2019s indorsement has been forged, the payee may recover against a collecting bank upon the theory of conversion or quasi-contractual liability. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1963) Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7 87, pp. 640-641 and cases there cited; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1963) (dictum) 220 Cal.App.2d 665, 677-678 [34 Cal.Rptr. 82]; and see Note 100 A.L.R.2d 670, 673.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c We, therefore, hold that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action against the defendant collecting bank, CroekerCitizens National Bank, sufficient to withstand a general demurrer with reference to the checks governed by the pertinent provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3122 and 3104).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\"Checks Governed by Commercial Code</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cAs to the check issued after January 1, 1965, when the Commercial Code was in force, the plaintiff\u2019s position is even stronger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">\u201cThe relevant portion of the Commercial Code, section 3116 provides: \u2018An instrument payable to the order of two or more persons ... (b) If not in the alternative is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged or enforced only by all of them. \u2019 It has been commented with reference to this portion of section 3116, \u2018The effect of subd. (2) in California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>is probably to resolve a doubt arising from <em>Cober </em>v. <em>Connolly </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 741 [128 P.2d 519, 142 A.L.R. 367]. (See 1 Stan. L. Rev. 730-736.)\u2019 (Cal. Comments to Uniform Com. Code, \u00a7 3116, Deering\u2019s California Codes, p. 350.) By the express provisions of section 3116, subdivision (b), all the joint pa\u00edses must join not only for negotiation, but also for discharge as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cIn <em>Gill Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Freedman </em>(1959) <em>supra, </em>339 Mass. 303 [158 N.E.2d 863, 866], the same court that rendered the judgment in <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1926) <em>supra, </em>256 Mass. 281 [152 N.E. 82], in affirming a judgment holding a negotiating joint payee liable to the drawer in an action for money had and received even though he personally had not received any of the proceeds of the check, which was given as a down payment on a diesel 50-ton shovel never delivered, stated as follows: \u2018The cheek was payable to both the defendant <em>and </em>Porte. A receipt for the cheek was required in behalf of both of them. The indorsement of both of them was necessary to cash the check or otherwise to transfer it. See G.L. c. 107, \u00a7 64 (recently repealed by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 2, and, under \u00a7 1, supplanted by G.L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-116) ; D.C.Code (1940 ed.) \u00a7 28-312. See also cases cited in annotations to \u00a7 41 in Beutel\u2019s Brannan, Negotiable Instruments Law (7th Ed.) 631-634.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Other pertinent sections of the Commercial Code are: section 3404: \u2018 (1) Any unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it; but it operates as the signature of the unauthorized signer in favor of any person who in good faith pays the instrument or takes it for value. (2) Any unauthorized signature may be ratified for all purposes of this division. Such ratification does not of itself affect any rights of the person ratifying against the actual signer.\u2019 Section 1201, subdivision (43) : \u2018 \u201cUnauthorized\u201d signature or indorsement means one made without actual, implied or apparent authority and includes a forgery.\u2019 Section 3306: \u2018 Unless he has the rights of a holder in due course any person takes the instrument subject to . . . (d) The defense that he or a person through whom he holds the instrument acquired it by theft, . . .\u2019 Section 3419: \u2018 (1) An instrument is converted when . . . (c) It is paid on a forged indorsement. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cThe comments under sections 3404 and 3419 indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>section 3419 changes the preexisting California law and now gives the payee of a forged check a cause of action for conversion against the drawee (payor) bank. But no change is indicated as to the preexisting California case law permitting the payee to recover from a collecting bank which has paid out on a forged indorsement. (See: <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Cory. </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1962) Sup. Jud. Ct. of Mass. 345 Mass. 1 [184 N.E.2d 358, 362, 99 A.L.R2d 628].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\"Thus, the plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendant collecting bank on the check governed by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.  The demurrers here were both general and special. The order of the trial court sustaining the demurrers reflects a ruling on the basis of the general demurrers only; hence, the case must be returned to the trial court for consideration of the special demurrers. <em>(Stowe </em>v. <em>Fritzie Hotels, Inc. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 416, 425-426 [282 P.2d 890]; <em>Buss </em>v. <em>J.
