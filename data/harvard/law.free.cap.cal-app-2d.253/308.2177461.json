Defendant does not deny that he furnished marijuana to a state agent and the informer nor that he took their money. He claims that he was entrapped by the informer for whom he merely did a favor in acting as go-between to secure the marijuana; and that he was denied due process of law because, under the circumstances of this case, in which the prosecution was in communication with the informer up to and including the time of trial, there was an obligation on the prosecution to produce him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">This case involves the existence and extent of the obligation of the prosecution to facilitate the production of an informer as a witness, and the question of whether on the facts presented the prosecution violated such obligation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 748 [3 Cal.Rptr. 1, 349 P.2d 673].) It is concluded that there was no obligation on the prosecution to produce the informer; that there was a duty to disclose his identity and whereabouts, as known, and not to impede or interfere with the defendant\u2019s right to attempt to secure him as a witness; that the duty of disclosure was fulfilled; and that, under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no such interference on the part of the prosecution is sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\n<em>Statement of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The facts concerning the transfer of, and payment for, the marijuana, are not disputed in most particulars. It is, therefore, appropriate to consider the respective relationships of the defendant and the prosecution with the informer. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>chronological summary places his activities, and those of the other parties involved, in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The defendant, a young man, aged 23 at the time of the trial, testified that he had known Ronald Lopez, the informer, 10 or 15 years, and would have included him among his five or six best friends. The members of their respective families were friends and met frequently. He knew that Lopez had been using marijuana for five years, and had also sold it. In fact, during the period from March 1965 until March 1966, the defendant, according to his own testimony, had smoked marijuana with Lopez six or seven times. Lopez allegedly furnished the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In January 1965, Lopez married a Pat Robertson, who was 19 at the time of the trial. She testified that she was separated from Lopez and would be eligible for a final decree of divorce August 11,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">During the period from May 1965 to the latter part of July 1965, Lopez was in the Watsonville city jail, where he served as a trusty. Mrs. Lopez testified she visited him frequently in jail, and that during one of these visits she participated in a conversation between Lopez and Gerald Fagundes, a detective with the Watsonville Police Department, in which the three of them discussed the detective\u2019s proposal that Lopez work with him to break up a local prostitution ring. The detective indicated Lopez would be compensated every time he assisted. Fagundes denied contacting Lopez while he was in jail. Questioning on cross-examination of Mrs. Lopez indicated that Fagundes, Lopez and others were in fact involved in some conversation on that subject matter, which, despite the questioner\u2019s attempts to so establish, the witness did not consider facetious.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Fagundes, who was first called as a witness for the defendant, and subsequently, under circumstances hereinafter set forth, as the court\u2019s witness, testified that Lopez, whom he had known about six years, had acknowledged that he had some information about narcotic traffic in the City of Watson-ville ; that a meeting was arranged with state narcotic agents around the first of September 1965; that for the next six or seven months there was a general investigation in which Lopez participated; and that he never gave Lopez any money, nor, to his knowledge, did any local law enforcement agency do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Agent Armenia acknowledged that from August 1965 until sometime in February 1966, a \u201cbuy program\u201d was conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in the Watsonville area; that he saw Lopez several times a week, possibly every other day during this period; and that Lopez was paid for the expenses he incurred for food, money paid out, and things like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Agent Verbrugge, who observed a portion of the activities resulting in defendant\u2019s conviction, stated that he and Armenia were introduced to Lopez by Fagundes in September 1965; and that he worked with Lopez and saw him two or three times a week during the buy program.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Field Supervisor Ojeda, who testified for the prosecution concerning the custody of the evidence received on January 24th was thereafter called as a witness by the defendant. He testified that Lopez was paid by Agent Armenia, that he received the agent\u2019s vouchers, that Lopez received $5, $10, or possibly $15 at a time for expenses, and that the total did not exceed $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">According to Mrs. Lopez, at the time her husband was released from jail in July 1965 she was not living with him, but was living in Santa Clara, where she resided for about two months. She came down to Watsonville every weekend, and in August moved in with Lopez at his mother\u2019s house for about a week. According to her testimony, Lopez had ample spending money during all this period. He had marijuana in his possession most of the time, smoked it, and on two or three occasions she saw him pass it to others in return for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">In response to defendant\u2019s cross-examination, Agent Armenia testified that at the end of August or first of September 1965, the defendant was first pointed out as an alleged source of supply; that at that time the defendant\u2019s brother sent Armenia and Lopez to the defendant\u2019s home to purchase marijuana, but that the defendant was not there. He did not know whether Lopez had attempted to make other purchases from defendant. The defendant testified that from November 1965 through February 1966, Lopez persistently importuned him by telephone and in person to secure marijuana to satisfy the informer\u2019s habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The defendant acknowledged that on January 10th he asked around for marijuana without success; that on the 11th he found a source and told him he would advise him later how much he wanted for his contact; that Lopez telephoned him and, upon being advised of defendant\u2019s find, ordered two \u201ccans,\u201d and arrangements were made to meet at 4:30 p.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Lopez and Armenia picked up the defendant at his residence in Watsonville, and drove to a place designated by him. The defendant then left the car with $40 which had been paid to him and subsequently returned with two candy bars (observed), and two cans of marijuana (concealed). Defendant put the marijuana under the passenger side of the front seat where it was subsequently retrieved by the agent, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s instructions. The only discrepancies between the agent\u2019s account and that of the defendant are with respect to the manner in which Lopez designated the agent when he introduced him to defendant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s insistence that all his dealings were with Lopez rather than, as the agent testified, with Armenia. The agent further testified that defendant admitted that he had been smoking marijuana for approximately 13 years, did not believe it was bad and believed alcohol was worse, and that the agent\u2019s attempt to haggle over the price was countered with defendant\u2019s statement that he had been doing business with his source for a long time and had never been able to get a break in the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Defendant testified that after the incident on the 11th there were further calls from Lopez who said his uncle took most of the marijuana; that on January 23d he told Lopez that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get in any more trouble or anything because me and my wife had split up and I wanted to go back with her . . . she didn\u2019t want me ... to mess around with any marijuana\u201d; that Lopez insisted and offered defendant $10 if he would get him some more; that he (defendant) ultimately assented and on the 24th he went downtown keeping an eye open for the source; that the source confronted him and said he had more available; that he met Lopez, who wanted four cans so he could split with his uncle and another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>friend; that he arranged to meet him in the park at 3 p.m.; and that he then returned to the source, secured the four cans and hid them in his mother\u2019s hack yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The agent and defendant each testified that defendant drove up with a friend and met Lopez and Armenia in the vicinity of the downtown park; that defendant asked Lopez to come with him to get the marijuana, but rejected Armenia\u2019s overture to come along, and then told them both to meet him at another park in a few minutes. Defendant went with his friend to get the marijuana, and, according to his version, returned to the rendezvous, observed the purchasers\u2019 car, threw the contraband in the weeds, approached the passenger side of the other vehicle, conversed with Lopez, received $80 from him, of which a portion came from Armenia, and then went back downtown and turned the $80 over to his source. Armenia testified to substantially the same transaction, except that he stated that defendant came to the driver\u2019s side, conversed with him and received the $80 from him. He retrieved the package, which proved to contain marijuana, from the weeds. Agent Verbrugge, who was covering the operation with Fagundes and Ojeda, corroborated Armenia\u2019s testimony that the person who approached Armenia\u2019s car came to the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Defendant admitted that his source of supply was the same on each occasion, but he refused to name him \u201cbecause I am scared. Like they say, they are going to get somebody, money to get Bonnie [Lopez], I don\u2019t want them\u2014to have them to get me, too, you know.\u201d The court respected the defendant\u2019s feelings and did not require him to answer because it might expose him to great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The \u201cbuy program\u201d ended sometime around the first week of February 1966. Thereafter, and on or before February 23d, Lopez, Agents Armenia and Yerbrugge, Detective Fagundes and officers of the Capitola Police Department were present at a meeting in Capitola. Lopez was arrested by Armenia on one of several outstanding traffic warrants, including one from Monterey County, for driving with a suspended license in violation of section 14601 of the Yehicle Code. These warrants allegedly only came to the attention of the agents on that day. Lopez was delivered to the custody of the Capitola Chief of Police who took him to the Santa Cruz County jail. That was the last occasion on which Armenia saw Lopez, and there is no evidence that Yerbrugge ever saw him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On. February 23d, . Lopez was brought to the Monterey County jail in Salinas for traffic violations, and remained there until released on March 3d. Agents Armenia and Verbrugge each denied that Lopez was held in protective custody, and each opined that he would have preferred not to arrest the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On February 25th the grand jury held a hearing and indicted defendant and others; and on March 1st there were mass arrests in which defendant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On March 3d Detective Fagundes and a lieutenant of the Watsonville Police Department, who were at the district attorney\u2019s office in Salinas, were requested to give Lopez a ride back to Watsonville, and did so. Fagundes testified that this was the last time he saw Lopez. He denied that he discussed the informer\u2019s future plans, or that he made any arrangements for Lopez to leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The two agents, the field supervisor, and the detective, each testified that Lopez was told that he might have to testify in proceedings arising out of his activities. No one admitted telling him he would not have to testify. All acknowledged that Lopez had expressed fears for his personal safety. Armenia acknowledged it was possible that he told Lopez he could leave the area after he made the \u201cbuys,\u201d but the others denied that they ever so advised Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">It was stipulated that defendant\u2019s attorney first contacted the district attorney concerning the case on March 15th; that on March 17th a request for the identity and address of the informer was refused; that, as reflected in the record, the defendant moved the court for an order for discovery of this information; that the motion was granted on April 4th; and that on April 9th the defendant\u2019s attorney received the district attorney\u2019s letter dated April 7th which gave the informer\u2019s name, and his last known address as Monterey County jail. Two statements by the prosecution that the letter also divulged Lopez\u2019 mother\u2019s address in Watsonville, as the address he had given when booked at the jail, were never controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The defendant subsequently testified that on Monday, May 16th, at about 5 :30 or 6 p.m., the eve of the trial, he went to Lopez\u2019 house (the address of his mother) and was greeted by the wife of Lopez\u2019 brother, Sheldon. He then talked to Sheldon who said he did not know where Lopez was, and that he had not seen him. Lopez\u2019 mother joined the conversation and said that the last time she heard of Ronnie he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Santa Rosa, but she did not know where he was staying, or anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On May 17, 1966, the first day of trial, the prosecution produced the testimony of the two agents, the field supervisor, and a laboratory technician to establish the offenses of which the defendant was convicted. The defendant indicated in his cross-examination of Agent Armenia, the People\u2019s first witness, that he was going to insist on the production of Lopez. At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the defendant moved in the alternative that the prosecution produce Lopez, or that the case be dismissed. The court denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The defendant then called Detective Pagundes who testified generally concerning the introduction of Lopez to the state agents, and their subsequent relationship. Court thereupon adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Prom subsequent testimony it appeared that about 8 a.m. on Tuesday May 17th, the first day of the trial, Pagundes had received a phone call at his office from a person indicating he was Lopez.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Pagundes the voice sounded like that of a fellow officer with whom he had been working until midnight on a burglary case, and the salutation was not one with which Lopez customarily addressed him, so he did not really think it was Lopez. He was busy making an inventory of tools involved in the other case, and told the caller he would call him back. Pagundes testified that he never had a chance to return the call on the 17th before he testified, but did call Lopez back at 6:30 on the morning of the 18th.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">At 7:30 p.m. on the 17th, after he testified (or possibly, see fn. 4, supra, the 16th), Pagundes received a call from someone purporting to be Lopez. Pagundes testified that he said no more than that he, Pagundes, had to go out.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">On the evening of the 17th, after the first day of trial, the defendant, his brother, his attorney, Mrs. Lopez and Mrs. Lopez\u2019 younger sister conferred at defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. Lopez \u2019 sister-in-law called the Lopez family home between 8 and 8:30 and talked to a person whose voice she, Mrs. Lopez and defendant\u2019s brother, all identified as that of the informer. The court sustained the prosecution\u2019s objection to questions designed to elicit what Lopez may have said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>about prior conversations he had held with Fagundes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sister-in-law further testified that she had received a call from Lopez at 3 p.m. on the 17th.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Following this conversation, the defendant, his brother and his attorney went to the judge\u2019s home,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and then down to Santa Cruz to secure subpoenas for Mrs. Lopez and her sister, who were served, and for Lopez and Fagundes. At 11:30 p.m., defendant\u2019s brother attempted to serve Lopez at his mother\u2019s home. The door was answered by Sheldon\u2019s wife. Sheldon then came to the door and said that Ronald was not there. Lopez\u2019 mother came to the door and affirmed that he was not there, and stated that the last time she had heard from her son was two weeks before.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The court\u2019s question, \u201cHave you [since receiving the call at 8 a.m. on May 17th] . . . called him back?\u201d and Fagundes\u2019 answer, \u201cI called him this [May 18th] morning . . . about 6 :30, \u2019 \u2019 left the impression there had been no intervening contacts. Fagundes, when examined on behalf of the defendant, first acknowledged and then denied that Lopez had told him on the 17th that the defendant had been to his house on the night of the 16th for the purpose of getting him to testify. The detective admitted that he had told Lopez on the 17th that there was a $500 \u201ccontract\u201d on the informer\u2019s life, and a similar $500 \u201ccontract\u201d on his own life. He insisted that he never instructed Lopez not to testify, and he explained he had not told the judge about this conversation because he had not been asked. When the prosecutor took oyer the examination, Fagundes for the first time mentioned a call from Lopez at midnight of the night of May 17-18, and attributed the foregoing statements to that call.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>he was home in bed asleep when called by a person who identified himself as Lopez. The caller stated that the defendant had been to his house, and discussed the fact that there was a $500 price on the informer and on the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Fagundes further testified that he called Lopez at 6:30 a.m. on the 18th. No testimony was elicited as to the subject matter of this call. The detective further acknowledged that he phoned the district attorney at 7 a.m. on the 18th after receiving word to appear again at the trial, and after he had called Lopez. He denied that he knew that the defendant was seeking Lopez as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Testimony concerning the foregoing incidents, and defendant\u2019s testimony that he was merely an entrapped go-between was received on the second day of trial. Following the testimony of defendant\u2019s brother, which revealed that Lopez had talked on the telephone from his mother\u2019s house the night before, defendant renewed his motion to dismiss the action for lack of due process of law. The judge, who had then also heard the confused testimony of Fagundes, denied the motion because the defendant had failed to show some active participation of the police department in preventing the defendant from securing the testimony of the informer. Whatever one might think of the activities of Fagundes, his denials supported a finding that he had not told Lopez not to testify. In any event, it was obvious that the police had not spirited Lopez away. The court concluded that he refused to accept service of the subpoena because he feared for his safety, and that the police could not be criticized for telling him that there were threats against him, but would have been subject to criticism if they had failed to warn him. The judge left the way open for renewal of the motion to compel the prosecution to produce the witness if entrapment were shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The defendant\u2019s brother further testified that he had not seen Lopez since March 1st when he, Frank Avila, had also been arrested; that after March 1st he heard Lopez had skipped town, but had made no effort to determine whether he was at his mother\u2019s prior to the preceding night.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Court adjourned on the 18th, following the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the cross-examination of the defendant. The ease proceeded the following morning and both sides rested. No showing was made that the defendant had delivered a subpoena for Lopez to any peace officer for service, nor did defendant seek a continuance to effect service, or an order for service on a concealed witness. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1988.) Defendant sought and was granted leave to move for a dismissal for lack of due process before the prosecution commenced its opening argument. The court concluded that the police were not secreting Lopez or doing anything to prevent him from being present at the trial, and that, even accepting the defendant\u2019s testimony at its face value, it could not see any entrapment whatsoever, because repeated requests were not the persuasion that would convince a man to do something he otherwise would not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>Obligation of the Prosecution\u2014Production v. Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUSz\">\u201cThe prosecution is not required to call any particular witness, nor to put on all the evidence relating to a charge so long as all material evidence bearing thereon is fairly presented in such a manner as to accord to the defendant a fair trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 748, 752.) This principle has been generally applied to exonerate the prosecution from any alleged obligation to produce an informer as its witness to a charge which it can establish through other evidence.

There was, therefore, no privilege to refuse to identify the informer, and the matter was governed by the rule \"that the prosecution is required to disclose the informer\u2019s name or dismiss the case, on proper application by the defendant to the court.\u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 751; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 769, 773; <em>People </em>v. <em>Durazo </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 354, 356 [340 P.2d 594, 76 A.L.R.2d 257] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 355, 357-358, 358-360 [333 P.2d 19] ; <em>Priestly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 812, 816-819 [330 P.2d 39] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>McShann </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 802, 806-811 [330 P.2d 33]; <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 53, 58-65 [1 L.Ed.2d 639, 643-647, 77 S.Ct. 623].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The prosecution had met the requirements of disclosure by voluntarily disclosing the informant\u2019s identity and his last lmown whereabouts. The trial court denied ICiihoa\u2019s motion that it order the prosecution to produce him. (53 Cal.2d at p. 751.) It was admitted, however, that the prosecution had released the accused after an earlier arrest for the offense charged, and deferred rearresting and prosecuting him until the informer had departed from the state. The court concluded that the admitted purposeful delay in bringing the defendant to trial \"would seem to point unerringly to the conclusion that the state sought to circumvent, if not. to stultify, the reason for the rule requring disclosure. The procedure resorted to in the instant case manifestly denied the defendant a fair trial just as effectively as if the informer had never been identified.\u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In this case the testimony of the informer would be material, relevant and competent. Not only was he a witness of and participant in the two transactions which gave rise to the charges involved, but also, according to the testimony of the defendant, he was the one who could confirm or deny that he made the alleged persistent attempts to induce the defendant to secure marijuana for him.  It is recognized that a person who may give evidence on the issue of entrapment is one whose identity must be disclosed as a material witness. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McShann, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 802, 810; and <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>353 U.S. 53, 64 [1 L.Ed.2d 639, 647].) In <em>Velarde-Villarreal </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1965) 354 F.2d 9, under a similar claim of persuasion, the court observed: \u201cIt would appear that Margarito might have been an important witness for the defendant-appellant had he been made available. Had Margarito been called, his testimony might possibly have served to corroborate appellant\u2019s claim of entrapment. See <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 369 [2 L.Ed.2d 848, 78 S.Ct. 819].\u201d (354 F.2d at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Here the prosecution met the burden of disclosure over a month before the trial when it furnished the information requested by defendant\u2019s motion. It is also noted that if the defendant\u2019s testimony, that he only engaged in securing marijuana because he was induced to do so by his friend Lopez, is to be believed, he had cause to learn of the perfidy of his friend when he received a copy of the indictment at his arraignment. This case does not in reality involve the question of divulging the identity of an unknown informer, nor his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">No question has been raised, as in <em>Kiihoa, </em>as to the delay in arresting or in bringing the defendant to trial. In fact, the record shows that the informer was physically available as a witness at the time of trial.  In any event, delay in arresting and charging the accused, which results in the unavailability of the informer, is not a denial of due process of law if the facts \u201cdo not indicate that the prosecution had any intent to cause the absence of the informer but that the delay was for the mere purpose of more efficient law enforcement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castedy, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.2d 763, 770; and see pp. 767-770; accord: <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 358, 365; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilmore </em>(1965) 239 Cal.App.2d 125, 128-130 [48 Cal.Rptr. 449] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fontaine, supra, </em>237 Cal.App2d 320. 324-325; <em>People </em>v. <em>Galvan, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.2d 443, 447; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lugo </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>772, 778 [21 Cal.Rptr. 871] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKoy, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.2d 104, 110; <em>People </em>v. <em>Givens </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 834, 839-840 [13 Cal.Rptr. 157]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLosa </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 681, 683-684 [7 Cal.Rptr. 753].)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Defendant insists the prosecution had the duty not only to divulge the identity and whereabouts of the informer, but also to produce him in court. In <em>Kiihoa, </em>the reversal indicates that under the circumstances the court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion that the informer be produced. (See 53 Cal.2d at p. 751.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the following cases the court upheld a denial of the defendant\u2019s demand or motion that the prosecution produce an informer, when the identity and whereabouts of the informer had been disclosed to the best of the prosecution\u2019s knowledge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barone, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 776, 781; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 358, 366; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 125, 133-134; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 482, 483, 485; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fontaine, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 320, 327-328; <em>People </em>v. <em>Render, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 190,195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u201cIn the absence of evidence to show that the People sought to suppress the testimony of the informer or bring about his absence or disappearance, defendant cannot predicate error on the People\u2019s failure to produce him.

Three agents testified that they did not know his whereabouts at the time of the trial. There was also testimony which indicated that an agent might have advised the informer to leave the country for the purpose of denying the defense access to him as a witness. Two judges concluded: \u201cWe therefore hold that the cause should be and it is remanded to the trial court for the purpose of holding a further hearing at which the Government shall be given the opportunity of proving if such be the ease that it was genuinely unable through reasonable efforts to produce Margarito and also, if such be the ease, that the Government did not take steps to see to it that Margarito would be or become unavailable as a witness. The burden of proving these things should be on the Government. Failure to make such proof will call for a new trial. This procedure is similar to that called for in <em>Remmer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>347 U.S. 227 [98 L.Ed. 654, 74 S.Ct. 450], Should the Government sustain its burden in these respects, then appellant should be denied relief. For if the Government was truly unable by reasonable efforts to produce Margarito, and was not responsible for his unavailability, the judgment of guilt must be affirmed.\u2019\u2019 (354 F.2d at p. 13.) The third judge stated: \u201cUnder all the unusual circumstances of the case at bar, I would hold that the Government, upon the request of the defendant, which here was timely made, was obliged either to produce its agent Margarito as a witness or to obtain and supply to the appellant such information as would enable appellant to bring him before the court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 15-16; fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Defendant\u2019s attempts to unqualifiedly apply the foregoing principles in support of his proposition that the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>must produce,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as well as divulge the identity and whereabouts of, the informer is thwarted by the long line of precedents to the contrary in this state, and by the fact that in this case, at the time of trial, the informer was as available to the defense as he was to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Obligation of the Prosecution\u2014Suppression or Interference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXBL\">Defendant further contends that he was denied due process of a fair trial because the prosecution in effect suppressed evidence which might have been favorable to him. This principle was noted in <em>Kiihoa </em>in the following passage: \"The intentional suppression of material evidence by the state would, of course, be a denial of a fair trial and due process. This could, in some circumstances, be manifest by a failure of the prosecution to call certain witnesses. [Citations.] Such a denial would likewise exist where the prosecution was allowed to control the course of proceedings in a manner which would prevent the accused from presenting material evidence. The rule requiring the disclosure of the identity of an alleged informer is designed to prevent such injustices. The rationale of that rule is that the defendant, through the testimony of the informer when his identity is made known, might be able to rebut a material element of the prosecution\u2019s case and thereby prove his innocence.  The denial by the prosecution of an opportunity for the defendant to seek out the informer and to defend by these means, where the testimony of the informer would be material to the issues, is unfair and oppressive to the defendant, and deprives him of due process of law. [Citations.] \u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 752; and see <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Galvan, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.2d 443, 450; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKoy, supra, 193 </em>Cal.App.2d 104, <em>109; People </em>v. <em>Render, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 190,195-196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cWithout question the intentional suppression of material evidence by a district attorney can result in the denial of a fair trial, and when it does, suppression amounts to a denial of due process. [Citing <em>Kiihoa] </em>. . .  [W]hether the district attorney\u2019s failure to call a particular witness constitutes a suppression of evidence necessarily depends upon the state of the evidence in the case, measured against the facts to which the uncalled witness could testify.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mort, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 596, 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Kiihoa </em>the court discussed the question of whether there was any state action which deprived the defendant of due process of law. The court recognized \u201cthat the police did not arrange for [the informant\u2019s] absence.\u201d It observed: \u201cThe critical question, however, is not necessarily one of improper conduct in bringing about [his] absence, but rather, whether the defendant\u2019s conviction resulted from some form of \u2022 trial in which his essential rights were disregarded or denied. We are persuaded that the circumstances surrounding this prosecution affected and militated against the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 753.) The fact that state action, purposefully delaying the trial, was involved is manifest from the concluding paragraph of the opinion. \u201cIt is not intended to hold that the mere unavailability of a material witness would necessarily result in a denial of due process in every case. We do not reach that question where, as here, the deprivation of due process was admittedly occasioned by state action.\u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\n<em>Evidence on Suppression or Interference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sauceda, supra, 199 </em>Cal.App.2d 47, the court reviewed five prior eases and remarked: \u201cIn all of these cases, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa, supra, </em>the suspect was not arrested until after the informant had left the jurisdiction. Yet the cases have uniformly held that in the void of specific testimony. that the police encouraged the informer to disappear [as was the ease in Kiihoa], the courts cannot infer improper motives or activities on the part of the officers, but must presume that the officers regularly and lawfully performed their duties <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farrara, </em>46 Cal.2d 265 [294 P.2d 21]), as well as that the payment for and termination of an informer\u2019s employment is not in and of itself \u2018 encouraging him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>disappear.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilburn, supra </em>[ (1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 702, 705 [16 Cal.Rptr. 97]].) Nor do we think that the fact that the informer here was a parolee who had to receive special permission, from the authorities to leave the state constituted an encouragement of his disappearance.\u201d (199 Cal.App.2d at p. 56; accord: <em>People </em>v. <em>Barone, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 776, 780; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 358, 365; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 125, 134; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 482, 484; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 365, <em>369; People </em>v. <em>Galvan, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.2d 443, 448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Defendant contends that the testimony concerning the telephone calls between Detective Fagundes and Lopez gives rise to the inference that there was state action to induce the informer not to testify, as prohibited by both state and federal law. It may be assumed that the admitted content of the calls, the circumstances under which they were made and received, and the manner in which Fagundes testified would be sufficient to sustain a finding contrary to his express denials that he told the informer not to testify. The trial judge who heard and observed the witness concluded, however, that the informer was personally avoiding service of process, not because of the action of the detective, but because of personal fear for his safety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact that each party to the conversation discussed what was apparently known to both, that there was a price on the life of each, does not require a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>Kiihoa </em>the court recognized that the prosecution\u2019s motive in protecting the informer from the threats of reprisal was praiseworthy. It concluded, however: \u201cSuch motives and purposes cannot prevail when, as here, they inevitably result, intentionally or unintentionally, in depriving the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (53 Cal.2d at p. 754.) The opinion cites <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>353 U.S. 53. wherein the court stated: \u201cWe believe that no fixed rule with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>disclosure is justifiable. The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d (353 U.S. at p. 62 [1 L.Ed.2d at p. 646].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 229 [23 Cal.Rptr. 569, 373 P.2d 617, 3 A.L.R.3d 946] the opinion expressed the following view: \u201cWhile there might be a popularly held belief that informers are threatened by guilty defendants, such a belief would not appear to have that degree of reliability or universality to have become a matter of \u2018 common human experience or well known laws of natural science \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 720, 732 [17 Cal.Rptr. 481, 366 P.2d 33]), so that a jury may take judicial notice thereof, even though such behavior may with some frequency be called to the attention of law enforcement personnel.\u201d (58 Cal.2d at p. 242.) Here there was testimony to evince the informer\u2019s fear. The following is pertinent: \u201cIt is equally obvious\u2014as testimony in the record before us recites\u2014that the person can secure the cooperation of addicts and other persons involved in criminal activity only on the condition that they be as anonymous as possible. The reason is plain: disclosure of the fact that the informer has aided the police results, at best, in ostracism and (for an addict) in drying up of his own sources of supply; at the worst it results in physical harm or even death. It follows that court-made rules which infringe on the desired anonymity result, <em>pro tanto, </em>in a decreased effectiveness on the part of police and prosecutor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.2d at p. 131; and see fn. 3, omitted in quotation, pp. 131-132; and Shenk, J. dissenting, <em>People </em>v. <em>Durazo, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 354, 358-359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It has been assumed that the informer directed, or was party, to the statements attributed to his brother and to his mother, first, by the defendant who allegedly went to the house on May 16th, and again by defendant\u2019s brother who attempted to serve the subpoena the following night. It is possible that those declarants, fearing for the safety of their relative, sought, on their own initiative to avoid a confrontation between the informer, and those whom the record reflects had each been charged as a result of the informer\u2019s activities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Unanswered, is whether similar responses would have been made to a deputy sheriff whether armed with a subpoena alone or with a subsequently issued order to enter. (See Process, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The record does not, as a matter of law, require a finding that agents of the state intervened to prevent the defendant\u2019s securing the testimony of the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>Entrapment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Defendant\u2019s claim that he was entrapped is countered by his admission and by other evidence which indicates that he knew he was furnishing marijuana not only to Lopez, the alleged persuader, but to \u201chis uncle\u201d (the agent) and possibly others. Entrapment was not established as a matter of law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barone, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 776, 781-782; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cordero </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 826, 828-829 [49 Cal.Rptr. 924] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 365, 368-369; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 669, 672 [27 Cal.Rptr. 144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u201cThe burden of proving the affirmative defense of entrapment is on the accused and he must show that he was induced to commit the crime of which he is charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barone, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 776, 782; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 365, 368; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.2d 669, 671.) It is unnecessary to determine whether this burden is one of persuasion (see Evid. Code. \u00a7\u00a7 500, 501) or of producing evidence (see <em>id, </em>\u00a7 550). It may be assumed that it is just the latter and that on the whole ease the prosecution must establish the defendant\u2019s guilt to the degree of proof required by law. It is clear, however, that the prosecution does not have to negate entrapment. Whatever may be said as to the necessity of producing the informer when the alleged entrapment is directly related to the particular transaction charged may not necessarily be true in connection with allegations that there were many other contacts to which the prosecution was not a party. The defendant is opening up a new field, and it is not unfair to require that his burden of producing evidence of these new transactions include producing the witness to testify to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>Bight to Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Unquestionably the defendant has the right to the process of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses on his behalf.

Where process is equally available to the defendant, he cannot complain that the prosecution failed to secure the attendance of a witness. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Daboul </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 800, 804 [44 Cal.Rptr. 744]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Galvan, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.2d 443, 449, 450; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.2d 191, 195 196; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Render, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 190, 196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Generally it is not the duty of the district attorney or public officials to locate or to assist a defendant in locating a witness whose address is unknown to him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 36, 41 [23 Cal.Rptr. 558] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d 674, 679; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bailey </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 578, 580 [205 P.2d 418].)  Where compulsory process has been issued, served and has proved ineffective, and the court has issued a bench warrant for the witness, neither the court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brinson </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 253, 257-258 [12 Cal.Rptr. 625]); nor the prosecutor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d 674, 679) can be chargeable with error because the defendant failed to secure the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In this case compulsory process was issued. Service was not effective because the witness ostensibly concealed himself within his mother\u2019s house. Whether by virtue of the provisions of section 1102 of the Penal Code,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or because of the inherent power of the court to carry out an analogous procedure to. execute the mandate of section 13 of article I of the State Constitution, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the production of witnesses and evidence are deemed applicable. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Clinesmith </em>(1959) 175 Cal. App.2d .Supp. 911, 913-914 [346 P.2d 923] ; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Brinson, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 253, 258.) Code of Civil Procedure.section 1988 provides: \u201cIf a witness is concealed in a building or vessel, so as to prevent the service of a subpoena upon him, any court or judge, or any officer issuing the subpoena, may, upon proof by affidavit of the concealment, and of the materiality of the witness, make an order that the sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of the county serve the subpoena; and the sheriff must serve it accordingly, and for that purpose may break into the building or vessel where the witness is concealed. \u2019'</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">No application was made under this section. The failure to issue such an order, upon proper showing, would have been error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bossert, supra, </em>14 Cal.App. 111, 113, 116.) The failure to make a request for such an order, or to make the showing required by the statute, precludes asserting error at this time. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marseiler </em>(1886) 70 Cal. 98, 102; and <em>cf. In re Finn, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 807, 813; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.2d 36, 41; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cuthbertson </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 393, 395 [1 Cal.Rptr. 435]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Townsend </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 204, 205 [151 P.745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u201cThe difficulty with appellant\u2019s position is that here the court did issue the requested process [a \u201cbody attachment\u201d which the sheriff returned unserved], and there is no showing that anything that the court did or refused to do is the cause of the absence of the witness at the trial. The <em>Marseiler </em>case is in point; it held that the court could require a showing of need for the requested process, which is just what the court did in the present case. Moreover, nowhere in the record is there any showing that Basse\u2019s testimony would have been in any way helpful to appellant or that the lack of her testimony in any way prejudiced him. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brinson, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 253, 258-259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Galvan, supra, </em>the court stated; \u201cDefendant cannot avoid the consequences of his failure to seek out the informer when he had the opportunity to do so, and likewise he cannot shift to the prosecution the burden of calling the informer as a witness for the defense.\u201d \u201cDefendant failed to take advantage of his opportunity to seek out the informen As we have noted, defendant put off subpoenaing Tucker until two days before the trial, although he had both, ample time to locate him and the means of compelling his attendance by following the procedure provided by Penal Code sections 1334 et seq. Furthermore, the tardy attempt to subpoena Tucker was misdirected and inadequate.\u201d (208 Cal.App.2d at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>the court made the following observation: \u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel complains that in this situation the trial court \u2018should not sit idly by..\u2019 -This- criticism is misdirected. Of all the people, in., the. courtroom, defendant alone knew with certainty whether Penn had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>purchased heroin from him as charged by the prosecution. Defendant, better than anyone else, knew whether Penn\u2019s presence would be helpful to his defense. If, as counsel now supposes, Penn was in Chino, he was but a two-hour automobile ride from the courthouse, and the court had discretion to order his presence if a request had been made under Penal Code, section 2621. No request was made by counsel. This court must conclude not that defendant\u2019s trial tactics were inept, but that his brief is disingenuous.\u201d (202 Cal.App.2d at pp. 195-196.) In this case defendant alone knew with certainty whether Lopez had importuned him for the period and in the manner he claimed. Lopez may still have been at his mother\u2019s home on the morning of May 18th. If an application had been made for an order under section 1988 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the question could have been resolved, or at least brought to a head. If the court proceeded to compel the witness\u2019 presence on its own initiative and the witness proved unfavorable to the defendant (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 196 [25 Cal.Rptr. 813] ; fn. 9), the court might have been subject to criticism. Without resorting to the alternatives quoted in <em>Rodriguez, </em>it suffices to note that the defendant at the trial, and on appeal, has been more intent upon establishing some dereliction on the part of the prosecution than in securing the presence and testimony of the informant on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1960) 282 F.2d 435, the court offered to issue a subpoena after the defendant stated, and offered to testify, that the witness could not be found at the address given by the prosecution. \u201cCounsel declined .the issuance of the \u2018forthwith subpoena\u2019 for fear that a \u2018not found\u2019 return by the marshal would indicate that the witness was not available to the government and thereby destroy the effect of appellant\u2019s contention that the witness was available to the government but unavailable to the appellant.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cThe appellant should have accepted the offer of the court to have issued a \u2018forthwith subpoena\u2019, which may have resulted in the production of the witness Johnson. Apparently appellant desired neither the presence of Johnson nor a \u2018not found\u2019 return by the United States Marshal. Under the record in this case we .find no prejudicial error on the part of the trial court in rejecting the offer of proof made by appellant\u2019s counsel.\u201d (282 F.2d at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">From the whole record it appears that defendant\u2019s failure to secure the' testimony of liis' former friend and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>betrayer was caused by his own lack of diligence in pursuing the processes available to him to secure witnesses, rather than by any breach of duty on the part of the prosecution. To hold otherwise, in the circumstances of this case, would open the door to connivance where the informer, either fearful or remorseful in the presence of the defendant or his relatives, conceals himself from the service of the subpoena, to the end that defendant may secure a dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Molinari, P. J., and Elkington, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 5,1967. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The notice of appeal was filed June 20, 1966, 11 days after judgment. A report from the Santa Cruz County sheriff\u2019s office indicates that the notice of appeal was executed on Friday, June 17, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m. and delivered to the jailer, who upon the advice of the district attorney filed the notice together with his report. Filing of a notice with a prison official during the 10-day period is treated as constructive filing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dailey </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 101, 103-107 [345 P.2d 558].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\">According to Agent Armenia, who monitored the conversation and made notes at the time, the conversation was as follows: \"The male voice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>said: \u2018Yah man.\u2019 The operator said: \u2018Freddy, got any weed left?\u2019 The other voice said: \u2018Who\u2019s this?

It is conceivable that if pertinent they would be material on the issue of continuing the trial to get the testimony of Lopez. No formal offer of proof was made as to the contents of Lopez \u2019 recitals of Fagundes \u2019 declarations. At one time defendant\u2019s counsel did assert \u201cif we could produce him [Lopez], he would show that he [Fagundes] told him not to testify.\u201d However, no motion was made for a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Apparently, as a result of this visit the judge telephoned the police department and left a message for Fagundes, later received by him, to appear in court again the morning of the 18th.

On the other hand, the witness\u2019 admission that Lopez told him the defendant, Freddy Avila (who testified he went on the evening on the 16th) had been to the house and not defendant\u2019s brother, Frank Avila (who attempted to serve the subpoena on the night of the 17tli), suggests that the call may have been prior to the commencement of the trial on the 17th, despite Fagundes \u2019 later statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The question of disclosure of the identity of an informer \u201cwho is not a material witness to the guilt or innocence of the accused of the offense charged\u201d is now controlled by section 1042, subdivision (c), of the Evidence Code.
