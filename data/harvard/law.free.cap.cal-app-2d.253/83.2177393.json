Respondent (herein \u201crailroad\u201d) owned a railroad tunnel which ran through the hill beneath the district\u2019s mains. The tunnel collapsed, whereupon the surface land above it subsided and the mains were disrupted. The district thereafter commenced this action for damages against the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The district\u2019s complaint, setting forth the above facts, undertook to assert the railroad\u2019s liability in four counts. In one\u2014numerically, the third cause of action\u2014liability was based upon the railroad\u2019s alleged negligence in constructing and maintaining the underground tunnel. For reasons which we mention after deciding the appeal on its merits, the negligence count is not involved on this appeal and the complaint before us does not allege the railroad\u2019s negligence in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The appeal\u2019s merits are defined by this sequence of events in the lower court: Upon first appearance, the railroad moved to strike the first, second and fourth counts in the complaint and demurred, both generally and specially, to each. The trial court granted the motion to strike and ruled that its order striking the three counts mooted the demurrers to each. The court thereupon entered judgment dismissing the first, second and fourth counts. The appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The record discloses, and the parties agree, that the trial court struck each of the counts mentioned upon the ground that none stated a cause of action against the railroad. The judgment of dismissal having followed, it is to be considered in the same light as a judgment upon sustaining of a general demurrer without leave to amend and, on appeal, will be subject to the same test. <em>(McKay </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 247, 249 [345 P.2d 949].) The question, then, is whether the first, second or fourth count states a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The district does not allege in any count the nature or extent of its estate in the land involved. It apparently did not occupy the surface under an express grant. As to its surface ownership, it alleges alternative facts by which, the district claims, it was a lawful occupant of the surface under any of several theories, and entitled to subjacent support from the subsurface strata. It is alleged that the district is organized under the Municipal Water District Act (now \u00a7 71000 et seq., Wat. Code), and that its water mains in this case were located in a city street and in a county highway which traverse the surface above the railroad tunnel. It claims that it is lawfully a surface owner upon theories invoked by other allegations as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">(1) In the first count, the district alleges that its water mains were \u201cplaced, owned and maintained\u201d in the surface highways under claim of right and without protest from the railroad for more than five years. It claims an estate in the surface by adverse possession. There is no allegation, however, that the pipes are located in any property of the railroad, and various other allegations import to the contrary. Therefore, the complaint does not sustain the district\u2019s claim to surface ownership by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">(2) On the same facts, the district claims status as a surface owner by \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d subject only to the right of the railroad to be compensated. <em>(Provident Irr. Dist. </em>v. <em>Cecil </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 13, 17 [271 P.2d 157].) But, again, no allegation places the district\u2019s water mains in or upon property of the railroad as an \u201c inverse eondemnee \u2019 \u2019; and, again, this theory of surface ownership will not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">(3) In the second count, the district alleges that its water mains are lawfully located because they are in public highway easements on the surface. Under these allegations, the district had the right to install its mains in the street and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>in the highway under the Municipal Water District Act. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 71697.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exercising its right, it became a lawful occupant of the land surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">(We note that some of the few authorities dealing with support of land state that even a surface trespasser is entitled to it. (5 Powell, Real Property, \u00a7 699, pp. 287-288; Rest., Torts, \u00a7 820, subd. (1), com. g.) We do not so hold, but neither do we establish as the law of the case that the district had to be a \u201clawful\u201d occupant of the surface in order to be entitled to subjacent support from the subsurface. In commenting upon the district\u2019s claims enumerated above, we are responding to the allegations in the complaint before us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The complaint\u2014and we refer hereinafter to the second count\u2014does not allege, either, the nature or extent of the railroad\u2019s ownership of the subsurface: it alleges only that the railroad owned a tunnel through the hill and beneath the district\u2019s water mains. The complaint contains no allegations, however, under which the railroad is shown to have owned any part of the land <em>surface </em>involved, adjoining the district\u2019s occupancy or otherwise. Accordingly, for purposes of stating a cause of action under the law of subjacent support, the complaint sufficiently alleges that the railroad is a subsurface owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Again, the complaint is less than explicit as to whether the tunnel is an artificial excavation in the hill and whether the railroad did the excavating. However, from the structure depicted in common usage of the term \u201crailroad tunnel,\u201d from various references to its \u201cconstruction\u201d and to the right of the railroad \u201cto construct\u201d a tunnel, and from allegations that \u201cat all times\u201d the railroad owned, possessed and controlled the tunnel, we find the fair import of an allegation that the tunnel in question was excavated by the railroad, and that the tunnel was constructed in the subsurface before the district\u2019s mains were installed in the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Thus, although the complaint is replete with uncertainties and inferential pleading, it alleges that the railroad, acting as a subsurface owner, excavated an underground tunnel; that, after the tunnel was built, the district installed its water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mains in the land surface above the tunnel; and that the tunnel subsequently collapsed, causing subsidence and the district\u2019s damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">At common law, where one person owns the surface of land and another the subjacent land, the owner of the surface is entitled to have it remain in its natural condition, without subsidence by reason of the subsurface owner\u2019s withdrawal of subjacent support. (Rest., Torts, \u00a7 820; 3 Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed. 1939) \u00a7 754, p. 196; 5 Powell, Real Property (1962) \u00a7 703, p. 308; 2 Thompson, Real Property (4th ed. 1961) \u00a7415, p. 646; VI-A Amer. Law of Property (1954) \u00a7 28.36, pp. 99-100; <em>Humphries </em>v. <em>Brogden </em>(1850) 12 Q.B. 739, 744-745 [116 Eng. Rep. 1048,1050] ; and see <em>Empire Star Mines Co. </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1944) 62 Cal.App.2d 466, 533-534 [145 P.2d 49].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The same authorities agree that the common law right of subjacent support is closely analogous to that of lateral support (e.g., 3 Tiffany, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 754, pp. 196-197; 5 Powell, supra); each of two of the treatises concurs to the extent that each treats the two subjects together. (2 Thompson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 415, p. 640; VI-A Amer. Law of Property, <em>supra.) </em>Under all the authorities, also, the common law obligation of subjacent support is \u201cabsolute.\u201d (E.g., Rest., Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 820, subd. (1), com. b; 5 Powell, <em>supra-, 2 </em>Thompson, <em>supra.) </em>The authorities\u2014California courts included\u2014also agree that the common law obligation of lateral support is similarly \u201cabsolute.\u201d <em>(Wharam </em>v. <em>Investment Underwriters </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 346, 349 [136 P.2d 363] ; Rest., Torts, \u00a7 817, subd. (1), com. b; 5 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 699, p. 290; 2 Thompson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 415, p. 642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u201cSupport is lateral when the supported and supporting lands are divided by a vertical plane. Support is subjacent when the supported land is above and the supporting land is beneath it. Such is the situation when one person owns an upper stratum of land and another person owns a stratum under it. It most frequently arises from a transfer of minerals in place, the rest of the land being retained, or from a transfer of the land, excepting the minerals.\u201d (Rest., Torts, ch. 39, \u201cScope and Introductory Note,\u201d p. 183; <em>accord, </em>5 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 703, p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">On this appeal, the district contends that the common law rule of absolute liability for deprivation of subjacent support is still in effect in California, unmodified by statute, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>its complaint states a cause of action at common law. The railroad asserts that the Legislature changed the common law rule by enacting Civil Code section 832 (hereinafter \u201csection 832\u201d)- From this premise, the railroad argues in substance that the complaint does not state a cause of action because it does not allege that the excavator of the tunnel failed to give notice of the excavation or to use ordinary care in excavating, both of which are required by section 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In its present form,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 832 relieves an excavating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>surface owner </em>from the absolute duty to provide <em>lateral </em>support to the land of a coterminous surface owner, provided he gives notice of the excavation to his neighbor and exercises ordinary care in excavating, both as required by the statute. To this extent, the statute relaxes the common law duty of lateral support. <em>(Wharam </em>v. <em>Investment Underwriters, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.2d at p. 349; <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 489, 494-495 [12 Cal.Rptr. 55, 87 A.L.R.2d 704] ; see Comment (1920) 20 Cal.L.Rev. 62, 63.) Since the common law rule of lateral support is relaxed by reason of the statute\u2019s provisions for notice and the exercise of ordinary care, the relaxation occurred when these provisions were added to section 832 in 1874. In a lateral support case between coterminous surface owners, the applicability of section 832 could depend upon the date the excavation was made, i.e., before or after the 1874 amendment. The district\u2019s position here is that the statute did not and does not operate to change the common law rule of <em>subjacent </em>support at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">If this is so, the date that the tunnel was constructed is not relevant to whether the complaint before us states a cause of action. And, if section 832 is inapplicable as the district contends, we should so hold in reviewing the complaint because, under the law of the case thus established, the facts of notice of the railroad tunnel excavation\u2014if given\u2014and ordinary care in excavating\u2014if exercised\u2014are not available as affirmative defenses to a complaint which alleges neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">We have seen that the complaint alleges a loss of surface support incurred by a supported surface owner from a supporting owner underneath, and not that the supporting owner\u2014the railroad\u2014owns any part of the surface adjoining the district\u2019s occupancy there. Consequently, no element of lateral support is presented: this is a \u201cpure\u201d subjacent support case. As such, it has no precedent among the California decisions, all of which\u2014with the possible exception of <em>Porter </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1920), hereinafter discussed\u2014 deal with lateral support obligations and coterminous surface owners only.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We hold that section 832 applies only as between coterminous surface land owners, and only to their mutual obligation of lateral support. Although the statute thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>applied relaxes the common law, it does not apply as between a surface owner and a subsurface owner and it does not change the common law duty of subjacent support owed to the surface by the subsurface. Several reasons direct this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">First: Such authorities as have considered section 832 in lateral support cases appear to assume that the statute deals only with the lateral support obligation existing between coterminous surface owners of land. <em>\u201cAll that </em>[section 832] <em>does </em>is to permit a land owner to excavate, freed from the absolute common law right of <em>lateral </em>support in his neighbor, provided certain conditions in the code section are complied with, and always provided that negligence of the excavator is not the proximate cause of damage to the property of the adjoining land owner.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Wharam </em>v. <em>Investment Underwriters, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.2d at p. 349; <em>Sager </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>(1944) 67 Cal.App.2d 27, 32 [153 P.2d 569] (\u201cThe common law rule of <em>lateral </em>support is found in Civil Code section 832: . . .\u201d] (Italics added) ; <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.2d at pp. 494-495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Porter </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 515 [189 P. 105], is the single California ease dealing, even in part, with subjacent support as such. In <em>Porter, </em>the plaintiff was the owner of an improved lot fronting on a city street under which the defendant city excavated a tunnel. In her action for negligent deprivation of support, the court held that the city was under a duty to use ordinary care in constructing the tunnel. The critical question, though, was the applicable statute of limitations. The complaint pleaded negligence. The <em>Porter </em>court indicated that the city would be liable for negligence but that its negligent act was a trespass upon plaintiff\u2019s property governed by the statute of limitations in a trespass action rather than in a negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The <em>Porter </em>decision does not hold that section 832 controls all relationships between owners of the surface and the subsurface. To the contrary, the <em>Porter </em>court implied (182 Cal. at p. 520) that the plaintiff was a coterminous surface owner entitled to lateral support <em>next to </em>the street, and a surface owner entitled to subjacent support <em>in </em>the street; and that her coterminous rights existed by reason of section 832 (\u201cunder the code\u201d) but that her surface rights did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Second: Section 832 declares the entitlement of a \u201c <em>coterminous </em>owner ... to the . . . support which his land receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>from the <em>adjoining </em>land. ...\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cCoterminous\u201d is defined as \u201chaving the same or coincident boundaries.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1967) p. 516.) \u201cAdjoining\u201d means \u201ctouching or bounding at some point or on some line.\u201d <em>(Op. cit., </em>p. 27.) The principal legal dictionaries define \u201cadjoining\u201d in virtually identical language: \u201cThe word in its etymological sense means touching or contiguous, as distinguished from lying near to or adjacent.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951), p. 62; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d rev. 1914) ; Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1948) p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Thus, \u201ccoterminous\u201d and \u201cadjoining\u201d each imports physical contiguousness at a common boundary. Such is characteristic of surface ownerships of land. On the surface of the planet, a precisely drawn boundary is necessary as a limitation upon otherwise unlimited occupancy and use on either side. On the surface, a precise boundary can feasibly be drawn as a visible line on an accessible horizontal plane. Contiguousness at a common boundary is not characteristic of the relationship between surface and subsurface ownerships. Ordinarily, the nature and extent of a granted underground use, not a precise boundary, limits occupancy and use at the subsurface level. A precise boundary is thus not necessary, and it cannot feasibly be drawn below ground because it would be an invisible plane through an impenetrable solid.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Since \u201ccoterminous\u201d and \u201cadjoining\u201d-\u2014each by defin\u00ed-' tion\u2014are characteristic of surface ownerships only, the nomenclature of section 832 appears to limit the statute to surface ownerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Third: The entirety of section 832 indicates that it is intended to apply to lateral support obligations existing between surface owners only. It applies to excavations \u201con\u201d land, and not, in terms, underneath it. The notice to be given by an excavator must state \u201cthe depth <em>to which </em>such excavation is intended to be made\u201d (italics added), which imports an opening <em>from </em>the surface rather than under it. If the notice were to apply to a tunnel beneath the land to be protected, it would properly specify the level or elevation of the tunnel excavation as well as its \u201cdepth.\u201d Manifestly, the section\u2019s subparagraphs numbered-3 and 4 apply to surface owners only. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">...Eourth: Since 1872, section.832.has appeared in division 2, part 2, title 3, chapter 1- of. the Giv.il Code, in .article 1 under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the article heading \u201cBoundaries.\" An article heading is an integral part of the code and is to be given effect according to its import. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Lynch </em>(1924) 69 Cal.App. 66. 69 [230 P. 462].) The same is true of chapter and section headings. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 260, 263 [44 P.2d 320].) As we have seen, the term \u201cboundaries\" is characteristic of adjoining surface ownerships of land. Its use as the heading of article 1 suggests that the full article\u2014 section 832 included\u2014is intended to apply to surface owners only.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The suggestion develops conviction from the language of the other sections in article 1 under \u201cboundaries.\" Since 1872, section 832 has appeared in the article with the same companion sections. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 829-831, 833, 834.) The first among them, section 829,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> explicitly refers to \u201cthe surface.\" The language of section 829 extends the rights of fee ownership beneath the surface, which strongly implies that the section\u2014and all of article 1, which it introduces\u2014is not addressed to vertically separated ownerships at all. Each of the remaining sections in article 1 clearly applies only to a surface owner,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or only as between surface owners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the remaining sections in article 1 could, in fact, possibly apply to a situation involving a subsurface owner. Since section 832 was thus placed in a statutory context which otherwise deals exclusively with surface owners and their relationships, it appears that the Legislature did not intend section 832 to apply to ownerships beneath the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Fifth: The subject of subjacent support of land has been principally encountered in the law of mining, one of its problem areas. (See Rest., Torts, p. 183, quoted <em>supra; </em>5 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 703, p. 308 et <em>seq.; </em>2 Thompson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 415, p. 645 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>et seq.; 3 Lindley, Mines (3d ed. 1914) \u00a7 812, pp. 2004-2005; 2 C.J.S., Adjoining Landowners, \u00a7 26, p. 28; 58 C.J.S., Mines and Minerals, \u00a7 278, pp. 783 et seq.) The Legislature that enacted section 832 in 1872, and the one that amended it in 1874 to relax the common law rule of lateral support, were cognizant of subjacent support problems, a prior Legislature having enacted a surface-protection statute affecting mining-operations as early as 1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The early law was not addressed or limited to subterranean mining as such, but its language<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> demonstrates legislative intent to protect the subjacent support of land against mining below ground. The language also manifests legislative recognition that surface and subsurface estates in land could be\u2014 and, in a state newly created by miners among others, frequently were\u2014held in separate ownership. The code commission which recommended enactment in 1872 of the Civil Code also specifically recommended the codification of the 1855 mining law in the same code. The 1872 Legislature adopted the one in the Civil Code, but not the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prom the historical context, it appears that the Legislature\u2019s apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>limitation of section 832 to surface ownerships\u2014in 1872 and 1874 alike\u2014was an act of deliberation and not an accident. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The Legislature, in enacting and amending section 832, had good reason to relax the common law rule of lateral support as between the coterminous surface land owners to whom it applies. The rule had become burdensome and unrealistic among changing conditions involving the growth of urban communities, the proliferation of surface ownerships as population increased, and the commonplace necessity of surface excavation for building purposes. The need for its relaxation was \u201cearly perceived in California\u201d <em>(Wharam </em>v. <em>Investment Underwriters, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 346, 349), and section 832 codifies its relaxation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>No such reason dictated a relaxation of the obligation of subjacent support owed at common law by a subsurface owner: the need for protection of the surface, in fact, has increased as the importance of such subsurface activities as mining\u2014and, for that matter, railroad tunneling\u2014has declined in modern times.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In a given set of facts involving coterminous surface land owners, depending upon elements of topography and surface location and upon the pull of gravity in any case, \u201clateral support\u201d and \u201csubjacent support\u201d can mean practically the same thing. In other situations, a single surface owner can be entitled to both. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>182 Cal. at p. 520.) Accordingly, when the Legislature mentioned \u201csubjacent support\u201d in section 832, it used the term only as it might apply to a surface owner. That the term was used does not extend the statute to the subsurface owner to whom it <em>does </em>apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We have seen that, according to the allegations in the complaint, the district\u2019s water mains were installed in the land surface\u2014i.e., the district became a surface owner\u2014after the railroad had excavated the tunnel in the subsurface. This sequence is not fatal to the district\u2019s cause of action for deprivation of surface support.  The surface owner\u2019s cause of action arises when the land subsides, not when the excavation is made. (Rest., Torts, \u00a7 820, subd. (1), com. <em>f; id., </em>\u00a7 817, subd. (1) com. i; 2 Thompson, supra, \u00a7 415, p. 647; VIA Amer. Law of Property, \u00a7 28.48, p. 134; 3 Lindley, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 823, pp. 2016-2017.) It has been so held in the lateral support' cases in California. <em>(Veterans\u2019 Welfare Board </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 818, 831 [169 P.2d 1000].) A surface owner of land in California is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>lateral support although the offending excavation was made before he acquired title. <em>(Conlin </em>v. <em>Coyne </em>(1937) 19 Cal.App. 2d 78, 89 [64 P.2d 1123].) This rule is consonant with the authorities\u2019 invariable description of the right of subjacent support as a \u201cnatural\u201d property right, which is unaffected with any element of foreseeability associated with liability for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The railroad contends that it is not liable to the district because even the common law rule of subjacent support extends only to surface land in its \u201cnatural condition\u201d and thus\u2014in the absence of negligence\u2014does not protect the district\u2019s water mains because the latter were \u201cstructures.\u201d So far as the statement goes, it appears to recite the common law rule. (3 Tiffany, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 754, p. <em>197; </em>VI-A Amer. Law of Property, \u00a7 28.45, p. 130.) But the common law right to support is not lost by the imposition of structures unless the downward pressure of their artificial weight contributes to the subsidence. (5 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 703, pp. 308-309.) The California lateral support cases so hold. <em>(Wharam </em>v. <em>Investment Underwriters, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 346, 350; <em>C. F. Harper Co. </em>v. <em>DeWitt Mortg. &amp; Realty Co. </em>(1931) 115 Cal.App. 15, 20-21 [300 P. 839].) In this regard, the burden of showing that the structures\u2019 weight contributed to the subsidence rests upon the defendant. (5 Powell, <em>supra.) </em>Only a complaint is before us. Therefore, the railroad\u2019s contentions as to \u201cstructures \u2019 \u2019 are a matter of affirmative defense and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In the second count of its complaint, the district alleges itself to be a surface owner deprived of subjacent support by reason of an excavation made by a subsurface owner. Since the common law rule of subjacent support is applicable, the second count states a cause of action and the judgment as to that count should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The fourth count, thus far not mentioned, purports to plead a cause of action based upon strict liability for ultra-hazardous activity. Attempting to do so, it repleads the allegations of the first and second counts\u2014which do not allege negligence\u2014and adds only the bare conclusion that \u201cconstruction and maintenance of said tunnel was at all times inherently dangerous\u201d to the surface above it.  Under the rule of \u201cabsolute\u201d liability for ultrahazardous activity, as established in California by the decision in <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Petroleum Corp. </em>(1928) 205 Cal. 328 [270 P. 952, 60 A.L.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>475], the \u201cimportant factor is that certain activities under certain conditions may be so hazardous to the public generally, and of such relative infrequent occurrence, that it may well call for strict liability as the best public policy. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 489, 500 [190 P.2d 1].)  Whether a given case is a proper one for imposing strict liability is a question of law. <em>(Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 496.)  The fourth count alleges no facts bringing the railroad tunnel within the rule, and we are unable to hold as a matter of law that subterranean tunneling, without negligence, is so hazardous\u2014if hazardous at all\u2014as to warrant the rule\u2019s application here. Accordingly, the fourth count does not state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We have previously indicated that the third count of the original complaint, which sounds against the railroad in negligence, is not before us. This is because of the full sequence of unusual events in the trial court. When it first appeared, the railroad demurred to the negligence count both generally and specially, but did not move to strike it. The trial court overruled the general demurrer and sustained the special demurrer with leave to amend within a time specified. The court\u2019s action left the third count in a viable\u2014and amendable\u2014condition. The district, choosing at the time to challenge the trial court\u2019s action striking the other counts, dismissed the third count <em>without prejudice </em>and appealed from the judgment dismissing the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">When the appeal reached this court (1 Civ. 20624), it was dismissed on the railroad\u2019s motion because an appellate decision would have been a \u201cpiecemeal\u201d disposition of the case while the third count was in effect pending in the trial court. On motion there, the district then obtained leave to reinstate the third count and filed an amended complaint for negligence. The railroad responded with a voluminous answer and the case thereafter stood at issue as a negligence action only. A full two years later, the district changed its mind and dismissed its amended complaint\u2014and, thereby, the third count for <em>negligence\u2014with </em>prejudice. The district is back in this court on appeal from the judgment which originally dismissed the other counts, but without the \u201cpiecemeal\u201d defect, of the abortive earlier appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We mention this tortuous history because its effect has been to limit our review to the first, second and fourth counts of the original complaint. The parties have ignored any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>limitation: the record transmitted to us includes the subsequent pleadings which we may not properly consider, and both briefs have argued facts which do not appear in the original complaint. Such facts include an allegation and an argument, by the railroad, that it is not liable because the tunnel\u2019s collapse was the result of an intervening cause not connected with its obligation of subjacent support. We cannot and do not so hold, because <em>the complaint before us </em>makes no allegation that there was an intervening cause of the tunnel\u2019s collapse. We deem it necessary to state this further limit upon our decision so that the parties, not having recognized the limitations upon this appellate review, will not misconstrue the law of the case thus far established.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The judgment dismissing the second cause of action set forth in the complaint herein is reversed, and the trial court is directed to make rulings on the demurrers thereto consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The judgment dismissing the first and fourth causes of action in the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Devine, P.
