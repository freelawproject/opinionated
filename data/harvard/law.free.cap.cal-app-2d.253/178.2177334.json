J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asy\">Florence Hazelwood appeals from a judgment entered upon verdict of a jury in favor of Paul Gordon and denial of her motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She had sued for damages suffered as a consequence of injuries incurred when she fell down a flight of stairs at the rear of a building on West Third Street in Los Angeles. The building was owned by respondent Gordon, and leased in part to appellant\u2019s employer, California Western States Life Insurance Company (Company).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Appellant alleged respondent negligently constructed and maintained the rear staircase. Gordon denied negligence, alleged contributory negligence by appellant, and cross-complained against appellant\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">At the time of her fall, appellant had been employed as a secretary by Company for about a year. The company\u2019s offices were on the second floor of the building; respondent occupied the lower floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">At about 5 p.m. on May 20, 1960, appellant left Company\u2019s office carrying mail in her right hand, and a bank deposit in her purse which she carried on her left arm. She testified she walked to the top of the stairs. \u201cWhen I stepped down I stepped, my whole foot was not on the step and apparently not enough of my foot was on the step to hold all my weight, because when I finally put my foot\u2014my weight on the foot that was stepped down, it wasn\u2019t there, and I went head first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Appellant fell against the stucco wall at her left, and then to the bottom of the steps, coming to rest with her feet still on the steps, her hip on the wide step at the bottom of the stairway, and her head against the tire of a car parked at the bottom of the stairs. She stated she injured her neck, back, both legs and one arm. She arose and walked about one block to a friend\u2019s (who is a nurse) house and received first aid treatment. Thereafter, she saw a doctor. In the following two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>weeks, she stayed home, except for visits to a hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In July 1960 she was hospitalized for neck treatment, and also for an emotional upset. In May 1961, an examination revealed a small calcification in her neck, which was removed surgically. Her physician believed it was related to the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u2022 Three physicians testified on behalf of respondent. Dr. Johnson, from an examination of appellant made on July 5, 1961, found no residual trauma from her fall. Dr. Crowe, from an examination in December 1963, found no orthopedic residuals from the fall. Dr. Galland treated appellant in 1957 following an automobile accident and in April 1959 after a fall while skiing. In his opinion, the ealeiferous nodule in appellant\u2019s neck, which was removed by her physician in May 1961, was not caused by her fall down the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Appellant testified she used the back staircase at least twice a day and \u201calways\u201d felt the stairs were dangerous. She stated she was 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed around 145-150 pounds at the time of her fall; she wore a size 9 shoe, \u201cwhich is fairly large feet, \u2019 \u2019 she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">John Cowles, a licensed general contractor who examined the staircase on behalf of appellant, stated that in his opinion, relative to \u201cthe standard of building practices in Los Angeles\u201d during the years 1953 and 1954, \u201c. . . I would say this stairway was rather steep.\u201d He noted there was some variation between the \u201crun of different steps,\u201d and also as to the \u201crise\u201d of the staircase. \u201c. . . [Y]ou are well within the Code requirement as far as the rise. The place I think that you are perhaps lacking ... as far as the Code is concerned is this run which is the distance between nose to nose.\u201d Cowles indicated the Code specified a minimum dimension of 9 inches; the run varied from 8% to 10 inches, the maximum variation being on the <em>bottom, </em>step. Appellant also attempted to show the \u201chandrail\u201d on the staircase was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Appellant contends the evidence fails to support the verdict in that she established violations of the applicable Los Angeles City Ordinances in the construction of the stairway, and therefore is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The jury brought in a general verdict in favor of respondent. On appeal, we need not speculate on which grounds the jury so concluded <em>(Nigro </em>v. <em>West Foods of California, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 567, 571 [32 Cal.Rptr. 692]). Such a verdict supports findings in favor of the prevailing party on all material issues <em>(Behr </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz, </em>172 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>App.2d 697, 712 [342 P.2d 987]), and if the evidence supports the verdict on any theory of the case, it will be assumed the jury so found. (See <em>Hudgins </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>136 Cal. App. 44, 50 [28 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The evidence clearly supports a verdict for respondent. Assuming arguendo that appellant\u2019s evidence showed the stairway failed to meet statutory standards, she did not sustain her burden of proving that such violations <em>proximately caused </em>her injuries. <em>(Blodgett </em>v. <em>B. H. Dyas Co., </em>4 Cal.2d 511, 513 [50 P.2d 801]; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Moesser, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 612, 614 [262 P.2d 27] [directed verdict for defendant affirmed where plaintiff alleged injury in stairway fall].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Appellant\u2019s own testimony showed she fell from improperly placing her foot on the very top step of the staircase. The violations of ordinances she alleged pertained to the handrail and to lower steps. Further, she stated she believed even prior to the fall that the stairs were \u201cdangerous.\u201d Such testimony supports findings both of lack of proximate cause for appellant\u2019s injuries, and of her contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury in the language of B.A.J.I. No. 101-E (\u201cPossibility of Avoiding Accident Not Test of Negligence\u201d) and No. 102-B (\u201cWhen a Person Must Work in Dangerous Situations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">B.A.J.I. No. 101-E provides: \u201cThe mere fact, if it is a fact, that it was possible for a person to avoid an accident that he did not avoid, does not, of itself, justify a finding that he was negligent or eontributorily negligent. If a person exercised ordinary care and did all that an ordinarily prudent person would have done in the circumstances to avoid an accident, she is not chargeable with negligence or contributory negligence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The trial court thoroughly instructed the jury on negligence, giving B.A.J.I. No. 101, the basic definition, No. 101-C and No. 101-1. As the court noted in refusing additionally to give No. 101-E: \u201cThe issue is whether plaintiff exercised ordinary care in using the stairs [,] not that she was exercis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ing ordinary care and should have done something in addition \u2018 to avoid \u2019 the accident. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The \u201c101 Group\u201d instructions define negligence and particularize the definitions as appropriate to given factual contests. They are redundant in that many of the principles of law covered in one of the instructions are repeated with perhaps emphasis in others. In <em>Luis </em>v. <em>Cavin, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 107, the court says at page 115 [198 P.2d 563] : \u201cThe well-settled rule is that it is not error for a court to refuse a requested instruction if the subject matter thereof is substantially incorporated in the instructions given. A party is not entitled to have the jury instructed in any particular phraseology, and may not complain on the ground that his requested instructions are refused if the court, of its own motion or otherwise, correctly announces the substance of the law applicable to the ease. <em>(Huston </em>v. <em>Schohr, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 267, 277 [146 P.2d 730].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">B.A.J.I. No. 102-B was properly refused by the trial court as factually inapplicable to the instant case. The court stated there was \u201cno evidence\u201d appellant was working in a \u201cdangerous\u201d place, that she was required to take unusual risks, or that she was \u201crequired\u201d to use the particular stairway involved. Appellant concedes her employment was neither dangerous nor involved unusual risks, but argues that she was \u201crequired\u201d in practical effect to use the rear stairway, and therefore the instruction should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The evidence shows there were two stairways in the building\u2014one in the front and one in the rear\u2014which appellant might have used, and there is no evidence she was in fact required to use the one in the rear.  In any event, a court is pot bound to separate the applicable portion of an instruction from the inapplicable, nor obligated to modify a requested instruction. The court may, in a civil ease where a portion of\u2019 the proffered instruction is clearly and concededly inapplicable, refuse the instruction completely. <em>(Anaheim, Bldrs. Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lincoln Nat. Life Ins. Co., </em>233 Cal.App.2d 400, 413 [43 Cal.Rptr. 494]; <em>Jaeger </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 520, 525 [213 P.2d 404].)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u2022 In addition, as pointed out in the annotation to B.A.J.I. No. 102-B, no principle of law is stated in this instruction not already covered in B.A.J.I. No. 102, which latter was given the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Herndon, J., and Fleming, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-13\">The appeal from this motion is dismissed. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 956.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">See also <em>Montijo </em>v. <em>Western Greyhound Lines, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 342, 346 [33 Cal.Rptr. 184], where plaintiff alleged that defendant\u2019s stairway was constructed in violation of applicable ordinance. She contended defendant was therefore negligent per se, and she was entitled to recover for injuries sustained in a fall on the stairs. The appellate court affirmed the grant of a new trial in favor of defendant, noting with numerous citations, that no liability attached to a defendant unless its allegedly negligent construction or maintenance proximately caused plaintiff\u20199 injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
