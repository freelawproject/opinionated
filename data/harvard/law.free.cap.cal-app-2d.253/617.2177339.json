Did the court have jurisdiction to sentence defendant to imprisonment for more than five days ?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">2. Is the order sufficiently specific ?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Becord</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Defendant was brought into the superior court on an order to show cause why he should not be found in contempt for failing to comply with the order in a divorce decree requiring him to pay $50 a month for the support of each of his two minor children. Upon the hearing, the court found that in 1966, defendant paid the sum of $275 instead of the $600 ordered, in 1965, $415, and in 1964, $495, instead of the $600 ordered for each of those years. No contention is made as to the validity of this finding. The court then found, concerning alimony ordered to be paid: \u2018 \u2018 The alimony cannot be disregarded, as this too is a valid enforceable Court Order.\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order found further that defendant had knowledge of the order for child support and alimony, and \u201cthat he had the ability to comply with those orders <em>in a much more substantial way than he actually clicl, but that he did wilfully fail to do so on at least ten separate and distinct occasions. </em>As punishment for such contempt, the defendant is sentenced to serve five days in the Shasta County Jail for each instance of contempt for a total of fifty (50) days.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">1. The sentence in excess of five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Assuming that in other respects the order was regular, the court had jurisdiction to sentence defendant to imprisonment for not exceeding five days on each violation of the support order. Section 1218 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, that where a person is adjudged in contempt \u201che may be imprisoned not exceeding five days.\u201d Failure, without just cause, to make the payment ordered for each month that passed would constitute a separate contempt for which the court would have the power to sentence defendant to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>It is well established that a decree ordering support payments is not a \u201cdebt\u201d and the failure to comply with such order may be punished by contempt. <em>(Heller </em>v. <em>Heller </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 679, 683 [41 Cal.Rptr. 177].) Each wilful failure to pay as ordered constitutes a separate contempt. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 730, 736-737 [18 Cal.Rptr. 773]; <em>In re Toor </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 75, 76 [280 P.2d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">2. The order is not specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">However, the order is void because it does not specify the particular payments in default for which defendant was being sentenced. The order states that defendant is sentenced to serve five days \u201cfor each instance of contempt for a total of fifty (50) days.\u201d Mathematically, it must be concluded that the court found that defendant failed to make at least 10 support payments. But which ones, over the period of three years apparently considered by the court, do not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The court lumped together the total amount of payments which should have been made in the years 1964,1965 and 1966 and the payments that were made and then made the broad finding that he failed to pay on \u201cat least ten separate and distinct occasions,\u201d without specifying which occasions it was selecting upon which to base the imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\"Contempt proceedings being criminal in nature must be conducted in strict compliance with the statutory procedure. Jurisdiction to make the order must affirmatively appear of record; no presumption of regularity in the proceedings applies.\u201d <em>(In re Bernice A. Mancini </em>(1963) <em>215 </em>Cal.App.2d 57, 59 [29 Cal.Rptr. 798].) \u201cAn order adjudging one to be in contempt must be entered \u2018specifying particularly\u2019 the offense (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a71218.)\u201d <em>(In re Joseph J. Mancini </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 54, 56 [29 Cal.Rptr. 796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The order is void in another respect in that it fails to specifically find petitioner\u2019s ability to comply with the support order. \u201c \u2018A judgment of contempt must not only specify the act to be performed, it must also include a finding that such act is within the power of the contemner to perform. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.2d at p. 738, quoting from <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 72, 75 [6 Cal.Rptr. 404].) This order merely finds that defendant had \u201cthe ability to comply ... in a much more substantial way than he actually did. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">In <em>In re Scroggin </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 281 [229 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>489], the finding was that the defendant had \u201c \u2018and now has the ability to make a <em>substantial payment </em>to plaintiff due her under the Interlocutory Decree.\u2019 \u201d The reviewing court held \u201cA finding that one has the ability to pay \u2018a substantial amount\u2019 is not a finding of an ability to pay\u201d the amount ordered to be paid in the interlocutory decree. The court stated further that \u201cSuch a finding is but a conclusion and is so vague, indefinite, and uncertain as to leave wholly to conjecture the amount which petitioner has the ability to pay, and is not sufficient to support the order of commitment for contempt.\u201d (P. 283.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The following findings on the ability of defendants to pay support amounts ordered were held to make the contempt orders in which they are found void:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>In re Michelena </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 377, 378 [309 P.2d 861], \u201c [Petitioner \u2018had the ability to comply with said order of court to a greater extent\u2019 <em>In re Spollino </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 783 [25 Cal.Rptr. 536], \u201che had the <em>partial ability </em>to comply with said order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The statement in the instant order that petitioner had the ability to comply \u201cin a much more substantial way than he actually did\u201d is equally as indefinite as are the findings in the last three cases above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">At oral argument, the parties agreed that petitioner has served in jail five days of the period for which he was sentenced. On any redetermination of petitioner\u2019s liability for support, this fact must be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">As the order adjudicating contempt and imprisonment is void, it is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Pierce, P. J., and Friedman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-18\">Retired Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The order originally ordered petitioner to pay an equal sum per month for the support of another minor who has since become self-supporting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\">What this means cannot be determined as no order of contempt was made concerning alimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-14\">There is a provision to the effect that after serving 25 days if defendant \u201cmakes reasonable payments on the arrearage\u201d the other 25 days of the sentence will be suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
