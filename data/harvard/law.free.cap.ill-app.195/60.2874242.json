The action was originally brought against the Chicago Railways Company. Afterwards the Chicago City Railway Company was made an additional defendant to the suit. The plaintiff, in her declaration, alleged that while she was in the act of boarding one of the cars of the defendants for the purpose of becoming a passenger, and while 'she was in the exercise of ordinary care for her own safety, the defendants, through their servants, carelessly and negligently caused the car to be suddenly and violently started, and she was thereby thrown with great force and violence from and off the car to the ground, and that she suffered a miscarriage and was otherwise greatly bruised and injured. Both defendants pleaded the general issue. The case was tried before a court and a jury, and during the progress of the trial the action was discontinued as to the Chicago Railways Company. A verdict was returned by the jury finding the defendant guilty and assessing the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $3,500. A motion for a new trial was overruled, judgment was entered on the verdict and this appeal followed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b87-7\" pgmap=\"87\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b87-8\" pgmap=\"87\">1.
