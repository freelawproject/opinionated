Adinamis and George Angelus. The declaration consisted of an indebitatus assumpsit count for goods, wares and merchandise sold and delivered, a quantum valebant count, and five common counts in assumpsit, for money lent and advanced, for money had arid received, for interest, for value of work done and material furnished, and upon an account stated. To this declaration was attached an affidavit of claim stating that the demand of the plaintiffs is \u201cfor money obtained from the plaintiffs by the defendants,\u201d amounting to four hundred dollars. Appended was a copy of written contract for the sale of the defendant\u2019s confectionery store in Chicago to the plaintiffs, which states that the purchasers have deposited with the sellers two hundred dollars to be applied on the purchase price, \u201cin case the above mentioned deal shall be consummated\u201d within five days; that if the \u201cdeal\u201d is not so consummated, \u201cthrough the fault of\u201d the purchasers, said deposit shall be retained by the sellers as liquidated damages, but if the sellers refuse to execute a bill of sale, then they shall return the deposit and pay two hundred dollars in addition thereto as liquidated damages. The defendants filed their written appearance and a plea of the general issue, accompanied by an affidavit of merits, made by the defendants\u2019 attorney, as to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. When the case was called for trial neither the defendants nor their attorneys responded, and a judgment for four hundred dollars, together with costs, in favor of the plaintiffs was entered. Subsequently the defendants sued out this writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbM\" pgmap=\"119\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b119-7\" pgmap=\"119\">1.
