The material parts of the agreement are as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-13\" pgmap=\"357(18) 358(359)\">\u201cThat if the party of the second part shall first make the payments and perform the covenants hereinafter mentioned on Ms part to be made and performed, the said party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to convey and assure to the said party of the second part, in fee simple, clear of all incumbrances whatever by a good and sufficient warranty deed, the lot, piece or parcel of ground situated in the County of Cook and State of Illinois, known and described as Lot 10 in Block 6 in Tolman &amp; Tondelius subdn. of Lot 3, otherwise known as number 3949 S.

An agreement to sell real estate wherein it is provided that vendor shall make certain repairs, and that vendee shall pay taxes and other assessments before conveyance, evidences an intention of the parties that vendee shall have possession of the premises before such conveyance.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-11\" pgmap=\"359\">3.

Where an agreement to sell real estate shows an intention of the parties that vendee shall have possession before conveyance, and the agreement fixes no definite time when such possession is to be delivered to vendee, the law implies that such possession shall be delivered within a reasonable time.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-12\" pgmap=\"359\">4.

Evidence, \u00a7 350<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when parol evidence of collateral agreement admissible. Where an agreement to sell real estate requires that possession be delivered to vendee before conveyance, but fixes no time for such delivery, parol evidence of a contract fixing such time for delivery is competent, and has no tendency to vary the terms of a written instrument.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b360-5\" pgmap=\"360\">6. Vendor and purchaser, \u00a7 164<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when delay in delivery of possession unreasonable. Where an agreement for the sale of real estate dated March 25th gave vendor a period of more than two years in which to make conveyance, but was construed to require delivery of possession to vendee within a reasonable time, and where there was evidence of a verbal agreement to deliver such possession April 15th, a finding that vendor unreasonably delayed to deliver such possession held warranted by the evidence, where it appeared that as late as May 18th such possession had not been delivered, although there was evidence that at such last mentioned date vendor had not perfected his title, for the reason that under the agreement the time for conveyance and the time for delivery of possession were not the same, and therefore failure to perfect title did not excuse vendor for unreasonable delay in delivering possession to vendee.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
