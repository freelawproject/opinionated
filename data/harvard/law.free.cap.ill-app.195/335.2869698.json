In an action of tort to recover for injuries to plaintiff\u2019s electric car by being struck by a 60-horsepower automobile weighing 5,000 pounds, alleged to have been negligently operated by defendant, where it appeared that defendant, going south at a rate of speed estimated at from twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, turned west at a speed of fifteen miles an hour, veering towards the south side of the street into which he turned, so as to strike plaintiff\u2019s electric car which was running east on the same street, evidence held to warrant a finding that defendant was negligent, although he claimed the accident was due to his attempt to avoid striking children who were on the cross walk as he turned, as the evidence warranted the court in finding that the cause of the accident was defendant\u2019s excessive speed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-7\" pgmap=\"362\">2.
