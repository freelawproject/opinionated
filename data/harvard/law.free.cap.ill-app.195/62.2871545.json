The first count, in substance, charged the defendants with falsely, fraudulently and knowingly making certain false and fraudulent representations to the plaintiff as to the condition of the La Touriste Manufacturing Company; that the plaintiff relied upon such representations and as a result thereof suffered a loss. The second count was substantially the same as the first, save that it also charged that the defendants entered into a wilful and malicious conspiracy, agreement and undertaking to cheat and defraud the plaintiff. To the declaration, all the defendants filed pleas of the general issue.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\" pgmap=\"88\">The case was tried before the court and a jury, and when the plaintiff rested, the trial court, of his own motion, directed a verdict for the defendants.
