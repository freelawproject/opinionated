It appeared that one Clay was handed money by a police officer with which to purchase cocaine, and in the presence of witnesses he handed defendant the money and $5 of his own, asking defendant to keep it for him. Clay stepped behind the counter and taking a bottle of cocaine, worth about $2, and retired to a water-closet. There was no evidence of any secret understanding between defendant and Clay, or that any one else knew that Clay took the bottle. Defendant denied that any such understanding existed. Defendant returned Clay\u2019s money on request. Clay was formerly a porter at defendant\u2019s store and it was not unusual for him to ask defendant to keep money for him.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-10\" pgmap=\"666\">Edward H.
