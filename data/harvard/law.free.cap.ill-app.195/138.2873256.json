In an action for personal injuries sustained by a servant while riding on top of a heavily loaded wagon, a denial of a motion to exclude statements of the plaintiff that he was hit by a viaduct was error, when it appeared that such statements were mere inferences or conclusions.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-11\" pgmap=\"165\">4.
