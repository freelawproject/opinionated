It appears that prior to his death, insured was subject to severe attacks of headache, and on two or three occasions, many years before his death, he had taken morphine to relieve the pain; that on Friday, September 22, 1911, he told a woman servant at his apartment that he had not been well, and was nervous; that the following morning he appeared at the apartment and said to the woman who opened the door for him, \u201cI am awfully sick, and want to come in and go to bed\u201d; that he also said'that he did not want a doctor, but merely wanted to rest; that he went into his bedroom and shut the door, and about noon, he sent word to his wife \u201cthat he was at the apartment being taken care of, and for her not to worry\u201d; that he ate nothing that day; that about two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, one of his servants went to his bedroom door and asked him if he wanted anything, receiving a negative reply; that he was then standing, holding a bottle containing small white tablets; that he had two or three of the tablets in his hand, and was counting out others; that in reply to an inquiry as to what he was taking, he said it was \u201csomething to ease the pain\u201d in his head, \u201csome medicine he got at the drugstore\u201d; that he asked for a glass of water, and handed the bottle containing the tablets to the woman, who took it from the room and left it in a bedroom adjoining, where it was found the next day; that about half an hour later, he became nauseated, and went into the bathroom, but returned to his bedroom a few minutes later; that about six o\u2019clock in the evening, he came out, partly dressed, went to the kitchen, where he chatted with the woman for an hour and a half; that he said he felt better, and thought he would go to his farm; that later he came out of his bedroom dressed and with his hat and overcoat on, smoking a cigar; that he sat down and talked for another half hour, and then, saying that he felt \u201cshaky,\u201d returned to his bedroom, undressed and went to bed; that during the night he grew worse, and in the morning two physicians were called, but they were unable to arouse him, and he died about eleven o\u2019clock Sunday evening; that an autopsy was had, and the doctors making it certified \u201cthat the findings were consistent with morphine poisoning,\u201d and \u201cthat no other cause of death was found.\u201d It was stipulated in the record, however, \u201cthat the deceased died from \u00e1n overdose of morphine.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-8\" pgmap=\"163\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-9\" pgmap=\"163\">1.
