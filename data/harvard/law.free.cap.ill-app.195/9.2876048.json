The verdict was directed evidently on the theory that plaintiff\u2019s own evidence established such defense. The contract consisted of a written proposal and acceptance. Plaintiff\u2019s proposal was to erect a chimney at Dubuque, Iowa, of reinforced concrete construction 185 feet above the base of a foundation 12 feet below grade. The excavation and preparation of the ground therefor were to be made by defendant. The proposal was dated July 10,1911, and called for prompt acceptance, which was given by letter two days later stating that the excavation would be completed about August 1st, but it was not in fact done until December 12th. In a letter in September, plaintiff expressed anxiety to do the work before cold weather. However, it undertook to perform its contract without any express modification of its terms. It laid the foundation in the four days following December 12th, when freezing weather set in. The evidence showed that cement will not set in a temperature below 26 degrees above zero without employing artificial heat, and that its use would have required much expense and the erection of a building around the chimney structure. It also showed that owing to delays in transporting the \u201cform units\u201d required for cement construction and increasing cold weather\u2014the mean temperature most of the rest of December being below 26 degrees above zero, and in January below zero\u2014no further work in actual construction was done. But the material therefor had already been shipped to Dubuque. The proposal contained these provisions: \u201cMaterial will be. shipped in five days from receipt of order to ship, and about fifty working days are required for the completion of the work. * * * The delivery, erection and completion promised are contingent upon strikes, accidents or other causes of delay beyond our control.\u201d On January 4th representatives of the parties had an interview in which the causes of delay as aforesaid were explained by plaintiff\u2019s representative, he saying, \u201cwe are going to do the best we can to get it done, and the fact that it has got into winter is not our fault.\u201d Defendant\u2019s representative asked if plaintiff would agree to complete the chimney by February 20th. Plaintiff\u2019s representative said it depended on the weather, that they were going to get the job done as soon as they could, but were not going to promise impossibilities. Defendant\u2019s representative expressed a purpose to cancel the contract against which plaintiff\u2019s representative protested. Two days later defendant\u2019s attorney called up the latter by telephone and asked if he would agree to complete the chimney by March 1st, to which he replied, \u201cwe will if we can, but it all depends on the weather.\u201d On January 9th defendant wrote plaintiff a letter referring .to such conversation and saying it left no alternative but to cancel the contract, and taking the position that plaintiff had practically abandoned the contract. Plaintiff declined to accept the cancellation and evinced its readiness to proceed with the work. Plaintiff undertook to prove that the term \u201cworking days\u201d had by usage a special meaning in the trade or commerce of concrete construction. Defendant contended that the words have a definite and settled meaning in commerce and jurisprudence, that of days as they succeed each other exclusive of Sundays and holidays; that the language of the contract was clear and unambiguous, and that parol evidence of its meaning was incompetent. While the court took defendant\u2019s view it nevertheless heard evidence on the subject out of the hearing of the jury, but in directing the verdict treated it as received. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show the expense it had incurred in preparation for and partial performance of the contract, its readiness^to complete the same, and the cancellation thereof by defendant because, plaintiff would not guarantee completion of the structure by February 20th or March 1st. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A9N\" pgmap=\"37\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"APy\" pgmap=\"37(51) 38(33)\">1. Contracts, \u00a7 301<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when extension of time for performance Should he granted. A contract whereby plaintiff agreed to construct a chimney for defendant in \u201cabout fifty working days,\u201d and which expressly provides that delivery within the time named is contingent upon causes of delay beyond the control of plaintiff, entitles plaintiff to a reasonable extension of such period depending upon causes which may excuse such delay, and such contract does not limit plaintiff to exactly fifty days in which it must complete such construction.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-4\" pgmap=\"37\">Rankin, Howard &amp; Donnelly and J.

Contracts, \u00a7 322<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what not equivalent to breach. Where a contract provided that plaintiff should construct a chimney for defendant \u201cin about fifty working days,\u201d and also expressly provided that the time named shall be contingent upon causes of delay beyond the control of plaintiff, and where plaintiff refuses to agree to complete the construction within a named time at the request of defendant, such refusal does not amount to a renunciation or abandonment of the contract by plaintiff, for the reason that plaintiff had a right to anticipate that the character of the work and the season of the year, which was winter, may cause delays which are excusable under the provisions of the contract and which may prevent the completion of construction within such named time.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b38-6\" pgmap=\"38\">3. Contracts, \u00a7 319<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when breach does not arise before time for performance. In an action to recover on a contract whereby plaintiff agreed to construct a chimney for defendant in \u201cabout fifty working days,\u201d and where defendant sought to cancel the contract claiming breach by plaintiff, the question whether evidence that a special meaning of the term \u201cworking days\u201d obtained in the construction trade was competent as bearing on the question of a breach is immaterial where it appears by applying defendant\u2019s construction of the words to the facts in the case that no breach had taken place when defendant canceled the contract.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b38-7\" pgmap=\"38\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a71392<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal of peremptory instruction not error. In an action to recover on a contract whereby plaintiff agreed to construct a chimney for defendant in \u201cabout fifty working days,\u201d where the facts proved did not amount as a matter of law to a renunciation of the contract by plaintiff, peremptory instruction for defendant held erroneous.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
