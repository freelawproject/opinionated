The evidence tended to show that the plaintiff took his household goods to the freight depot of the defendant, located in New Jersey, on September 4, 1911. That being Labor Day, no goods were being received. The plaintiff then took them and delivered them to an expressman, to be taken by the latter to the defendant the next day for shipment to Chicago. The defendant and his family left for Chicago on September 4th. The next day the expressman delivered the goods to the railroad company. He paid the freight, $6, received a bill of lading, and mailed the same to the plaintiff in Chicago. The articles were household goods. One item was \u201c11 case contents.\u201d All of the goods weighed eight hundred pounds.. Stamped on the bill of lading in red ink by the agent in New Jersey was the following:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-10\" pgmap=\"534(69) 535(18)\">\u201cFor the purpose of enabling the carrier to apply the proper published rate, as explained in its Classification and Tariffs, I hereby declare that the value of the property herein described does not exceed $10.00 per 100, and that in case of loss or damage thereto, I will not assert claim against the carrier on a higher basis of value than $10.00 for each 100 pounds or fraction thereof in weight of the property so lost or damaged.\u201d (This was signed by plaintiff\u2019s agent.)</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7p\" pgmap=\"535\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AYD\" pgmap=\"535\">1.

In an action to recover for goods lost by a carrier in transportation from Passaic, New Jersey, to Chicago, Illinois, the refusal of the trial court to hold, as a proposition of law, that the transaction in question was interstate commerce, held erroneous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4k-\" pgmap=\"535\">2.
