In an action to recover the amount of a broker\u2019s commission for negotiating the sale of certain real estate, judgment against plaintiff held not manifestly against the weight of evidence.</headnotes><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b607-4\" pgmap=\"607\">This case has been tried twice. On the first trial the court directed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant, Minnie 1ST. Foster, which they did, and judgment was entered on the verdict against the plaintiff. On June 24, 1913, this court reversed said judgment and remanded the cause on the ground that the trial court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant. (Wood v. Foster, 181 Ill. App. 409.) When the ease came on for trial the second time the defendant withdrew her request for a jury trial, and the case was tried before the court upon the same evidence as was introduced at the first trial. It was stipulated that the transcript of the record and the printed abstract thereof filed in this court on the former appeal be introduced in evidence without objections or exceptions by either party. The court found the issues against the plaintiff and on October 2, 1914, entered judgment against the plaintiff for costs. The issues made by the pleadings and the. evidence in the case are sufficiently stated in the former opinion of this court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-5\" pgmap=\"607\">E.
