The statement of claim set forth that plaintiffs were the executors of the last will and testament of the said Joseph De Trana, deceased, duly appointed by the Probate Court of Cook county. It also set out the note in full, a copy of which was attached to and made a part thereof. To this statement of claim defendant, who is an attorney of law, filed an affidavit of merits wherein he did not deny the execution of the said note, but claimed to have paid on said note the sum of $50; and further, that there was due him from the said De Trana, by reason of legal services rendered and disbursements advanced, the sum of $199. Also, on the same date defendant filed a \u2018 \u2018 statement and affidavit of claim on set-off,\u201d which was but a repetition of his affidavit of merits.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\" pgmap=\"180\">No affidavit of merits was filed by the plaintiffs to this statement and affidavit of claim on set-off.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\" pgmap=\"180\">On the trial below, before the court without a jury, the court found the issues against the defendant and assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 damages in the sum of $359.10, and judgment for said amount was entered thereon, to reverse which the defendant has sued out this writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-6\" pgmap=\"181\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-7\" pgmap=\"181\">1.

In a suit by an executor on a promissory note payable to a deceased person, testimony of the defendant that he had paid part of the note to deceased was incompetent under Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. 1911, ch. 51, sec. 2 (J. &amp; A. \u00b6 5519), defendant being an adverse witness on his own behalf.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">2.
