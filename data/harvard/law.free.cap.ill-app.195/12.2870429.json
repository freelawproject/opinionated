Evidence held insufficient to show that a broker was the procuring cause of a sale of real estate, where the sellers had submitted the property to the buyer at the same price before the broker, and the vendee told the latter that knowing the seUers, the buyers would probably deal directly with the vendor, and thereafter without the broker\u2019s aid or influence purchased directly from the sellers.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-3\" pgmap=\"39\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\" pgmap=\"39\">Suit by Eugene A. Bournique against John B. Drake and others for broker\u2019s commissions based upon the claim that plaintiff was the authorized agent of defendant to find a purchaser of certain real estate belonging to the estate of John B. Drake, Sr., and that he was the procuring cause of the sale thereof. It appeared that the property in question was purchased by the trustee of the estate of Marshall Field for $1,100,000, that the property was first offered to the Field estate by Drake, but that the trustees were not then in a position to purchase it, that such property was located near the retail store of Marshall Field &amp; Company and was desirable for the Field estate and that the purchasers and seller were acquainted with each other. The plaintiff had nothing to do with the negotiations in which the terms of sale were discussed, and though the evidence was conflicting, it tended to show that the purchasers treated the plaintiff\u2019s efforts with courtesy but finally took up the matter of purchasing directly with Drake. At the trial the plaintiff recovered a judgment for $27,500, two and one-half per cent, of the selling price, and the defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">Wilson, Moore &amp; McIlvaine, for appellant; N.
