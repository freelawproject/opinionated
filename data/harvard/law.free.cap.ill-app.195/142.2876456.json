Rysdon Company. It appeared that defendant had a contract to install twenty skylights in the roof of a one-story car barn at Rockford, Illinois. After three of them had been installed by an employee named Malmstrom, defendant, desiring to use Malmstrom\u2019s services elsewhere, directed the plaintiff Novy to go to Rockford and do the remainder of the work. Plaintiff was an experienced sheet metal worker, and the only instructions given him by defendant\u2019s president, Louis Rysdon, who employed him, were to go to Rockford with Malmstrom, who would show him what was to be done. There was evidence tending to prove that defendant delegated to Malmstrom the duty of furnishing to plaintiff suitable hoisting apparatus for his use, and that after it was set up, although Malmstrom said he did not like the way it worked, and that \u201cit did not catch right,\u201d he nevertheless directed plaintiff to use it and \u201cget through as quickly as he could.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-4\" pgmap=\"169\">After Malmstrom left, two laborers used the derrick until about 2:30 in the afternoon, in hoisting the material to the roof. Then they fastened a barrel of putty weighing five hundred pounds to the cable, and attempted to hoist it. When they had raised it about fifteen feet above the ground, they called to plaintiff, who was working at another part of the roof, to \u201ccome over and give them a hand.\u201d Plaintiff took hold of one of the drum handles while the laborers held the other. By their combined efforts, the handles were turned several times, when something gave way and plaintiff was thrown from the roof to the ground. He sustained a compound fracture of both bones of the left leg above the ankle, resulting in a stiff ankle and deformed foot, with two and one-half inches shortening of the leg.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\" pgmap=\"169\">At the trial a judgment of $8,000 was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169\">Ralph F.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1411<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict will not be disturbed on appeal. Where the evidence upon questions of pure fact is conflicting, the Appellate Court is not authorized to reverse the finding of the jury and the judgment of the trial court, unless after an examination of all the evidence it appears that the verdict is manifestly contrary to the preponderance of the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 166<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when servant need not inspect appliances. In the absence of notice that a pawl is defective, a servant has the right to rely upon the inspection of such hoisting apparatus by the representative of the master to whom has been delegated the duty of furnishing the appliance, and such servant is not required to inspect the appliance.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b170-7\" pgmap=\"170\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 363<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when servant does not assume rislc of injury. Where evidence in an action for injuries showed that a defective derrick was used successfully for several hours, the danger arising from the use of such derrick was not so obvious that a reasonably prudent person would have refused to use it, and a servant in obeying the direction of the representative of the master to use the apparatus did not assume the risk of injury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b170-8\" pgmap=\"170\">4. Master and servant, \u00a7 623<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what evidence as to defective appliance admissible. In an action for injuries to a servant caused by a derrick, where some evidence tended to show that the derrick was in the same condition two days after the accident as at the time, there was no reversible error in permitting a witness to testify as to its condition on such second day.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b170-9\" pgmap=\"170\">5. Master and servant, \u00a7 777<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction properly refused as misleading. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a servant by reason of a defective derrick, an instruction which might have been understood as announcing the view that it was the duty of the servant to inspect the appliance for defects was properly refused as misleading, as such duty under the evidence was that of the representative of the master.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
