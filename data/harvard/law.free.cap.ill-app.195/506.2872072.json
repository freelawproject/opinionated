Buker, defendant, to recover on a contract for professional services as an attorney at law. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $343.40, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-12\" pgmap=\"532(64) 533(167)\">Plaintiff is an attorney at law, and was retained by the defendant to represent him in a certain litigation then pending in the Superior Court of Cook county. It was agreed that plaintiff should receive $5 per hour for the time necessarily employed. January 26, 1912, a memorandum of the agreement was signed by the defendant, which stated that $100 had been paid as a retainer, and that the fees earned should be \u201cpaid as fast as can be, and secured on Buker\u2019s Estate.\u201d In accordance with the agreement, plaintiff proceeded to represent the defendant in the case in the Superior Court, and continued to do so until some time in July, 1912. At that time plaintiff claimed he had been necessarily engaged 127% hours in the litigation, and requested that the defendant secure him for his fees before proceeding further. At the time of the request the amount of his services rendered had not been computed. Plaintiff requested that he be secured on the interest which the defendant had in the property involved in the case in the Superior Court, the security to cover the services rendered and to be rendered. The defendant refused to do so, stating that as he did not know the amount of plaintiff\u2019s bill, he was unwilling to give the security. Thereupon plaintiff said he would have nothing further to do with the case.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1G7\" pgmap=\"533\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ai-\" pgmap=\"533\">1.
