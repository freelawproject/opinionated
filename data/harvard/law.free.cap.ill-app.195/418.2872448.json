In an action to recover on a written contract of employment, contract construed and held that a proposition of law to the effect that the contract was terminable at the pleasure of defendant, and that plaintiff could recover only for the time he worked thereunder, was properly rejected as not correctly stating the law of the case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aip\" pgmap=\"446\">3.

A contract providing that plaintiff shall be employed by defendant and requiring defendant to pay to plaintiff for his services a stated sum each week, commencing at a named date and continuing thereafter until a named date, is susceptible only of the construction that the term of such contract is intended to be two years, where it appears that the mutual covenants of the contract continue over a period of two years, although such period is nowhere therein stated as the term thereof, since equivalent words are found in such contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aj_\" pgmap=\"446(67) 447(29)\">4.

Where a contract of employment does not in express words state the term during which the contract is to operate, but provides for a series of payments to be made each week without interruption during a period which is in fact two years, and which also provides that plaintiff \u201cis to have two weeks vacation in each year with full pay,\u201d held that there was no ambiguity in the contract; \u201ceach year,\u201d as used therein meaning \u201ceach year\u201d of a two years\u2019 contract.</headnotes><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-4\" pgmap=\"446\">To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $500, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-5\" pgmap=\"446\">Harry G.
