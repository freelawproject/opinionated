Where, in an action to recover an instalment of salary, the appellee confessed error in the admission in evidence of a judgment in his favor for a prior instalment, which had since been-reversed by the Supreme Court holding that defendant was not liable, the court, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s confession of error, may consider defendant\u2019s assignment of error based upon the refusal of the trial court to give a peremptory instruction, and since, under the undisputed facts, there could be nO' recovery, may reverse without remanding.</headnotes><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\" pgmap=\"400\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\" pgmap=\"400\">Action by Albert A. Newman, plaintiff, against the Newman Clock Company, defendant, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover instalments of salary claimed under a written contract.

Since the rendition of the judgment appealed from, such prior judgment has been reversed by the Supreme Court (268 Ill. 426, aff\u2019g 191 Ill. App. 343), holding as matter of law that the acts of plaintiff shown by the record in that case amounted to a breach of the contract releasing defendant from liability thereon.
