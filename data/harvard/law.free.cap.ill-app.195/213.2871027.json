Adrian Scheltes, trustee, plaintiff, against Thomas M. Hunter, bailiff, defendant. On submission of the case, by agreement, to the court without a jury, the court found defendant guilty and that plaintiff was entitled to possession of the property, and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at one cent. A motion for new trial was overruled, and from judgment entered on the finding, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\" pgmap=\"239(184) 240(95)\">The evidence shows that on December 30,1911, Nate Schatz, who was engaged in the clothing business in the city of Chicago, under the name and style of \u201cBart Clothing Company,\u201d executed and delivered to S. A. Scheltes, as trustee, a certain deed of trust purporting to be an assignment for the benefit of the creditors of Schatz. The deed conveyed to the trustee all his merchandise, furniture and fixtures, cash, bills and accounts receivable, and other property owned by him in connection with the said business. At the time of the execution, Schatz was owing a large amount of money, practically all of it to eleven creditors, one of whom was Rose, Rogers and Rose, a corporation, that held a claim amounting to $2,649.06, and the deed was executed in pursuance of an arrangement made at a meeting of certain of the creditors of Schatz, and was ratified and assented to by ten of the said eleven creditors.!\u2122There was a conflict in the evidence as to whether Rose, Rogers and Rose ratified and assented! to the assignment. Immediately after the execution of\u00ae the said deed, the trustee took possession of the property conveyed and appears to have conducted the business from that time until the date of the trial. On May 4,1912, Rose, Rogers and Rose recovered a judgment against the said Schatz, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, in the sum of $2,671. Execution was issued on this judgment and placed in the hands of Thomas M. Hunter, the bailiff of said court, who, on or about June 4, 1912, seized 400 suits of men\u2019s clothing in the hands of the said trustee.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\" pgmap=\"240\">The declaration consists of the usual counts in replevin. The defendant filed two pleas; the first averring that the property replevined was the property of Nathan Schatz and not of the plaintiff, the second averring justification of the seizure as bailiff of the said court under a writ of execution in full force and effect, issued by the said court on the said judgment in favor of Rose, Rogers and Rose. To these pleas the plaintiff filed a replication.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">The defendant contended \u201cthat the alleged assignment for the benefit of creditors is void because it tends to hinder, delay and defraud creditors. Being void, no title, to any property of Schatz passed to Scheltes, the plaintiff in this replevin action\u201d; that the goods seized by the defendant as bailiff of the Municipal Court were in fact the goods of Schatz, and that the trial court erred in rendering' judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant further contended that \u201cthe plaintiff did not establish an estoppel by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240(73) 241(30)\">The plaintiff contended: \u201c1. The deed of trust was not made to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, and was not fraudulent or void. 2. A preponderance of the evidence clearly establishes that the deed of trust was made with the full knowledge and acquiescence of R\u00f3se, Rogers and Rose, and, therefore, was and is \u2022binding upon them. 3. The goods seized by the bailiff under the execution were goods purchased by S. Adrian Sckeltes, as trustee, and were not subject to seizure under execution against Nate Schatz, the original assignor, even though the original conveyance to the trustee were fraudulent and void.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b241-8\" pgmap=\"241\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b241-9\" pgmap=\"241\">1.
