To reverse a judgment of nil capiat for defendant, entered on a verdict of not guilty ordered by the court, plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-12\" pgmap=\"411(29) 412(97)\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that her intestate, whil\u00e9 employed as a barn boss and engaged in and about his duties near a grain and malt elevator owned and operated by defendant, received injuries from an explosion in the elevator which resulted in his death. There was evidence tending to show the presence in the elevator of quantities of grain dust and the proximity of lighted gas jets; that such dust is of a highly explosive nature and on contact with flame or spark will explode; that this was a dust explosion; that the device used by defendant to remove dust was not effective for the purpose, and that other methods, which a witness described in detail, would prevent such an explosion.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A6P\" pgmap=\"412\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ATsa\" pgmap=\"412\">1.

In an action to recover for the death of an employee due to an explosion of grain dust in the employer\u2019s elevator, where it appeared that there were lighted gas jets in the proximity to quantities of such dust, the question whether the employer\u2019s duty to use reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe place to work requires him to substitute another method of preventing such explosions is for the jury.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">Juul &amp; Juul, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">F.
