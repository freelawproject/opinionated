Contracts, \u00a7 86<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what constitutes sufficient consideration to support contract. In an action to recover on a contract whereby defendant guarantied the return of goods supplied to a third person for use by such person as samples while employed by plaintiff, the employment of such third person by plaintiff is a sufficient consideration to support the contract sued upon.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"All\" pgmap=\"471\">2. Limitation of action, \u00a7 21<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when action on contract of guaranty barred.

Guaranty, \u00a7 6<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when notice of acceptance of guaranty unnecessary. In an action to recover on a contract of guaranty, unlimited as to time, but limited as to amount, proof of notice to guarantor of the acceptance of the undertaking is not necessary.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AU9\" pgmap=\"471\">4. Guaranty, \u00a7 33<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what facts must he specially pleaded. In an action to recover upon a collateral, continuing guaranty if defendant in defense relies on the fact that no suit was brought against the principal to recover the debt, and that no notice of the default in payment was given to defendant, such facts must be specially pleaded, for the reason that in such case proof of the indebtedness and of the guaranty entitles plaintiff prima facie to recover.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJk\" pgmap=\"471\">5. Guaranty, \u00a7 27<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when failure to give notice of default of principal available as defense. In an action to recover on a guaranty, the fact of failure of plaintiff to notify defendant of the default of principal can be availed of as a defense only in so far as defendant can show damage as a result of such want of notice.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b471-13\" pgmap=\"471\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
