Krulewich, defendant, in the Superior Court of Cook county, to recover money alleged to have been deposited by plaintiff in defendant\u2019s savings bank. It was not disputed that a man named Powel Gilis made deposits and is entitled to withdraw the same, and the question was as to his identity with plaintiff. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $237, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\" pgmap=\"410\">Plaintiff has possession of the bank book issued to Powel Gilis, and testified that he received it when he opened his account with defendant; that he made the deposits and received the withdrawals entered in the book; that the signature on the identification card was made by him. Other witnesses testified that plaintiff is the man to whom this book was issued and who had an account with defendant. Defendant introduced testimony tending to show that the signature of plaintiff was not made by the man who signed the identification card when the account was opened.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-10\" pgmap=\"410\">M.
