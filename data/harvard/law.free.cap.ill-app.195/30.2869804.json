Wallace Wakem against the Colonial Trust &amp; Savings Bank, a corporation, for the alleged conversion by said bank of a promissory note in the sum of $2,000 made by John T. Cheney, under date of July 9,1912, due four months from its date, bearing interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, indorsed in blank by Clinton S. Woolf oik and the Realty Realization Company, and of forty shares of the capital stock of the said company which was attached to said note as collateral security. Plaintiff purchased the note from R. C. Keller, vice-president and cashier of the Colonial Trust &amp; Savings Bank, and the note with the collateral attached was subsequently deposited with the bank for collection. The bank issued its receipt to plaintiff, under said date, reciting therein that it had received the note for collection. The plaintiff denied that he authorized the bank to deliver the _x__ note to the indorser, Woolf oik, and no written authority was given to the hank to deliver the note to such indorser.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1kT\" pgmap=\"57\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-9\" pgmap=\"57\">1. Banks and banking, \u00a7 152<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when hank is liable for negligence. If no authority is given to a bank to deliver a note to an indorser thereon for collection, such unauthorized act on the part of the bank constitutes negligence, and the bank is liable for any loss resulting therefrom.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-10\" pgmap=\"57\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1396<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding will he set aside on appeal. Evidence held to justify a finding that a bank was not authorized to deliver a note to an indorser thereon for collection.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-11\" pgmap=\"57\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1173<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when propositions of law refused need not he considered on appeal. Where no complaint is made as to propositions of law held by the court, which propositions correctly state the principles of law applicable to the evidence, it is unnecessary to consider objections to propositions of law refused.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-4\" pgmap=\"57\">Following the death of the indorser, Woolf oik, about five months after the maturity of the note, plaintiff for the first time, according to his testimony, learned that the hank had delivered the note to such indorser. Neither the note nor collateral has ever been found, and plaintiff has received no proceeds from either. There was a finding in favor of plaintiff, and judgment for $2,183.46, whereupon defendants appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">Adams, Follahsbee, Hawley &amp; Shorey, for appellant; Mitchell D.
