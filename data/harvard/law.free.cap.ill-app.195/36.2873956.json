This contract was never consummated. The plaintiff was a broker in the transaction, and the said written contract contained the following provisions relating to commissions: \u201cBrokerage fees- to be paid as follows, to-wit: Party of the first part (Gudichsen) to pay to Frank N. Derby two hundred ($200.00) dollars. Party of the second part (defendant in error), to pay to Frank N. Derby two hundred ($200.00) dollars.\u201d In addition to this contract, the plaintiff also introduced evidence to the effect that he was to receive his commission from the defendant when he brought the latter and Gudichsen together in a valid, binding and enforceable contract. It is conceded that the plaintiff did bring the defendant and Gudichsen together in such a contract, but the defendant claimed on the trial that there was an oral agreement between the parties to this suit to the effect that the latter would not be entitled to any commission from the defendant until the contract between the latter and Gudichsen had been actually consummated, and some evidence, tending to prove this claim, was introduced.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\" pgmap=\"63\">The case was tried before the court without a jury, and a finding and judgment in favor of the defendant was entered, and this writ of error followed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-7\" pgmap=\"63\">Arthur A.

In a suit for broker\u2019s commissions, the fact that the broker recorded or caused to be recorded the written contract for the exchange of property, without authority from either the buyer or seller so to do, would not alone bar the broker\u2019s right to recover if he was otherwise entitled thereto.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
