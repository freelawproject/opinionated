Painter, plaintiff, against Howard Durham, defendant, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover on a contract for services. From a judgment for plaintiff for $4.26, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\" pgmap=\"494(158) 495(169)\">This was an action of the first class in the Municipal. Court of Chicago, brought by the appellant (hereinafter called the plaintiff) against the appellee (hereinafter called the defendant) to recover a balance of $955.26, and interest, alleged to be due the plaintiff for services as a \u201cgraduate professional nurse,\u201d rendered to the defendant under an alleged contract. Plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, as amended, alleges, in substance, that she rendered services to certain members of the defendant\u2019s family as a \u201cgraduate professional nurse,\u201d for a period of eighty-one weeks, from March 16, 1908, to and including October 19, 1909 (except two weeks, from July 25, 1908, to August 10,1908), at an agreed rate of $25 per week, making a total of $2,025; that the defendant was entitled to credit for payments aggregating $1,069.74, leaving a balance due to plaintiff of $955.26, with interest. The defendant filed an affidavit of merits in which he denied the employment of the plaintiff for a longer period than seventy-nine weeks; denied any contract or agreement with the plaintiff to pay her at the, rate of $25 per week, or that he ever ratified any such alleged agreement; and averred that there was never any contract or agreement as to the rate of pay of the plaintiff; that she was entitled to payment only at a reasonable rate for the nature and kind of services performed; that plaintiff rendered services as a \u201cgraduate professional nurse\u201d for twenty-six weeks only, and that for such service $25 per week is reasonable, making a total of $650; that for the remaining sixty-three weeks plaintiff rendered services only as a practical or untrained nurse, for which $8 per week is reasonable and ample compensation, making a total of $424; that plaintiff earned for her entire services to the defendant a sum not exceeding $1,074; that defendant has paid to plaintiff $1,069.74, leaving a balance of $4.26 due the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\" pgmap=\"495(208) 496(68)\">The defendant testified as follows: \u201cThat on the 9th or 10th of May, 1909, Miss Painter rendered me a statement and asked for some money. I had been giving her money as she asked it during this time. The statement showed that I owed her at the rate of $25 a week a little over $1,000. I wrote Miss Painter a check for $300. I told her I had no idea she would charge me $25 a week for every week she had been with me, that I thought it was unfair, that I could not afford to pay it, that I could not afford to keep her at that rate and that if she was going to stay with me any longer she would have to reduce her bill and reduce her charge for the future. That is the payment appearing on statement of claim under date of May 11,1909. The Court: Q. What did she say when you told her she would have to reduce her bill? A. She said she didn\u2019t see how she could do it, etc., but I told her I could not afford to keep her any longer at that rate. It was a pleasant friendly conversation and we left it that way, that I could not afford to pay it.\u201d The defendant further testified that he never at any time during the period of employment told the plaintiff that he considered her as anything else than a professional nurse; that after the said conversation he permitted the plaintiff to continue in her work and nothing further was said or done in reference to her work or pay.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AIZ\" pgmap=\"496\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aqq\" pgmap=\"496\">1.
