Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 5<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what power judges have to mahe rules. Under paragraph 9 of section 28 of the Municipal Court Act (J. &amp; A. \u00a1[ 3340), the judges of the Municipal Court of Chicago may adopt a rule providing for the filing of a statement of claim, instead of a declaration, in cases of the first class.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AvSK\" pgmap=\"603\">3. Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 17b<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when motion for dismissal of action properly refused. In an action of contract of the first class in the Municipal Court of Chicago, the denial of a motion to dismiss held not erroneous because plaintiffs filed a statement of claim instead of a declaration, where it appeared that such pleading was permitted by a rule of that court in force when such statement of claim was filed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AWy\" pgmap=\"603\">4.

Where the settlement of a controversy is delegated to the attorney of one of the parties with general authority to settle the same, an admission by him made during negotiations looking to such settlement is not incompetent as violating the rule that an attorney cannot, outside a trial, make admissions against the interest of a client, for the reason that the law of principal and agent is applicable to the relation of attorney and client, and the client is bound by the acts of his attorney within the scope of the authority of such attorney.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AhQV\" pgmap=\"603(68) 604(24)\">5. Attorney and client, \u00a7 67<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when client bound by admission of attorney. A client which has delegated to its general counsel general authority to settle a controversy is bound by the admission of an attorney in the office of such general counsel, to whom the settlement of such controversy has been delegated with the consent of the client, as much as though such admission were made by such general counsel, especially where it appears that the client acquiesced in and subsequently ratified the acts of such attorney with reference to such controversy.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-4\" pgmap=\"603\">Montgomery, Hart, Smith &amp; Steere, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-5\" pgmap=\"603\">Carl A.
