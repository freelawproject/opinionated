L. Dawson, a dealer in secondhand machinery, by which the greater part of the machinery5 there located was so damaged as to render it unfit for further use as such. Plaintiff contended that such machinery was sold by Dawson to the defendant, a dealer in scrap iron, having two yards, known respectively as Halsted street and Lake street yards; that at the time of the fire, he had on consignment with the said Dawson a lot of secondhand laundry machinery which had been placed in merchantable condition by Dawson; that the fire rendered necessary the removal of the machinery from Dawson\u2019s premises; that defendant, in the course of the negotiations for the purchase from Dawson of what the defendant designated as \u201cmachinery cast scrap,\u201d agreed to permit the said laundry machinery to be stored in its Lake street yard without reward; that in accordance with said agreement, said laundry machinery was taken to the yard of the defendant; that thereafter defendant refused to return it on demand and converted same to its own use.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\" pgmap=\"251\">Defendant contended that plaintiff did not show that this property ever came into its possession; further, that as to said property, even though it came into its possession, it was a bailee without reward, and the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property was lost through the gross negligence of the defendant; and, finally, that the property in question was part of the property purchased from the said Dawson, and for which it had paid.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\" pgmap=\"251\">On behalf of the plaintiff, the testimony showed that shortly after the fire, Dawson called at defendant\u2019s place of business for the purpose of selling the machinery which had been rendered unfit for further use as such, and that he talked with one Santowsky, president of the defendant, who afterwards called at Dawson\u2019s premises; that Dawson showed him what he had for sale; that they discussed and arrived at terms of sale; that the sale was confirmed by letter from defendant to Dawson, a carbon copy of which was introduced in evidence and reads as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\" pgmap=\"251\">\u201cPhones: Monroe 156.

There was further testimony that all the machinery that was delivered either at its Lake street or at its Halsted street yard was part bf the property purchased under the above letter, and had been paid for; that said laun-' dry machinery, even though it was intact and usable, was considered as machinery cast scrap; furthermore, that no money was paid defendant for hauling the laundry machinery to its Lake street yard. While Santowsky denied having had a conversation with Dawson relative to the storage of this laundry machinery, he admitted that in a conversation with the said Dawson at the time of the negotiations that led up to the agreement embodied in the letter aforesaid, he (Dawson) stated: \u201cAll the machines that is there that have any good, we will take away, the rest we can pick out.\u201d There was no evidence on the part of the defendant as to the value of the property in question.</p><headnotes data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-7\" pgmap=\"253\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-8\" pgmap=\"253\">Trover and conversion, \u00a7 39<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to support verdict.
