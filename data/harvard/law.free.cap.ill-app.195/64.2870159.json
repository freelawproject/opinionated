Huggins. The trust deed was executed by Lilly Gottschalk, and was given to secure the payment of certain promissory notes. All of the notes were signed by said Lilly Gottschalk and were made payable to herself, and were indorsed by her and Albert Wesley Gottschalk. At the time of the filing of the bill, some of the notes were owned by the complainant. A decree was entered finding, inter alia, that there was due to the complainant the sum of $641.47, with interest thereon from December 27, 1912, and also the sum of $75 as reasonable solicitor\u2019s fees, and a sale of the real estate was ordered, unless such sums, together with the costs of the suit, yrere paid within ten days. The decree further provided that \u201cafter the coming in and the confirmation of the master\u2019s report of sale in case any deficiency is shown in the amount due to the complainant, Sara G. Huggins, she shall be entitled to execution against the defendant, Lilly Gottschalk and Albert Wesley Gottschalk, personally liable therefor.\u201d This appeal is prosecuted to reverse said decree, and the sole appellant is Albert Wesley Gottschalk.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-7\" pgmap=\"91\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b91-8\" pgmap=\"91\">Appeal and error, \u00a7 308<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what decision not reviewaMe on appeal.
