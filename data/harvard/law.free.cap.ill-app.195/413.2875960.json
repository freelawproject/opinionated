Where a lease for one year provides that the failure of lessee to give certain notice shall at the option of lessor operate to extend the term of the lease for a further period of the same length, the fact that lessor brings an action to recover for rent due under the lease as so extended is an election by him to treat the lease as being renewed for the further term, it appearing that the notice required was not given.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AdVf\" pgmap=\"440(57) 441(23)\">3.

Where a lease for one year provided that the failure of lessee to give certain notice should operate at the option of lessor to extend the-term of the lease, the same consideration which supports other provisions of the lease will support the condition that failure to give the notice provided for should extend the lease, for the reason that the contract was entire.</headnotes><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b440-4\" pgmap=\"440\">Defendant vacated the premises April 30,1914, and the lease provided that in case he should vacate, the same might be relet by the lessor for such a rent and upon such terms as he might see fit, and if a sufficient sum should not be thus realized to satisfy the rent thereby reserved, the lessee agreed to satisfy and pay the deficiency.
