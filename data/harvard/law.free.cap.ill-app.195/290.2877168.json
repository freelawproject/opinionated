The lamps were installed and $24 paid on the total purchase price of $195. Defendant contended that the lamps did not perform the work for which they were bought, and counterclaimed against plaintiff\u2019s claim the $24 it had paid on account. The trial court found the issues for the defendant on the counterclaim and gave judgment in its favor for $24, and plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error in an effort to reverse the judgment.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-10\" pgmap=\"316(119) 317(35)\">There was evidence that the plaintiff was a manufacturer of the lamps contracted to be sold to defendant; that defendant operated printing presses which caused considerable vibration, and that the lamps which defendant was using were often broken by reason of the vibration; that it was represented to defendant at the time of the sale that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cNew Idea\u201d lamps would withstand the vibration without breaking; that the lamps sold were to take the place of the ones then in use, which were discarded and the \u201cNew Idea\u201d lamps installed! in their stead; that the \u201cNew Idea\u201d lamps did not fulfil the purpose for which they were bought and which plaintiff knew they were intended to serve; that the new lamps did not withstand the vibration caused by the running of the presses, but constantly broke so that they could not be used successfully to light the presses.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-8\" pgmap=\"317\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b317-9\" pgmap=\"317\">1.
