Upon a trial before the court without a jury, plaintiffs recovered a judgment for two hundred and twenty dollars, and defendant sued out this writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-8\" pgmap=\"124\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-9\" pgmap=\"124\">1. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1414<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding of court will not be disturbed. Evidence, though conflicting, held to support a finding of the existence of a contract of employment for one year.,</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-10\" pgmap=\"124\">2. Appeal and error,' \u00a7 1258<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when party cannot complain of amount of recovery. A defendant cannot complain on appeal merely because the amount of damages allowed the plaintiffs was less than a sum which would have been justified under the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-11\" pgmap=\"124\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1414<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding of court not justified by evidence. Evidence fyeld not to justify a finding of default under a contract of employment, for while the employees did not appear on a certain date as required by the contract, it appeared that they were prepared' and ready to go but did not because defendant\u2019s agent telegraphed them not to do so.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-12\" pgmap=\"124\">4. Frauds, Statute of, \u00a7 118<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statute must be pleaded. If the Statute of Frauds is relied upon as a defense it must be pleaded, unless the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings are in such form as to advise the defendant of the precise nature of the claim.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-13\" pgmap=\"124\">5. Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 13<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is nature of affidavit of merits. An affidavit of merits filed in the Municipal Court is not technically a pleading.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-14\" pgmap=\"124\">6. Pleading, \u00a7 262<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when amended or additional pleading is necessary. Where a statement of claim sought recovery for damages for breach of a contract of employment, and the defendant filed an affidavit of merits denying such contract, the defendant could not defend upon a different theory without asking leave to file, and filing, an amended or additional affidavit.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-15\" pgmap=\"124(24) 125(60)\">7. Appeal, and error, \u00a7 425<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when defense cannot be raised on appeal. In an action for damages for breach of a contract of employment, where it appeared that the defendant at the trial orally urged the Statute of Frauds as a defense, but did not plead such defense by filing an amended affidavit of merits, a contention that the contract was void under the Statute of Frauds could not be urged on appeal, not being brought properly before the trial court for decision.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-5\" pgmap=\"124\">Alden, Latham &amp; Young and Asa Q.
