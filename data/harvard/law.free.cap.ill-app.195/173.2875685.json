The dismissal of a bill for divorce for want of equity, on the charge of adultery, is not clearly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, where it appears that the court stated that he did not believe the plaintiff\u2019s witness, and the testimony of plaintiff was thus left uncorroborated.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b199-15\" pgmap=\"199(45) 200(29)\">2.

On appeal from a decree dismissing a bill for divorce, where the record showed that the trial court stated that complainant had testified that he had deserted his wife, but did not show evidence warranting such statement, the action of the court in refusing to allow the introduction of additional testimony was erroneous, as depriving the plaintiff of a fair and impartial hearing.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b199-7\" pgmap=\"199\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.
