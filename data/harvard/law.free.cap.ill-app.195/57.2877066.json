Proof of different and contradictory statements of a witness as to a material matter made on former occasions is merely evidence tending to impeach such witness, to be considered by the jury in estimating the weight of the testimony.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-8\" pgmap=\"84\">3.

Husband and wife, \u00a7 210<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction as to effect of separation erroneous. An instruction stating in effect that if a woman married a man in good faith and afterwards learned that he had another wife living, and they agreed to separate, such agreement was sufficient consideration to support a transfer of property from such man to the woman, is erroneous, since it was the duty of the woman on learning of the former marriage to cease living in adultery, and the agreement to separate did not extinguish any claim or right which the woman might have against the man.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b84-13\" pgmap=\"84\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
