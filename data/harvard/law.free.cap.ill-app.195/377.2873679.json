To reverse a judgment of nil capiat for defendant entered on a verdict of not guilty, plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\" pgmap=\"404\">At the time of the accident plaintiff was forty-one years old, with fifteen years\u2019 experience working on buildings. He had worked on the present building four or five months as a general laborer, carrying brick, etc. He testified that he was ordered by the foreman to carry bricks to a bricklayer; that to reach the bricklayer it was necessary to cross on floor joists which were uncovered, and plaintiff said to the foreman that planks should be laid on the joists over which he could walk, but the foreman said this was unnecessary; that as plaintiff stepped on a joist it \u201cwabbled\u201d and he fell, striking his side on the edge of the joist. On the contrary there was sufficient testimony to cause the jury to believe that nothing was said by plaintiff or the foreman about planks; that plaintiff was thoroughly experienced in walking over uncovered joists and that that whs the customary thing for workmen to do; that the joist in question was not loose and did not \u201cwabble\u201d; other, workmen had walked on it and noticed nothing wrong with it; that plaintiff fell because he stepped on a mortar board lying on the joists, which tipped.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-6\" pgmap=\"404\">Gallagher &amp; Messner, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-7\" pgmap=\"404\">Ralph F.

St., ch. 48, J. &amp; A. ff 5368), relating to the construction of scaffolds, hoists, cranes, etc., held not erroneous for the reason that plaintiff\u2019s fall was not due to defects in any of the appliances mentioned in that statute, which' had no application to the case.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
