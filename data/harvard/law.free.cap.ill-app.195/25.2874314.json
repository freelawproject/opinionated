H. Johnson, trustee of the estate of Jacob Shynman, bankrupt, against Abraham M. Goldberg, Philip Goldberg and Morris Goldberg, trading as A. M. Goldberg &amp; Brothers.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\" pgmap=\"52\">The original statement of claim averred that defendants agreed to pay Shynman\u2019s creditors $5,022.12, and the amended statement, that they agreed to pay Shynman that sum for the benefit of his creditors.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\" pgmap=\"52\">The case was heard and submitted to the jury on the theory that plaintiff could recover only on an agreement by defendants to pay all Shynman\u2019s debts, and that they amounted to said sum.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\" pgmap=\"52\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to support his allegations, and defendants\u2019 tended to show that they agreed to pay Shynman only $3,000 for Shynman\u2019s stock and machinery and incumbrances thereon, and that they performed their agreement.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\" pgmap=\"52\">The jury evidently accepted defendants\u2019 version of the contract but rejected their claim of payment. The jury were instructed, however, that unless they found the defendants agreed to pay all the debts of Shynman as charged in the statement of claim, they must find against the plaintiff and for defendants, and also that unless they found from the evidence that a definite amount was agreed upon between the parties, their finding should be for defendants. That Shynman\u2019s debts amounted to $5,022.12 was not questioned. The verdict rendered was for $3,000, and the defendants appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-10\" pgmap=\"52\">E. N. Zoline and Morris K.
