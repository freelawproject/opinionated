Van Vlissingen to recover on a promissory note executed by the defendant at Chicago, dated December 1, 1903, to the order of Fredericka Dressier, for the sum of $1,000, with interest at six per cent, per annum.

A discharge in bankruptcy releases a debt of the bankrupt arising out of a note, and to revive the same the promise of the debtor to pay the note must be clear, distinct and unequivocal, and without such clear and express promise neither pay-ment of interest, part payment of principal, nor declaration of intention to pay will suffice to revive the same.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-8\" pgmap=\"90\">2.
