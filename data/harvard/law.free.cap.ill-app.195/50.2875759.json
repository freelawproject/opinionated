A bank does not become an innocent purchaser of a negotiable note so as to entitle it to protection against infirmities of the.paper by merely discounting the same for a person not indebted to it and crediting him with the proceeds by way of deposit, as such deposit so long as it is not withdrawn is subject to equities of prior parties.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-15\" pgmap=\"76(36) 77(54)\">2.

The introduction in evidence of notes sued upon, indorsed in blank by the payee, is prima facie evidence that the plaintiff has acquired them in good faith, for value, in the usual course of business before maturity and without notice of defenses, and such proof cannot be overcome by merely showing that the original transaction between the plaintiff and the payee did not of itself amount to a purchase of the notes.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b76-7\" pgmap=\"76\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

Defendants to a suit on a note brought by an indorsee bank, in order to sustain their claim that the bank is not entitled to protection as an innocent purchaser, must show not only that the bank merely credited the proceeds of the discounted note by way of deposit in favor of the payee and that the payee was not then indebted to the bank, but must also prove that the amount due upon such deposit, if any, had not been_drawn out at the time of the trial, there being no claim of an earlier notice to the bank of such defense.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
