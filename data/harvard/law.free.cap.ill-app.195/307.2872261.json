The Act of 1898 (J. &amp; A. \u00b6 9516-9576) was intended to provide a new system for the assessment of property and not to amend the General Revenue Act, and as to that subject it is substantially complete in itself, constituting an entire plan for making the assessment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-11\" pgmap=\"334\">2.

Where the Legislature frames a new statute upon a certain subject-matter with an evident intention to revise the whole subject-matter legislated upon, there is in effect a legislative declaration that whatever is embraced in the new statute shall prevail, and that whatever is excluded is discarded, and that the provisions of the new law shall be substituted for those of the old.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-12\" pgmap=\"334(77) 335(72)\">3.
