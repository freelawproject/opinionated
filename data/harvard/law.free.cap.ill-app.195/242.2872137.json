Phillips, defendants, to recover damages claimed to have been sustained by misrepresentations of defendants as to a fur coat purchased of them by plaintiff. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendants prosecute this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-11\" pgmap=\"268(156) 269(19)\">Defendants filed an appearance and an affidavit of defense denying that any representations as claimed had been made. The case was duly set for trial, and on that date the plaintiff appeared but the defendants were absent and not represented, and the court entered judgment against them for the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Within two days thereafter defendants, by their attorneys, filed a written motion to vacafe the judgment, which motion was supported by an affidavit. This, in substance, alleged that the failure to be present on the day of the trial was due to a mistake of a clerk in the office of defendants\u2019 attorneys wh(/ was confused by the announcement of the cases on the Municipal Court judges\u2019 calls which appeared in the \u201cDaily Municipal Court Record,\u201d a daily paper or bulletin giving the court calls. The clerk\u2019s mistake seems to have been made possible by the fact that some of the judges were suspending their calls on account of the sessions of the State Bar Association, while others were not.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b269-7\" pgmap=\"269\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b269-8\" pgmap=\"269\">Judgment, \u00a7 286<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when refusal of motion to vacate judgment by default reversible error.
