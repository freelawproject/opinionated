Barber, plaintiff, against Travelers \u2019 Insurance Company, defendant, and by Marion Belle Barber, plaintiff, against Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company, defendant, each to recover on an accident policy issued by defendant to Lyman W. Barber, the beneficiary named in one policy being Bert S. Barber and in the other Marion Belle Barber. There was judgment for defendant in both actions, to reverse which plaintiffs prosecute these writs of error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-11\" pgmap=\"296(136) 297(275)\">A former trial of the same cases on the same evidence, with the exception of the testimony of Irma Palmer and Mildred Shippey, which testimony was first introduced on the present trial by defendant, resulted in judgment for the respective plaintiffs, which was reversed by this court and the causes remanded. Barber v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 165 Ill. App. 239. In the opinion then filed the pleadings and questions involved were fully stated. The policy provided: \u201cThat this insurance shall not cover * * * death * * * resulting wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, from intoxication or while intoxicated.\u201d The defense on both trials was practically that the assured at the time he came to his death was intoxicated. HA left his office about six p. m. of January 4, 1908, went to a saloon and remained three-quarters of an hour, had there one or two drinks of whisky, then went to supper and after supper had more whisky and also drank'beer; about nine o\u2019clock he went to another saloon and then to the \u201cSavoy,\u201d where he remained an hour or longer, and drank beer; then about eleven o\u2019clock he went to a house of ill-fame, where he had beer; a little later he went to another house of the same class in the same district, and there remained two hours or longer and drank beer, he went up stairs with Mildred Shippey, an inmate, and, according to her testimony and the testimony of two other inmates of the house, was then intoxicated, vomited and had to be helped up and down stairs. About 1:30 a. m. he went in a cab to a saloon nearby, and then to another house of ill-fame, on leaving which he took a girl into the cab and took her three blocks south of the saloon from which they started and in the direction of the assured\u2019s home. Thereafter the assured rode in the cab to the Old Colony Building, nearly two miles north of the place where the girl left the cab. .When he reached there he dismissed the cabman, walked up stairs to the elevated railway station, and took a southbound elevated train at 3:30 a. m. His dead body was found the next morning under the elevated railway station at the Twenty-sixth street station. The evidence showed that he fell from the car on which he was riding at that place and was thereby killed.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\" pgmap=\"297(88) 298(73)\">The defendant called five physicians and propounded to each the same hypothetical question, stating quite fully the appearance, history and actions of the assured from six p. m. of January 4th until half past three o\u2019clock the next morning, and included the assumption that he staggered, was unable to talk coherently, spoke only a few words and those merely in monosyllables. The question asked was: \u201cAssuming the facts stated in the question, have you an opinion as to whether that man was or was not intoxicated about 4 a. m. the next morning?\u201d Over the objection of plaintiff the question was permitted to be answered, and the answer by each physician was, in substance, that he had an opinion that the man was intoxicated and that the intoxication would probably continue three or four hours from four o\u2019clock. One of the contentions of the defendant is that the court erred in permitting the hypothetical question to be answered.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-8\" pgmap=\"298\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-9\" pgmap=\"298\">1.
