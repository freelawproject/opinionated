Devine, administrator of the estate of Vladislaw Paszkowsky, deceased, plaintiff, against Chicago &amp; Western Indiana Railroad Company and the Belt Railway Company of Chicago, defendants, alleging that defendants, by their servants, with force and arms, assaulted plaintiff\u2019s intestate, causing his death. The jury returned a verdict finding defendants not guilty, on which verdict the court entered judgment. To reverse this judgment, plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">The defendants entered a special plea son assault demesne and the plaintiff a replication de injuria absque tali causa.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\" pgmap=\"261\">The testimony tended to show that in the evening of February 14, 1905, Wirsing, a special policeman, employed about their tracks by defendants, and two other special policemen saw two men stealing coal from cars on defendants \u2019 tracks. The officers followed them and Wirsing overtook the two men, who were carrying the stolen coal in sacks. One of the men was plaintiff, who is described as the \u201cbig man.\u201d While there is some slight conflict in the testimony, Wirsing\u2019s story in the main is uncontradicted. He says that he showed his star to these two men and demanded the return of the coal but they dropped their sacks and \u201ctackled\u201d him. He says that he had offered no violence to them up to that time. Wirsing drew a revolver and fired in the air, as he says, to attract the attention of the other two officers. His story of the affair from that point, in substance, is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\" pgmap=\"261(79) 262(110)\">\u2018 \u2018 With that the big man broke away from me and ran into what I afterwards found to be his yard. I fought the little man into his yard, where we were met by the big man. The big man had an ax and threw it at me, striking the fence. In the meantime the little man backed away from me and disappeared and my time was taken up with the larger man of the two. He ran into the shed and got a shovel, and I went into the shed after him and tried to get the shovel away from him, at the same time telling him to \u2018drop that.\u2019 I fired another shot into the fence, thinking thereby to make him drop it. About a few minutes after that we kept on struggling and he attacked me with the shovel and he struck me in the right hand. I had the revolver in my hand pointed directly at him when he struck me on the hand. It exploded and the shot struck him on the knee. After that he rallied and drove me into the alley.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-9\" pgmap=\"262\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-10\" pgmap=\"262\">L Action on the case, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to support verdict. Evidence in action of trespass on the case to recover for death of plaintiff\u2019s decedent by assault by defendants\u2019 servants, examined and held to support verdict for defendants.</headnotes><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\" pgmap=\"262\">On cross-examination the witness said that plaintiff struck him several times with the shovel, and also \u201che struck the gun. When the gun went off I was not trying to fire the gun at all. \u2019 \u2019 Other witnesses gave testimony tending to corroborate Wirsing, and it seems to have been proven beyond serious doubt that the firing of the revolver was simultaneous with the blow on the hand in which it was held from the shovel wielded by plaintiff. From the facts in evidence we would have little trouble in concluding that the actual firing of the shot was not the intentional act of defendants\u2019 servant, but was accidental as regards them.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\" pgmap=\"262\">Arthur C.
