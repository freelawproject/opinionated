The receipt of the beans and the correctness of the purchase price were admitted by the defendant and a set-off was filed, in which the defendant claimed that the beans contained formaldehyde and salicylic acid, and that an extract consisting of a maceration of said vanilla beans, grain alcohol, glycerine and sugar was found, upon chemical analysis, about eight months thereafter, to contain formaldehyde and salicylic acid, neither of which products being normal ingredients of vanilla beans, but are sometimes used as preservatives thereof. Defendant claims that said extract was unsalable and became a total loss.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b55-9\" pgmap=\"55\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b55-10\" pgmap=\"55\">1. Appeal and error, \u00a7 536<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is necessary to preserve objection for review. A contention on appeal that a plaintiff who made no motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence cannot question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict for the defendant is not well taken.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\" pgmap=\"55\">No chemical analysis of the beans at any time was made by either of the parties. There were two shipments of beans of fifty pounds each, following the receipt by the defendant of a sample lot of beans of twenty-five pounds.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\" pgmap=\"55\">About two-thirds of the beans were used by the defendant and the remainder were returned to the plaintiff, credit being given therefor. Plaintiff, who was an importer of vanilla beans, denied that formaldehyde or salicylic acid was used by it as a preservative of said vanilla beans, or for any other purpose in connection therewith. There was a trial by jury, resulting in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendant on its set-off for three hundred dollars, whereupon the plaintiff brought error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-6\" pgmap=\"55\">Hoyne, O\u2019Connor &amp; Irwin, for plaintiff in error; Carl J.
