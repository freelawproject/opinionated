There was some evidence that there was a wind blowing from the south, accompanied by snow and rain, and one of defendant\u2019s street cars, going south on the west track on Western avenue, was approaching the intersection of Polk street, at a speed variously estimated by the witnesses at from seven to twenty miles an hour. Lenihan stepped off the sidewalk at the southeast corner of Polk street and Western avenue, and walked southwesterly towards the sidewalk at the northwest corner of said streets, thereby apparently following the most direct course from one sidewalk to the other. As he reached the west rail of the west car track, he was struck by the street car and killed. Whether he saw or heard the car coming is not known. There was evidence tending to prove that although the motorman saw Lenihan when the latter first started to cross the street, the car being then about one hundred feet away, yet he merely sounded his gong, without applying the brakes, and made no effort to stop the car until Lenihan stepped directly in front of it, about twenty or twenty-five feet away.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\" pgmap=\"171\">At the trial a judgment of $2,000 was entered in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AtH\" pgmap=\"172\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\" pgmap=\"172\">1.

In an action for the death of a pedestrian struck by a street car, an instruction stating that if the jury believed from the evidence that the motorman saw the deceased \u201cin time to have slowed up his car and have prevented said collision,\u201d then it was the absolute duty of the motorman, as a matter of law, to do so, and that his failure to act in that particular manner in this case was such negligence, as a . matter of law, \u201cas would render the defendant liable\u201d in damages, provided the motorman\u2019s failure to so act was the cause of the accident, and that deceased was in the exercise of due care for his own safety is erroneous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\" pgmap=\"172\">2.
