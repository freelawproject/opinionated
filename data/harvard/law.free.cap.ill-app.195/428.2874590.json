Hyatt, plaintiff, against A. Volney Foster, defendant, in the Municipal Court of Chicago, to recover the interest of plaintiff in the profits of a transaction with another. To reverse a judgment of $635 for plaintiff, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-13\" pgmap=\"454(48) 455(113)\">The evidence shows that plaintiff was employed by the United States Silica Company, of which defendant was president, and also by defendant in the interest of the estate of Volney W. Foster, deceased, at a salary of $250 a month, $150 of which was paid by the Silica Company and $100 by the Foster estate. It was agreed that plaintiff should have twenty per cent, of the profits of the company in excess of $10,000 per year. It appears, and is not disputed, that plaintiff overdrew his account to June 30,1912, to the amount of $3,483.23. During such employment plaintiff had a verbal agreement with defendant that he should receive one-fifth of the profits of a certain deal made with the Thornton Stone Company. It was subsequently agreed between them that plaintiff\u2019s share of such profits was $635. This item of $635 is the subject-matter of this suit. The evidence shows that defendant wrote plaintiff a letter substantially as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\" pgmap=\"455\">\u201cAugust 27, 1912.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">Ealph E.

Where, in an action to recover part of the profits of a transaction claimed by plaintiff under acceptance of an offer of compromise which involves the assignment of such interest by plaintiff to a corporation of which defendant is an officer, defendant introducing as evidence thereof a letter from him to plaintiff in which it is stated that plaintiff may retain his position in the employ of defendant and the corporation on the condition, among others, that he assign to the corporation all his share in the profits of the transaction, to be applied on a note to be given in settlement of an indebtedness due from plaintiff to the corporation, it is error for the trial court to refuse to hold as a proposition of law that if plaintiff accepted the proposal contained in the letter, he could not recover.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Apcx\" pgmap=\"457\">2.
