At some time between one and three o\u2019clock in the afternoon of April 17,1914, Judge Petit\u2019s minute clerk, by direction of the judge, telephoned to the offices of counsel on both sides that the court would render a decision on the following day, Saturday; and before four o\u2019clock of the same day, counsel for defendants caused a notice, to the effect that at ten o\u2019clock on Saturday they would ask the court to enter findings and judgment in favor of defendants, and a copy of the findings and decree, which were after-wards entered, to be served upon appellant\u2019s counsel, Herman Welk, by delivering the same to a stenographer employed by him and then in charge of his office in Chicago. It appears, however, that Mr. Welk did not personally receive word of either the telephone communication of the minute clerk or the formal notice given by defendants\u2019 counsel until the Monday following (after the term had expired), for the reason that before either of such notices was given on Friday afternoon he had been called to his home in Lemont by the illness of his wife, and remained there all Saturday and Sunday. The telephone message was received at his office on Friday afternoon by a real estate broker who had an office in the same suite, and the other notice was received, as above stated, by Mr. Welk\u2019s stenographer; but so far as the record shows, neither the real estate broker nor the stenographer made any attempt to notify Mr. Welk that such notices had come to them, until he returned to his office on Monday, April 20,1914. Thereupon he made a motion to set aside and vacate the decree entered on April 18, 1914, filing with his notice of such motion the affidavits of himself and of the stenographer as to the facts of which they had knowledge. When this motion to vacate was called up before Judge Petit, on April 21, 1914, oral statements on both sides were evidently made by counsel, and also by the court, and the clerk of the court, as to what had occured on Friday and Saturday. The bill of exceptions shows that after the affidavits and oral statements of defendants\u2019 counsel had been heard, the court ordered that such oral statements \u2018 \u2018 should be incorporated in affidavits and presented afterwards nunc pro tunc as of April 21,1914, to form a part of the bill of exceptions\u201d (which was in fact done, and the same filed on May 15, 1914), and then overruled the motion to vacate the decree. From this ruling, or order, John La Page appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-4\" pgmap=\"167\">Herman Welk and Irwin &amp; Stampfli, for appellant; Frederic C.
