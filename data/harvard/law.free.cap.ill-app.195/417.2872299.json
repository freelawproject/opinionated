That there was an agreement as to the amount of the claim was denied only by Stewart, the president of defendant company. Aside from that it was clear that on the \u2022 amount agreed upon by Stewart as due, defendant paid the sum of $400 twice, and the balance of the sum due is the amount of the judgment. Defendant sent a letter transmitting a check of $400 on account saying that the check was sent as promised. One Voorhees testified that there was an agreement as to the amount due and an agreement of Stewart to pay the same. In an account appearing in the claim of plaintiff and in some amendments thereto the amounts were stated in francs and centimes, but the American equivalents for the French money were also stated. To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $246.65, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AP5u\" pgmap=\"444\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AWV\" pgmap=\"444\">1.

In an action to recover for goods sold and delivered, where it appears that an account contained in plaintiff's pleadings stated the amount due plaintiff in terms of francs and centimes is not an infraction of the constitutional requirement that all court proceedings shall be in the English language, notwithstanding the fact that such statement would be a statement of French money, for the reason that defendant could not have been misled thereby, especially where the same pleading also shows the American equivalent for such French money, and where it does not appear that the statement of such equivalent was incorrect.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AHO\" pgmap=\"444\">3.
