The evidence showed that the child was born May 20, 1911; that a warrant in the bastardy proceeding was issued October 30,1911, but complainant was unable to serve the warrant and the proceeding was abandoned. The complaint in the present case was filed January 21, 1915. The defendant when in Chicago lived with his mother at 92nd street and Buffalo avenue. The relator testified that defendant remained in Chicago up to about the 22nd of September; that he left about October 30, 1911, and she did not see him nor know where he was until September, 1914. The Secretary of the Court of Domestic Relations testified that she went to the neighborhood of 92nd street and Buffalo avenue two or three times a week from the time the child was born to September, 1914, and did not see defendant at any place in Illinois during that time. The witness was not cross-examined nor did defendant offer any testimony to explain or contradict the testimony given for the prosecution.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-5\" pgmap=\"442\">John Curtin, for plaintiff in error; Chauncey N.
