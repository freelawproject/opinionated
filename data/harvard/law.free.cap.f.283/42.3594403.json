Defendant-appellee is a corporation organized in 1910 under the laws of Kentucky, and ever since engaged at Louisville, Ky., in preparing, packing, and selling meat products as a competitor of plaintiff. In 1918 plaintiff filed in the court below its bill, asserting the valid adoption in 1877 by the copartnership of Armour &amp; Co., and the continued use thereafter by the copartnership and the corporation, respectively, of a trade-mark (for hams and bacons of high-grade quality) consisting of the symbol of a star, and, as an alternative, the word \u201cStar.\u201d The bill alleged infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark by defendant in the use of the brand \u201cSouthern Star\u201d upon hams and bacons of defendant\u2019s marketing. Unfair competition was also asserted. Defendant denied that either plaintiff or its predecessor was the original user of the \u201cStar\u201d brand or mark, and asserted that the use of the same was of common right. There was also denial that plaintiff had exclusively either the ownership of or the right to use the asserted trade-mark in Kentucky or elsewhere, or that plaintiff had ever used it except in connection with the word \u201cArmour,\u201d as \u201cArmour\u2019s Star,\u201d admitting, however, that plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark has become known to the public as \u201cArmour\u2019s Star.\u201d Both trademark infringement and unfair competition were denied. It appeared \u25a0upon the hearing (with slight exceptions, the testimony was all taken in open court) that plaintiff\u2019s asserted -\u201cStar\u201d trade-mark had never been used by it or its predecessor, except in connection with its best grade of hams and bacons; the name \u201cShield\u201d being applied to its second grade, and the name \u201cBanana\u201d to its third or poorest grade, of hams and bacons. It also appeared that defendant\u2019s application for registration of its trade-mark \u201cSouthern Star\u201d was, upon plaintiff\u2019s opposition, rejected by the Patent Office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The District Judge filed a written opinion (275 Fed. 92) finding that as early as 1876 plaintiff and its predecessor had used continuously and very extensively, throughout the country, including Kentucky, the word \u201cStar,\u201d in connection with the words \u201cArmour &amp; Co.\u201d or the word \u201cArmour,\u201d and also the emblem of a star in connection with those words, upon vast quantities of its hams and bacons, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>that since <em>1910 </em>the defendant, with knowledge of such use by plaintiff, had itself used the words \u201cSouthern Star,\u201d in \u201ccombination with the emblem of a star, upon its hams and bacons and meats prepared in Louisville, Ky., and sold throughout that state,\u201d to the extent of about 15 per cent, of its product. The opinion was expressed that the word \u201cStar\u201d could not, standing alone, be the subject of a valid trade-mark, although it was recognized that the words \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d might be; that it did not satisfactorily appear from the testimony that \u201cthere had been established in the public mind a secondary meaning of the word \"Star\u2019 <em>\u201d; </em>that not only could not the use of defendant\u2019s mark \u201cSouthern Star\u201d infringe the use of a trade-mark \u201cArmour\u2019s Star,\u201d but that the testimony failed satisfactorily to show that any purchaser had been deceived \u201cinto the use of any of defendant\u2019s hams or bacons, or into any purchase thereof as those of plaintiff instead of those of defendant\u201d There was conclusion of noninfringement of trade-mark and lack of unfair competition. The opinion seems thus sufficiently summarized for present purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Plaintiff asserts no trade-mark in the words \u201cArmour\u2019s Star.\u201d It bases its right to relief squarely upon the proposition that its actual trade-mark was \u201cStar,\u201d either as a word or as a symbol, and that not only was such trade-mark valid originally, but that it has acquired a secondary meaning as indicating plaintiff\u2019s product. We think that, at least by direct analogy to words such as \u201cQueen,\u201d \u201cMonarch,\u201d \u201cVictor,\u201d \u2022 \u201cPillsbury\u2019s Best,\u201d the word \u201cStar,\u201d or a symbol thereof, should be regarded as fanciful and as suggestive, rather than as purely descriptive, and thus as capable of being made the subject of a valid trade-mark, if not already exclusively appropriated. Thomas G. Plant Co. v. May Co. (C. C. A. 6) 105 Fed. 375, 378 et seq., 44 C. C. A. 534; Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514, 520, 9 Sup. Ct. 143, 32 L. Ed. 526. And such view seems to accord with patent office practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"> We also think such word would not necessarily be invalid merely because applied to but one grade of plaintiff\u2019s manufactured product Dixie v. Stearns (C. C. A. 7) 185 Fed. 431, 434, 107 C. C. A. 501. And we do not doubt that the adoption of the word \u201cStar,\u201d or a symbol thereof, would not fail of creating a valid trade-mark merely because used in association with the name of the manufacturer, or other words not adopted as part of the trade-mark. Layton v. Church (C. C. A. 8) 182 Fed. 24, 29, 104 C. C. A. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">But, as applied to the case before us, the question whether plaintiff or its predecessor actually adopted\" as its trade-mark the word \u201cStar,\u201d or a symbol thereof, as distinguished from a trade-mark \u201cArmour\u2019s Star,\u201d is distinctly one of fact, the affirmative of which plaintiff has the burden of establishing. In our opinion, plaintiff has not sustained this burden. Its asserted adoption of the word or symbol \u201cStar\u201d as a trade-mark is not admitted by defendant. There is no direct testimony (by any one claiming personal knowledge) as to the fact of such original adoption. Nor is such adoption confirmed by proof of registration. Not that registration creates a trade-mark, or is at all essential to its validity; its existence, however, might afford some evidence of the identity of the trade-mark as asserted at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of registration. There is testimony on the part of several witnesses, the most prominent being employees or representatives of plaintiff, that from the time of the earliest knowledge of the respective witnesses Armour &amp; Co. had used the symbol or mark of the \u201cStar\u201d on their highest grades of hams and bacons, and that such practice has been continued until the present time, and that in the mind of the public, during the time covered by the testimony of these witnesses, \u201cStar\u201d ham and \u201cStar\u201d bacon, \u201cas gathered from conversations with dealers and consumers, always meant Armour\u2019s Star ham and Armour\u2019s Star bacon\u201d; but it is satisfactorily established by the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s representatives that in Armour &amp; Co.\u2019s labels, brands, and advertising matter generally, including also its large display cards, the name given was always \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d ham, or \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d bacon, as the case might be \u2014 no use of the word \u201cStar\u201d (or its symbol), except as directly preceded by the word \u201cArmour\u2019s,\u201d being shown; that about the year 1906 plaintiff adopted the blue and yellow label, which reads \u201cArmour\u2019s Star Ham, selected stock, mild cure. Armour &amp; Co.,\u201d and that such label has been in use ever since; that since about the year 1916 no symbol star has been used on any of Armour &amp; Co\u2019s advertisements, either labels or burning brand (none of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses carry their knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark back of the year 1886 or 1887). Indeed, one of plaintiff\u2019s directors says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u201cOur advertising has been confined exclusively to the \u2018Star\u2019 brand, \u2018Armour\u2019s Star,\u2019 using tbe word \u2018star,\u2019 or symbol star, in connection with the word \u2018Armour\u2019s,\u2019 in connection with our choicest hams and bacons, our highest grade. \u2018Armour\u2019s Star* is indicative of our choicest grade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Moreover, it would seem unnatural that plaintiff and its predecessor should deliberately adopt the word \u201cStar\u201d (or its symbol) as its sole trade-mark, in view of the fact that other manufacturers had previously used or were using the star trade-mark in connection with ham's and bacons. It affirmatively appeared by the bill of complaint that as early as 1875 one Baltz, of Chicago, merchandised hams and bacon under the trade-mark \u201cStar of the West,\u201d' and plaintiff asserts that in 1893 it purchased this trade-mark. It also appears that about the year 1870 George F. Davis <em>&amp; Co., </em>of Cincinnati, adopted a brand in connection with the sale of hams and bacon consisting of a five-pointed star, with the symbol of a star in one of the points thereof, which Davis &amp; Co. apparently- called their \u201cStar Brand,\u201d and that this trademark was so used by Davis &amp; C\u00f3. until they went out of business in 1887 or 1888, afterwards being used by Jacob Vogel &amp; Son, of Cincinnati, who \u00e1re said to still use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">True, the fact of actual sale of the trade-mark by Davis to Vogel is largely hearsay, and it does not affirmatively appear that the sale was accompanied by a transfer of the business, although that is perhaps inferable, and thus Vogel &amp; Son may have acquired no legal right to the use of the-mark; also, neither Davis nor Vogel may have had any trade in Louisville, but presumably plaintiff was fully aware of the use of this trade-mark in connection with sales of hams and bacon in a by no means negligible portion of the territory covered by plaintiff\u2019s trade. It would thus be unnatural that plaintiff should adopt its now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>asserted trade-mark without distinguishing the product as \"Armour\u2019s Star,\u201d or in other appropriate way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, defendant presented a large amount of credible testimony, especially on the part of retail dealers, to the effect that Armour\u2019s name was better known than the word \"Star\u201d; that Armour\u2019s Star was generally called for by that name, and tending strongly to discredit the assertion that \u201cStar\u201d hams and \u201cStar\u201d bacon, without more, had come to indicate Armour\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">We conclude that plaintiff has not satisfactorily established the adoption and use of its alleged trade-mark \u201cStar,\u201d except as part of a trade-mark \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d (we have no occasion to decide whether the words \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d would constitute a valid trade-mark) ; that the conclusion of the District Judge that it did not satisfactorily appear from the testimony that a secondary meaning of the word \u201cStar\u201d in the public mind had been established cannot be rejected as against the weight of the evidence (Carey v. Donohue [C. C. A. 6] 209 Fed. 328, 333, 126 C. C. A. 254) ; that upon the facts hereinafter mentioned, in connection with the subject of unfair competition, defendant\u2019s use of its trade-mark \u201cSouthern Star\u201d would not infringe the trade-mark \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d; and that the District Judge thus did not err in denying relief on account of the alleged trade-mark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We may add, in this connection, that in our opinion it was not error to reject plaintiff\u2019s offer of the record of the Patent Office rejection of defendant\u2019s application for registration. Such rejection was clearly not an adjudication upon the fact question of what plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark actually was. It assumed to decide no questions other than whether defendant was entitled to the exclusive right to the words \u201cSouthern Star,\u201d or whether plaintiff\u2019s mark and defendant\u2019s mark were so similar as to be likely to confuse, or perhaps both those questions. See Trader-Mark Act of 1905, as amended (Comp. Stat. 1916, \u00a7 9485 et sea.),</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">As to unfair competition: In view of the conclusion reached as to plaintiff\u2019s established trade-mark, we think unfair competition was not satisfactorily established. To sustain a charge of unfair competition it must at least appear that defendant\u2019s conduct had a tendency (or was calculated) to palm off its goods as those of plaintiff. Goodyear Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 U. S. 598, 604, 9 Sup. Ct. 166, 32 L. Ed. 535; Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, 198 U. S. 118, 140, 25 Sup. Ct. 609, 49 L. Ed. 972; Rathbone v. Champion Co. (C. C. A. 6) 189 Fed. 26, 30, 110 C. C. A. 596, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 258. The general principles applicable to cases of this nature are well understood. In their application each case must turn largely upon its own circumstances. About 15 per cent, of defendant\u2019s product was wrapped and labeled. Except in the use of the word \u201cStar,\u201d it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>be difficult to construct labels more essentially different that those of plaintiff and defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s label is a comparatively small oval (or a circle), reading as already stated; the words \u201cArmour\u2019s\u201d and \u201cPlam\u201d being in blue letters upon a yellow field, and the word \u201cStar\u201d being in white letters upon a blue field. The other words are m black upon a yellow field.. Plaintiff\u2019s name (not its address) appears in comparatively small letters at the foot of the label, which is decidedly lacking in ornamentation and is of dignified simplicity. Defendant\u2019s labels are comparatively large and quite elaborate. Each of those presented as characteristic have the words in prominent letters \u201cSouthern Star Brand,\u201d accompanied by a star in symbol. Defendant\u2019s name and address appear prominently upon the face of the labels. In the center of each label appears a farmyard scene. It is hard to believe that even the casual and careless purchaser would be deceived by defendant\u2019s labels into thinking they were purchasing plaintiff\u2019s goods. The remaining 80 to 85 per cent, of defendant\u2019s product is sold unwrapped and merely skin-branded, as is a part of plaintiff\u2019s product. But here again, while the differences between the respective skin-brands are not so marked as in the case of the labels upon the wrapped product, they are nevertheless pronounced. Plaintiff\u2019s brand reads \u201cArmour\u2019s Star UL S. Inspected and Passed Est. 2A\u201d; the words being disposed in three parallel .lines, \u201cArmour\u2019s\u201d being above the word \u201cStar,\u201d which in turn is above the remaining words. Defendant\u2019s brand consists of a large, five-pointed star, across which are tire words \u201cSouthern Star\u201d; below these words, and still in the star, the word \u201cBrand\u201d; below the star the word \u201cU. S.,\u201d on the line below \u201cInspected and Passed,\u201d and below (a fifth line) \u201cEst. 995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Having in mind that since about the years 1914 to 1916 no star symbol has been used on any of plaintiff\u2019s advertisements, labels, or brands, the testimony that when customers wanted defendant\u2019s goods they asked for \u201cSouthern Star,\u201d that Armour\u2019s name was better known than the word \u201cStar,\u201d and that \u201cArmour\u2019s Star\u201d was generally called for by that name (thus tending to show that \u201cArmour\u2019s\u201d was the dominant portion of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark) ; the fact that retailers and large consumers are not as easily deceived as the small and casual consumer; the statement of the District Judge in his opinion (which we quote in the margin),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the natural probability that, in cases where the ham or bacon was sold by the retailer cut in slices, the consumer would not be very likely to pay attention to the brands \u2014 we are not convinced that we would be warranted in setting aside the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of lack of tendency to deception or unfair competition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>There is evidence tending to show deception (or perhaps attempted deception) on the part of some retailers; but, taking into account the entire record, we are unable to say with any confidence that defendant is responsible therefor. Rathbone v. Champion Co., supra, 189 Fed. at pages 32, 33, 110 C. C. A. 596, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 258. Indeed, there is an abundance of apparently reliable testimony that defendant\u2019s goods have been sold both to dealers and consumers generally on their merits. The asserted fact that defendant\u2019s \u201cSouthern Star Brand\u201d is inferior to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cStar,\u201d and that it is 'sold at a less price and in active competition, has no appreciable tendency to show unfairness in competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Plaintiff complains that certain of its proffered testimony was improperly rejected. We think the result would not be different if consideration were given to everything fairly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to consider the asserted defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">On Motion for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The petition for rehearing must be denied. One feature only of the petition seems to call for special mention. Our opinion states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u201cIt is satisfactorily established by the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s representatives that in Armour &amp; Co.\u2019s labels, brands, and advertising, matter generally, including also its large display cards, the name given was always \u2018Armour\u2019s Star\u2019 ham, or \u2018Armour\u2019s Star\u2019 bacon, as the case might be \u2014 no use of the word \u2018Star' (or its symbol), except as directly preceded by the word \u2018Armour\u2019s,\u2019 being shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">In challenge of the correctness of this statement, reference is made to Exhibit No. 25, described in the testimony as \u201ccontaining the figure of a star and above it the words \u2018Armour &amp; Co., and below it the word \u2018Chicago, \u201d which the testimony states \u201cis a label we put on our wrapped hams and bacon from my earliest recollection up to about 1906\u201d (the witness \u201cfirst went with Armour &amp; Co. in 1891, and went into the advertising department in 1896\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Exhibit No. 25 is not at hand, and inferably did not come up with the record. But that exhibit, as above described, is not enough to discredit the quoted statement in our opinion, nor change the conclusion there arrived at. The difference between \u201cArmour <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d and \u201cArmour\u2019s\u201d in that instance is not very significant. Indeed, the witness, immediately following his testimony as quoted above, identified \u201canother paper containing a circular figure with a star in the center, and the word \u2018star\u2019 written across the star, the word \u2018Armour\u2019s\u2019 above and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>words beneath,\u201d which paper, called a. sticker or notice, the witness says \u201cwas pasted on our wrapped hams, calling the attention of the public to the quality of the contents. It was used concurrently with the last exhibit\u201d (Exhibit 25).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> In the list of registered trademarks for hams and bacon by other manufacturers of \u201cStar\u201d brands (word or symbol or both), offered by defendant and excluded, but sent up with the record, appears one registered in 1870, one in 1872, another in 1873, together with the Davis &amp; Company brand, as registered in 1874; some, and perhaps all, of these seem to antedate the claimed adoption of plaintiff\u2019s trademark. While this evidence was offered by way of certified copy of registration from the public records, and may he open to consideration upon the proposition we are now considering, we prefer to pass it by.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\"* * * The testimony heard in plaintiff\u2019s behalf does not satisfactorily, and without mere inference or hearsay, show that any purchaser whatever, either for his own use or for sale to others, has been deceived into the use of any of defendant\u2019s hams or bacon,'or into any purchase thereof as those of the plaintiff instead of those of the defendant. On the contrary, the fact that no person of ordinary intelligence was at all likely to be so deceived by defendant\u2019s brands and marks was shown clearly by the testimony of so many witnesses that further testimony on that phase of the case was stopped by the court, when quite a score of other witnesses were present ready to testify for defendant to the same effect. In the almost entire absence of any con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>vineing testimony from the plaintiff on this point, the court thought further testimony thereon by the defendant unnecessary. In saying this, the court does not by any means overlook the testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiff. Quite the reverse, for we have reached these conclusions after a careful study of every part of that testimony, and especially as it bears upon the question of infringement and unfair competition.\u201d This quotation seems to make unnecessary further reference to plaintiff\u2019s contention that actual deception need not, as matter of law, he shown, and that it is enough if defendant\u2019s labels are calculated to deceive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
