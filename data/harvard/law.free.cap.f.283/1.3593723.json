The declaration alleged the execution of the contract its subject-matter, consideration, terms, plaintiff in error\u2019s partial, and its willingness and ability for complete, performance, and Wilson\u2019s failure, refusal and inability to perform. It also set out\u2014probably unnecessarily, but in evidentiary support Nof Wilson\u2019s default\u2014the commencement of an action by one Spry against Wilson in an appropriate court of Arkansas, wherein the latter was adjudged liable for specific performance of a contract with the former for the conveyance of the identical lands which are the subject-matter of the contract in the here pending suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">In the action thus commenced in Cook county, plaintiff in error caused an attachment to he issued, pursuant to which Wilson\u2019s property was seized.

His death, and its suggestion of record, brought the defendant in error, the Trusts &amp; Guarantee Company, Limited, as representative and successor, into the case, and upon special appearance it moved to quash the attachment issued by the state court because: (1) It was issued without warrant or authority in law, being \u201cupon an alleged cause of action under which the damages are unliquidated\u201d; (2) no affidavit \u201cfor attachment in aid,\u201d as required by the; laws of Illinois, was filed; and (3) the clerk of the Illinois court issued the writ without authority of law, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">Through this writ of error, review of the action of the District Court in granting the motion to quash is sought.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-10\">Carl R.

St. 1921, c. 11) are involved in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-14\">Section 1 provides that in any court of record having competent jurisdiction, \u201ca creditor may have an attachment against the property of his <em>debtor, * </em>* * when the indebtedness exceeds $20,\u201d in any one of the following cases: (Here are enumerated nine grounds, common in attachment statutes; e. g., nonresidence, concealment, fraudulent transfers, etc.) Procedure on behalf of the creditor, by affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>setting forth the nature of the <em>indebtedness </em>above credits and set-offs, is prescribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">Section 31 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff, in any action of <em>assumpsit, debt, covenant, trespass, </em>or <em>trespass on the case, </em>having commenced, * * 0 by summons or capias may, at any time pending such suit * * * sue out an attachment, * * 43 which * s * shall be entitled in the suit pending and be <em>in aid </em>thereof; and such proceedings shall he thereupon had as required * * <em>* </em>in original attachments as near as may be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">As a step to obtain the attachment, the section prescribes the filing by plaintiff of \u201ca sufficient bond and an affidavit,\u201d hereinafter noted. Two provisos are found in this section: (a) That it shall not apply where the defendant has been arrested and has given special bail; (b) that in actions 6\u00a3 \u201ctrespass\u201d or \u201ctrespass on the case\u201d the issuance of the writ must be conditioned precedently upon application to a judge or master, with examination under oath, \u201cconcerning the cause of action,\u201d whereupon such judge or master, by indorsement upon the writ, shall <em>limit the damages </em>\u201cfor which the writ shall issue.\u201d Statutes of Illinois, 1833-35, p. 82 (act of 1833); Illinois Revised Statutes, 1845 p. 63 (act of 1843); Statutes of Illinois, 1869-71-72, p. 176 (act of 1872); Statutes of Illinois, 1895, p. 21 (act of 1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">These two sections, in their purpose to deal with the remedy by attachment, may be thus characterized: Section 1 grants the remedy, <em>as original </em>by a <em>creditor </em>against his <em>debtor </em>in respect of an <em>indebtedness. </em>Section 31 grants the remedy, as \u201cprovisional,\u201d or \u201cin aid,\u201d in five technically well-defined forms of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">Therefore, had the plaintiff herein sought to proceed by original attachment, it might be inquired whether the parties sustained the relation of \u201cdebtor\u201d and \u201ccreditor,\u201d or whether the proceeding was sued out with respect to an \u201cindebtedness,\u201d as these terms serve to define the category established by section 1. But when it appears, as it does, that the attachment, in truth, was issued in a pending action and in aid thereof, the interpretation of section 1 becomes quite irrelevant, and, as it seems to us, the query is not whether plaintiff and defendant sustain the relation of \u201ccreditor\u201d and \u201cdebtor,\u201d exhibiting an alleged \u201cindebtedness\u201d within the meaning of the former, but rather whether plaintiff has commenced <em>an action </em>of <em>assumpsit, debt, covenant, trespass, </em>or <em>trespass on the case, </em>justifying the attachment, within the meaning of the latter, section.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">That plaintiff had commenced, that there was pending when the attachment issued, an action properly termed \u201cassumpsit,\u201d is not questioned. Upon this limited inquiry, the want of expression or interpretation by the final judicial authority of Illinois respecting section 1 is not pertinent, nor does the diversity of opinion respecting that section found in cases decided by intermediate tribunals, call for review or attempts at reconciliation. Firebaugh v. Hall, 63 Ill. 81; Capes v. Burgess, 135 Ill. 61, 25 N. E. 1000; Steele-Wedeles Co. v. Shoodoc Pond Packing Co., 153 Ill. App. 576; Meglemry v. Gebhart Chili Powder Co., 187 Ill. App. 14; American Humber Co. v. Leach, 207 Ill. App. 62; Lepman &amp; Heggie v. Interstate Produce Co., 205 Ill. App. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">It is, however, significant that, while the cases cited express diversity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of view respecting the limitations of section 1, for example, in assump-sit, when the damages are unliquidated, an original attachment may not be sued out, there is not in any of the cases the slightest suggestion that in section 31 there is any limitation, except such as arises upon its plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This brings us directly to the contention of the defendant in error respecting this section, and it may be thus stated: Section 31 awards the attachment \u201cin aid,\u201d in assumpsit, debt, covenant, trespass, or trespass on the case, \u201con filing * * * a sufficient bond and affidavit showing his right to an attachment under the first section of this act.\u201d Therefore, so it is argued, because an original attachment under section 1 will not issue where the damages are unliquidated, and an \u201cin aid\u201d attachment will not issue under section 31 unless the affidavit shows a right to an attachment under section 1, and, obviously, because an affidavit showing unliquidated damages does not show the right under section 1, there can be no \u201cin aid\u201d attachment under section 31, whenever the damages are unliquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The statement of the argument at once excites the inquiry, what could have prompted legislative disclosure of the greatly enlarged policy respecting attachments, and the categories wherein they may issue, found in section 31, when the intent, in fact, was merely \u2014 the argument is reduced to this \u2014 to provide for \u201cin aid\u201d attachments in the limited category of section .1 ? Because, if the \u201cright to an attachment\u201d under section 1, as noted in section 31, means what the defendant in error contends, then the right can never exist, except\u2019in the relationship of \u201cdebtor\u201d and \u201ccreditor,\u201d exhibiting an \"indebtedness.\u201d Is it possible that the Legislature used the terms found in section 31 \u2014 definitively including, as ingredients, liquidated or unliquidated damages \u2014 and still intended by the use of the language \u201cshowing a right to an attachment under section 1\u201d to destroy the definitions? Our view is:</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Section 3\u00cd was intended to deal with \u201cin aid\u201d attachments and to declare the categories wherein they may issue. It has entirely distinctive subject-matter, and the office of the clause prescribing the quality and terms of the affidavit is not to declare, define, or limit the categories. Under section 1 the <em>right </em>to an attachment is granted to a creditor against his debtor upon showing the existence of an indebtedness, howsoever those terms may be defined. But the right is exercisable only upon the coexistence and the assignment of any one or more of the nine grounds, viz. nonresidence, fraudulent transfer, etc. Under section 31 the right to an attachment is granted \u201cin aid,\u201d a provisional remedy, in enumerated cases, assumpsit, debt, covenant, etc., provided, also, that in such a pending action there likewise be assigned as coexistent one or more of the nine grounds prescribed in section 1. This seems to us to be the plain,office of this language, and it makes the two sections entirely consistent, carrying out the clear legislative intent to provide for greater liberality in the issuance of attachments. If this be not quite obvious, surely some explanation should be at hand for the limitations contained in section 31 upon the issuance of attachments in cases of trespass and trespass on the case through the intervention of a judge, \u00abr master in chancery, who must fix a limitation upon the amount, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>of the damages in the case, but the damages for which the attachment may issue; a like explanation for interposing a special procedural step in those cases and failing to prescribe any in actions of covenant or as-sumpsit, where the damages may be unliquidated, likewise for the amendment of 1895, which expressly places \u201cassumpsit\u201d in section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Our conclusion is that the attachment issued finds clear justification in section 31, and that the contention of the defendant in error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The order of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with directions to overrule the defendant in error\u2019s motion to quash, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Upon petition for rehearing, defendants in error, after rearguing the only question originally presented, urged that, though the views expressed in the decision stand, \u201cstill a rehearing should be granted, and the reversing order of this court vacated, upon the following jurisdictional point, not heretofore called to the court\u2019s attention, but which nevertheless exists, and, being jurisdictional, controls,\u201d etc,</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Calling attention to section 31 of the Illinois attachment statute, conditioning the issuance of attachments in aid upon plaintiff\u2019s \u201chaving commenced an action by summons or capias,\u201d counsel proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">\u201cThe record at bar shows a total failure of compliance with the express terms of the act, a filing of the affidavit upon which the writ was issued as the initial act, followed by the filing merely of a declaration in assumpsit, and that no summons or capias has at any time been issued. In other words, the attachment writ quashed by the court below was issued before the plaintiff had commenced an action by summons or capias. The statute provides a fundamental prerequisite of a pending suit commenced by summons or capias before the record will permit the filing of the affidavit and the then issuance of the writ. <em>At bar, there was no pending suit and no summons or capias. The attachment writ is void, a nullity, and therefore no reversal should be made upon the record.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">Consulting the record as it came from the state to the federal court, we find:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">(1) That the removal petition avers: (a) \u201cThat the above-named \u00bb suit is an action at law commenced In this court on February 14, 1920.\u201d (b) That on the same date the plaintiff filed its certain declaration, whose allegations are summarized in the petition, (c) That the citizenship of the parties \u201cat the time of the <em>institution of this action\u201c </em>was and is as alleged, (d) That petitioner has not appeared m <em>this action, </em>that the time within which defendant is required to plead to the \"declaration of the plaintiff has not yet expired, and that the state court proceed no further, etc., except to make the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">(2) The writ of attachment issued by the state court contains as its opening recital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-13\">\u201cThat the above-named <em>plaintiff commenced heretofore the above-entitled action, and that the same is still pending.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-14\">\u2014which writ was issued by the court on February 14, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">(3) The notice given pursuant to the Illinois law and returned with the record herein reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u201cPublic notice is hereby given to tbe said Matthew Wilson that a writ of attachment in aid of a suit of law <em>heretofore commenced hy summons and still pending, </em>issued out of the office of the clerk of the superior court of Cook county, dated the 14th day of February, 1920, at the suit of the said Hoosier Veneer Company,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">(4) The notice given by plaintiff in error\u2019s testator, Wilson, was \u201cfor the removal of said cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">As indicated in the opinion upon the former hearing, the defendant in error, in the trial court, appeared specially, and there and here urged, not that no action was pending, but that the writ of attachment \u201cwas issued without warrant or authority in law, and seeks attachment upon an <em>alleged cause of action </em>under which the damages are unliquidated.\u201d True, a second specification, that plaintiff \u201cdid not file an affidavit,\u201d required for attachment \u201cin aid\u201d under the Illinois law, and a thifd, that the clerk of the court \u201cissued the writ of attachment herein without warrant or authority in law,\u201d were included; but the first specification only was urged upon review. It may be noted, further, that the order of the District Court to which this writ of error is addressed, after reciting consideration of the \u201coriginal affidavit for attachment in aid\u201d and the amendments thereto, and the additional affidavit filed as supplemental ahiended \u201coriginal affidavit for attachment in aid,\u201d directed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">\u201cThat the writ of attachment in aid be quashed, and the garnishee discharged, and <em>the suit herein he d\u00c1snulssed, </em>and that the defendant have and recover its costs herein, to be taxed against the plaintiff, for which let execution issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Thus the record returned from the state court shows that therein it was conceived that an action was pending, and the federal District Court had the same conception, for it entertained and allowed application to amend and supplemental affidavits for attachment \u2014 presumably in a pending suit \u2014 and directed the <em>dismissal of the suit. </em>Therefore the question arises: Can the defendants in error, having removed a suit, contend that no <em>pending </em>suit was removed? O'f course, if \u201cpendency\u201d is to be tested out by inquiring whether jurisdiction over the person of a defendant or respondent has\" been obtained or perfected, it may be that no such suit or proceeding was pending. If that were the test, then no suit wherein jurisdiction is sought to be obtained through attachment against a nonresident could ever be \u201cpending,\u201d unless and until the defendant named saw fit to confer jurisdiction over his person. Plainly, the attachment statutes contemplate the issuance of the writ as the means \u2014 jurisdiction over the person by service of summons or capias being impossible because of nonresidence \u2014 of compelling appearance through a seizure of the property. Therefore, can such a defendant appear in court \u2014 though specially \u2014 and concurrently maintain: (1) That in no sense was any suit or any proceeding pending in the state court; and (2) that the suit which was pending in the state court did \u25a0not warrant the particular kind of attachment issued?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">When defendants in error filed a removal petition, averring \u201cthat the above-named suit is an action at law commenced in <em>this </em>[state] court February 14, 1920,\u201d they should not be averse to having the federal court taire them at their word; and when, upon examination of the state court record, we find a writ \u2014 the one here sought to be avoided \u2014 re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>citing the prior commencement of \u201cthe above-entitled action, and <em>that the same is still pending \u201d </em>the defendants in error should not now be heard to gainsay their own and the state court records; but they should be held to have foreclosed contention, respecting <em>pendency </em>of <em>a </em>suit or proceeding which they removed from the state court. In other words, there was pending in the state, and removed to the federal, court a suit or proceeding answering the test aptly furnished in Schroeder v. Merchants\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Insurance Co., 104 Ill. 71, 74, 75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201cWhat is the commencement of a suit? It is not claimed that it is the service of process on the defendant. It is believed that no case can be found that holds the suit is not commenced until service or appearance of defendant. We may therefore conclude that jurisdiction of the person of the defendant is not essential to the commencement of a suit. But it is apparent that a suit is not commenced until the court has in some'manner acquired jurisdiction of something in relation to the controversy. It must, therefore, be over the person of the plaintiff, or the subject-matter, or both. The court acquires jurisdiction of the plaintiff when he applies for its power and assistance to compel the defendant to render him his rights under the law; but this aid must be sought according to prescribed forms, and under our practice that form requires that he file with the clerk of the court a praecipe for the process he desires. This is an application, in its nature, to the court to send! its process to require the defendant to appear at a subsequent term to defend the action. The court clearly has jurisdiction of the plaintiff when he thus invokes its aid. When he thus submits his person to the court, he, by asking its aid, gives the court jurisdiction over the subject-matter in controversy, and confers power to adjudicate and determine his rights thus submitted. In this manner the court becomes possessed of jurisdiction of the person of the plaintiff and of the subject-matter, and when so possessed it becomes the duty of the court to commence and carry on the power to bring the defendant into court, that the case may be heard, and the rights of the parties in the matter thus brought before the court may be judicially and conclusively determined. It therefore follows that, when the plaintiff submits himself and the subject-matter to the jurisdiction of the court, and the court or law commences acting under his claim for its investigation, he has commenced Ms suit. WThen he puts the court or its instruments in motion under Ms claim, Ms action is commenced. All done in the case subsequently is but a continuation of the action he thus started, until the final end of the action or suit\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The contention now for the first time pressed, we think, may further be answered by reference to the principle enforced in Clark v. Wells, 203 U. S. 164, 172, 27 Sup. Ct. 43, 45 (51 <em>L. </em>Ed. 138), where it is observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201cWhen the jurisdiction of the state court was terminated by the removal, that court had seized upon the attached property, with the right to hold it to answer such judgment as might be rendered. In the absence of personal service, the state statute provided for publication of notice of the pendency of the suit. If the defendant failed to appear, the court might proceed to render a judgment, which would permit the attached property to be sold for its satisfaction. To render such a judgment in the absence of an appearance and defense, the state court had only to require the statutory notice to the defendant when its proceedings were interrupted by the removal to the federal court on the application of the defendant. The federal court thus acquired jurisdiction of a cause of wMeh the defendant had notice, as appears by Ms petition for removal and the action of the state court invoked by Mm. The defendant, it is true, had not been personally served with process or submitted his person to the jurisdiction of either the state or federal court. But he did not attack the validity of the attachment proceedings, which appear to be regular and in conformity to the law of the state. There was no necessity of publication of notice in the federal court in order to warn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tlie defendant of the proceeding; he knew of it, and to a qualified extent had appeared in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In the present case, too, the attachment proceedings \u201cappear to be regular and in conformity to the law of the state\u201d \u2014 at least we find no difficulty in viewing the attachment proceedings in aid justified by section 31 of the attachment statute; the \u201ccase\u201d being clearly one of the several therein designated. It is true that here the defendants in error <em>do </em>\u201cattack the validity of the attachment proceedings,\u201d but, as noted, upon a ground which necessitated the interpretation of the complaint or declaration \u2014 in 'other words, upon a ground presupposing the pen-dency of a suit whose character had to be determined upon inspection of the declaration. Hence, when the defendants in error removed from the state court what they characterized as a suit commenced therein on Februapr 14, 1920, which removal carried with it the attachment theretofore issued, and when, upon the arrival of the case in the federal court, presupposing, of course, and asserting in fact, the pendency of <em>a </em>suit, they moved to quash the writ of attachment upon the ground, not that <em>no </em>suit was pending \u2014 that nothing was - removed from the state court \u2014 but that, in a suit commenced and of the character as alleged, an attachment <em>in aid </em>could not have been issued, they effectually estopped themselves from thereafter trying to mend their hold by claiming that,- no suit being pending, <em>no </em>attachment could issue. We hold that, when a suit has been removed from the state to a federal court and has been characterized as pending in the state court, whatever right may be reserved to object to jurisdiction over the person of the removing party, there is an appearance to \u201ca qualified extent,\u201d precluding the removing party from claiming that he removed nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> But, however much discussion may be indulged respecting the interpretation of section 31, or of the point now for the first time pressed, we believe that the later view of the Supreme Court of Illinois would impel the conclusion that the attachment in the present case may stand as \u201coriginal,\u201d rather than as \u201cin aid.\u201d See Humphreys v. Matthews, 11 Ill. 472, and May v. Disconto Gesellschaft, 211 Ill. 310, 71 N.
