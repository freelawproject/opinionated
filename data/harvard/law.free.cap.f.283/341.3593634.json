The defendant is a New Jersey corporation registered at Harrisburg as a foreign corporation doing business in Pennsylvania, with its principal place of business in Philadelphia. Pursuant to the Act of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania of 1911 (P. L. 710; Pa. St. 1920, \u00a7 11054 etseq.), the defendant filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth a power of attorney appointing him its authorized agent upon whom all lawful process in any proceeding against it might be served and agreeing that \u201cservice of process on [him] shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon it [the said corporation].\u201d Section 2 (section 11055). This statute further provides for the issuance of process by certain courts in any county of the commonwealth] against a foreign corporation so registered and for service thereof upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth, as its authorized agent, by the Sheriff of Dauphin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">The plaintiff brought this action in the District Court of the United' States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Marshal for the Eastern District sent the writ of summons to the Sheriff of Dauphin County for service upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the authorized agent of the defendant foreign corporation, at Harrisburg, a city within the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Marshal made return of the writ as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">\u201cAnd now, February 10th, 1920, at ten thirty o\u2019clock a. m.- Served within Summons in Assumpsit on Dock Contractor Company by leaving a true and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>attested copy thereof in duplicate, in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with O. R. Wiliets, Clerk, and party in charge, the lawful attorney, duly constituted by the said Dock Contractor Company upon whom all lawful process in any action, Rule or legal proceeding against it may be served and paying to him in behalf of the plaintiff at the time of service thereof the sum of Two ($2.00) Dollars as required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201cSo answers B. R. Speas, Deputy Sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cGeo. W. Karmony, Sheriff of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cFebruary 10, 1920, served the within Writ at Harrisburg, Pa., upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth as appears by the return of the Sheriff of Dauphin County attached within,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cSo answers Frank J. Noonan, U. S. Marshal,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cBy Thos. Marple, Deputy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The defendant entered a special appearance and moved to set aside the return. A rule issued and on hearing was made absolute. The court\u2019s decision, under the circumstances, put an end to the action. The plaintiff is here on appeal, raising two questions. We shall review only the one question passed\u201d upon by the court, which is: Whether service of the writ as shown by the return is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">We would decide this question on the opinion of the learned District Judge as correctly stating the law and fully reflecting our views but for a phase of the argument on appeal which apparently was not presented to him. We refer to his opinion for a full discussion of the question. (C. C. A.) 283 Fed. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">We have here a case where process, addressed to the Marshal, was in fact served by the Sheriff of Dauphin County. Or, treating the service thus made by the Sheriff as one made by the Marshal, we have a case where service was made by the Marshal outside of the territorial limits of his district. Was the service in either aspect valid? The plaintiff says it was, upon the contention that, by force of the Conformity Act (section 914, R, S.; Comp. St. \u00a7 1537), a marshal is empowered to serve process of a federal court, not merely in the mode or manner, but to the territorial extent provided by state statute for service of process of state courts. As applied to this case, the plaintiff bases this contention upon two considerations. The first is that in its power of attorney the defendant foreign corporation agreed to be sued as a consideration for the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Steamship Co. v. Kane, 170 U. S. 100, 18 Sup. Ct. 526, 42 L. Ed. 964; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U. S. 369, 24 L. Ed. 853, and therefore submitted to suit in federal as well as in state courts upon service of the kind provided by state statute for actions brought in state courts. The agreement, as we read it, does not go that far. It goes only to the point \u201cthat service of process on the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall be of the same legal force and validity as <em>if served ttpon it, </em>the said corporation.\u201d This leaves any question of validity of service upon the defendant foreign corporation just where it was before the agreement was entered into. Or, if construed as the plaintiff urges, the agreement could not, even if so intended, vary the method of lawful service or enlarge the authority of the Marshal in making service.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The next consideration in support of the plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the word \u201cpractice\u201d in the Conformity Act (providing that \u201cthe practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>[in District Courts] shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice * * * and forms and modes of proceeding * * * in like causes\u201d in the state courts) includes service of process, and therefore service of process by the Sheriff of Dauphin County, in the Middle District, on the designation of the Marshal for the Eastern District, is service of process by the Marshal within the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Admittedly the \u201cmode\u201d of serving process comes within the term \u201cpractice\u201d as used in the Conformity Act and the state law may therefore be followed, Amy v. Watertown, 130 U. S. 304, 9 Sup. Ct, 530, 32 L. Ed. 946, as where in an action against a municipal corporation a state law requires service upon the mayor. But, as pointed out by Judge Hough in Sewchulis v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 233 Fed. 422, 147 C. C. A. 358:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cThere is a wide difference between the method of serving a summons and the effect of such service when made. The first relates to the \u2018form, manner, and order of conducting and carrying on suits.\u2019 The effect of the formal act called \u2018service\u2019 is not a question of practice at all, but one of jurisdiction, and jurisdiction in turn must be tested by substantive law.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">- Applying this test we come first to the Act of Congress of May 19, 1828, c. 68, \u00a7 1, 4 Stat. 278 (Comp. St. \u00a7 1536), the predecessor of the Conformity Act, which declared that \u201cthe forms of mesne process, * * * and the forms and modes of proceeding\u201d in certain federal courts shall be the same as those in the state courts.. This Act was held to be \u201ca process act, designed only to regulate proceedings in the federal courts after they had obtained jurisdiction; not to enlarge their jurisdiction.\u201d Bath County v. Amy, 13 Wall. 250, 20 L. Ed. 539. Giving the Conformity Act a like construction as affecting jurisdiction, it is clear that the jurisdiction of the District Court over parties to an action is controlled, now as before, by the validity of service of process upon them. Validity of service depends upon the authority of the officer making it. That authority is given the Marshal by federal statute; with a few exceptions not here relevant, it empowers him only to \u201cexecute, <em>throughout the district </em>all * * * precepts directed to him, and issued under the authority of the United States.\u201d Section 787, R. S.; Comp. St. \u00a7 1311. The authority of the Marshal, being limited by this statute to official acts within his district, is not expanded by the Conformity Statute to official acts beyond his district. Therefore, when a Marshal serves process in a manner or in a place without authority of law, jurisdiction over the person so served is not acquired by the court for which the Marshal has attempted to act. Agreeing with the learned trial judge that the Marshal had not authority, either under particular or general statute, to delegate the service of the writ in this case or make the service himself outside of his district, we affirm the order making absolute the rule to set aside or strike off the Marshal\u2019s return.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
