If it could be shown that in consequence of the inadequacy of the husband\u2019s provision the necessaries were actually required for the wife\u2019s proper support, commensurate with his means, her wonted living as his spouse and her station in the community, a different rule would apply.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b89-11\">Appeal from a judgment for defendant, rendered in a District Court in the city of Hew York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-12\">Action to recover for necessaries alleged to have been supplied to defendant\u2019s wife upon his credit.'</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>Samuel D. Levy, </em>for plaintiff (appellant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-5\"><em>EseeM\u00e9l Eixmcm, </em>for defendant (respondent).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b90-6\">Bisohoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT0\">Careful scrutiny of the evidence, shows that defendant was sought to be held liable hi this action upon his wife\u2019s alleged implied authority to pledge her husband\u2019s credit for necessaries supplied to her at her request. For the defendant, however, it appeared without contradiction that for nearly two years before the alleged necessaries were supplied, husband and wife were living in a state of voluntary separation, and that during all this time the husband had regularly paid his wife a weekly allowance of fifty dollars for her separate maintenance and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">That, irrespective of whether or\" not the person who supplies the wife with necessaries had knowledge at the time of the husband\u2019s provision for her support, the presumption of the wife\u2019s authority to pledge her husband\u2019s credit is negatived by the fact of their living apart, and that the tradesman who supplies her under such circumstances, upon the credit of her husband and without his express sanction or approval, does so at his own peril, are propositions too well established by authority to admit of further dispute. See the rule stated and the cases collated in Hare &amp; Wallace\u2019s notes to- <em>Manby </em>v. <em>Scott, Montague </em>v. <em>Benedict </em>and <em>Seaton </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>reported in Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, <em>436, </em>etc.; Tyler Infancy &amp; Coverture, \u00a7 221; Schouler\u2019s Husband <em>&amp; </em>Wife, \u00a7 117; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>8 Johns. 72; <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>12 id. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">It was incumbent upon plaintiff, therefore, to proceed still further and show that the articles supplied to the wife were not only of the kind usually denominated necessaries, because their need is common to all persons, but that in consequence of the inadequacy of the husband\u2019s provision they were actually required for the wife\u2019s proper support, commensurate with his means, her wonted living as his spouse, and her station in the community. Schouler\u2019s Husband <em>&amp; </em>Wife, \u00a7 103; <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>39 N. Y. 351; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Daly, 198; <em>Blowers </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>4 Denlo, 46. This, however, the evidence wholly failed to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><em>Daubney </em>v. Hughes, 60 N. Y. 187, seemingly cited by appellant\u2019s counsel in support of his contention of defendant\u2019s liability, has no application to the question here involved. In the case cited, the husband was adjudged liable for his wife\u2019s support, upon his express promise, notice of the revocation of which was not brought to the promisee\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Giegerioh, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
