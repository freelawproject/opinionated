But plaintiff relied on an alleged admission of defendants to the contrary. Before commencing the action, plaintiff\u2019s attorney called on defendants to ascertain \u201c whether T. had authority to bind defendants, or to sell and employ a broker.\u201d Defendants said \u201cthat T. was authorized to take any steps necessary to sell.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this did not involve authority on T. to employ another broker.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-10\">Also <em>held, </em>that the rule \u201cwhen an agent, acting within the scope of his actual authority, perpetrates a fraud for the benefit of his principal, and the latter receives the fruits of it, he thereby adopts the fraudulent acts of his agent,\u201d does not apply so as to validate a delegation of his agency by a broker.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b437-11\">Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the City Court affirming judgment on a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-12\">Action for broker\u2019s commission on a sale of realty.

And so he was, without doubt; hut whether as subagent of Thompson or as independent broker for the defendants, is a point upon which, in a measure, the appeal depends. Thompson was the broker whom the defendants employed; and if, to promote the sale, he engaged the plaintiff as his auxiliary on an agreement to divide commissions, then, as subagent, plaintiff must look only to Thompson for compensation. Thompson testifies, \u201cWe were both brokers in the matter; there was a sort of implied understanding between brokers that I would divide \u25a0commissions with him.\u201d Plaintiff says, Thompson \u201c told me he would pay me a commission \u201d \u2014 a commission, not <em>the </em>commission, and <em>he, </em>not the defendants, would pay it. Obviously, the plaintiff\u2019s own version of the transaction is in harmony with Thompson\u2019s statement that he was to divide his commission with the plaintiff. But that the plaintiff understood he was only to share Thompson\u2019s compensation is cleared of all doubt by the fact that he presented a bill and threatened suit for only half the commission. True, the claim for half commission was asserted against the defendants; but that only shows plaintiff\u2019s mistake as to the party legally liable to him. True, also, that the next day plaintiff\u2019s attorney made demand of the full commission; but that only shows the attorney\u2019s .skill in trying to nullify the effect of the client\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Our conclusion is that, upon the uncontradicted evidence, plaintiff was employed by Thompson to assist him in the negotiation on an agreement to divide his commission; and \u2022.that so, as subagent, plaintiff sustained no such relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>defendants as made them liable for his compensation. 1 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Assuming, however, that Thompson employed plaintiff as broker for the defendants, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove that Thompson had authority so to employ him. Without specific authority from his principal, an agent has no power to delegate his trust. <em>Lewis </em>v. Ingersoll, 3 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 55; <em>Newton </em>v. Bronson, 13 N. Y. 587; <em>Hicks </em>v. Dorn, 9 Abb. (N. S.) 53; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Farmers' </em>Loan, <em>etc., </em>Co., 24 Hun, 300 ; <em>Lyon </em>v. Jerome, 26 Wend. 485. Indisputably, the office of broker involves personal confidence and discretion. <em>Bonwell </em>v. Howes, 15 Daly, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Did the defendants empower their broker Thompson to substitute another in his stead? Both Thompson and defendant Arthur 0. Tucker, deny the communication of any such power. But plaintiff relies on an alleged admission of Tucker to the contrary. A da;y or two before commencing this action plaintiff\u2019s attorney called on Mr. Tucker, for the purpose of ascertaining \u201c whether \"Mr. Thompson had authority to bind the Tuckers, or to sell and employ a broker.\u201d Mr. Arthur 0. Tucker said, \u201c that Mr. Thompson was authorized to take any steps necessary to sell.\u201d As broker employed to sell, Thompson, of course, had authority to take the steps necessary to that end. To have denied him such power would have been to render his agency frustrate. But, surely, authority to take the steps necessary to a sale, does not involve authority to employ another broker; for, if one broker, then why not a second and a third, and so on indefinitely, until the principal be crushed under the accumulated weight of countless commissions ?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">But the person whom the attorney had the precaution to take with him as a corroborative witness, fails to sustain him, saying, that Tucker\u2019s words were that Thompson \u201c had full authority to sell.\u201d This is no more than a declaration that Thompson was a broker to sell. The learned trial judge in his charge misapprehended the effect of the testimony, when he told the jury that Tucker stated to the attorney \u201c that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Thompson had full authority to employ brokers for the sale of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On a critical review of the case we see that, at most, the finding that the defendants authorized Thompson to retain the plaintiff, is sustained only by a scintilla of evidence, and this is ineffectual against a motion to nonsuit. <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>103 N. Y. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The respondent argues, however, that by consummating the sale which he negotiated, the appellents are estopped to question his authority, upon the ground that the enjoyment of the fruits of an agent\u2019s act charges the principal with responsibility. The principle upon which the respondent relies is of recognized and salutary operation; but he misapprehends its import and application. The rule as propounded in a leading case of this state is, that \u201c when an agent, acting within the scope of his actual authority, perpetrates a fraud for the benefit of his principal, and the latter receives the fruits of it, he thereby adopts the fraudulent acts of his agent.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Sweeny, </em>35 N. Y. 291; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>115 id. 556. Here, the act of Thompson in substituting plaintiff as broker, if there wrere such substitution, was beyond the scope of Thompson\u2019s authority; and the transaction, the enjoyment of the fruits of which is supposed to estop the appellants, was not the transaction of their agent but of a stranger. The rule was never applied, and in reason can never be applied, so as to validate a delegation of his agency by a broker; else the principal would be at the mercy of his broker, and might be burdened with, liability to as many deputies as the broker should choose to appoint. The law is settled otherwise. \u201c Where the subagent has been appointed without authority, and his acts are afterwards ratified, he can recover no compensation from the principal, but must look to the agent.\u201d 1 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law,' 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We conclude, therefore, that upon the uncontroverted evidence, the appellants are not responsible for the employment of the plaintiff, and are under no obligation to compensate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Our conviction that the respondent\u2019s claim is without equity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>reconciles us the more readily to the defeat of his judgment on legal grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.'</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Bookstaver and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
