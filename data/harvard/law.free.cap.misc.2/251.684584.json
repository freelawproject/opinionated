Rep. 179; <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>13 R. I. 342; <em>McNeal </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>53 N. J. Law, 617. But, upon the arrival of the oil in the city of New York, at the pier where the defendants knew the railroad company would discharge its freight, there was a delivery of .the oil in conformity with the terms of the contract, and from that time forth the company became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>agent of the defendants, and the plaintiff was absolved from all responsibility for its conduct. <em>Pacific Iron Works </em>v. <em>long Island Railroad </em>Company, 62 N. Y. 272. True, as contends the learned counsel for the appellants, in particulars the case varies from the one at bar; still, for the propositions in support of which it is cited, it is an explicit and decisive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The oil arrived at the pier in the city of New York between four and five o\u2019clock p. h. of the thirty-first of October, and as the plaintiff had to the last hour of the day within which to deliver, the delivery was seasonably made pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Our conclusion is that, as matter of law, the plaintiff performed its agreement by due delivery; but if a question of fact on the evidence, the parties consented by motions for a verdict, that the judge should determine it, and we are not at liberty to review his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Bookstaver and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
