These were the effect of the Statute of Frauds in the case and whether the principal amount if due, assuming the damages to be unliquidated, bore interest, and also as of what time the damages were to be computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">I am of opinion that the allegation of the complaint of the contract not being controverted by the answer, was to be taken as true for the purpose of the action.

The facts found by him were supported by evidence.
