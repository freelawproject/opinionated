The complaint demands judgment that'certain deeds be declared fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs; that one of the defendants be adjudged liable to surrender possession; that all others claiming under Mm be forever barred from all claim; that the premises be adjudged to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>subject to the interests of the plaintiffs; that the premises be partitioned according to the respective rights of the parties, etc., etc. The action is, therefore, for equitable relief, and such relief cannot be granted at a jury term. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Manhattan Railway </em>Co., 53 N.
