These offers being rejected, and the assignors driven to an action to collect their debts, the defendants, for the first time, interpose the objection that the goods were not delivered within the stipulated period. The fact that after the alleged time of shipment and delivery had elapsed, the goods were sent at the special instance and request of the defendants, operated of iiself as an estoppel against the defense of a belated delivery. At all events, that fact, coupled with the acceptance, approval .and retention of the goods, without objection as to the time of \u25a0delivery, and with the negotiation for a compromise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>claim proceeding on an express admission of its validity and amount, clearly and conclusively demonstrates a waiver of the right to defend the action on the ground that the goods were not delivered in conformity with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Appellants argue, however, that for anything apparent they might have shown that, by the contract they proposed but were not permitted to prove, an acceptance of the goods was not to operate as a waiver of default in delivery. But, the Waiver is founded not alone on the acceptance, but independently and conclusively on the other facts recited as precluding the defense of no due delivery. Again, the answer is not a mere denial of the contract alleged by the plaintiff, but affirmatively avers another agreement between the parties, and of the agreement so averred, it is not a term that acceptance shall not waive default in delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">It follows, therefore, that the learned trial judge rightly rejected evidence, if indeed it were tendered, of a condition in the contract that acceptance of the goods should not operate a waiver of undue delivery, and rightly directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Further discussion of a case so plain both on the law and the facts, would be but a useless expenditure of time and labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bischoee, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
