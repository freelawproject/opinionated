But assuming it to apply as well to the District Courts in the city of Hew York neither of the cases to which our attention has been directed sanctions the construction requisite to support the amendment. Hor have we been able to ascertain as the result of our own researches that the section, which is but a re-enactment of former provisions affecting Justices\u2019 Courts has ever received that construction (Chap. 344, Laws of 1857).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The judgment should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered with costs to the appellant unless respondent within five days consents in writing that the judgment be reduced to sixty dollars, the amount of salary due at the time of his discharge, with interest and the costs of the court below, and upon such consent the judgment so reduced is affirmed Without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Pryor, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
