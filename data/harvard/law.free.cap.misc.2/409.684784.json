Plaintiff knew that defendant was a married woman, and in one of the interviews with her had been told that she had submitted the estimate to her husband, who thought it was too high. There was other testimony showing that plaintiff knew defendant\u2019s husband was living. After the work had been finished and payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>therefor demanded on several occasions of defendant, plaintiff accepted a promissory note made by defendant\u2019s husband for the full amount of the bill, which was thereafter sued upon and put in judgment. On the trial hereof plaintiff was nonsuited. <em>Held, </em>proper; that plaintiff\u2019s judgment against defendant\u2019s husband was conclusivo evidence that he-looked to him as the principal debtor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-4\">Also <em>held, </em>that plaintiff\u2019s contention that they ought not to be concluded by that judgment, as the action was based upon the promissory note and not upon the original claim, is not tenable, for the reason that the original claim was the only consideration for the giving of the note, and without 'such consideration the note would have been void as between the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-5\">Also <em>held, </em>that under the plea of <em>nil d\u00e9bet, </em>any fact tending to show there was no indebtedness on the part of defendants, was admissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">Appeal from \u00e1 judgment of the General Term of the City Court, affirming a judgment entered on a nonsuit, and affirming an order denying a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-7\"><em>William Douglas Moore, </em>for plaintiff (appellant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-8\"><em>Palmer, Pootliby &lt;&amp; Warren, </em>for defendant (respondent).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-9\">Bookstaveb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB8\">This action was brought by the plaintiff, a decorator, against the defendant, a married woman, for work done in papering and decorating the flat No. 226 West Fifty-ninth street, New York, and for certain work done in cleaning carpets and in removing and packing -furniture, etc. A written estimate was made out in her name by the plaintiff and sent to her by mail. Plaintiff himself testified that he knew defendant was a married woman, and in one of the interviews with him had told him she had submitted it to her husband, who thought it too high, and there was other testimony given by plaintiff strongly tending to show that he knew that defendant had a husband living. Under such circumstances we think it was his duty to have informed himself as to whom the flat belonged. After the work was finished plaintiff demanded payment from the defendant by mail several times, and in response to his last request he received a promissory note, made by defendant\u2019s husband, for the full amount of the bill, which he accepted. When it became due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and was unpaid, plaintiff wrote Mr. Swayze asking for its payment, and offered to renew it for a piortion of the amount, if necessary. Thereafter, the plaintiff sued on this note and obtained judgment thereon in the state of Hew Jersey. In an action against a married woman for repairs on her house,, proof that the plaintiff obtained judgment against her husband is conclusive evidence that the plaintiff looked to him as the debtor. <em>McCauslcmd </em>v. <em>King, </em>26 N. W. Rep. 836. Appellant contends, however, that they ought not to be concluded thereby, as the action in Hew Jersey was based upon the promissory note and not upon the original claim. Bxit the original claim was the only consideration for that note,, and without such consideration the note would have been void as between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">As far as we are able to see from the return, there is nothing to distinguish this case from any other where the wife, as part of her family duties, superintends and looks after the family home, seeing that it is kept in order and suitable for a family residence. If the defendant could be held personally liable in this action, there is nothing to hinder any tradesman from holding the wife liable for everything pertaining to the household which she directs to be done, and she would be liable for the hire of the household servants, who are always under her direction and selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The cases cited by the appellant as to the effect of judgments, refer to instances where two people are severally liable for the same debt. In such case, it is true, judginent against one is no defense to an action against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Appellant also contends that it was error to admit in evidence the note given by Mr. Swayze, claiming that its introduction tended to prove payment, which was not pleaded, and which should have been if he had desired to avail himself of that plea. But under the plea of <em>nil </em>debet, any fact tending to show there was no indebtedness on the part of the defendant, was admissible. <em>Lent </em>v. <em>New York, etc., Co., </em>130 N. Y. 511. He also contends that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was not broad enough to cover the questions raised; yret it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>plainly made upon the theory and contention that no claim against defendant had been proven, but on the other hand, the proof showed that the defendant\u2019s husband was the debtor, and had been made so by the highest authority known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
