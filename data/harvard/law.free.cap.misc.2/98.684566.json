On appeal to the General Term the order was reversed, because the moving papers showed no ground for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Upon the order of reversal the defendant now applies to the court for restitution of the counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">It appeal\u2019s that no notice of the motion has been served on the plaintiff, and that the counsel fee has been partly expended for her benefit in the prosecution of the action and in resistance to the counterclaim. The action was tried, and resulted in a dismissal of the complaint on the plaintiff\u2019s own ease, but this not until she had given evidence in opposition to the counterclaim. The decree denies a divorce to the plaintiff, without adjudicating the counterclaim, the benefit of which it reserves to the defendant in a future action.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The question whether in an action for divorce the defendant husband may ever \"claim restitution of a counsel fee paid under order of court, we need not now decide ; because upon the facts apparent on the application, no case is presented for such restitution. The counsel fee, no matter to whom actually delivered, was, in legal effect, paid to the wife, and a restitution of it would be restitution by her. Oases, <em>infra,. </em>But, she- has had no notice of this motion ; and without her day. in court, she cannot be compelled to pay money for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The legal effect being, that the wife received the money and disbursed it to her attorneys upon them retainer, they are under no obligation to return it. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>3 N. Y. 327; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Nostrand, </em>53 N. Y. Super.
