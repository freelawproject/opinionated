At the end of two years defendant closed the business and dismantled his factory. In an action to recover the \u00a73,000, <em>held, </em>that plaintiff was entitled to recover, and that his obedience of defendant\u2019s instructions to shut down and dismantle the factory was not a waiver or release by him of defendant\u2019s obligations under the contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b511-11\">Defendant afterwards went into another business and offered plaintiff employment for the remainder of his term of service. <em>Reid, </em>that plaintiff was not bound to accept it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-12\">Appeal by defendant from judgment for plaintiff entered on verdict directed by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-13\">(Jcmtor, <em>linson c&amp; Van Schaick, </em>for plaintiff (respondent).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-14\"><em>William, li. </em>Bronk, for defendant (appellant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-15\">Van Wyck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aux\">Plaintiff\u2019s action is upon a written agreement between him and defendant, made on November 1, 1889, whereby Brandus, plaintiff, engages for five years the services of Hecht, defendant, as general manager of his busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ness of manufacturing and dealing in fancy silverwares, and agrees to pay him therefor a sum equal to twenty-five per cent of the net profits of his said business, and covenants with said Hecht that said amount shall not be less than $2,080 during each year, and to make up and pay any deficiency if the same shall not amount to said sum; and the said Hecht hereby accepts said appointment for the period stated, and agrees to give his entire time and devote his utmost skill, energies and ability to the advancement of said business, and to accept for his services the share of the profits above stated.\u201d The defendant, in pursuance of the contract, embarked in the business with plaintiff as his general manager, but being disappointed in its results, first made unsuccessful efforts to sell the same, and then determined to run it no longer, and dismantled his factory, and finally abandoned his business about three years before plaintiff\u2019s term of employment would have expired by the terms of the contract. Hence this action by plaintiff to recover $2,000 as liquidated damages under the following provisions of the original agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Brandus shall have the right of terminating this agreement at any time upon the payment of $2,000 to said Hecht, and a share of the profits up to the time of such termination. Either party committing a breach of this agreement shall forfeit to the other $2,000 as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, to be recovered by him in an action at law.\u201d It is undisputed that defendant, by his letter of December 1,1890, notified plaintiff, his general business manager, as follows: \u201c Personally, I am positively through with the business, and will run it no longer,\u201d and \u201c please close down.\u201d It was the servant\u2019s duty to obey these instructions from his master, and his obedience in this respect was the master\u2019s breach of the agreement as regards the continuance of the master\u2019s business and servant\u2019s employment. And as the factory was immediately closed down and its dismantlement begun, and the whole business was finally abandoned and closed on March 7, 1891, the plaintiff had an immediate cause of action for $2,000 under the above provisions of the agreement, unless he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>as appellant contends, had abandoned, released or waived defendant\u2019s obligations under the agreement to continue the business and plaintiff\u2019s employment for five years, or to pay the plaintiff $2,000 as stipulated damages for failure to so continue the business or employment, or for terminating the agreement as provided for therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The appellant\u2019s main contentions as to abandonment, release or waiver by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s obligations under the agreement, are that defendant\u2019s letter of \u00a1November 18, 1890, is, in itself, such release or waiver and if not so, in itself, then it is the foundation upon which a waiver or release by estoppel can be built from the subsequent acts of defendant in discontinuing his business and plaintiff\u2019s employment, and in terminating the agreement, and which were induced by this letter and plaintiff\u2019s acts and conversations. The appellant insists that plaintiff\u2019s willing obedience to defendant\u2019s instructions to shut down and dismantle his factory was a waiver or release by him of defendant\u2019s obligations under the agreement to continue the business under plaintiff\u2019s management for five years. But such obedience cannot be so construed, first, because plaintiff was a servant, and such instructions came from his master, and secondly, whether servant or copartner, the plaintiff had no legal right to object, for he had by the contract conceded to defendant the absolute right to terminate the agreement, or to discontinue the business or employment whenever he saw fit to do so, and upon the exercise of such right he became liable to plaintiff in $2,000. \u00a1Now as to this letter of plaintiff. The defendant, at folios 150 and 151, testified that before he had received this letter he had \u201c lots of times \u201d directed plaintiff to sell the business, and had \u201c asked him to do all he could to sell it.\u201d This letter treats almost solely of plaintiff\u2019s efforts to make a sale of the business as instructed by defendant, and in it plaintiff says: \u201cYou (defendant) ask me what are my views as to my future; frankly, I had not given that a thought, but I certainly expect to perform all my obligations to you,\u201d and then makes reference to going into some other business with defendant if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>this business is.sold out. The defendant testifies, at folio 140, that after receipt of this letter <em>\u201c </em>Mr. Hecht, we looked around for several different kinds of business, but' we did not. enter into any of them.\u201d After all of these efforts of the defendant and his servant to make a sale of the silverware business and factory, and to embark in some other kind of business, had finally failed, we find the defendant, as was his legal right, assuming full and absolute control of his affairs and himself determining to shut down and dismantle his factory and abandon the business, without any regard to the previous unsuccessful efforts of himself and servant to sell the same and embark in another business, for he writes plaintiff, who 'is still his servant, on December 1, 1890, that \u201c.if you are through manufacturing at the factory, please close down, as it is useless to make me pay the pay rolls every Saturday, if (I don\u2019t know) we have no orders. Personally I am positively through with the business and will run it no longer;\u201d and again on December 3, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to retain anybody at all at the factory, except Michael, until Christmas. I want to stop all expenses, even one dollar. Therefore, sell all of our stock this month, with a profit, if possible; at cost, or below, if compelled. The reason I am determined to close up the business, is that this year has proven the <em>worst </em>of any, except first year; that I don\u2019t want to pay out one single dollar more.\u201d It was not only plaintiff\u2019s right, but his duty to carry out, to the letter, these instructions from his employer; and in so doing, he in no way released or waived any of defendant\u2019s obligations under the original agreement, while a failure to so do would have rendered him personally liable to his employer for all resulting approximate damages, as well as to all subsequently-employed subordinates who might fail to hold the defendant liable for their wages, by reason of this revocation by him of plaintiff\u2019s former authority. The plaintiff, in obedience to these instructions, finally closed out the business and factory, and delivered the keys to defendant on March 7, 1891. But the appellant contends that plaintiff was bound to accept employment from him and his part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ner in the publishing business, for the remainder of the term, at forty dollars per week, because defendant testified, at folio 143, that he, at the time the keys were delivered, told plaintiff to have a talk with Hastings, defendant\u2019s partner, about his employment by them; while Hastings, on behalf of defendant, testified that he had offered plaintiff employment as a salesman in their publishing business at forty dollars per week for remainder of his unexpired term. The plaintiff was under no obligation to accept this employment, for defendant\u2019s liability to him for $2,000, as liquidated damages had already been fixed, and moreover, he could not be forced to abandon the business of manufacturing silverware, in which he had twenty-five per cent of the net profits, as compensation for his services, and to accept employment as a salesman in the publishing business at the rate of forty dollars per week. And the proof is clear that plaintiff did not accept this latter offer, for the defendant, at folio 144, testified that the plaintiff said to him, immediately after this interview with his partner, \u201cMr. Brandus, Mr. Hastings has mentioned the subject about the publishing business, my being employed in it, and I must say I have not looked at my contract, or considered it any, and I will give you an answer on Monday at one o\u2019clock.\u201d The answer which plaintiff gave on Monday, will be found at folio 64, and says: \u201c Agreeable to my promise to let you have my reply to-day, I beg to say that I decide to stand by the contract made between us, and shall expect payment of the $2,000, in accordance with the contract.\u201d In the Hew of the transactions and obligations of the parties, which has herein been taken, it appears that there were no disputed questions as to any material facts, and that the facts which appellant was prevented from proHng were immaterial to the legitimate issues of the case, and hence, that the court properly directed a verdict for plaintiff for the $2,000, less the counterclaim, which was not denied. The judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">MoG-owak and FrrzsiHorrs, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
