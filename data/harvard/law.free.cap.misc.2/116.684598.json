The answer, by not denying, admits the price apd the sale and delivery of the cash carriers; and then proceeds to plead a counterclaim as follows: That there was on the premises of the defendants a certain car system ; that when the plaintiff placed its service in the store of the defendants it took to itself the old service of the defendants and applied the same to its own use and benefit, .without the knowledge of the defendants; that the reasonable value of the said old service was $150; that the defendants have demanded from the plaintiff a deduction to that amount from its bill, and have tendered to plaintiff the sum of $150, and hereby offer to allow judgment to be taken against them for the sum of $150 with interest and costs. At the trial plaintiffs moved for judgment upon the pleadings, \u201c on .the ground that the answer did not deny any of the allegations of the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>and did not set up a counterclaim which could properly be interposed in this action.\u201d The motion was granted and judgment directed for plaintiff for the full price of the cash carriers, to which order and direction defendants duly excepted. The sole question for decision is, whether the facts alleged constitute a valid counterclaim ?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Defendants insist that the cause of action which they retort upon plaintiff, \u201carises out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or in any event, that it is \u201c connected with the subject of the action.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. subd. 1, \u00a7 501. The contention is obviously untenable. The transaction set forth as the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s claim is the sale of the fifteen cash carriers; the cause of action alleged in the answer is the conversion of the old car system.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The sale of one commodity to the defendants, and the conversion of another commodity by the plaintiff, are tw'o totally different and independent transactions. JSTeither is the cause of action in the answer <em>coimectecl </em>with the subject of the action in the complaint. The subject of action in the complaint is the sale of the fifteen new cash carriers; the cause of action in the answer is the conversion of the old car system, between which subsists no legal connection whatsoever. It is not apparent, therefore, on the face of the answer that the cause of action it advances, sustains to the claim in the complaint that common origin or relation \"which the Code exacts as the indispensible condition of a valid counterclaim. <em>Edgerton </em>v. Page, 20 N. Y. 281, 285 ; <em>Boreel </em>v. Lawton, 90 id. 293, 297; <em>Thorp </em>v. <em>Philbin, </em>15 Daly, 155, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">But, in an action on contract any other cause of action on contract may be interposed as a counterclaim. Code, subd. 2, \u00a7 501. It is to be ascertained, therefore, whether the cause of action exhibited in the answer be a cause of action on contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Undoubtedly the facts stated in the answer constitute a cause of action for conversion. But, \u201cif upon the facts alleged, a cause of action in tort, as well as one on contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>may be spelled out,\u201d the pleader may elect to stand either upon tort or contract. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>121 N. Y. 522. Do the defendants in their answer rely upon tort or contract ? Manifestly upon contract. Their claim is not damages for the conversion, but the specific value of the goods applied by the plaintiff to its use and benefit; and that value they plead as a counterclaim, which would be inadmissible were the claim of damages for a tort. Beyond all controversy the defendants elect to treat their cause of action as a claim upon contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">But, it does not appear that the plaintiff has sold the thing taken; the contrary rather; and the question remains, whether the owner of a chattel converted but not parted with for money or its equivalent, may waive the tort and sue the wrongdoer in assumpsit as upon an implied contract of sale <em>\u00cd </em>It is conceded that in England, and in many states of the union, the query must be answered in the negative. See cases collected by Mr. Freeman in his note to <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Drinkwater, </em>17 Am. Dec. 242. Nay more, in this state the law was, that trover could not be turned into asssumpsit for money had and received, until the thing converted was exchanged by the wrongdoer for money or money\u2019s worth. <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Dun</em>lop, 4 Barb. 36, 42; <em>Harpending </em>v. <em>Shoemaker, </em>37 Barb. 270, 291; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>5 Den. 370 ; <em>Tryon </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>7 Lans. 511, 514; <em>McGoldrick </em>v. <em>Willits, </em>52 N. Y. 614, 620. When the tort is waived and assumpsit is brought, the receipt of the money on the sale of the goods gives the cause of the action.\u201d <em>Schroeppel </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>6 N. Y. 107, 112. Meanwhile, however, the current doctrine was subjected to destructive criticism as well by courts as by commentators. Notes of Nicholas Bill to <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>1 Hill, 240, and <em>Berly </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 id. 584; 2 Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7 108, note 5 ; Cooley on Torts, 95; Hill on Torts, 42. <em>\u201c </em>A more liberal, and we think, a more sensible, rule, is laid down by the later text-writers, and sustained by many courts, to the effect that the tort may be waived and assumpsit maintained, when the property taken has been converted either into money or into any other beneficial use by the wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>58 Miss. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cWe see no reason why the right to waive the tort and . maintain assumpsit should not be as well applicable to the case where the defendant has actually appropriated to his own \u2022 benefit and used up the plaintiff\u2019s goods himself, as where he has sold them to another and received the money, though in the former case the action must be for goods sold and delivered, and not for money had and received.\u201d Talcott, J., in <em>Abbott </em>v. Blossom, 64 Barb. 353, 356. \u201cIf the defendant had taken the wheat tortiously, the plaintiff, according to the well-known rights of election, might have brought assumpsit for goods sold and delivered.\u201d Cowen, J., in <em>Putmam </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>1 Hill, 234, 240. \u201c Butts has, therefore, an election against Collins; he can maintain trover or assumpsit, and in the latter case recover the value of the flannels under the common counts for money had and received, or for goods sold.\u201d Maison, Senator, in <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>13 Wend. 139,154. At last, in <em>Hawk </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>54 Barb. 164, it was expressly ruled that \u201c where one has unlawfully taken possession of another\u2019s property, the tort may be waived, and an action brought for its value.\u201d And in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>121 N. Y. 161, the Court of Appeals, per Beckham, J., said: \u201c The owner of personal property which has been wrongfully converted by another man, although the property is retained by the wrongdoer, may waive the tort and sue for and recover its value upon an implied contract of sale.\u201d The mile as thus held, finds support in the adjudications of other states. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 N. H. 384; <em>Stockett </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>2 Gill &amp; J. 326, 342, 343 ; <em>Halleck </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>16 Cal. 574; <em>Fratt </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>12 id. 89 ; <em>Borker </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>15 Ohio, 9. It is commended, moreover, to acceptance by the analogies of the law and the interests of justice. A consent induced by fraud is no consent; and yet the vendor in a fraudulent sale may waive the tort and sue for goods sold. It is conceded that upon a conversion, if the goods be parted with by the wrongdoer, he may be held as for money had and received \u2014 his promise to pay being arbitrarily forced upon him by implication of law. Soj if he retain the goods, the owner should be allowed to treat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>transaction as a sale, and the law should imply a promise to pay their value. In such case the tort-feasor will not be allowed to set up his own wrongful intent, in disavowal of the implied promise which the law would otherwise raise against him. <em>Hill </em>v. Perrott, 3 Taunt. 274, 275 ; <em>Lightly </em>v. <em>Clouston, </em>1 id. 112, 114, per Mansfield, C. J. The rule is advantageous to a defendant, since being sued on contract instead of in tort, he is exempt from arrest and may plead an offset. -</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201cNo party is bound to sue in tort, when by converting the action into an action on contract he does not prejudice the defendant; and, generally speaking, it is more favorable to the defendant that he should be sued in contract, because the form of action lets in a set-off, and enables him to pay money into court.\u201d Tindall, C. J, in <em>Young </em>v. Marshall, 8 Bing. 43. Finally, by converting the tort into a contract, and so opening the case to a counterclaim, all the controversies between the parties may be adjusted in a single litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The conclusion is, that the defendants had an option to waive the conversion, and to claim as for goods sold and delivered; and that, by their answer, they elected to proceed upon contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The result is, that the counterclaim is valid, and the judgment overruling it erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Daly, Ch. J., and Bischoff, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
