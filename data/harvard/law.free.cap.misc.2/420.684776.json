His <em>domicile </em>is the place to which he intends eventually to return and there to remain <em>(Matter of Thompson, </em>1 Wend. 43), while his <em>residence </em>comprehends no more than a fixed abode for the t\u00fane being, as contradistinguished from a place of temporary sojourn. <em>Matter of Wrigley, </em>8 Wend. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">On the hearing of the motion to vacate the.attachment it appeared from the affidavit of Elizabeth H. Pratt, which was submitted for the purposes 0f the motion on defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>behalf, that at all times prior to the removal of her family, which consisted of herself and two sons, one of. them, the defendant, to New Haven, Conn., their <em>domicile </em>was in St. Louis, Ho., and that about the year 1887 the removal to New Haven was effected for no other purpose than to complete the sons\u2019 education. The St. Louis <em>domicile </em>was, therefore, not abandoned, and as at the time of the removal to New Haven defendant was an infant his domicile Avas that of his mother. <em>Lamar </em>v. Micou, 112 U. S. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">St. Louis, having been shown to be defendant\u2019s <em>domicile </em>of origin, its continuance, both during his minority, and thereafter, must be presumed until it satisfactorily appears that he has established a <em>domicile </em>of choice. 7 LaAvson\u2019s Rights, Remedies <em>&amp; </em>Practice, 6067, \u00a7 3848. No attempt was made by defendant to prove a <em>domicile </em>of choice, but instead he endeavored to show that when the attachment was issued he was not a <em>resident </em>of Ncav Haven, but of New York. Plaintiff\u2019s right to the attachment, however, was not dependent upon the fact of defendant\u2019s <em>residence </em>in New Haven, but upon the fact of his <em>nonresidence </em>Avitliin the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In June 1890, when defendant was but twenty years of age, he came to the city of New York to venture in the business of a theatrical manager. For this purpose he established an office, and after having at intervals lived at boarding houses and hotels, about February, 1892, rented apartments at 250 West Thirty-ninth street, in said city, which he in turn abandoned shortly before July fifteenth of the same year, when, as he says himself, he stored his furniture and went to Old Orchard, Haine, there to spend his summer vacation. On July twenty-eighth, concededly while defendant was without the state, the attachment was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The facts narrated sIloav that at the time of issuing the attachment defendant had no fixed abode Avitliin, and that he was, therefore, at the time not a <em>resident </em>of the state of New York. Assuming that he had a general intention of future return, that fact alone did not constitute a continuance of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>abode <em>(Wood </em>v. Hamilton, 14 Daly, 41; <em>Weitkamp </em>v. Loehr, 53 N. Y. Super. Ct. 83); nor was defendant\u2019s own declaration of his intention to renew his abode at a stated time con? elusive. <em>Dietlin </em>v. Egam,, 46 N. Y. St. Repr. 762. His <em>domicile </em>of origin was in St. Louis. He had not acquired a <em>domicile </em>of choice. Actual abode, for business accommodation only, did not effect a change of <em>domicile. Matter of </em>Wrigley, 8 Wend. 134, 139. It could only be acquired by concurrence of actual <em>residence </em>and intention permanently to remain' (5 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 862); and without satisfactory evidence that defendant, at the time when the attachment was issued, had a fixed place of abode within the state, his <em>residence </em>must be presumed to be at the place of his <em>domicile.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Bookstaveb and Pbyob, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
