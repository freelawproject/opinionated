The answer admits the receipt of the money and denies all other allegations of the complaint; and for a second defense sets, up that plaintiff\u2019s assignor was a clerk in defendant\u2019s employment at and previous and after the times mentioned in the complaint, and in receipt from the defendant of a weekly salary which was duly paid to and received by the assignor during every week he was employed by the defendant, together with other matters in which is included the portion of the. answer which was striken out by the order appealed from. A mere inspection of the portion striken out, shows that it is not relevant or material to the defense set up, which is payment; besides, such an inspection will disclose the fact that the part striken out is highly scandalous in charging a crime upon which no claim of damages is predicated and which is immaterial in so far as it constitutes no defense to the cause of action set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The granting or refusal of a motion to strike out as immaterial and irrelevant is always within the discretion of the court (Code, \u00a7 545 ; <em>Town of Essex </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; Can. R. R. Co., </em>8 Hun, 361; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>1 Abb. Pr. 39 ; <em>Homam </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>4 Weekly Dig. 175 ; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Folsom, </em>57 Hun 128); and the same we apprehend is true in regard to scandalous matter especially as in this case where it cannot by itself constitute a defense to the action. Moreover, it is apparent that the most it could do would be to prejudice the jury against the assignor if called as a witness in this action; and we do not see how the complaint could be established without calling In'm as a witness, when the facts alleged in the part striken out if true, can be brought out upon cross-examination, and we think it will place him in a sufficiently ruifavorable light to-appear as witness to the claim, assignor of the claim and attorney for the claimant at the same time. We cannot say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that the discretion exercised by the judge granting the order was improper under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">But it is contended by appellant that no party to the action is aggrieved by the matter stricken out, as Hr. Goldzier the assignor, is not a party to the action, and, therefore, the motion should not have been granted. But it is no defense to such a. motion that no party to the action is aggrieved, for the Code expressly provides that \u201c any person aggrieved \u201d by the irreleyant or scandalous matter may have it striken out on motion,, and in this case it is made by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney who is the person injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The order should, therefore, be affirmed, with ten dollars, costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Pryor and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
