Up to April 9, 1898, plaintiff had performed all of the terms of the agreement under which the notes were given, and defendant L. had enjoyed all his rights thereunder. On that day, plaintiff notified defendant L. by letter, that in view of his repeated and continued defaults in payments of some of the notes, he terminated and rescinded the contract, and inclosed the last eleven notes of the series, all of which matured after April 9, retaining eight notes maturing before that date then outstanding and unpaid. Defendant L. by letter acquiesced in the rescission, and notified plaintiff of his consent that the agreement be wholly rescinded and annulled. In an action on two of the last-mentioned notes, <em>Jield, </em>that plaintiff by the notice of April 9, meant simply that he terminated the contract only as to its unexpired period.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-7\"><em>Held, </em>further, that as all the unpaid notes up to the date of the rescission had been fully earned by plaintiff by the performance of the contract on his part, and defendant L. having had all the benefits of the contract up to its rescission, both he and the indorsers were liable thereon.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-8\">Ap indorser of a promissory note is not released by mere failure to sue the maker.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-9\">Appeal in each action from a judgment against the defendants entered upon the verdict of a jury, directed by the court, and from orders denying motions for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-10\"><em>Carter, Pinney &lt;&amp; Kellogg (Frederick P.

Lovell under an agreement between himself and the plaintiff, which provided among other things that during the period of three years after the date of the contract, Lovell was to have the exclusive right to have impressions printed from certain plates belonging to Hurst, and that during the same period the latter should not publish directly or indirectly, any works competitive to those covered by the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>contract; and for these exclusive rights the agreement provided that Hurst should receive the sum of $90,000, for which sum Lovell should give him thirty-six negotiable promissory notes each for $2,500, payable at intervals of one month respectively, each to be drawn to the order of Trow\u2019s Printing and Bookbinding Company, to be indorsed by them, and by the defendant Lange. The agreement also provided this sum of $90,000 was intended not only to include the right to use the plates, but also a consideration for the relinquishment of competing business, and that if the plates were destroyed before the termination of three years, it should not be considered as abating the payment of any portion of this, sum. The agreement further provided for the purchase by Lovell of a large amount of book stock and sheets, and that Lovell should be bound at the end of the three years, or at such earlier time as he might desire, to purchase all the plates covered by the contract, for the sum of $75,000, in addition to the $90,000 before mentioned, and that from the making of said purchase Hurst should become bound to refrain from entering into any competing business for twenty-five years after the date thereof, with certain exceptions. Under this contract the thirty-six notes provided for in the agreement,, were delivered to the plaintiff, each made by Lovell, and indorsed by the defendants, as provided for in the agreement. Subsequently fifteen of these notes fell due, and were paid at maturity, but the sixteenth and seventeenth notes of the series,, wlficli are the ones in suit in these actions, were not paid, as was also the case with six others falling due thereafter. After the delivery of these notes to the plaintiff, he transferred the two in question to Samuel J. Kerr, by whom these actions were originally commenced, but subsequently, in December, 1891, the notes were taken up by the plaintiff from Kerr, and he again became their sole owner, and remained so down to and including the time of the trial. On March 9, 1892, there being .at the time seven notes of this series unpaid, including the two now under consideration, Hurst sent the following letter to Lovell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201cLaw Office of Andrew Gilhooly, Temple Court-] Building, 5 Beekman Street, {-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">New York, <em>March 9th, </em>1892.

W. LOVELL.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Meanwhile and up to the 9th of April, 1892, Hurst had completely performed all of the terms of the above-mentioned agreement on his part to be performed, and Lovell had enjoyed the exclusive use of the plates referred to in the agreement, and Hurst had refrained from publishing the hooks he had undertaken not to publish. The eleven notes returned as before stated, were all notes maturing after April 9, 1892. The eight notes maturing before that date then outstanding and unpaid were retained. Of these Hurst, on April 9,1892, held and owned five, including the two in question in that action, which actions were then pending, and the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>three were in suit by other parties against LoveE and the defendants herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The foregoing facts appealing at the trial, the court, when all the evidence was in, at the request of the plaintiff, directed a verdict in his favor for the full amount of the notes, with interest, to which the defendants excepted, and this exception raises the only question to be considered upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The direction was made at the close of the evidence on motion by both parties for the direction of a verdict, one in favor of plaintiff and the other for the dismissal of the complaints and a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, and neither party asked to go to the jury upon any question, thus submitting to the court for its determination any questions of fact that may have arisen upon the evidence in the case. This gave to the judge the office of the jury and brings up the question whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s decision. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Shute, </em>15 Daly, 358 ; <em>Gilder </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>45 N. Y. St. Repr. 690 ; <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Atlas S. S. Co., </em>46 id. 533 ; <em>Mayor, etc., </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>39 Hun, 519, 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant contends that the rescission of the contract of March fourth, discharged both the maker and the indorsers of the notes in suit from any liability thereon. This would be the case if the notices served by Hurst upon Lovell amounted to a rescission in the ordinary acceptation of that term. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>White, </em>87 N. Y. 463; 2 Dan. Neg. Inst. \u00a7 1306; <em>Freith </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>L. R. (9 Com. Pleas) 213 ; 9 Eng. Rep. 393; <em>Mersey Steel and Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>9 App. Cas. 434; 36 Eng. Rep. 164; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Parkhurst, </em>126 N. Y. 93; Bishop on Contracts, \u00a7 827; <em>Creighton </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>50 N. Y. Super. Ct. 9; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Robie, </em>42 N. Y. 320; <em>Conrow </em>v. <em>Little, </em>115 N. Y. 394; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bowery Savings Bank, </em>113 id. 450, and many others which might be cited. The question then arises as to what was really intended by the plaintiff\u2019s notice of April 9, 1892. Did he thereby mean that he rescinded the contract <em>ab initio </em>or only from and after April 9, 1892, the date of the notice. And this depends upon the construction to be given to the words <em>\u201c </em>I hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>terminate cmd rescind </em>my said written contract,\u201d to be determined in the light of surrounding circumstances. Good \u2022writers often use the word \u201c rescind \u201d in the narrower sense of \u25a0terminate a contract as to future transactions. Thus, in making ,a note at page 145, 28 Abb. N. C., Dr. Abbott says: <em>\u201c </em>The word \u2018 rescission \u2019 is often and not improperly used to mean cutting off, termination. Thus Bispham (Eq. J. 556, \u00a7 506) says a dissolution of the partnership is a rescission of the contract, \u25a0meaning of course a rescission as to future transactions.\u201d The words <em>\u201c </em>rescission \u201d and \u201c rescind \u201d are used <em>simpticiter </em>by \"the highest authorities to indicate in some cases partial rescission or termination, as well as to indicate in other cases annulment <em>ab initio. </em>Thus Leake Cont. (3d ed. 1892) 53, says: \u201cIn a case of money lent under a special contract, which was afterwards rescinded by mutual agreement, it was held that the money still remains due, the rescission relating \u25a0only to the further execution of the contract.\u201d Fey, J., says, in <em>Stuck </em>v. <em>Capstick, </em>12 Chan. Div. 863, in speaking of the dissolution of a partnership which involved the refusal by defendant, an incoming partner, to pay his bonus or premium after three months\u2019 joint conduct of the business, the pretext for his refusal being the allegation that plaintiff had not fairly performed on his part: \u201c It must have regard to the circumstances which have led to the dissolution of the partnership. * * * The allegation of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff tiled, and in my opinion the defendant has in effect <em>rescinded </em>the partnership agreement without any excuse,\u201d and he thereupon went on to decree <em>jpayment of thepremimn </em>agreeably to the terms of the partnership, thus showing that the rescinding spoken of was not an absolute rescission or annuhnent of the partnership <em>ab </em>initio, but a termination or rescission, restricted to the future. This is made still clearer by the head-note, which states the case as one \u201c where a partnership is dissolved before its natural expiration, etc., without payment of the premium * * * the partner who has agreed to pay it\u201d (if his fault is the sole cause of the dissolution) \u201c will be ordered to pay the whole of it notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the dissolution.\u201d In 2 Pars, on Cont. (7th ed.) 677 (star paging), we find these words, \u201c and a suit for the recovery of damages for a \"breach of the contract is equivalent to a notice of rescission,\u201d citing <em>Graham </em>v. Holloway, 44 Ill. 385. In <em>Mann </em>v. Palmer, 3 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 162, the head-note is \u201c acquiescence in the rescission of the executory contract is not necessarily a waiver of an existing claim for profits made under it.\u201d Obviously a single word, like the word \u201c rescind/' cannot be wrenched from its context and construed alone in its unqualified, strict and technical sense in disregard of the surrounding circumstances. To ascertain the import of the notice the intent must be gathered from the instrument considered as a whole. \u201c It is a cardinal rule in the construction of contracts that the intention of the parties is to be inquired into and if not forbidden by law is to be effectuated. Too much regard is not to be had to the proper and exact signification of words so as to prevent the simple intention of the parties from taking effect, and where the language is susceptible of more than one interpretation, the courts will look at the surrounding circumstances when the contract was entered into, the situation of the parties and of the subject-matter of the instrument.\u201d <em>French </em>v. <em>Carhart, </em>1 N. Y. 102; appd. <em>Bridger </em>v. Pierson, 45 id. 601; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Assn., </em>122 id. 258. And this rule has been applied even to the interpretation of charters and legislative enactments. <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>City of </em>Cohoes, 74 N. Y. 387. On the general question under consideration, see, also, <em>Blossom </em>v. Griffin, 13 N. Y. 569; <em>Zimmer </em>v. Settle, 124 id. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Under the light of these authorities we think the circumstances surrounding the making and termination of the contract should be considered. It is undisputed from the 4tli of llarch, 1890, the date of the contract, down to the 9th of April, 1892, Hurst had in all things performed his part of the contract, inasmuch as Lovell had enjoyed the exclusive use of the plates down to the latter date, and Hurst had refrained from publishing, as he agreed, any works in competition to those \"mentioned in the agreement. Hence, by virtue of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>performance, Hurst had, on the 9th of April, 1892, earned, and had a vested right of action on all of said series of notes maturing prior to April 9, 1892, and then unpaid. None of these were returned at the time of giving the notice; some of them were then in action. Lovell had, in violation of his contract, made default in the payment of eight of the series. In consequence of these repeated defaults on Lovell\u2019s part, Hurst was clearly justified, on April ninth, in terminating the contract as to its unexpired part, and in holding Lovell upon his contract and notes given thereunder, for the liability already incurred on his previous defaults. <em>In re </em>Kelly, 51 Fed. Rep. 194; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Massena Springs, etc., R. Co., </em>63 Hun, 439, 443; <em>Strach </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>41 N. Y. St. Repr. 777; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>21 N. Y. 399. In giving Lovell notice of such termination of the contract, Hurst was not confined to any particular form of words so long as their import was to terminate the contract in respect to its unexpired period. If, instead of using the expression \u201cterminate and rescind,\u201d Hurst had written that he had terminated the contract as of the date of the notice, or had coupled with the word \u201c rescind,\u201d words showing express reservation of his accrued rights, this would have meant simply that he terminated the contract only as to its unexpired period. <em>McCreery </em>v. <em>Day, </em>119 N. Y. 1; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>74 id. 201; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>46 N. Y. St. Repr. 242. In the light of the surrounding circumstances, has he done anything else than this ?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">But it is claimed that we must give effect to all the words in the contract. We do this in this case by making the word \u201c rescind \u201d equivalent to the word \u201c terminate,\u201d and hence regard it as mere tautology and synonymous with \u201c terminate.\u201d The curious in such matters would see in this no more than a survival of that disposition which draftsmen exhibited when the fee bill was in part regulated by the folio, and they became expert in the use of a large vocabulary of words having the same or similar meaning in order to increase the number of folios.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">It is quite true, as contended for by the appellant, that as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>general rule where there has been a breach of a contract, the party performing has the right to consider such breach as a basis for rescinding and abandoning the contract, or to treat the contract as subsisting, and sue for the enforcement of the unperformed obligation, and the election to rescind the agreement bars the pursuit of the other alternative. Yet this is so only in cases where the contract is rescinded <em>in toto </em>and <em>db initio. </em>In such cases he cannot regard the contract as existing and not existing at the same time; he must choose between the two. But, as before shown, there are numerous cases in which the party performing the contract on his part, may terminate it as to the future, and still hold the delinquent party for its performance up to the time of its termination. In addition to what has been said, we may call attention to the familiar illustration of an ordinary lease for a number of years, where it is provided that the same shall continue for a definite period of time, with installments of rent to be paid monthly; if the lessee neglects to pay these monthly installments, the landlord may allow the lease to go on to the end, and sue for the whole rent due, or he may at any time by the commencement of summary proceedings, obtain possession of the leased property, and thus terminate the lease, and yet he may thereafter sue the lessee and recover for the rent due up to the time of the dispossession. And we have no doubt whatever but that the contract under consideration falls within the latter class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Again, all the facts in this case were undisputed. If conflicting inferences were to be drawn from these facts, the action of the parties in requesting the court to direct a verdict, made it the judge of those inferences to the same extent that the jury would have been had not such requests been made; and we think there is quite sufficient in these cases to warrant the judge in drawing the inference as he did in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">But it is claimed on behalf of appellant that even conceding Lovell might be held upon the notes due and unpaid at the time of the rescission, the indorsers were thereby dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>charged, because of the modification of the contract between Lovell and Hurst, inasmuch as the only liability of the defendants to the plaintiff is as sureties for Lovell, the sole party to the contract. It is difficult to see how a cancellation of a contract is a modification of it. The terms of the contract were in no way changed by such termination, and if Lovell was not discharged from the obligation he incurred before the rescission, we cannot see how his sureties could be. As before Shown, all the unpaid notes up to the date of the rescission ' had been fully earned by Hurst by the performance of the contract on his part, and Lovell had had all the benefits of the contract up to its rescission; and in our opinion the notes were in the nature of rent for the plates, etc., and the defendants Were liable for its payment. We fail to perceive any force in the argument that the defendants were injured by such rescission ; on the contrary, it appears to us that it was greatly to their advantage, as in consequence of it they were relieved from a large liability, which, if the contract had been allowed to continue, they or their principal, Lovell, would have had to meet, with nonresultmg advantage to the indorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The contention that the sureties were released because of an extension of time granted the principal, is not well founded. Such a contention is based solely upon the letters written by the plaintiff to the defendant, which, instead of extending his time to pay the notes, really were intended to press upon him the necessity for immediate payment. The mere failure to sue upon the notes when due never releases the indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b410-7\">Pbyob, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A1I\">I am unable to concur in the prevailing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The notes in suit were given in execution of the agreement of the 15th of June, 1892, but that contract was \u201c rescinded \u201d and <em>u </em>annulled \u201d\u25a0 by the mutual consent of the parties, and by consequence all rights acquired, under it ceased and determined. A rescission of a contract imports <em>proprio vigore </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>relinquishment of every benefit and a dissolution of every obligation dependent upon it; and by the act of rescission each party is restored to his original position and relation. It is a contradiction in terms to assert a right under a rescinded contract, and \u201cneither party can thereafter invoke it against the other.\u201d <em>McCreery </em>v. <em>Day, </em>119 N. Y. 1; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>White, </em>87 id. 463, 466; <em>Brewster </em>v. Wooster, 131 id. 473; <em>Fullager </em>v. Reville, 3 Hun, 600. By rescission of the contract, of which they were an incident, the notes became incapable of enforcement. Otherwise, however, had they been reserved from the operation of the rescission, but of that there is no hint, the words being \u201c <em>wholly </em>rescinded and annulled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
