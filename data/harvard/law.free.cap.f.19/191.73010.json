Neither the state court nor its officer, the syndic, ever had any <em>actual </em>custody of the property. It was seized by the marshal in the hands of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-13\">It is contended by the syndic that the cession made by the debtor and accepted by the state court <em>ipso facto </em>vested the creditors and the court with the title and the <em>constructive </em>possession of the property, so as to place it from that moment <em>in gremio legis, </em>and beyond the jurisdiction and control of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-14\">The plaintiff contends\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-15\">(1) That the insolvent laws of Louisiana are not operative against the plaintiff, who is a citizen of another state, either in whole or in part; in other words, that those laws are to be considered as <em>not ivritten, </em>either in a state or in a federal court. The syndic admits that they aro inoperative <em>in part, </em>but not as a whole. Dor instance, he admits that they are powerless to stay proceedings in this court. He admits that a discharge of the debtor is inoperative here. But he contends that in one respect they <em>are operative, </em>and that one respect is that they have the effect <em>proprio vigore </em>to transfer to the state tribunals <em>sole </em>jurisdiction over the property of the insolvent, with the <em>sole </em>power to sell and distribute the samo among his creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-16\">The authorities repudiate specifically such a distinction. 5 Gill, 426; 4 Gill &amp; J. 509; 2 Md. 457; 5 Md. 1; <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Suck, </em>quoted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>supreme court of the United States in 1 Wall. 234; Judge Taney\u2019s opinion, 8 Gill. 499; 1 Wall. 234; 4 Wall. 409; 5 La. Ann. 271; 10 La. Ann. 145; 14 La. Ann. 261; 1 Bald. 301; 14 Pet. 67; 5 Blatchf. 279; 3 N. Y. 500. The effect of such a construction of the law would be to <em>compel </em>foreign creditors to subject themselves <em>voluntarily to </em>th8 jurisdiction of the state courts, and thus be bound by the insolvent\u2019s discharge. The state courts would thus holdall the insolvent\u2019s property in constructive possession and say to the foreign creditors: \u201cCome in and take your dividend and <em>have your debt discharged </em>or get nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">(2) If the insolvent laws, qaalaws, are inoperative in all respects as against foreign creditors, this case presents nothing but a question of the conflict of jurisdiction between two tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction, each having power to bind the goods of the defendant by its process. The rule in such cases is that <em>where the parties are not the same, nor the cause of action the same in both counts, i. e., </em>to the extent of constituting <em>Us pendens, </em>that court holds the property which first obtained physical custody of it. In other words, in such cases there is no such thing as a constructive possession of property which is capable of actual possession\u2014of <em>physical prehension. </em>The term <em>in gremio legis </em>is then, and under such circumstances, equivalent to <em>in manu ministres curiae. Payne </em>v. <em>Drewe, </em>4 East, 523; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Carryl, </em>20 How. 594; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>24 How. 450; <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Atlantic, etc., Air-line R. R. </em>2 Woods, 409, opinion of Judges Bradley and Erskine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">It is clear that this court will not surrender its possession of and jurisdiction over <em>the property of the defendant </em>to a syndic, or officer of a state court, who had no legal existence when the jurisdiction of this court attached. That the property seized <em>belongs to the defendant, </em>notwithstanding the cession, is incontestable. The Code so declares in the most emphatic terms. Articles 2171, 2178, 2180, 2182. These articles of the Code, and the apparently conflicting section of the <em>subordinate </em>Revised Statutes, which declares that the cession \u201cfully vests the property in the creditors,\u201d have been interpreted authoritatively. <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Creditors, </em>3 La. Ann. 387; <em>Nouvet </em>v. <em>Bollinger, </em>15 La. Ann. 293. The contrary decision\u2014the mere <em>dictum </em>of Judge Porter, unbacked by the quotation of authority\u2014in <em>Schroeder\u2019s Syndics </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>2 La. 354, is directly in the teeth of the law. The decision of <em>Bank of Tenn. </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>17 How. 517, is equally without foundation. The authority of that case is further weakened by the fact that the seizure was made after the appointment and confirmation of the syndic, and after his actual custody of the property had begun.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">The case of <em>Crapo </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>16 Wall. 610, does not apply to this case,'because the assignment made by the court under the Massachusetts insolvent law transferred the <em>absolute title </em>of the property to the assignee, and also operated as a tradition and delivery of the property to such assignee. Under the law of Louisiana the <em>cessio bonorum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>loaves the title in the insolvent, and simply transfers to the creditors a right to administer and sell the property ceded under the orders of this court; and it is admitted that if, under the insolvent law of Louisiana, the <em>cessio bonorum </em>divested the title of the insolvent, vested such title <em>ipso facto </em>in the syndic, and operated a tradition and delivery of the property into the possession of such officer, then there would be an end of their attachment. But, inasmuch as such <em>cessio bonorum </em>is simply equivalent to an application to appoint a receiver to administer the property of the insolvent under the orders of the court for the benefit of his creditors,\u2014the absolute title remaining all the time in the insolvent, coupled with the express right to terminate the whole proceeding at any time by coming forward and paying the debts and costs of administration,\u2014this court\u2019s rights to lay its hands on the property of the debtor cannot be ousted, unless by the previous actual possession of such property by a state court through its duly-appointed officer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-4\"><em>Thomas L.

And in this case it is said \u201cthat the surrender in the Second district court of New Orleans divested Conrey of all his rights of property and vested these in the creditors; the right and title had, by operation of the law of the state, vested in the creditors.\u201d In <em>Crapo </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>16 Wall. 610, this is declared to be the effect of the insolvent law of Massachusetts, and Mr. Justice Br'adley, who dissents on the ground that the property referred to was not within the limits of the state, says, (page 643 :)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-4\">\u201cIn the case now decided the force and effect of \"the judicial assignment wAuld have been regarded as conclusive in Massachusetts, had the ship, the subject of it, returned there, and become subjected to its local jurisdiction. * * * I do not deiiy that, if the property had been within Massachusetts jurisdiction when the assignment passed, the property would have been <em>ipso facto </em>transferred to the assignee by the laws of Massachusetts <em>proprio vigore, </em>and, being actually transferred and vested, would have been respected the world over.\u201d <em>Yonley </em>v.

The attachment issued by virtue of a state law, and falls under the above section of the law of the United States.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-17\"> Reported by Joseph P. Hornor, Esq., of the New Orleans bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-8\">Billings, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHQ\">The facts necessary to be considered are these: Messrs. Ranlett &amp; Co., the defendants, had made a <em>cessio bonorum </em>under the insolvent law of the state of Louisiana, which had been accepted by the court before which the proceeding was pending, but no syndic had been appointed and no possession taken in behalf of the creditors. At this stage of the proceeding the plaintiff, who is a citizen of the state of Mississippi, sued out a writ of attachment in the circuit court of the United States in this state, and under his writ the marshal seized the property, the same being in the possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the defendants. The matter comes np on a motion of the syndic to release the seizure, on the ground that, inasmuch as the cession had been accepted by the court, according to the provisions of the insolvent law of the state, the property had vested in the creditors. Those provisions are as follows: \u201cFrom and after such cession and acceptance all the property of the insolvent debtor mentioned in the schedule shall fully vest in his creditors.\u201d Kev. St. La. \u00a7 1791. So far as actual possession affects the question, the facts are with the plaintiff, for the marshal found the property in the possession of the defendant, seized it and holds it. The case is, therefore, free from any embarrassment arising from any possible disputed possession between tiie officers of tills court and the court in which the insolvent case is pending. It is to be further observed that the law of the state of Louisiana, exclusive of the insolvent law of the state, requires tradition or delivery of personal property in order to transfer title. So that the sole point to be decided is whether the insolvent law, in and of itself, without any other investiture of title, the possession remaining in the debtor, removes the property beyond the reach of a creditor who is a citizen of another state. If that law operates upon such a creditor, the property, by the court\u2019s mere acceptance of the cession, was completely vested, though no possession had been taken, and must bo surrendered to the syndic now appointed, to be administered under the insolvent law; if, on the other hand, that law is not operative upon such a creditor, there is nothing to prevent, and it becomes a manifest duty that this court should hold the property seized, and subject it to the payment of the debt of the attaching creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The cases upon the general subject are numerous, but for the most part they deal with questions-remote from the one before the court. The solution of this question stands with but little advance since the decision of <em>Ogden </em>v. Saunders, <em>12 </em>Wheat. 213, which as late as <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>1 Wall. 223, after an elaborate discussion, was, so far as relates to this matter, reiterated without qualification. The principle stated in both these casos, and in the last recognized as unqualified and unquestioned law, is: \u201cWhen, in the exercise of their power to enact insolvent laws, states pass beyond their own limits and the rights of their own citizens, and act upon the rights of citizens of other states, there arises a conflict of sovereign power and a collision with the judicial powers granted to the United Stales, -which render the exercise of such a power incompatible with the rights of other states.and with the constitution of the United States.\u201d I am unable to perceive how there should be doubt or hesitation in deducing the law of this case from the principle thus enunciated and adhered to. If any attempt on the part of a state \u201cto act upon the rights of a foreign citizen he so opposed to the sovereign and the judicial powers of the United States as to be incompatible witli the rights of other states and with the constitution of the United States, \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>then it must follow that, so long as the insolvent court relies exclusively upon the words of the insolvent law, at,any stage of its procedure, short of actual, physical-possession, or such a state of facts as by the general law of' the state are tantamount to physical possession, as against the process of the United States court, issued at the instance of a foreign creditor, the title of the syndic must be nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Mr. Justice Woodbury, in <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Wood. &amp; M. 136, with reference to this very question, says: \u201cThe actual seizure of the property of the bankrupt in another government or country, before his assignees take possession of it, creates a lien upon it in favor of a foreign creditor, which will be sustained;\u201d and again upon the same page, says: The circuit court of the United States, sitting in Massachusetts, \u201cis as different a tribunal from those belonging to .Massachusetts alone as the court of any other state.\u201d Nor do we obtain any qualification of this rigid doctrine from the federal statute, that the rules of property in the several states- control the courts of the United States sitting therein, for that statute contains an exception which removes this whole question from its dominion. That statute is as follows: \u201cThe laws of the several states, except'when the <em>constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require </em>or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States where they apply.\u201d Eev. St. \u00a7 721. Indeed, the statute, by its exception, declares that all state laws\u2014be they insolvent laws, or laws prescribing rules of property, or of any other character\u2014cease to be binding upon the federal courts whenever the constitution of the United States otherwise requires or provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The leading cases have arisen where only the validity of the debt- or\u2019s discharge was involved. But the conclusion that until the state insolvent court has possession, its proceedings cannot afteet the nonresident creditor, follows as conclusively with respect to exemption from process, or respite, or stay, or any intermediate action. In <em>Haydel </em>v. <em>Girod, </em>10 Pet. 283, where the plaintiff, a resident creditor, had not been notified, and a respite and stay had been granted and were pleaded, the court say: \u201cThe plaintiff was in no sense made a party to the proceedings, and, consequently, his rights are in no respect affected by them.\u201d <em>A fortiori </em>must this be true where, as here, with reference to a party, the^court had no authority to decree or proceed; for in <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>4 Wall. 411, the court say, \u201cunless in cases where a citizen of another state voluntarily becomes a party to the proceedings, the state tribunal has no jurisdiction of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Many eases have been cited by the counsel for the defendant, but they cannot avail to shake the settled law as thus explicitly declared by the supreme tribunal of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">There are numerous cases where the settlement of the estates of insolvent deceased persons has, by the same tribunal, been declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>to he exclusively vested in the appropriate state courts. It seems to me this large class of cases only affirm what is the universal law, and necessarily so, that the estates of the dead must he settled by the local mortuary courts, and that this is equally true whether they be solvent or insolvent. The jurisdiction in these cases springs not from the insolvency, but from the death, and the law which regulates is not an insolvent law, hut a law controlling the administration of successions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The case of <em>Bank of Tennessee </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>17 How. 159, I have carefully considered. The point presented and decided seems to have been that a misdescription of real estate in the schedule of the insolvent debtor did not prevent its passing to the creditors by the cession. The contest was between a purchaser from the syndic under a sale ordered by the court of insolvency and those claiming title by a purchase under a judgment rendered in the United States circuit court after, the cession. When we observe that the chief justice in giving the opinion of the court says, \u201cthe validity of the insolvent law of Louisiana has been fully recognized in the case of <em>Peale </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>14 How. 368,\u201d and further, that that case is placed upon the ground (page 374) that \u201cwhile the property remained in the <em>custody and possession </em>of one court no other court had the right to interiore with it,\u201d it seems that it should be inferred that in the case of <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Horn </em>the syndic had possession at the time of the rendition of the judgment in the circuit court, and prior to any attempt to seize under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In the case presented here the plaintiff is in possession, and both as respects title and possession his right is absolute but for a right which, if it exists at all, comes from the inherent force of a state insolvent law, which, unaccompanied by possession, is, as to this plaintiff, like an extraterritorial bankrupt or insolvent law, and according to the summary of authorities in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 322, (decided at the same term with the case of <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Bank, supra,) </em>gives to the foreign assignee no title as against local creditors who attach. The constitution of the United States operates within as well as without the state which enacts insolvent laws. No state laws in conflict with it can be rules of property. The doctrine of comity between the federal and state courts lias been constantly extending in recognition and clear and rigid enforcement; but the rules of law as expounded in <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Saunders, supra, </em>are, as it seems to me, unchanged. In accordance with that case, in this forum\u2019 at least, the possession of a foreign citizen under an attachment must prevail against the syndic who claims merely by the declaratory force of a state insolvent law. A mere declaration in a statute, which is by the settled adjudications inoperative against a party domiciled as is the plaintiff, cannot oust this court of administration of the property, which is, consistently with all the rules of judicial comity, in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The rule must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
