Even if the Court should be of opinion that the arrangement testified to by the witness, Debilius, as having been made with the defendant in October or November, 1882, amounted in law to a new demise, still the plaintiff cannot recover unless the jury find from the evidence that at the time such arrangement was entered into, the bridge was in an unsafe and defective condition for the purpose for which it was erected and used, and that the defendant at that time knew that it was so unsafe and defective, and there is no evidence in the cause legally sufficient to show any such defective condition or knowledge thereof on the part of said defendant at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">5.

Albert was, in his life-time, the owner of the place and premises known as \u201c Holly Grove\u201d or \u201c Tivoli,\u201d situated on the Patapsco River, in Baltimore County, and leased the same to Prank Debilius, by the lease offered in evidence, dated the 23rd of May, 1878, for \u201can excursion point and summer resort,\u201d and afterwards died, leaving a will, probated the 17th of April, 1879, by which he devised the said premises to the defendant, and he has ever since been the owner of the same as such devisee. And if the jury shall further find from the evidence, that at the date of the aforesaid lease there had been built on said premises two bridges or piers, and a wharf, as described by the witnesses, and that these were used for the purpose of affording access to and from the land for excursionists and visitors coming to said place in boats by water. And if they shall further find that said Debilius, as tenant under said lease, entered into possession and used the premises as an excursion point or summer resort, under the terms of said lease; and shall further find, that in October or November, 1882, during the last year of said tenancy, and after the season of summer excursions for that year had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ended, the defendant went to the said Debilius and asked him what he was going to do with the place, and that the said Debilius told him that he did not want the place any longer, as he was making nothing at it; that defendant then asked him if he could not get some society to take it; to which Debilius replied, that he did not think he could, and. then told the defendant that he would keep the place and take care of it, and give him, the defendant, $10 per day for every day it was used, and the defendant agreed to this arrangement, and that the same was to go into effect in the following summer, or after the expiration of said lease, and that the said Debilius took charge of the place, and was in possession thereof under this verbal arrangement on the 23rd of July, 1883, when the disaster described by tlie witnesses occurred. And if the jury shall further find from the evidence, that at the time the said new verbal agreement was made, one of the said bridges or piers had become unsafe and in a dangerous condition by reason of the stringers or timbers thereof, or some of them, having become rotten with dry rot, and continued in such rotten and unsafe condition down to the time of the disaster aforesaid; and if the jury shall further find from the evidence, that the defendant, at the time said verbal arrangement was made, knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known, of the rotten and unsafe condition of said bridge and failed to repair the same ; and if they further find that on the 23rd of July, 1883, there was an excursion to the said place by people from Baltimore going to the same in a barge by water, and among said excursionists was Patrick Ryan, the father of the equitable plaintiff, and while he and others were passing over the said bridge or pier to reach the boat which was to take them back to Baltimore, a portion of the said bridge, to the extent of thirty or forty feet, suddenly gave way by reason of the defective and rotten condition of the timbers thereof, whereby the said Patrick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>with others, were precipitated into the water and drowned, and that said drowning was without any fault, negligence, or want of ordinary care on the part of the deceased; and if the jury shall further find that Thomas Ryan, the equitable plaintiff, was the son of the said Patrick, and was, at the time, a minor, under the age of twenty-one years, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">The defendant excepted; and after the verdict he filed a motion in arrest of judgment, and a motion for a new trial, and later a motion to remand the record of the case, <em>non obstante veredicto, to </em>the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, whence it had been transmitted, for the reason that the Circuit Court for Howard County, had no jurisdiction of the cause, inasmuch as there was no proper and legal suggestion, and no legal affidavit supporting the same, made in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, as would authorize said Circuit Court to transmit the record of the cause to the Circuit Court for Howard County, for trial. All of these motions were overruled by the Court, and judgment was entered upon the verdict The defendant appealed. He also appealed from the order of the Court, overruling the motion to remand the record of the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">The defendant filed certain special exceptions which are sufficiently noticed in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b353-7\">The cause was argued before Alvey, .0. J., Yellott, Stone, Irving, and Bryan, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-8\"><em>Talbot J. Albert, </em>and. <em>Wm.

The statute provides in a case like the present that the suit shall be brought in the name of the State for the use of the party aggrieved. This suit has been so brought, and certainly after verdict it is too^ late to urge the objection that the name of a next friend should have been inserted. The only object that could have been obtained by inserting the name of the next friend of the infant, was security for the costs to the defendant if the plaintiff failed in his suit. The next friend would have had no authority to receive the amount of the judgment, and his appearance in a case like this answers no good purpose except to be security for costs. But while that is undoubtedly so, we must not be understood to decide that it would he improper to insert the name of a <em>prochein ami </em>to the infant in a case like the present. In many instances it would be very desirable to do so. Especially in those cases where the infant was too young to make an affidavit for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Another objection urged is that the infant could not-make the suggestion and affidavit for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The infant in this case was upwards of fifteen years of age and would be presumed at that age to have under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>standing and discretion sufficient to understand what a removal of his case meant, and to make the oath required. In the light of our present Constitution, the right of removal is regarded as a very valuable one. In asking for it, the infant did not waive any rights that he had, but merely asserted and demanded his legal right. What an adult <em>prochein ami </em>could certainly have done for him, an infant who had arrived at fifteen years of age could do for himself. It might present a different question if the equitable plaintiff was of such tender years, that no presumption could arise of sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the right claimed or of an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Another objection is that the affiant did not pursue in his suggestion for removal the exact words of the Constitution in this, that the suggestion was that \u201c he believed that he could not have a fair and impartial trial,\u201d while the constitutional provision is that \u201che cannot have a fair and impartial trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The difference is' altogether immaterial. The party making the suggestion is required to verify it by his affidavit. This affidavit is that the matters in the suggestion contained are true, <em>\u201cto the best of his (the affiant\u2019s) knowledge and belief.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Taking the suggestion in the exact words prescribed by the Constitution, and the affidavit together, and they mean nothing more than that the party swears that to the best of his <em>knowledge and belief </em>he cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the Court from which he desires the removal. The suggestion and affidavit in this case mean and assei\u2019t precisely the same. In this case the word <em>belief </em>is inserted twice where once would have been sufficient, and is clearly only surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Another objection remains to he disposed of. The defendant has filed in the record certain special exceptions, as he terms them, to the Court\u2019s instruction and to certain prayers of the plaintiff for want of legally sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>dence to support them. As these prayers were rejected by the Court, and the plaintiff has not appealed, these rejected prayers are not before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Hor can we notice these so-called special exceptions as applicable to the Court\u2019s instruction, because they are not properly speaking exceptions at all. The fourth rule of the Court of Appeals, provides in the latter part of it as follows: \u201cNor shall any question arise in the Court of Appeals as to the insufficiency of evidence to support any <em>instruction actually granted, </em>unless it appear that such question was distinctly made to and decided by the Court below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The only way that a question can be made to appear to this Court, to have been made to and decided by the Court below, is by way of exception. By the uniform and continuous practice in this l\u00e1tate, a bill of exceptions must be <em>signed </em>and sealed by the Court below, before we can review it. In general the bill of exceptions itself must plainly show the point decided by the lower Court. We are particularly prohibited from examining the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a <em>granted prayer </em>or -instruction by the rule just referred to, unless it distinctly appears that such question was made to and decided by the Court below. It can only be made so to appear to us by a certificate under the hand and seal of the Judge who tried the case below.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Butrin this case there is no exception, properly speaking, to the instruction of the Court for <em>ivant of the legal sufficiency of the evidence </em>to support it. There are papers filed in the case called special exceptions on that point, but they are not signed and sealed by the Court, but by the attorneys. From aught that appears in this record the legal sufficiency of the evidence may never have been brought to the attention of the Judge, who tried the case. A paper filed in a case by the attorney unsigned and unsealed by the Judge, cannot have the force and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>effect of an exception, although, the parties may call it so. The special exception for want of evidence must he <em>within </em>the hill of exceptions and not out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">If these so-called special exceptions that are not certified to as hy the lower Court, have ever been considered by this Court, it was always in cases where no objection was urged against them. In the case at bar the objection is distinctly made and urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The correctness of the law of the Court\u2019s instruction is open for review upon the exception taken to it by the defendant, but not the legal sufficiency of the evidence up.on which it was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The end and object of this fourth rule, and the Act of 1825, upon which it was founded, were to restrict this Court to the decision of the questions decided below. It was intended to prevent surprise, and consequent injustice in the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Had the special exceptions of the defendant to the Court\u2019s instruction for want of legally sufficient evidence, been included <em>in the </em>exception, they would have been before us. As they now stand, the correctness of the instruction upon that ground is hot before us, but its correctness as a legal proposition will be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The defehdant\u2019s counsel has argued with much force that there is no legally sufficient proof of the ownership of the wharf by the defendant. The proof of ownershin of this wharf by the defendant is vital to the case of the plaintiff, as he is charged in that capacity only. We may say here that because the defendant was the owner of \u201cSparrow point \u201d farm, it does not necessarily follow that he was the owner of the wharf. There are many summer resorts in the waters of this State, as well as farms, where th\u00a7 land owners are not the owners of the wharves attached. These latter are often built and owned by steamboat companies and others, and the proprietors of the land have no interest in them except as a means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ingress and egress to and from the lands. The Act of 1862, has nothing to do with this case. The proprietor of the land bordering on the navigable waters has the <em>right </em>to make these improvements, but it is a right that he can sell or gi^e away.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">But we are precluded from a decision on that question for the reason that it is not presented to us properly in the record. Nor do any of the prayers offered by the defendant raise the question of the legal sufficiency of evidence, except the fifth which was rejected. But this prayer is restricted to the question of negligence or wrongful act. But we are not prepared to say that the case should have been taken away from the jury, for that would have been the effect of granting the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In deciding the law of this case it will not be necessary to- refer to the prayers either of the plaintiff or defendant further than we have done, as they were all rejected and the Court\u2019s own instruction was given. If that instruction covered the whole law of the case. When we say that all the prayers were rejected, we should except the fifth prayer of plaintiff, and sixth of defendant. The defendant does not of course' appeal from the granting of his own prayer, and we do not understand 'the defendant as making any serious contention against the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer, and we may therefore confine ourselves to the Court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">That instruction substantially laid down the law to be, and so instructed the jury, that if they found that the defendant was the owner of the wharf, and that he rented it out to a tenant, and <em>that at the time of the renting, </em>the wharf was unsafe, and <em>defendant hneio, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence </em>could have known, of its unsafe condition, and that the accident happened in consequence of such condition, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Of the correctness of the rule so laid down, provided the jury found the facts, we think there can be no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>doubt. The law is very tersely laid down as far back as the case of <em>Roswell vs. </em>Prior, in 12 <em>Modern R., </em>639, where the Court say : \u201c This action is well brought against the erector, for before his assignment over he was liable for all consequential damages; and it shall not be in his power to discharge himself by granting it over.\u201d There are many cases to the same effect, but it will be sufficient for us to cite the case of <em>Owings vs. </em>Jones, 9 Md., 108, where the Court adopt this rule laid , down in 56 <em>E. C. L. R., </em>784:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201c Where the owner leases premises which are a nuisance, or must in the nature of things become so by their user, and receives rent, then, whether, in or out of possession he is liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A wharf, furnishing the only mode of ingress and egress to a summer resort, where crowds were invited to come, if in an unsafe and dangerous condition is certainly a nuisance of the worst character. It will not do for the owner, knowing its condition, or having by the exercise of any reasonable care the means of knowning it, to rent it out and receive rent for it, but escape all liability when the crash comes. He who solicits and invites the public to his resorts, must have them in a reasonably safe condition, and not in a condition to risk the lives and limbs of his visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This question has been much discussed in the Courts of New York. <em>Swords vs. Edgar, </em>59 <em>N. Y., </em>28, was a case very much like the present. There the Court decided that if the owner of a pier had leased it, and at the time of the demise, and delivery of posession to the lessee, it was in an unsafe and defective condition, and afterwards while in the possession of the lessee, an injury happens to one lawfully on the pier, the lessor is liable. 'This decision has not been overruled in that State. The case of <em>Edwards vs. N. Y. and H. R. R. Co., </em>98 <em>N. Y., </em>245, is very different from <em>Swords vs. Edgar, </em>and in commenting upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the latter case the Court says, \u201cIt is one where liability was imposed upon the lessor of a public dock, upon the ground that he had suffered a nuisance in his dock before the demise, and he was held liable on that ground. And the ground of nuisance is the only one upon which that decision can stand. There are similar cases in New England and England. A dock is regarded as a species of public highway, and the owner who suffers a nuisance to he created and continued upon his dock, remains liable upon the ground of nuisance.\u201d The case in 98 N. <em>Y., </em>was this: The defendant rented a hall for the purpose of giving in it a pedestrian exhibition. A gallery broke down during the exhibition and injured the plaintiff. The Court held that in the absence of evidence tending to show that the defendant knew, or had reason to suppose, that there was some defect in the gallery, or that it was of insufficient strength to hold the number of people who could be contained therein, or that it would be used in such a way as to endanger its security, the plaintiff could not recover. The gallery had been divided into boxes, which were filled with chairs and tables, and had been used for festivals, &amp;c. But the lessee had removed the chairs and tables, and a turbulent crowd had filled the gallery, and in stamping and beating time to the music, they broke it down. There was no evidence whatever that the lessor knew, or could have known, that it was to be so used, and he was held not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We cannot perceive any inconsistency in this case with <em>Swords vs. Edgar. </em>We have referred to them at some length because they were pressed in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">But in any event, we think the case of <em>Owings vs. Jones, </em>9 <em>Md., </em>108, a controlling authority, based as we think it is upon sound reason, and we think it may be held as well settled in this State, that where the owner of a wharf leases or rents it out, and at the time of such renting the wharf was in an unsafe condition for the use that the lessor knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>it was to be put, and that the owner knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known of its condition, and that one who was lawfully on the wharf, and was injured in consequence of its condition, that the owner is liable.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b361-7\">(Decided 4th January, 1887.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">This was substantially the instruction of the Court, and ,the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
