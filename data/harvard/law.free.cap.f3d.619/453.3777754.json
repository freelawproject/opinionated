EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">In this petition for review from the Departmental Appeals Board of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d), Petitioner Cedar Lake Nursing Home (\u201cCedar Lake\u201d) challenges a $5,000 per-instance civil monetary penalty levied by the DHHS against Cedar Lake for violations of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h). We reject Petitioner\u2019s challenge and DISMISS the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Cedar Lake is a nursing home that participates in the Medicare program. On February 20, 2008, a resident of Cedar Lake designated in the record as \u201cResident # 10\u201d \u2014 a 92 year-old woman suffering from a variety of ailments \u2014 wandered away from the facility and was later discovered walking alone along a highway. Witnesses alerted Cedar Lake staff, who returned her to the facility. Cedar Lake\u2019s alarm system, designed to prevent such \u201celopements\u201d by residents, did not sound when Resident # 10 opened the door to leave the facility. Cedar Lake alleges through witness testimony that the alarm did not sound because an installation contractor responsible for installing a new alarm system disconnected the old system without informing Cedar Lake personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">After this incident, surveyors affiliated with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Division (\u201cCMS\u201d) of the DHHS conducted a survey of Cedar Lake and determined the facility to be in violation of several Medicare-related regulations, including 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h), which requires a nursing home to \u201censure that \u2014 (1) the resident environment remains as free of accident hazards as is possible; and (2) each resident receives adequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d Specifically, the surveyors found that Cedar Lake violated 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h) with respect to Resident # 10\u2019s elopement incident. In response to these findings, CMS imposed a $5,000 per-instance civil monetary penalty on Cedar Lake for violations of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Cedar Lake appealed this decision to an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and requested a hearing. After briefing, CMS moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the undisputed facts presented by the parties showed that Cedar Lake failed to take all reasonable steps to provide Resident #10 with supervision adequate to prevent her elopement in violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">In ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the ALJ considered Cedar Lake\u2019s main factual presentation: affidavits by two Cedar Lake employees testifying that the alarm\u2019s failure to sound upon Resident # 10\u2019s departure was unforesee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>able because the installation contractor had failed to inform Cedar Lake that the alarm had been disconnected. Accepting this testimony as true, the ALJ concluded that the remainder of the undisputed facts showed that Resident # 10\u2019s elopement was foreseeable and that Cedar Lake did not reasonably provide Resident # 10 with enough supervision to prevent her wandering from the facility. <em>See Cedar Lake Nursing Home, </em>D.A.B. No. CR1967, at 7-8 (June 24, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The ALJ\u2019s findings of undisputed fact included the following: that Resident # 10 \u201chad a history of wandering, was at high risk for elopement, and repeatedly attempted to leave the facility\u201d; that Cedar Lake\u2019s care plan for Resident # 10 required staff to place the resident in an area \u201cwhere constant observation is possible\u201d; and that the facility\u2019s care plan amendments for Resident # 10 included frequent observation in addition to the use of a door alarm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. On the basis of these undisputed factual findings, the ALJ determined that Cedar Lake failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent Resident # 10\u2019s elopement in violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h). The ALJ, thus, granted CMS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and upheld the $5,000 per-instance civil monetary fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Cedar Lake appealed the ALJ\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Departmental Appeals Board, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Cedar Lake now seeks review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">We have jurisdiction to review imposition of the civil monetary penalty against Cedar Lake pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e). <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.5(c); \u00a7 498.90(a)(1) (2010). Ordinarily, review of such an administrative decision is conducted according to the deferential standards of the Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), which permits the setting aside of agency actions, findings, and conclusions that are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A)-(E) (2010); <em>see also Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994); <em>Harris County Hosp. Dist. v. Shalala, </em>64 F.3d 220, 221 (5th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Petitioner, however, asserts that we should review this case <em>de novo </em>in accord with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 because the agency decided the case on a motion for summary judgment without having an evidentiary hearing. Petitioner cites a opinion from the Sixth Circuit in which the court conducted <em>de novo </em>review of a summary judgment appealed through the same DHHS process. <em>See Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>373 F.3d 743, 750 (6th Cir.2004). In that case, the Sixth Circuit applied <em>de novo </em>review without expressly considering whether deferential review under the APA was the more appropriate standard. <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s assertion that we should apply <em>de novo </em>review is ultimately unavailing for the reasons discussed by Judge Posner in his recent opinion in <em>Fal-Meridian, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, </em>604 F.3d 445 (7th Cir.2010). <em>Fal-Meridian </em>was an appeal, very similar to present one, in which the DHHS Departmental Appeals Board approved summary judgment imposing a $7,100 civil monetary penalty on a nursing home for violations of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h), the same regulation at issue here. Carefully addressing the proper standard of review, Judge Posner wrote that \u201c[t]he absence of an evidentiary hearing does not alter the standard of judicial review of administrative decisions, set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449-50. Judge Posner noted that giving heightened deference to administrative decisions is appropriate, even on appeal from summary judgment, because agencies have particular subject-matter experience and expertise and \u201care given more decisional latitude by legislatures than trial courts are .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>This holding is consistent with opinions of other circuit courts concerning judicial review of decisions made without evidentiary hearings by agencies other than the DHHS. <em>Id. </em>at 449 (citing <em>Gibson v. SEC, </em>561 F.3d 548, 552-53 (6th Cir.2009); <em>Martex Farms, S.E. v. E.P.A., </em>559 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009); <em>Hasan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>545 F.3d 248, 250-51 (3d Cir.2008); <em>Cogeneration Ass\u2019n v. FERC, 525 </em>F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (D.C.Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We find Judge Posner\u2019s reasoning in <em>Fal-Meridian </em>persuasive. Thus, we review this petition consistent with the deferential standards of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A)-(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Reviewing the findings and conclusions at issue here under the deferential standards of the APA, we do not consider them to be arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The ALJ determined that Cedar Lake\u2019s actions with respect to Resident # 10 were in violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(l)-(2), which require a nursing facility to ensure that the resident environment remains as free of accident hazards \u201cas is possible\u201d and that each resident receives \u201cadequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d The standard of care imposed by these \u201cas is possible\u201d and \u201cadequate supervision\u201d regulations has been consistently interpreted by the DHHS and federal courts as a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard. <em>See Fal-Meridian, </em>604 F.3d at 449; <em>Crestview, </em>373 F.3d at 754; <em>Woodstock Care Center v. Thompson, </em>363 F.3d 583, 589-90 (6th Cir.2003); <em>see also Kenton Healthcare, LLC, </em>D.A.B. No. CR1666, at 5 (Sept. 28, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Based on specific, undisputed findings of fact, the ALJ determined and the Departmental Appeals Board affirmed that Cedar Lake\u2019s actions with respect to Resident # 10 were not reasonable under the standard of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h), in that Cedar Lake did not take all reasonable steps to prevent her from wandering out of the facility. The ALJ\u2019s undisputed findings of fact in support of this determination include not only the February 20, 2008 incident in which Resident # 10 wandered away from the facility, but also Resident # 10\u2019s history of wandering, Cedar Lake\u2019s prior knowledge of Resident # 10\u2019s propensity to wander, and Cedar Lake\u2019s previous development of a care plan that involved frequent observation and other measures designed to prevent Resident # 10 from wandering. <em>See Cedar Lake Nursing Home, </em>D.A.B. No. CR1967, at 7-8 (June 24, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Moreover, the primary facts presented by Cedar Lake, even when taken as true by the ALJ, failed to alter these core factual findings. Indeed, the ALJ accepted as true Cedar Lake\u2019s main factual presentation \u2014 affidavits by employees testifying to the effect that the installation contractor did not inform Cedar Lake that the alarm was to be turned off \u2014 but held that such facts did not show that Resident # 10\u2019s elopement was unforeseeable nor demonstrate that Cedar Lake\u2019s actions were reasonable under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h). <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-21\">These findings and conclusions of the ALJ and the Departmental Appeals Board with regard to the unreasonableness of Cedar Lake\u2019s safety and supervision measures under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h) are not arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance to the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. Therefore, this petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. The first ALJ assigned to hear the case, Jose A. Anglada, denied CMS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but this decision was vacated by the second ALJ assigned to the case, Carolyn Cozad Hughes, after the ALJ Anglada left the agency. All references to \u201cthe ALJ\u201d are to ALJ Hughes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. The ALJ considered Cedar Lake's argument \u2014 which it repeats on this petition for review \u2014 that facts derived from Cedar Lake\u2019s internal, privileged documents cannot form the basis for a summary judgment motion. But the ALJ concluded that enough of these undisputed facts existed \"wholly independent\u201d of Cedar Lake's purportedly privileged documents to support summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\">. Similarly, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e) states that \"findings of the Secretary [of the DHHS] with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
