The justice having given judgment for the plaintiff, the proceedings were removed by certiorari into the Court of Common Pleas, at the instance of the defendant. The writ of certiorari was issued April 16th 1870.

The defendant appears by his counsel and objects to the justice trying the case, for the reason that the title to the land and tenement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>question is disputed and will be involved in the trial of the case, on oath in due form of law; and he further saith that McGinniss was not quietly and peaceably possessed of said premises or any part thereof.

Walters had entered into the possession thereof' by virtue of said demise, and that during the continuance of said lease, and by the permission of the said-John D. Walters, a certain A. J. Vernon entered into possession and became a tenant of the said demised premises. That the said term being ended, after demand by the said Johnson McGinniss to the said John D. Walters to remove from the said premises,, three months before the application in this behalf to the said justice, the said John D. Walters- had refused, and the said A. J. Vernon, the tenant holding under said Walters, still refuses to'comply with said request, and the said justice.did enter judgment against the said A. J. Vernon for the sum of . damages for the unjust detention of said premises, together with $4.40 costs, &amp;c. * * * These are to command you forthwith do deliver possession to said Johnson McGinniss,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">The certiorari to the justice was not allowed by a judge of the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">In the Court of Common Pleas the defendant filed these exceptions:\u2014 '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">The proceedings are irregular and defective in being commenced by summons instead of information or complaint verified by oath or aflSrmation averring the following alleged facts:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">1.

Which -said writ of certiorari, was a supersedeas of all further proceedings by the said justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">The court (Gilmore, P. J.) delivered the following opinion</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">\u201c The 1st exception is not sustained. The proceedings were properly commenced by summons as authorized by the act; no oath or affidavit was required as a foundation for the summons. It is true, the summons is defective in not setting forth the subject of the complaint. It is more in th'e nature of a s\u00fammoiis or writ in ejectment than a complaint to obtain possession by a landlord against a'tenant upon an expired lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">\u201c We fully sustain the 2d exception, and this we do without exacting \u2018unattainable precision from the magistrate.\u2019 But we must have some substance, and upon this record there is neither form or substance. It is only by reference to other matters, and that subsequent to the making of the record, that we know it is a proceeding by- landlord against tenant under the Act of 14th December 1863. No lease'is stated, when it began or whether it ever ended-. It did not appear that three months\u2019 notice of .intention was given by the landlord to the tenant, or whether any notice whatsoever had been given. The whole record is bare of all substance, so much so as to render it about a nullity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">\u201c The 4th and 5th exceptions are not sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-13\">\u201cAnd now, July 12th 1870, these proceedings are reversed and wholly set as\u2019ide at the costs of the def\u00e9ndant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-14\">On the 27th of September 1870, the plaintiff moved to quash 'the certiorari, because it was not allowed by one of the judges \u00f3f the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-15\">The motion was-overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-16\">The plaintiff removed the case to the Supreme Court, and there 'assigned for error \u2014 reversing the-justice\u2019s proceedings, and refusing to quash the certiorari.'</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-17\"><em>D.

Playford), </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzB\">The Act of 1863, unlike the Act of 1772, does not require justices to make a record of their findings. Strict pre cisi\u00f3n is not required of justices of the peace: Snyder <em>v. </em>Carfrey, 4 P. F. Smith 93; Harris <em>v. </em>Levin, 1 Id. 412. A special allocatur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>is necessary to a certiorari to a iustice: Benner <em>v. </em>Ducoing, 1 P. A. Brown 217.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ASY\">January 3d 1871,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-6\"><em>E. Campbell </em>(with whom were <em>Roddy &amp; Darly), </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH5M\">The justice must set out facts sufficient to show his jurisdiction: Rich <em>v. </em>Keyser, 4 P. F. Smith 87; Snyder <em>v. </em>Carfrey, Id. 93. Quashing the writ was in the discretion of the court below, and cannot be reviewed: Renninger <em>v. </em>Thompson, 6 S. &amp; R. 1; Skidmore <em>v. </em>Bradford, 4 Barr 296. The Constitution, Art. 5, \u00a7 8, does not require the allowance of a judge to a certiorari. The Act of April 26th 1855 dispenses with it: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Willow Grove Turnpike, 2 Binn. 263.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A3e\">by Thompson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY_\">The judgment of a justice of the peace or alderman in proceedings under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1863 rests upon an inquest of facts to be found by him: Bedford <em>v. </em>Kelly, 11 P. F. Smith 491; and these must be set forth on his docket, or by a reference therein to the complaint, in order to sustain the judgment if given for the landlord. The demise, the term, that it is fully ended, and that the required notice of the landlord\u2019s desire to have and repossess the demised premises, must appear by the record to be found by the magistrate: Givens <em>v. </em>Miller, 12 P. F. Smith 133. As already said, these may be.found by a reference by the magistrate to the complaint, if it be full enough. It would, however, be better to set out all these facts on the record. Here they do not appear as found anywhere, either by the record of the judgment, or by reference to the complaint preceding the summons; indeed, no complaint in writing appears to have been filed as the ground for the summons; and for this reason, or some other, the summons issued was almost in the common form of justice\u2019s process, This was wrong also. The summons should always contain a brief statement of the grounds of its issuance. We might not be disposed to reverse for the defective summons in this' case, as there was. an appearance ; but the record of the justice was entirely defective in not setting out the inquest of facts already noticed as required by the Act of Assembly. Special jurisdictions must contain on their face everything necessary to. show that they are' not transcended. For these reasons, the judgment of the court below which reversed the proceedings before the justice must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">There is no constitutional requirement that the judges of the Courts of Common Pleas must allow writs of certiorari to justices of the peace. Sect. 8 of Art. V. of the Constitution gives them the power to do so, but the Act of 26th April 1855 dispenses with the necessity for. doing it, and this act operating as a remedy merely, is beyond doubt constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
