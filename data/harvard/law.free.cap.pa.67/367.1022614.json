G. Dallas, a lunatic: No. 230, to January Term 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">The appeal was by Alfred Elwyn, committee, &amp;c., of the lunatic, from the decree of the court confirming the report of the auditor on the account of the committee. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">The following facts found by the auditor were agreed by the parties to be correct':\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">Alfred Elwyn, the appellant, is the committee of the estate of Francis G. Dallas, a lunatic.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">On the 21st of May 1866, Olive M. Devoe, administratrix, &amp;e., of Giles H. Devoe, obtained a judgment in the District Court against said Dallas (who appeared by his committee) for $1172.71, on a promissory note given by him before he became insane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">The account of the committee was filed in the Common Pleas, August 27th 1866. The lunatic is an officer in the navy, and is entitled to half-pay, $1000 per annum, while in the hospital for the insane, and has no other estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-11\">When the lunatic was first affected, it appeared he had a sister who was bedridden and helpless, and whojn he had always maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-12\">The court ordered an allowance of $20 per month, or $240 per annum, to be paid her by the committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-13\">The account as filed showed a balance of $248.97, in the hands of the committee after the payment of all sums due for boarding and clothing of the lunatic, and the allowance for the support of his sister to said date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-14\">This balance was reduced by expenses of audit, &amp;c., to $161.22, which the auditor awarded to Mrs. Devoe, the judgment-creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-15\">Whether the said balance in the hands of the committee was liable to be applied towards the payment of the judgment is the only question raised by this appeal. It was composed of funds received from the half-pay, and there was no other estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-16\">The court confirmed the report, but delivered no opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-17\">Elwyn appealed to the Supreme' Court, and assigned for error: that the court erred in confirming the report of the auditor, awarding the balance, viz., $161.22, remaining in the hands of the committee, to the judgment-creditor of the lunatic.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-18\">R. <em>C. McMurtrie, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXU\">The points are, that the fund being the pay of an officer of the government is not liable to be taken by creditors, and that the party was entitled to $300 under the <em>\u201c </em>exemption laws,\u201d being more than the balance. As to the 1st he cited Davis <em>v. </em>Duke of Marlborough, 1 Swanston 79; Flarty <em>v. </em>Odlum, 3 T. R. 681; Fenton <em>v. </em>Lowther, 1 Cox 315; McCarthy <em>v. </em>Goold, 1 Ball &amp; Beatty 387; Stone <em>v. </em>Lidderdale, 2 Anstruther 538; Act of April 15th 1845, \u00a7 5, Pamph. L. 460, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Purd. 435, pl. 33. The court will not order money to a lunatic\u2019s creditors till his comfort is provided for.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AFTT\">February 27th 1871,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\"><em>J. B. Gest, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2n\">The committee must apply the income to payment of the lunatic\u2019s debts (Act of June 13th 1836, \u00a7 20, Pamph. L. 596, Purd. 632, pl. 20) as they existed at the time of the inquisition: Wright\u2019s Appeal, 8 Barr 57; Yaple <em>v. </em>Titus, 5 Wright 195.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"ADN\">by Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOe\">We think this case is governed by the Act of 13th June 1836, relating to lunatics. The 20th and 21st sections direct that the committee^shall have the management of the real and personal estate of the lunatic, and shall from time to time apply so much of the income thereof as shall be necessary to the payment of his just debts and engagements, and the support and maintenance of himself and his family, and the education of his minor children; and if the income be not sufficient, shall under the directions of the court, apply so much of the principal of his personal estate as shall be necessary for the purpose. The distribution of the surplus of $161.22 therefore did no more than the law allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">It may be admitted that the .half-pay of an officer of the government is not liable to be taken by creditors under any form of process \u2014 by levy, sale, attachment or sequestration. The authorities cited are to this effect. Being intended as a means of subsistence, it will not be permitted to be diverted. Like the provision of a parent in the hands of a trustee for a minor or lunatic child, it cannot be intercepted by others. But when the half-pay has reached the beneficiary, and has lost its distinctive character, and when as money it is in a proper sense, as here, a distributable fund lying in the hands of the law, it is to be governed by the direction of the law. Consequently a surplus not needed for the prime purpose of subsistence (as is found here) may be applied with the sanction of the court, which has the custody of the lunatic, to the payment of his debts. There is nothing which would prevent the lunatic himself from so doing, were he in his sound mind. His future pay may not be alienated by assignment, as it certainly cannot be intercepted by creditors <em>in </em>invitum, but money in possession may be disposed of at his will. Why then should the court be disabled, after a sufficient provision made for him, from ordering payment of a surplus to a just debt? The sum allowed for the support of his sister, who is not of his family, but for whom h\u00e9 himself had provided, would be liable to a similar objection, and yet it was not excepted to by the committee. Of course we are to presume from the finding of the auditor and the approval of the court,'that these sums were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>in excess of the provision necessary for the lunatic; otherwise the court looking to the source of the income as half-pay, and as a provision made by the <em>parens patriae </em>for the officer\u2019s maintenance, would not allow its diversion to the prejudice of the lunatic. The same reasons dispose of the claim set up under the $300 law. The allowance to the creditor here is the act of the court by the hands of its committee; and not a seizure by adverse process. The decree of the Court of Common Pleas is affirmed and the costs ordered to be paid out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
