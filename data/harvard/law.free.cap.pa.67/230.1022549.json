D. 1859, when the first payment should be made; that on the 1st of April 1859, as agreed, the defendant paid to John F. Dravo, the plaintiff\u2019s son, who was his partner in business and agent of the plaintiff, the sum of five hundred dollars, as per agreement, and that defendant, in pursuance of said contract, was delivered possession of said house and lot by said plaintiff, or his agent for that purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>John P.

Defendant offers to prove the admissions of the plaintiff that he received the said money and lumber, knowing the same to be a part of the purchase-money of said house and lot; that from and after the 1st day of April, A. D. 1859, the said house and lot were duly assessed to the defendant as his property, and he paid the taxes on the same to the present time, and he has made valuable improvements on the property, and all this done with full knowledge of the plaintiff; that the plaintiff and his son, John P. Dravo, were partners, carrying on the coal business within a mile of said house and lot, at and before and several years after said parol sale; that after said sale, and some three or four years after defendant went into possession, the plaintiff in this case, on application of the defendant, agreed for a valuable consideration to extend the time of payment of the balance of the purchase-money under said contract for one year from that date, and that within that time, and before said year expired, the said defendant did tender to the said plaintiff the full amount of the balance of the said purchase-money under said contract, and interest, which the plaintiff refused because, as he said, the property had increased in value, and he ought to have more money; that at the time of the parol purchase the plaintiff was in possession of said property by his tenant, Mr. Penny; that plaintiff notified Mr. Penny to vacate on the 1st of April 1859, in order to give possession to the defendant, in pursuance of said parol contract; that all of the facts before stated were well and fully known to said plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">The defendant, in connection with his other offers, further offered to prove \u201cin connection with the fact that the plaintiff has testified in this case that he'was in possession of said premises by his tenant, Mr. Penny, at the time of the sale in this case, that Mr. Penny went out of possession on the 1st day of April 1859, and that defendant went, into possession under his contract of purchase from plaintiff\u2019s agent, John P. Dravo, and that his agent did, within a month or less after the date, pay over to him the said money paid on account of purchase-money; that plaintiff authorized his son, John P. Dravo, by parol to make the said sale, and that after said sale was agreed upon, as stated in the other offers, the plaintiff, or his agent for that purpose, put the defendant in possession, in pursuance of said agreement, and plaintiff received all the purchase-money paid, to wit, $860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">\u201c That plaintiff has admitted when fully advised of all the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and all the terms of the sale, that he had fully authorized and consented to all the terms of the sale made hy his said agent, and that he did not now claim to recover in this action on the ground that he did not agree to the original sale as negotiated by his son, but claimed to recover on <em>the </em>ground that three or four years ago, after said sale, the defendant agreed by parol to give up his rights under said sale and become his tenant, and that the payments made were to be applied as rent. That the defendant, while in possession, made valuable improvements, and that the plaintiff admitted at least four years ago that he knew the defendant had been making from time to time since he went into possession, valuable improvements on the property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">The defendant further offered in evidence <em>\u201c </em>a paper dated January 1st 1869, signed M. Dravo &amp; Sons, being a notice to defendant\u2019s tenants to quit possession, to be followed with evidence that this plaintiff commenced a judicial proceeding before A. S. Nicholson, Esq., an alderman of this city, to dispossess the said defendant of the property in dispute, and that this notice he made the ground of that proceeding. Defendant will also offer the evidence of said Alderman Nicholson that said proceeding was commenced by the plaintiff on the affidavit of plaintiff; also, the papers and all the proceedings in that case before said alderman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">\u201c The object of the offer is to show that this plaintiff acted in regard to the ownership of this property under the name of M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS2\">If the writing found on the paper-book of plaintiff in error was insufficient to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, there was abundant in the testimony offered and rejected by the court, to have done so, viz.: a contract of sale by parol was offered to be proved, delivery of possession pursuant thereto, part payment of the purchase-money, and valuable improvements made. This was all offered, and was the full measure of all that ever was required by any case to take the sale out of the operation of the Statute of Frauds. Nay more, the balance of the purchase-money was tendered and refused before suit brought. If this was not sufficient to take the case out of the statute, all our decisions on the subject are in error, and no case will ever arise in which any sale will be good without writing; yet we have, in very many instances, held sales by parol, partly executed, good. The cases in which this has been held are too numerous to be cited here. The cases of Richards <em>v. </em>Ellwell, 12 Wright 361; McGibbeney <em>v. </em>Burmaster, 3 P. F. Smith 332; and Lauer <em>v. </em>Lee, 6 Wright 171, among the many in our reports, are sufficiently instructive of what is necessary to avoid the influence of the Statute of Frauds; but if others be required, there is a bead-roll of them cited in these cases. That there was error in the rejection of each and every of the offers made below, and in the direction to the jury to find for the plaintiff, we have not a shadow of doubt, and therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
