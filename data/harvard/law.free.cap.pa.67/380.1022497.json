Scott in favor of Slack, and by him endorsed. The name of Kirk, however, is written above Slack\u2019s. And if we could look no further, could see nothing that does not appear upon the paper, we would be compelled to regard him as having endorsed irregularly (before Slack). And then, according to the doctrine of Taylor <em>v. </em>McCune and the cases following it, we would have to hold that he is under no obligation to the bank, inasmuch as the payee\u2019s name was not written above. But if we may look further, and see the order in point of time, in which the paper was endorsed, we will find that while Kirk appears to have gone irregularly upon it (by endorsing prior to the payee), <em>the fact is otherwise </em>; that Slack first endorsed the paper and delivered it to one of the drawers, who in company with Kirk applied to have it discounted-, and was promised the money if he would endorse; that he did then endorse and the money was paid over. If we may thus look into the circumstances attending the execution of the paper, all appearance of irregularity will disappear, and Kirk will be seen to be the <em>second endorser. </em>In such case it will be immaterial where his name is found; the law will treat it as if in its proper place. He could not, if he designed, vary the effect of his act by selecting a particular place for his signature. But here there was no such design; the name was misplaced by mistake. Kirk himself testifies that the bank required him to endorse, as the condition on which the money would be furnished; and that he accordingly did so. That he intended to do so in the usual way and with the usual effect, cannot be doubted. Any other suggestion would be wholly inconsistent with the purpose in view. Placing his name above the payee\u2019s directly tended to defeat this purpose, for without explanation (by reference to the circumstances), it created no obligation whatever. Indeed if the defendant\u2019s position (that no explanation can be heard, that the paper alone can be looked to) is correct, it was (if designed) an act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>pure folly, for it had not the slightest effect, but left the parties precisely as they were before. It would seem to be clear therefore that the name was misplaced by mistake. But whether this is so or not, is immaterial; because if we may look at the facts and see that he was the second endorser, the law will hold him responsible as such, no matter how his name came to be misplaced.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">After stating the grounds on which he held that the facts he referred to might be considered, he concluded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">\u201c In our judgment, Kirk was regularly upon the note as second endorser, and thus was liable to the bank.

The note upon which this question arises was drawn by T. and J. P. Scott, to the order of Timothy Slack, and endorsed by. James S. Kirk, first in the order of position on the hack of the note, and next by Slack, the payee. The note was discounted by the National Bank of Oxford for the benefit of the drawers, who after-wards failed to pay, except a part. The bank then collected one-half of the balance from Slack and the other half from Kirk, who paid voluntarily, but asserting at the same time Slack\u2019s liability to him. Then granting that, by reason of Kirk\u2019s irregular endorsement before Slack, the payee, neither Slack nor the bank could compel payment by Kirk, according to the decisions in Barto <em>v. </em>Schmeck, 4 Casey 447, Schaffer <em>v. </em>The Bank, 9 P. F. Smith 144, and Jack <em>v. </em>Morrison, 12 Wright 113, yet Slack, the payee and endorser of the note, was undoubtedly liable to the bank. He could set up neither the Statute of Frauds nor Kirk\u2019s want of liability, being the payee and regular endorser of the note as to the bank. He could not object, therefore, to payment to any transferee of the bank, or to any one rightfully paying the note, and entitled to substitution to the rights of the bank. Kirk, as irregular endorser, was the only party having a right to set up the Statute of Frauds, for his was the only parol agreement. But if, as an irregular endorser, liable only' upon his verbal promise to be answerable to the bank for the payment of the note, he chose to comply with his agreement, who can object? Certainly not Slack, for the payment enured to his benefit, if Kirk was liable to him; and if not, it was a matter of indifference to him whether he should pay the bank or some one else who bo-, came entitled to the note. The statute was made for the proteo-. tion of a party alleged to have made a verbal assumption, to be answerable for the debt or default of another; but if he admits his promise, and does not ask the shield of the statute, it does not compel him to be dishonest. Clearly Kirk had a right to pay if he would: and paying, he is entitled in equity to be subrogated to the rights of the bank, unless Slack can show that Kirk had also agreed to be liable to him for payment by the drawers. This promise, though not enforceable <em>against </em>Kirk, by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the statute, probably would be a defence to Slack. What right, \u25a0 'then, has Slack to object-to Kirk-fulfilling any promise he had made to the bank to be answerable for payment of the- note ? Clearly he had none by reason of the face of the paper, Kirk being an irregular endorser and not liable to him, according to the cases before, cited. There was amoral obligation on the part of Kirk to perform his promise to pay the bank, and this, followed by actual payment, constitutes his equity, and entitles him to substitution. If Slack claims protection against Kirk by reason of a promise to indemnify him,- he must make proof of it; otherwise, why should he have' any defence to Kirk, standing in, the room of the bank? If it be objected that the irregular endorsement by Kirk will not in itself enable him' to maintain the-suit, it might be answered by saying that the action is amendable, and the name of the bank can be used for his benefit. But what is to hinder Kirk\u2019s action ? On paying the note to the bank, he is entitled to delivery of it, and can claim as a holder under Slack\u2019s blank endorsement. His own name being irregularly endorsed before Slack can of itself make no. difference, for he is not liable to Slack upon that endorsement, according to Barto <em>v. </em>Schmeek and Schaffer <em>v. </em>The Bank, the presumption being.that he was intended'to be the second endorser, and it was Slack\u2019s own wrong to endorse below him. To escape this Slack must resort to proof. But if we resort to the parol evidence in this ease the same result follows. It shows that'Kirk never did assume the position of first endorser 'intentionally, and that his name was written above Slack\u2019s by inadvertence or mistake. The note was brought to him by the drawer, with Slack\u2019s endorsement already on it, and without an intimation that he should assume the position of first endorser. He went to the bank with the drawer to assist him in having it discounted and without having endorsed it; and it was \u25a0 only when the bank refused the discount without his name that he endorsed the name. The order of his endorsement, it is evident, was unnoticed, or its effect unknown, as it tended rather-to jeopard the security of the bank than to increase it. As the ease.stood, therefore, this evidence did not alter the relation of Slack to the bank, who had regularly endorsed the note as the payee, nor did \u25a0 it give him any recourse against Kirk. In either aspect, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the money paid by him to the bank, the payment not being voluntary in the sense of a payment by a mere volunteer, but being made on the footing of a promise to pay and an endorsement of the note. Having waived the protection of the statute, and honestly paid the bank according to his undertaking, he has. a right to use the name of the bank, or to sue in his own name to recover the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
