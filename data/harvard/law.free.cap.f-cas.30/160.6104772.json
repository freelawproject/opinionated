The bond was given about twenty years ago, and the title was to be made .so soon as grants should issue. It did not appear that the defendant had any such land on the waters of Stone\u2019s river. The only question was as to the measure of damages: whether it should be the value of the land at the time the bond was given, when grants were obtained, or at this time. The jury found a special verdict. That neither at the time of the contract, when grants issued, nor at any time since, has the defendant had such land as the bond calls for. That such land at the time the bond was given, and when grants should have issued, was worth, with the interest thereupon, $340, and at this time $1040.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-17\">Overton, for defendant, said he was prepared with authorities to show that judgment\u2019 .ought to pass for the lesser sum. The special verdict does not find fraud, and the court cannot presume it See 3 Johns. 281; 1 Johns. 551; 1 Caines, 379; 7 Johns. 603. If fraud had been found by the verdict it would not be contended that the larger sum ought not to be the measure of damages.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-18\">PER CPRIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">The jury have found that the defendant had not the land he contracted to convey; in-contemplation of law it was therefore a fraud. If the defendant had such land as he has attempted to prove (though he had not a legal title to it), if he offered to show land, to which he was entitled by contract for locating, by showing this he may perhaps have relief in equity; but, it having been found by the jury that he had no title, there must be judgment for the value of the land as it was estimated at this time.
