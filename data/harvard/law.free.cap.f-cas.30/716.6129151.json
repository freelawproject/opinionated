After this suit was entered in the state court, and before a declaration was filed, the defendant filed his petition, praying that. the cause might be removed into this court, which was directed accordingly. On an appearance being entered in this court, the plaintiff filed a declaration, and laid his damages at one thousand dollars. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-27\">Mr. Rawle showed cause, and relied upon the damages in the declaration, as being sufficient to maintain the jurisdiction of this court. It was answered by Mr. Lewis, for the plaintiff, that the sum really demanded is less than five hundred dollars, as is admitted by the plaintiff on the record.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b724-28\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AxMd\">The state court was not bound to grant the petition for removal, unless it was satisfied, that the sum in dispute amounted to five hundred dollars. Having done so, it follows, that that court was so satisfied. In this court the plaintiff has laid his damages at five hundred dollars, which is sufficient for the jurisdiction of this court, and it cannot be ousted by the plaintiff\u2019s releasing so much of his demand, as to reduce it below that sum. Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
