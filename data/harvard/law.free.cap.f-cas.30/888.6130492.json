It is not legal in the jury to allow damages, so that they will defeat the right .of the party to interest on a debt ascertained;- and damages are to be credited by the jury, on the day of their verdict, and are not so to be considered by them, as that, by depriving a party of interest on a debt due, they are made to bear interest, in fa-vour of the person to whom they may be allowed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b896-19\">[Cited in brief in Harrison v.

In this way, they have not only allowed interest on the damages, but have made the rate of interest twelve per cent.; interest at that rate, having been slopped upon so much, of the note given by the defendants, as this credit amounted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">A new trial must therefore be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
