PI. 491); they are dilatory, not reaching the merits of the action, and are not amendable; the plaintiff need not demur thereto when bad, but may treat them as nullities and sign judgment. 1 Tidd, Prae. 5S8. Tested by these rules, a plea in abatement which avers the suing out a former writ for the same cause, that it is still remaining in the clerk\u2019s office, that the defendant was arrested on such writ and surrendered to a person who represented himself to be deputy sheriff, that the suit is still pending, as defendant believes, and concluding with a verification, is destitute of requisite precision and formal accuracy, and does not tender a certain issue. What issue is tendered? Is it the suing out of the writ; its existence in the clerk\u2019s office; the arrest or surrender of the defendant, or the fact that T. was deputy sheriff, or that he represented himself to be such; that the suit is still pending, or that the defendant believes it to be pending? Such a plea\u2019 is clearly insufficient, and may be treated as a nullity. Where it appears to the appellate court that improper evidence has been admitted on the trial of an issue in the inferior court, yet if upon the whole record the judgment is right, it will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
