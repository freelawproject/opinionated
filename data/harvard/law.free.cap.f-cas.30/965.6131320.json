Upon the calling of the cause, Bell moved to dismiss the appeal, and this motion was sustained.</p> <p id=\"b973-36\" pgmap=\"973(8) 974(110)\">From the bill of exceptions, it is apparent that the court acted under a misapprehension of the fact that an appeal had been prayed by Billingsley on the day of trial. Such being the fact, the court erred, for the law is express that notice to the opposite party need only be given where the appeal is not prayed on the day of trial. Geyer\u2019s Dig. 391. It has been said that, as the appeal bond was not entered into on the day of trial, the appellant could give bond within ten days. This is true, and as the bond in this instance was executed in that time, it is sufficient Geyer\u2019s Dig. 390. Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
