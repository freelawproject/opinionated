The publication of the Listing Rule triggered lawsuits by a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>organizations and individuals: (1) the State of Alaska (\u201cAlaska\u201d) <em>(State of Alaska v. Salazar,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> et al., </em>Case No. 08-1352); (2) Safari Club International and Safari Club International Foundation (\u201cSCI\u201d) <em>(Safari Club Int\u2019l, et al. v.

Salazar, et al., </em>Case No. 09-245). These five actions were consolidated before this Court, along with six related actions, pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Polar Bear Endangered Species Act Listing and 1(d) Rule Litigation, </em>Case No. 08-764, Docket No. 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Each of these plaintiffs has challenged the Listing Rule under the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531 <em>et seq., </em>and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 <em>et seq., </em>claiming that FWS\u2019s decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of agency discretion. Among other claims, plaintiff CBD contends that the decision to list the polar bear as \u201cthreatened\u201d was arbitrary and capricious because the polar bear meets the definition of an \u201cendangered\u201d species under the ESA and thus qualifies for a higher level of protection. The remaining plaintiffs (collectively, the \u201cJoint Plaintiffs\u201d) contend, among other things, that the decision to list the polar bear was arbitrary and capricious because the polar bear does not meet the definition of a threatened species and therefore does not qualify for ESA protections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Pending before the Court are the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Upon careful consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 motions, the federal defendants\u2019 and defendant-intervenors\u2019 cross-motions, the various oppositions, replies, and supplemental briefs, the relevant law, the administrative record, statements made by counsel at the hearing held on October 20, 2010, and for the reasons stated herein, the Court concludes that FWS failed to adequately explain the legal basis for its Listing Rule. The federal defendants contend that, as a matter of law, an \u201cendangered species\u201d must be in imminent danger of extinction. The Court rejects the federal defendants\u2019 erroneous conclusion that an imminence requirement is mandated by the plain meaning of the statute. Because the federal defendants failed to acknowledge ambiguities in the definition of an endangered species, this Court can neither defer to the agency\u2019s plain-meaning interpretation nor impose its own interpretation of the statute; instead the Court must remand the Listing Rule to the agency to treat the statutory language as ambiguous. <em>See Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc. v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., </em>471 F.3d 1350, 1354 (D.C.Cir.2006). The Court therefore REMANDS the Listing Rule to the agency for this limited purpose. Having found sufficient grounds to remand to the agency on this threshold issue, the Court defers ruling on the merits of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., In re Checkosky, </em>23 F.3d 452, 463 (D.C.Cir.1994) (noting that \u201creviewing courts will often and quite properly pause before exercising full judicial review and remand to the agency for a more complete explanation of a troubling aspect of the agency\u2019s decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">A. Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The ESA has been described as \u201cthe most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.\u201d <em>Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 180, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978). Congress enacted the ESA \u201cto provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, [and] to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b). \u201cThe plain intent of Congress in enacting this statute was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\u201d <em>Tennessee Valley Auth., </em>437 U.S. at 184, 98 S.Ct. 2279.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The ESA\u2019s protections are triggered when a species is designated as either \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An \u201cendangered species\u201d is \u201cany species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>significant portion of its range.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532(6). A \u201cthreatened species\u201d is \u201cany species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1532(20). The ESA requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish and maintain a list of all species that have been designated as threatened or endangered. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(e). Species are added to and removed from this list after notice and an opportunity for public comment, either on the initiative of the Secretary or as a result of a petition submitted by an \u201cinterested person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(b)(1), (3), (5). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for making listing determinations for the polar bear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.01(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">A listing determination is made on the basis of one or more of five statutorily prescribed factors: (1) present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of a species\u2019 habitat or range; (2) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting a species\u2019 continued existence. 16 U.S.C \u00a7 1533(a)(l)(A)-(E); <em>see also </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.11(c). The agency must list a species as long as \u201cany one or a combination\u201d of these factors demonstrates that it is threatened or endangered. 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.11(c). The decision to list a species must be made \u201csolely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available ... after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">B. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Polar bears are marine mammals that are described as \u201cice-obligate,\u201d meaning that they are evolutionarily adapted to sea ice for their survival and primary habitat. ARL 117216.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There are approximately 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide, distributed in approximately nineteen populations throughout the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s ice-covered regions. ARL 117216-19. Current estimates show that two of the nineteen polar bear populations are increasing in numbers, six populations are stable, and five populations are declining. ARL 117221. Insufficient data are available to identify a trend for the remaining six populations. ARL 117221.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">On February 16, 2005, plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity submitted a petition to the Secretary of the Interior to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the ESA. Petition to List the Polar Bear <em>(Ursus </em>maritimus) as a Threatened Species Under the Endangered Species Act, ARL 4040-4209. FWS issued its final rule listing the polar bear as a threatened species on May 15, 2008.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>72 Fed.Reg. 28,212. In its Listing Rule, FWS found that the projected declines in sea ice over the next several decades will significantly impact polar bear reproduction and vital rates, ultimately leading to population-level declines. ARL 117265, 117279.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Specifically, FWS found that all polar bear populations will be affected by substantial losses of sea ice within the foreseeable future (which it defined as 45 years), although different populations will be affected at different rates and to different degrees. ARL 117279.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On this basis, FWS concluded that projected habitat losses alone qualify the polar bear as a threatened species throughout its range. ARL 117281. FWS also found, however, that the polar bear is not currently endangered in any portion of its range because the species is abundant, any observed population declines have been gradual rather than precipitous, and reproduction and recruitment are still occurring in all polar bear populations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ARL 117219, 117299-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">FWS\u2019s listing decision was challenged by organizational and individual plaintiffs, as described above. Plaintiffs have identified a number of purported deficiencies in the Listing Rule, each of which forms the basis for a claim that FWS violated both the ESA and the APA. The parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment are ripe for determination by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">FWS\u2019s listing decisions are subject to review under the APA. <em>See, e.g., Am. Wildlands v. Kempthorne, </em>530 F.3d 991, 997 (D.C.Cir.2008). Under the APA, federal agency actions are to be held unlawful and set aside where they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). To make this finding, the court must determine whether the agency \u201cconsidered the factors relevant to its decision and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Keating v. FERC, </em>569 F.3d 427, 433 (D.C.Cir.2009) (citing <em>Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 87, 105, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 76 L.Ed.2d 437 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Here, the threshold question before the Court relates to FWS\u2019s interpretation of the definition of \u201cendangered species\u201d under the ESA. The framework for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>viewing an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that the agency is charged with administering is set forth in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The first step in this review process is for the court to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In determining whether the statute unambiguously expresses the intent of Congress, the court should use all the \u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction,\u201d including looking to the text and structure of the statute, as well as its legislative history, if appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also Bell Atlantic Tel. Co. v. FCC, </em>131 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C.Cir.1997). If the court concludes that the statute is either silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise question at issue, the second step of the court\u2019s review process is to determine whether the interpretation proffered by the agency is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. The court must defer to agency interpretations that are not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Court\u2019s current inquiry arises out of plaintiff CBD\u2019s claim that FWS misinterpreted and misapplied the ESA in determining that the polar bear does not qualify for \u201cendangered\u201d status. Plaintiff CBD contends that FWS\u2019s decision to list the polar bear as \u201cthreatened\u201d rather than \u201cendangered\u201d on the basis of its conclusion that the species is not facing imminent extinction throughout any portion of its range is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the best available science for the polar bear. Memorandum of Points and Authorities of Plaintiffs Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace, Inc. in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 125) (\u201cCBD Op. Mem.\u201d) at 21. In response, the federal defendants argue that the agency\u2019s determination is compelled by the plain meaning of the statute. Federal Defendants\u2019 Combined Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on Listing Rule Claims (Docket No. 137) (\u201cFD Op. Mem.\u201d) at 44; <em>see also </em>Transcript of Motions Hearing, October 20, 2010 (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 17. According to the federal defendants, the text, structure, and legislative history of the ESA plainly and unambiguously require that a species must be in imminent danger of extinction to be designated as endangered. Therefore, before reaching the merits of CBD\u2019s claim, the Court must first address the threshold question of whether the ESA clearly expresses the intent of Congress to limit the \u201cendangered\u201d classification to only those species that are in danger of imminent extinction. The federal defendants\u2019 arguments are explored below in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">As the federal defendants have conceded, Tr. at 19, the statutory definition of an \u201cendangered species\u201d does not expressly require that the species be in danger of imminent extinction. An endangered species is defined as \u201cany species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532(6). Relying on ordinary meanings alone, this provision merely requires the Secretary to determine whether a species is \u201cexposed to the harm of no longer existing.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>896 F.Supp. 1057, 1062 (D.Colo.1995) (citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>nary for definitions of \u201cextinct\u201d and \u201cdanger\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Although nothing in the text of the ESA compels the agency\u2019s conclusion that an \u201cendangered\u201d designation requires imminent extinction, a plain meaning analysis does not end with the language of the relevant provision. Instead, the Court must analyze \u201c \u2018the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Scholastic TV Programming Found, v. FCC, </em>46 F.3d 1173, 1178 (D.C.Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Fort Stewart Sch. v. FLRA </em>495 U.S. 641, 645, 110 S.Ct. 2043, 109 L.Ed.2d 659 (1990)). According to the federal defendants, the structure and context of the statute clearly demonstrate that Congress intended to reserve an \u201cendangered\u201d designation for those species that are at risk of imminent extinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">While Congress did not provide express standards for distinguishing between endangered and threatened species, it is evident from the plain language of the ESA\u2019s definitions of those terms that Congress believed the immediacy of the impact from the threat(s) facing the species was in large measure what separated an endangered species from a threatened species. While both categories are forward-looking, the phrase \u2018in danger of connotes a risk of extinction that is both substantial and immediate, whereas the terms \u2018likely\u2019 and \u2018foreseeable future\u2019 connote a risk that is comparatively lower or less imminent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">FD Op. Mem. at 44. Reading the definitions of an endangered species and a threatened species together, the federal defendants contend that the only possible difference between a threatened species and an endangered species is the temporal proximity of the threat. FD Op. Mem. at 44. Indeed, the federal defendants assert that without an imminence requirement the \u201cthreatened\u201d category becomes superfluous, Federal Defendants\u2019 Reply in Support of Their Combined Opposition to Plaintiffs Motions for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on Listing Rule Claims (Docket No. 195) (\u201cFD Reply\u201d) at 25; <em>see also </em>Tr. at 21 (\u201c[I]f you don\u2019t read imminent in there, you can\u2019t have a threatened category.\u201d), and argue that an interpretation that reads the \u201cthreatened\u201d category out of the statute violates traditional principles of statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp. v. FERC, </em>372 F.3d 395, 401 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\u201cTraditional principles of statutory construction counsel against reading acts of Congress to be superfluous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The Court agrees that there is a temporal element to the distinction between the categories of endangered and threatened species.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, on balance, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>is not persuaded that this temporal distinction compels federal defendants\u2019 conclusion that to be \u201cin danger of extinction\u201d a species must be in imminent harm. Specifically, the Court rejects the federal defendants\u2019 contention that the category of \u201cthreatened\u201d species becomes superfluous in the absence of an imminence requirement because the distinction between the \u201cthreatened\u201d and \u201cendangered\u201d categories is not based solely and unambiguously on the imminence of the species\u2019 anticipated extinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">To the contrary, the Court finds that the overall structure of the ESA suggests that the definition of an endangered species was intentionally left ambiguous. It is well-settled that Congress need not \u201csupply administrative officials with a specific formula for their guidance in a field where flexibility and the adaptation of the congressional policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute the essence of the program.\u201d <em>Lichter v. United States, </em>334 U.S. 742, 785, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948). Indeed, under the ESA, Congress broadly delegated responsibility to the Secretary to determine whether a species is \u201cin danger of extinction\u201d in light of the five statutory listing factors and the best available science for that species.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Babbitt v. Sweet Home, </em>515 U.S. 687, 708, 115 S.Ct. 2407, 132 L.Ed.2d 597 (1995) (\u201cThe task of defining and listing endangered and threatened species requires an expertise and attention to detail that exceeds the normal province of Congress.\u201d). In making that determination, the agency cannot \u201crest simply on its parsing of the statutory language [but rather it] must bring its experience and expertise to bear in light of competing interests at stake.\u201d <em>PDK Labs., Inc. v. DEA, </em>362 F.3d 786, 797-98 (D.C.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 865-66, 104 S.Ct. 2778). The definition of an \u201cendangered species\u201d is, therefore, inherently ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds nothing in the text or structure of the statute to compel the conclusion that Congress intended to bind the agency to a particular formula for determining when a species is \u201cin danger of extinction.\u201d Accordingly, the Court rejects the federal defendants\u2019 assertion that the structure of the statute clearly and unambiguously imposes a bright-line imminence requirement for all endangered species.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Even assuming the structure of the statute does not unambiguously express the intent of Congress, the federal defendants assert that the agency\u2019s plain-meaning interpretation is nonetheless compelled by the legislative history of the ESA. FD Op. Mem. at 50. As the D.C. Circuit has stated, \u201cwe may consider a provision\u2019s legislative history ... to determine whether Congress\u2019 intent is clear from the plain language of a statute.\u201d <em>City of Cleveland v. NRC, </em>68 F.3d 1361, 1366 n. 4 (D.C.Cir. 1995). Defendant-intervenor AOGA, in its opening brief, points to several specific passages that it claims express the clear intent of Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">An animal\u2019s continued existence must actually be in peril before it may be considered endangered ... The threatened list will be composed of those species which are not presently in danger of extinction, but which are likely to become endangered if protective measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>are not taken. Senate Consideration and Passage of S.1983 (July 24, 1973), <em>reprinted in </em>Comm, on Env\u2019t and Public Works, 97th Cong., A Legislative History of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as Amended in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1981, at 375 (1982) [hereinafter Legislative History].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">The bill provides a broadened concept of \u2018endangered species\u2019 by affording the Secretary the additional power to list animals which he determines are likely within the foreseeable future to become threatened with extinction.

According to the federal defendants, these passages show that Congress created the \u201cthreatened\u201d category in 1973 to allow the agency to take steps to protect a species before extinction becomes imminent. FD Reply at 22. The federal defendants infer, therefore, that the original \u201cendangered\u201d category was only intended to encompass those species at the brink of extinction. FD Reply at 22; <em>see also </em>Tr. at 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Upon careful review of the legislative history, the Court is unpersuaded by the federal defendants\u2019 contention that the legislative history unambiguously requires imminent extinction for a species to be designated as endangered. Indeed, the Court notes that the word \u201cimminent\u201d appears once in the entire legislative history, in a passage that refers only cryptically to the definition of an endangered species. Sen. Rep. No. 93-307, at 3 (1973). This single statement is not sufficient to overcome a fundamental ambiguity in the text and structure of the statute. <em>See Humane Soe\u2019y of the United States v. Kempthorne, </em>579 F.Supp.2d 7, 20 (D.D.C.2008) (Friedman, J.) (finding single inconclusive statement from the legislative history insufficient to dispel ambiguity in the ESA). Moreover, although the legislative history does emphasize that an endangered species \u201cis\u201d (currently or presently or actually) in danger of extinction, whereas a threatened species is \u201clikely to become\u201d so endangered, this basic distinction is already apparent from the text of the statute itself and does not compel a conclusion that an endangered species must be in danger of <em>imminent </em>extinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Having carefully considered the text, structure, and legislative history of the ESA, the Court is persuaded that Congress intended to allow the agency flexibility to make a case-by-case determination of when a species is \u201cin danger of extinction,\u201d based on the five statutory listing factors and the best available science for that species. Therefore, the Court finds that the ESA does not compel the federal defendants\u2019 plain-meaning interpretation that an endangered species must be in danger of imminent extinction. For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the statute is \u201csilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\u201d before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the Court. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Upon finding the definition of an endangered species to be ambiguous, the Court would normally be required to defer to any permissible agency construction of the statute under step two of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis. <em>Id. </em>In this case, however, there is no permissible construction to which the Court can defer. Counsel conceded at oral argument that the agency does not seek deference to its interpretation of the definition of an endangered species under step two of the <em>Chevron </em>test and instead relies exclusively on a plain-meaning interpretation of the ESA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Tr. at 17, 26. As <em>\u201cChevron </em>step 2 deference is reserved for those instances when an agency recognizes that the Congress\u2019s intent is not plain from the statute\u2019s face,\u201d <em>Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc., </em>471 F.3d at 1354, this Court is precluded from according the agency\u2019s interpretation deference under <em>Chevron. See Sec\u2019y of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Admin, v. Natl Cement Co. of California, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 1066, 1075 (D.C.Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause the Secretary did not recognize the ambiguities inherent in the statutory terms, we do not defer to her plain meaning interpretation.\u201d); <em>see also PDK Labs., </em>362 F.3d at 798 (\u201cDeference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is not appropriate when the agency wrongly believes that [its] interpretation is compelled by Congress.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Humane Soc\u2019y, </em>579 F.Supp.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Therefore, having found that the agency wrongly relied on an erroneous plain-meaning reading of the definition of an endangered species, the Court must \u201cremand for [the agency] to treat the statutory language as ambiguous.\u201d <em>Natl Cement Co., </em>494 F.3d at 1075; <em>see also PDK Labs., </em>362 F.3d at 798 (\u201cThe law of this circuit requires in those circumstances that we withhold <em>Chevron </em>deference and remand to the agency so that it can fill in the gap.\u201d). The Court therefore will remand the Listing Rule to FWS for the agency to provide a reasonable interpretation of the definition of an \u201cendangered species,\u201d as applied to its listing determination for the polar bear.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Humane Soc\u2019y, </em>579 F.Supp.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>at 15. On remand, the agency should bring its expertise and experience to bear on the question of whether its determination that the polar bear is \u201cthreatened\u201d throughout its range is warranted, in light of the Court\u2019s finding that the definition of an endangered species is ambiguous. \u201cAt a minimum, the agency must explain how its interpretation of the statute conforms to the text, structure and legislative history of the ESA; how its interpretation is consistent with judicial interpretations of the ESA (if there are any on point); and how its interpretation serves the ESA\u2019s policy objectives. It must also address any legitimate concerns that its interpretation could undermine those policy objectives.\u201d <em>Humane Soe\u2019y, </em>579 F.Supp.2d at 20-21; <em>see also Nat\u2019l Cement Co., </em>494 F.3d at 1076-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The Court is persuaded that a remand for this limited purpose will not require the agency to undertake additional notice- and-comment rulemaking procedures.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See In re Checkosky, </em>23 F.3d at 465 (\u201cIn fashioning a remedy for an agency\u2019s failure to present an adequate statement of basis and purpose, this court may either remand for specific procedures to cure the deficiency without vacating [the] rule, or it may vacate the rule, thus requiring the agency to initiate another rulemaking proceeding if it would seek to confront the problem anew.\u201d (citing <em>Indep.

These regulations were later finalized and codified at 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.40(q) and are the subject of two additional actions before this Court.

If the FWS determines on this basis that listing may be warranted, it must promptly commence a review of the species' status. <em>Id. </em>Within 12 months of receiving the listing petition, the agency must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>have completed its review and must make a finding that listing is either: (1) not warranted; (2) warranted, but precluded by other listing priorities; or (3) warranted, in which case the FWS must publish a proposed rule to list the species in the Federal Register. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(b)(3)(B). A final rule generally must be completed within one year of publication of the proposed rule. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(b)(6). Plaintiff CBD sued FWS to enforce several of these deadlines for the polar bear. <em>See Ctr. for Biological Diversity </em>v. <em>Kempthome, </em>No. 05-5191 (N.D. Cal. filed Dec. 15, 2005); <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne, </em>No. 08-1339 (N.D.Cal. filed Mar. 10, 2008). After FWS determined that listing the polar bear would be warranted and then published a proposed rule to list the species as threatened throughout its range, the district court in California directed FWS to publish its final listing determination for the polar bear by May 15, 2008. <em>See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Kempthome, </em>No. 08-1339, 2008 WL 1902703, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34753 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 28, 2008). None of these actions are part of the multi-district litigation before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"Ab\">. FWS recognized that preliminary polar bear population models show that projected changes in future sea ice conditions could result in loss of approximately two-thirds of the world's polar bears by the mid-21st century. ARL 117278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AD-\">. Because FWS determined that no portion of the polar bear species is \u201cin danger of extinction,\u201d FWS did not reach the question of whether the polar bear is endangered throughout a \"significant portion of its range.\u201d ARL 117301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. In <em>United States v. </em>Hill, the defendant\u2014 who was charged with attempting to sell parts of animals on the endangered species list\u2014 raised a constitutional challenge to the ESA, arguing that the phrase \"in danger of extinction\u201d could not be defined with sufficient precision to constitute an \"intelligible principle,\u201d in violation of the nondelegation doctrine. 896 F.Supp. at 1060. Because the court\u2019s analysis of the phrase \"in danger of extinction\u201d did not arise in the context of a listing determination, it is not particularly useful for resolving the question of how that phrase should be interpreted and applied; however, it is instructive in demonstrating that the interpretation advanced by the federal defendants is not compelled by the text of the statute. The phrase \"in danger of extinction\u201d does not appear to have been interpreted by any court in the context of an ESA listing decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"AU\">. As defendant-intervenor AOGA correctly noted, an endangered species \"is\u201d in danger of extinction, in the present tense, whereas a threatened species is \"likely to become\u201d so endangered.

Although imminence of harm is clearly one factor that the agency weighs in its decision-making process, it is not necessarily a limiting factor. In many cases, the agency might appropriately find that the imminence of a particular threat is the dispositive factor that warrants listing a species as \"threatened\u201d rather than \u201cendangered,\u201d or vice versa. The agency nonetheless has broad discretion to decide that other factors outweigh the imminence of the threat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. Because the Court finds that the statute is ambiguous, the Court declines to adopt CBD\u2019s alternative plain-meaning interpretation of the definition of an endangered species, which would mandate that any species at high risk of extinction is necessarily \"in danger of extinction.\u201d <em>See </em>CBD Op. Mem. at 22. In any case, where the agency has relied exclusively on an erroneous plain-meaning interpretation of a statute that the court has found to be ambiguous, the court is not empowered to \"choose between competing meanings.\u201d <em>PDK Labs., </em>362 F.3d at 798.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">. The federal defendants' discussion of this issue in their briefs is cursory at best. Indeed, the federal defendants fail to mention the <em>Chevron </em>framework entirely with respect to the statutory definition of an endangered species. This is puzzling in light of the fact that the federal defendants have invoked <em>Chevron </em>with respect to other portions of the statute. For example, the federal defendants contend that FWS\u2019s interpretation of the term \"foreseeable future\u201d in the definition of a threatened species is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron </em>step two. FD Op. Mem. at 69-70, 72-79. The federal defendants further contend that the statutory phrase \"taking into account,\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(1), has a plain meaning under <em>Chevron </em>step one, but that \u201cat a minimum, if the Court were to find the \u2018taking into account\u2019 language ambiguous, the Service's interpretation is reasonable and entitled to deference under step II of <em>Chevron.\" </em>FD Reply at 40, n. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"A0k\">.A remand for this narrow purpose is particularly appropriate here, where the agency has not purported to interpret the statutory definition of an endangered species in the Listing Rule itself.
