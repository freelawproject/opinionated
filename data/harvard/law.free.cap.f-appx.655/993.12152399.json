(\u201cMERS\u201d), and Wells Fargo\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to quiet title over their property and recover damages in related causes of action over a dispute regarding their mortgage loan. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their suit to quiet title, which the district court denied. Simultaneously, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims under Rule 12(b)(6), which the court granted. On appeal, the Parkers argue that the lower court\u2019s denial of summary judgment and the grant of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal was in error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">On February 25, 2004, the Parkers signed a promissory note (titled \u201cNote\u201d) as the borrower-mortgagor of $173,468.00 from CH Mortgage Company I, Ltd. (\u201cCH\u201d), the lender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Note also referenced and utilized a Deed of Trust, executed on the same day, as the \u201csecurity instrument\u201d means of enforcing payment with regard to real property located at 4405 Rancho Del Norte Trail (\u201cthe Property\u201d) in McKinney, Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Deed of Trust itself listed MERS as the trustee beneficiary on behalf of CH and the as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>signee of CH. MERS subsequently assigned the deed to Wells Fargo on March 12, 2012, an assignment of which the Par-kers claimed they were never made aware. However, they also admitted in their amended complaint to making continuous monthly mortgage payments to Wells Fargo from February 25, 2004 to November 1, 2011. According to Wells Fargo, the Parker\u2019s last payment was made on November 25, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Citing concern over the housing bubble crisis, Plaintiffs sent correspondence titled \u201cRESPA Qualified Written Request, Complaint, Dispute of Debt <em>&amp; </em>Validation of Debt Letter\u201d (\u201cthe Parker\u2019s QWR letter\u201d) on November 29, 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Primarily, the letter questioned whether Wells Fargo in fact owned the promissory note and had any authority to continue to collect payments. The letter also threatened legal action under RESPA for a failure to comply. Wells Fargo responded to the Parkers dated December 29, acknowledging the receipt of the QWR and promising to look into the matter. The Parkers sent correspondence on February 27, 2012, titled \u201cNotice of Default / Notice of Opportunity to Cure,\u201d which was signed and notarized. The Notice alleged that Wells Fargo was in default of its contractual obligations and provided ten days to cure. A failure to cure, according the Parkers, would be taken as an implicit \u201cacceptance and agreement.\u201d The Parkers then sent a notarized \u201cCertificate of Default\u201d on April 2, 2012, stating that Wells Fargo was in default. Dated on that same day, the Parkers also signed their \u201cMemorandum of Contract\u201d with a third party individual as- a witness. The document purported to transfer title of the Property to the Parkers and foreclose all of Wells Fargo\u2019s interests in it based on their \u201ctacit acceptance\u201d of default.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">In early June 2012, Wells Fargo sent notice that they had elected to accelerate the debt. Later that month, the Parkers sent return correspondence stating that they were willing to satisfy the full debt, but conditioned the tender of payment upon the receipt of proof that Wells Fargo indeed was the owner of the promissory note.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wells Fargo sent notice and set an auction sale for the Property on July 3, 2012. One day prior to the sale, the Par-kers filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 disputing the mortgage with Wells Fargo and thereby causing an automatic stay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>The proceedings were converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August 21, 2013. Wells Fargo moved for relief from stay which was denied in October. However, on October 30, the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the Property back to the Parkers resulting in a lifted stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The case was removed to the district court in February of 2014. In their Amended Complaint, the Parkers listed their claims against Wells Fargo and their co-defendants: (1) to quiet title, (2) violation of RESPA, (3) breach of contract, (4) fraud, and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendants subsequently moved to dismiss all of the Parker\u2019s claims. The Parkers moved for summary judgment solely on their claim to quiet title. The district court denied summary judgment to the Parkers and granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on all of the Parkers\u2019 claims with prejudice. The Par-kers made timely appeal to this Court alleging erroneous summary judgment denial for quieting title and dismissal of all claims of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">On appeal, this Court reviews the grant or denial for a motion of summary judgment de novo under the same criteria used by the district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper if the movant shows that there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Evidence and inferences are drawn under this standard in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court may consider other materials presented in the record as well as the materials cited in the motion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">Similarly, we review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under this standard, this Court affirms unless the allegations, where all well-pleaded facts are assumed true in favor of the plaintiff, \u201csupport relief on any possible theory.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cDismissal is proper if the complaint lacks an allegation regarding a required element necessary to obtain relief.... And, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">Under Texas law, a suit to quiet title is a request to invoke the court\u2019s powers of equity in removing a \u201ccloud\u201d on plaintiffs title to the Property.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In order to prevail, the Parkers must show that Well Fargo\u2019s claim \u201c(1) constitutes a hindrance having the appearance of a better right to title than its own, that (2) appears to be valid on its face, and that (3) for reasons not apparent on its face, is not valid.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-17\">The court below properly dismissed the suit to quiet title. The Parkers have admitted that a creditor has a valid interest in this Property;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> they only dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>whether Wells Fargo is the rightful holder of this interest. As the district court observed, a suit to quiet title is not the appropriate way to resolve this dispute. Even if it were, the Parkers have failed to show that Wells Fargo\u2019s interest was invalid.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Their argument rests entirely on the legitimacy of Wells Fargo as the assignee to the Property interests under the mortgage, but they offer nothing but conclusory allegations to support their claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, as a matter of law, the Parkers\u2019 suit to quiet title failed to meet summary judgment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The Parkers\u2019 claims of fraud against Wells Fargo and its counsel, BMPC, are deficient. As correctly stated by the district court, it was Parkers\u2019 burden to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-7\">(1) the defendant made a false material representation; (2) knowingly or recklessly; (3) that was intended to induce plaintiff to act upon the representation; and that (4) plaintiff actually and justifiably relied upon the representation and suffered injury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">As the lower court correctly noted, the Parkers \u201chave not sufficiently pleaded a claim for fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Parkers allege that the Defendants misrepresented that Wells Fargo had the right to foreclose. But the Parkers never demonstrated that Well Fargo\u2019s asserted right to foreclose was actually false,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> despite the conclusory argument that since Defendants didn\u2019t show them the note, there is no note.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Furthermore, they failed to demonstrate any 'actual injury as a result of any reliance on this assertion. In fact, the facts seem to show that the harm the Parkers suffered\u2014foreclosure\u2014was the result of their own default. The court below, therefore, was correct in dismissing the fraud claim for failing to meet the required elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">The Parkers also alleged a violation of RESPA as a basis for recovering damages on the grounds that Wells Fargo failed to properly respond to their Qualified Written Request (\u201cQWR\u201d) letter. To succeed under such a claim, plaintiffs have to show that \u201ctheir correspondence met the requirements of a QWR, that Wells Fargo failed to make a timely response, and that this failure caused them actual damages.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, a valid QWR \u201cmust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>be related to the servicing of the loan.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cServicing,\u201d as defined in RESPA, \u201cmeans receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any loan ... and making the payments of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may be required pursuant to the terms of the loan.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Here, the Parker\u2019s QWR letter is deficient in meeting RESPA\u2019s express requirements. The letter requests proof of Wells Fargo\u2019s authority to collect payments under the promissory note and deed of trust, which does not relate to \u201cservicing of the loan\u201d under RESPA. Even assuming the letter was a valid QWR, the Parkers\u2019 claim fails because they did not show any facts \u201cgiving rise to a reasonable inference that [they] suffered actual damages from the alleged violation of the RESPA.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The lower court was correct to deny relief.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Finally, the Parkers\u2019 claims for breach of contract and for the intentional infliction of emotional distress are waived on appellate review. The appellants\u2019 brief failed to sufficiently argue these claims.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Similarly, appellants\u2019 brief also failed to bring argument against the lower court\u2019s dismissal of claims against MERS. Therefore, any claim of error in the dismissal of claims against MERS is also waived.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The Parkers contend that their offer was for an unconditional tender of payment which Wells Fargo refused. However, as correctly stated in Wells Fargo\u2019s brief, \"[a] valid and legal tender of money consists of the actual production of the funds and offer to pay the debt involved.\u201d <em>Baucum v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of New York, </em>370 S.W.2d 863, 866 (Tex. 1963).

The Parkers also contend that the district court erred in stating that Wells Fargo had filed a proof of claim during the bankruptcy proceedings. They imply that the lack of a proof of claim listing on the bankruptcy court\u2019s docket sheet is further evidence against Wells Fargo\u2019s lien creditor status. However, whether a proof of claim was filed is irrelevant here. As a secured creditor, Wells Fargo was not required to file a proof of claim. <em>In re Simmons, </em>765 F.2d 547, 551 (5th Cir. 1985) (discussing the requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a) and Bankr.
