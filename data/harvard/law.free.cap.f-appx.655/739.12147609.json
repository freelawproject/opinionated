David Bullock, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. Reversible error has been shown; we vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Bullock pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. The court sentenced Bullock to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment and entered final judgment on 1 July 2009. Bullock filed no direct appeal. Bullock later filed a section 2255 motion to vacate his conviction; the motion was first received by the district court on 8 August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The district court dismissed Bullock\u2019s motion as barred by the one-year statute of limitations established by the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether Bullock\u2019s section 2255 motion was timely filed under the \u201cprison mailbox rale.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">In section 2255 proceedings, we review de novo questions of law and review for clear error findings of fact. Jeffries v. United States, 748 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">Generally speaking, a prisoner must file his section 2255 motion within one year of the final judgment. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). Because Bullock filed no direct appeal, his judgment of conviction became final on 16 July 2009. See Akins v. United States, 204 F.3d 1086, 1089 n.1 (11th Cir. 2000) (a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time for filing a direct appeal expires). Bullock was thus required to file his section 2255 motion by 16 July 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Under the \u201cprison mailbox rule,\u201d a pro se prisoner\u2019s section 2255 motion is deemed filed on the date the prisoner delivers the motion to prison authorities for mailing. Washington v. United States, 243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001). The mailbox rule may be applied even when a prisoner\u2019s pleading is \u201clost\u201d and never received by the district court. See Allen v. Culliver, 471 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cAbsent evidence to the contrary, we assume that a prisoner delivered a filing to prison authorities on the date that he signed it.\u201d Jeffries, 748 F.3d at 1314; see also Washington, 243 F.3d at 1301 (accepting the signature date on the pleading as the date of delivery to prison authorities where the government \u201coffered no evidence to support a conclusion that the motion was delivered at a later date.\u201d). \u201cThe burden is on the Government to prove the motion was delivered to prison authorities on a date other than the date the prisoner signed it.\u201d Jeffries, 748 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Bullock\u2019s pertinent section 2255 motion is itself unsigned and undated, but documents accompanying the motion\u2014including the certificate of service for Bullock\u2019s brief in support of the motion and Bullock\u2019s sworn affidavit in support of his claims\u2014are signed and are dated 16 June 2010. (In an affidavit, Bullock declares that he first delivered his section 2255 motion to prison authorities for mailing on 16 June 2010, after having prepaid first class postage.) When Bullock later learned that the district court had no record of his original motion, Bullock filed a second document: a \u201cNotice of Resubmitting Motion Pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u201d\u2014 signed and dated on 30 July 2010\u2014togeth-er with a copy of Bullock\u2019s originally filed section 2255 motion. The district court received these resubmitted documents on 3 August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Given this evidence, the burden was on the government to prove that Bullock delivered his initial section 2255 motion to prison authorities\u2014if at all\u2014on a date other than on 16 June. See Jeffries, 748 F.3d at 1314; see also Daniels v. United States, 809 F.3d 588, 589 (11th Cir. 2015) (pursuant to Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts, a prisoner may demonstrate that his motion is timely by submitting an unsworn declaration that \u201cset[s] forth the date of deposit and state[s] that first-class postage has been prepaid.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">No evidentiary hearing was conducted in district court: no one testified in person before the court. The government, however, submitted three pieces of evidence in an attempt to contradict Bullock\u2019s assertion that he first delivered his section 2255 motion to prison authorities for mailing on 16 June. First, the government produced affidavits from mailroom supervisors at Bullock\u2019s prison about routine mailroom procedures. In pertinent part, the prison maintains logs only for outgoing certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>mail; not for \u201clegai/special mail\u201d or \u201cgeneral mail.\u201d The outgoing certified mail logs show no certified mail sent by Bullock during the months of June, July, or August 2010. (Bullock does not claim that he used certified mail.) About \u201clegal/special mail,\u201d the prison\u2019s policy is to' stamp the back of the envelope with the date of receipt in the mailroom. And all mail delivered to the prison mailroom\u2014including certified mail, \u201clegal/special mail\u201d or \u201cgeneral mail\u201d\u2014is taken to the post office for mailing within 24 hours of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Second, the government produced a copy of the envelope received by the district court containing Bullock\u2019s resubmitted section 2255 motion. The front of the envelope is labeled \u201cLegal Mail\u201d and the back of the envelope is date-stamped 30 July 2010, consistent with the prison\u2019s policy for handling \u201clegal/special mail.\u201d The envelope is post-marked 2 August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The third piece of evidence the government relies on are records of Bullock\u2019s commissary purchases between 2 June and 23 August 2010. The commissary receipts demonstrate that Bullock purchased stamps and a copy card only once during the pertinent period: on 29 July 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We agree with the district court that the government\u2019s evidence supports a finding that Bullock delivered some document to prison authorities for mailing on 30 July 2010. But that evidence is fully consistent with Bullock\u2019s contention that he resubmitted his section 2255 motion on 30 July.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Nothing in the government\u2019s evidence contradicts Bullock\u2019s contention that he also delivered originally his section 2255 motion to prison authorities on 16 June. That Bullock purchased no stamps or copy cards from the commissary within the two weeks leading up to 16 June\u2014by itself\u2014 falls short of the evidence necessary to overcome the presumption that Bullock\u2019s motion was delivered to prison authorities on 16 June. Cf. Jeffries, 748 F.3d at 1315-16 (government satisfied burden of proving untimely filing by introducing testimony about prison mailroom practices, evidence showing no prison logbook entry on the alleged date of delivery to the prison mail-room, the prisoner\u2019s lack of diligence in following up on his alleged pleading, and where the district court found prisoner\u2019s testimony lacked credibility). Nothing evidences that the commissary is the only source available for prisoners to obtain stamps and copy cards or that Bullock purchased no stamps or copy cards before 2 June.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In a case like this one, bare evidence of routine mail procedure is insufficient to overcome a prisoner\u2019s sworn statement on when he delivered a specific legal document to proper authorities. On this record, the government has failed to satisfy its burden of proof. We vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-11\">. To the extent Bullock argues that his section 2255 motion is timely under section 2255(f)(4), that issue is outside the scope of this appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3) (limiting appellate review to the issues specified in the COA). Moreover, to the extent Bullock now seeks to expand the scope of the COA, we deny the request as untimely. See Tompkins v. Moore, 193 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir. 1999) (arguments raised in the appellate brief \"will not be considered as a timely application for expansion of the [COA]\u201d and will not be reviewed on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">. In the light of our precedent and the plain language of Rule 3(d), we decline the government\u2019s invitation to adopt a higher evidentia-ry standard\u2014similar to that adopted by the Seventh Circuit\u2014for prisoners alleging \"lost mail\u201d claims. See Allen, 471 F.3d at 1198-99 (in the context of an alleged lost notice of appeal, the government bears the burden of proof once the prisoner has\u2014in compliance with identical language in Fed.R.App.P. 4(c)\u2014provided a declaration \u201cset[ting] forth the date of the deposit and stat[ing] that first class portage has been prepaid.\u201d); but see Ray v. Clements, 700 F.3d 993, 1011-12 (7th Cir. 2012) (to shift the burden to the government to show untimeliness, a prisoner must first submit a sworn declaration attesting to \"the who, what, when, where, how, and why of his alleged delivery to a prison official\u201d in addition to \"some other corroborating evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">. In dismissing Bullock's motion as untimely and finding facts, the district court relied almost exclusively on this Court\u2019s unpublished decision in Natson v. United States, 494 Fed.Appx. 3 (11th Cir. 2012) (unpublished). We disagree with the district court's determination that Bullock\u2019s case is factually indistinguishable from Natson. First and foremost, Natson involved no allegation of \"lost\u201d mail. Instead, Natson contended that he delivered timely his section 2255 motion to prison authorities but that the prison failed to process his mail until after the expiration of the limitation period. And in Natson, certified mail was involved. This Court concluded that the government\u2019s evidence\u2014which included testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>mony about routine mailroom procedures, the post-mark date on Natson\u2019s motion, and records of other certified mail having been delivered successfully to the post office within the pertinent time frame\u2014was sufficient to establish an untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">The government in this case presented some\u2014but not all\u2014of the same kinds of evidence involved in Natson (testimony about routine mailroom procedures). But the issue here is not whether the evidence presented by the government is an acceptable form of proof; it is acceptable in form but legally insufficient in weight, Nor does this case turn on the date on which mail actually received by the district court was in fact delivered to prison authorities. Instead, the issue in this case is whether the government\u2019s evidence is sufficient to rebut Bullock\u2019s contention that he delivered timely a section 2255 motion to prison authorities, but that the motion was never delivered to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
