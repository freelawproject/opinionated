Bacharach, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b641-28\">Mr. Mardell Trotter was convicted on federal drug and gun charges. After an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>unsuccessful direct appeal, Mr. Trotter moved to vacate the sentence on one of the gun charges (Count 11). The district court denied relief and a certificate of appeala-bility. Mr. Trotter now asks us for a certificate of appealability. We deny this request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On the disputed gun charge, Mr. Trotter was sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which imposes a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for those who, during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime, \u201cuse[] or carr[y] a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possess[ ] a firearm.\u201d According to the government, Mr. Trotter traded drugs for a gun. The jury found Mr.. Trotter guilty, and the court imposed a sentence that included a five-year prison term for the \u00a7 924(c) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On direct appeal, Mr. Trotter challenged the refusal to depart downward and argued that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction under \u00a7 924(c). We affirmed the conviction and remanded to the district court for clarification of the reasons for declining to depart downward. <em>United States v. Trotter (Trotter II), </em>518 F.3d 773 (10th Cir. 2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">On remand, the district court clarified its reasoning without modifying its earlier judgment or sentence. Mr. Trotter appealed and we remanded for resentencing under the revised sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Trotter, </em>No. 13-3145 (10th Cir. Nov. 21, 2013) (unpublished). On remand, the district court reduced Mr. Trotter\u2019s sentence from 322 to 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\"><em>In </em>appealing that sentence again, Mr. Trotter\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), identifying potentially appealable issues. In part, the <em>Anders </em>brief stated that Mr. Trotter might argue that the jury had been improperly instructed on the \u00a7 924(c) count in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Watson v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 74, 128 S.Ct. 579, 169 L.Ed.2d 472 (2007). <em>United States v. Trotter, </em>601 Fed.Appx. 721, 725 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished). In <em>Watson, </em>the Supreme Court held that trading drugs for a gun cannot constitute a \u201cuse\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c). <em>Watson, </em>552 U.S. at 83, 128 S.Ct. 579. But the Supreme Court did not address \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">We reviewed the issue for plain error. Doing so, we concluded that <em>Watson </em>did not apply because it addresses only one of the two prongs in \u00a7 924(c). <em>See Trotter, </em>601 Fed.Appx. at 725. Because we had previously held that trading guns for drugs may satisfy the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong, we concluded that the district court had not plainly erred. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Luke-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 703, 706 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that trading drugs for guns satisfies \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong)); <em>see also United States v. Gurka, </em>605 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2010) (expressing agreement with the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits that <em>\u201cWatson </em>does not affect the prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) concerned with \u2018possession in furtherance of \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Mr. Trotter now claims that under <em>Watson, </em>his counsel was ineffective by failing to present claims of insufficiency of the evidence and actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">II. Standard for a Certificate of Appeal-ability</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">To appeal the denial of relief, Mr. Trotter needs a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We may issue a certificate only if Mr. Trotter \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, Mr. Trotter must demonstrate that \u201cjurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or ... jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">III. Standard for Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In his motion, Mr. Trotter claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that <em>Watson </em>constitutes an intervening change in the law. To determine whether counsel was ineffective, we apply the two-pronged test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>Mr. Trotter must first show that his attorney\u2019s \u201cperformance was deficient\u201d and \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. If Mr. Trotter makes that showing, he must also demonstrate prejudice, which exists only if there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">IV.Counsel\u2019s omissions were not prejudicial to the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Section 924(c) contains two prongs. The first prong prohibits the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and the second prong prohibits \u201cpossession\u201d of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Mr. Trotter was indicted on both prongs. A \u201ccrime denounced in the statute disjunctively may be alleged in an indictment in the conjunctive, and thereafter proven in the disjunctive.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>546 F.2d 861, 868-69 (10th Cir. 1976). Thus, the \u00a7 924(c) conviction required the government to satisfy only one of the two prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Mr. Trotter contends that in light of <em>Watson v. United States, </em>there is no longer sufficient evidence for his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. 552 U.S. 74, 128 S.Ct. 579, 169 L.Ed.2d 472 (2007). It is true that Mr. Trotter\u2019s conviction cannot be sustained under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d prong because that possibility is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Watson. Id. </em>at 83, 128 S.Ct. 579. But <em>Watson </em>does not address the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong, and we have held that trading drugs for guns satisfies the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong. <em>See id.; United States v. Luke-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 703, 706 (10th Cir. 2007). Similarly, we have held that <em>Watson </em>does not bear on the sufficiency of the evidence for a conviction under the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong. <em>Trotter, </em>601 Fed.Appx. 721, 725 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Trotter, </em>483 F.3d 694, 702 (10th Cir. 2007), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>552 U.S. 1091, 128 S.Ct. 870, 169 L.Ed.2d 713 (2008). Thus, even after <em>Watson, </em>Mr. Trotter\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) may be upheld under the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Mr. Trotter also claims that <em>Watson </em>constitutes an intervening change in law that renders him actually innocent. A claim of actual innocence requires new evidence that would prevent any reasonable jury from finding Mr. Trotter guilty. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 329, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). Mr. Trotter did not present any new evidence. Instead, his claim is based solely on the opinion in <em>Watson. </em>Again, <em>Watson </em>does not bear on the \u201cpossession in furtherance of\u2019 prong of \u00a7 924(c) and Mr. Trotter does not question the applicability, of that prong to his conviction. <em>See Trotter, </em>601 Fed.Appx. at 725; <em>Trotter, </em>483 F.3d at 702. Absent other evidence, this claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">V. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We deny Mr. Trotter\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-16\"> Because oral argument would not be helpful, we decide this appeal based on the briefs. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order does not constitute binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
