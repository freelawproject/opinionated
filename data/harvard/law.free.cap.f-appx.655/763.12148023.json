Loaiza contends the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to inform the district court of the nature and extent of Loaiza\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-23\">At Loaiza\u2019s sentencing hearing, counsel for Loaiza discussed at length Loaiza\u2019s objection to the imposition of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for being a leader of the conspiracy. During this discussion, counsel for Loaiza and later the Government mentioned Loaiza\u2019s two lengthy proffers in cooperation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>law enforcement. Although the Government conceded Loaiza\u2019s cooperation, the Government did not elaborate. After hearing from both Loaiza and the Government, the district court overruled Loaiza\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 BB1.1 enhancement and calculated Loaiza\u2019s guideline range at 135 to 169 months. Because of the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement, Loaiza was ineligible for safety valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and thus subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. The district court ultimately varied downward from the guideline range and sentenced Loaiza to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">At no point during the sentencing hearing did Loaiza object to the Government\u2019s failure to inform the district court of Loai-za\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement. Rather, in arguing that he was not a leader of the conspiracy, Loaiza relied upon information that he had proffered to the Government and suggested that the Government could have or should have identified that information as evidence tending to disprove that Loaiza was a leader. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Loaiza\u2019s counsel noted \u201cfor purposes of the record in the possibility that there should be an issue on appeal as to breach of the plea agreement by the Government.\u201d This allusion to the possibility of appeal did not give the district court the opportunity to address the merits of the argument Loaiza now makes on appeal. Therefore, we review for plain error the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cTo preserve an issue for appeal, one must raise an objection that is sufficient to apprise the trial court and the opposing party of the particular grounds upon which appellate relief will later be sought.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In the context of an alleged breach of a plea agreement, the question of prejudice is not whether the defendant would have entered into the plea had he known of the future breach but rather whether his sentence was affected by the Government\u2019s breach. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 142 n.4, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1433 n.4, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (\u201cWhen the rights acquired by the defendant relate to sentencing, the outcome he must show to have been affected is his sentence.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Thus, to prevail; Loaiza must show a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different absent the breach. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Assuming that the Government breached the plea agreement by insufficiently informing the district court of the nature and extent of Loaiza\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement, Loaiza cannot show that the Government\u2019s breach affected Loaiza\u2019s substantial rights. Although perhaps unaware of the nature and extent of Loaiza\u2019s cooperation, the district court knew Loaiza cooperated with law enforcement and credited Loaiza with both an aceeptance-of-responsibility reduction and a downward variance to a sentence just five months longer than the mandatory minimum. Other than conjecture, Loaiza offers no grounds to support a reasonable probability that the district court would have given Loaiza an even larger downward variance. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301 (\u201c[Wjhere the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate ... the appellant ... has not met his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected.\u201d). Therefore, Loaiza has failed to meet his burden under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-15\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the Government breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir. 2004). Issues not raised before the district court, however, are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir. 2005). To establish plain error, the defendant must show (1) an error, ,(2) that is plain or obvious, (3) affecting his substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
