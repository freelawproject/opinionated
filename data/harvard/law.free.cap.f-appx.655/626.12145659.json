McKay, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">Lesia Nelson appeals from an order of the magistrate judge affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the agency applied the correct legal standards and its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">Upon the agency\u2019s denial of her applications, Ms. Nelson requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). Following a de novo hearing, the ALJ issued a decision denying benefits. He determined that Ms. Nelson had several physical and mental impairments that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>when considered together, constituted a severe impairment at step two of the five-step sequential evaluation process. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. I at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">After consideration of the entire record, the ALJ found that Ms. Nelson retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform medium work,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with certain additional limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">the claimant must periodically alternate sitting and standing; ... the claimant\u2019s visual acuity with glasses is \u215c in the right eye and \u00be in the left eye; the claimant can carry out simple instructions with routine supervision; can interact appropriately with supervisors and co-workers on a superficial basis; can adapt to a work situation; but cannot interact with the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Based on the testimony of a vocational expert (VE), the ALJ found that although Ms. Nelson could not perform her past relevant work as a certified nurse\u2019s aide, there were at least nine medium, light, and sedentary \u201cunskilled\u201d jobs totaling more than 1.6 million jobs in the national economy that she could perform. <em>Id. </em>at 44 (emphasis in original). As a result, the ALJ concluded that she was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied review. Ms. Nelson now appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">II. <em>Standard of Revieu?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. In reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision, we neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Vigil v. Colvin, </em>805 F.3d 1199, 1201 (10th Cir.2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Ms. Nelson argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding was not supported by substantial evidence because: (1) it failed to note the marked limitations noted by a. consulting psychologist in a portion of the agency\u2019s form used to assess a claimant\u2019s mental RFC; (2) it did not express whether her vision impairment was near sighted or far sighted; and (3) it was too vague regarding the need to periodically alternate between sitting and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">A. <em>Mental RFC Formulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">Sharon Taber, a psychologist who performed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment, noted in Section I of the evaluation form that Ms. Nelson had a moderate limitation in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, and marked limitations in her ability to understand and remember detailed instructions, carry out detailed instructions, and interact appropriately with the public. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. II at 374-75. According to Ms. Nelson, the ALJ\u2019s failure to note the moderate and marked limitations in formulating her mental RFC was error. We disagree. The purpose of Section I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-15\">is chiefly to have a worksheet to- ensure that the psychiatrist or psychologist has considered each of these pertinent mental activities and the claimant\u2019s or beneficiary\u2019s degree of limitation.... It is the narrative written by the psychiatrist or psychologist in section III ... that adjudicators are to use as the assessment of RFC. Adjudicators must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>take the RFC assessment in section III and decide what significance the elements discussed in this RFC assessment have in terms of the person\u2019s ability to meet the demands of past work or other work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">SSA, Program Operations Manual System (POMS), DI 25020.010 B.l (emphasis in original) (available at https://secure.ssa. gov/poms.nfs/lnx/0425020010).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In this case, Dr. Taber\u2019s Section III narrative adequately captured the limitations she found in Section I: \u201cClaimant is capable of carrying out simple instructions with routine supervision. Claimant is capable of interacting appropriately with supervisors and coworkers on a superficial basis but not with the general public. Claimant can adapt to a work situation.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. II at 376. In turn, the ALJ incorporated Dr. Taber\u2019s Section III assessment in Ms. Nelson\u2019s mental RFC. <em>See id., </em>Vol. I at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">More to the point, by limiting Ms. Nelson to unskilled work, the ALJ effectively accounted for <em>all </em>the limitations noted in Section I of Dr. Taber\u2019s evaluation. .Unskilled work generally requires only the following: (1) \u201c[understanding, remembering, and carrying out simple instructions\u201d; (2) \u201c[mjaking judgments that are commensurate with the functions of unskilled work\u2014i.e., simple work-related decisions\u201d; (3) \u201cResponding appropriately to supervision, co-workers and usual work situations\u201d; and (4) \u201c[djealing with changes in a routine work setting.\u201d SSR 96-9p, 1996 WL 374185, at *9 (July 2, 1996). Even though Dr. Taber noted marked limitations in Ms. Nelson\u2019s ability to remember detailed instructions, carry out detailed instructions, and interact appropriately with the public, unskilled work does not require these abilities, nor does it require the ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, an area in which Dr. Taber noted a moderate limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">B. <em>Physical RFC Formulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Ms. Nelson argues that the RFC determination was too vague because the ALJ did not explain in detail what was meant by the need for her to periodically alternate between sitting and standing. This \u201climitation\u201d was expressed in a Physical Residual Function Capacity Assessment, when J. Marks-Snelling, D.O., evaluated how long Ms. Nelson could \u201cSit,\u201d and checked a box indicating that she \u201cmust periodically alternate sitting and standing to relieve pain or discomfort.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. II at 394. The form further instructed the evaluator to \u201cexplain\u201d why the box was checked. <em>Id. </em>In an apparent reference to an orthopedic examination that discussed, in part, her low-back pain, <em>see id. </em>at 286, Dr. Marks-Snelling5 explained that Ms. Nelson had arthritis (in her back) that was exacerbated by her obesity, and she thus needed to \u201cperiodically alternate sitting and standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The ALJ included this \u201climitation\u201d <em>verbatim </em>in his RFC and the hypothetical posed to the VE. But according to Ms. Nelson, this was not enough because the ALJ should have defined what Dr. Marks-Snelling meant by \u201cperiodically,\u201d even though the doctor did not explain it. In other words, we understand Ms. Nelson\u2019s argument to be that the ALJ should have defined \u201cperiodically\u201d in terms of minutes or hours. But an ALJ cannot \u201csubstitute\u201d his own medical opinion for the opinion of a doctor. <em>Hamlin v. Barnhart, </em>365 F.3d 1208, 1221 (10th Cir.2004). <em>See also Miller v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 972, 977 (10th Cir.1996) (holding an \u201cALJ overstep[s] his bounds [when he enters] the province of medicine.\u201d). We acknowledge that Ms. Nelson testified that she could only sit for about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201c15 or 20 minutes\u201d at a time. Aplt. App., Vol. I at 73. The ALJ, however, found her testimony was not credible because \u201cno doctor put[ ] [any such] limit[ ] on her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In this regard, we note that in April 2011, the orthopedic specialist who examined and treated Ms. Nelson for knee and low-back pain wrote that \u201cshe ... has arthritis in [her back], but it\u2019s facet arthritis. Really, the disc spaces are satisfactorily preserved. There is no abnormal scoliosis or kyphosis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. II at 286. The doctor diagnosed Ms. Nelson with \u201c[e]arly dege nerative facet arthritis of the lumbar spin 3,\u201d and advised her to lose weight, stating \u201c[i]t\u2019s going to help this body a lot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The doctor never mentioned any limitations whatsoever. In sum, there is no evid mce in the record to support any limi-tatic n beyond the need to \u201cperiodically\u201d alternate between sitting and standing. And more to the point, there is no evidence that the need to periodically alternate between sitting and standing prevents Ms. Nelson from performing the jobs identified by the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Next, Ms. Nelson argues that it was not enough for the ALJ to describe her vision, \u201cwith glasses,\u201d as \u201c% in the right eye and \u215c&gt; in the left eye.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. I at 40. According to Ms. Nelson, this \u201cdoes not express visual acuity in sufficient work-related functions to be meaningful within a vocational setting.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 10. For example, \u201c[d]oes that mean bad near acuity or far acuity?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We agree with the Commissioner that there is no authority to support Ms. Nelson\u2019s argument that visual acuity must be stated in terms of far and near acuity. Once again we note that the \u201climitation\u201d found by the ALJ is word-for-word the vision \u201cimpairment\u201d described by Ms. Nelson\u2019s ophthalmologist. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. II at 497. And more to the point, there is no evidence that even if Ms. Nelson\u2019s vision impairment had been expressed in bad near or far acuity, it would prevent her from performing the jobs identified by the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-22\">.
