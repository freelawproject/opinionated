O\u2019Brien, United States Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Francis Harry Dishmon attempted to rob a bank. While fleeing, he caused a fatal ear accident. He managed to avoid being held criminally responsible for the fatality but the jury found him guilty of attempted robbery. He .wants us to reverse his conviction, claiming the prosecutor made improper remarks in closing argument. Whether or not the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, reversal is not warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">On the morning of August 28, 2013, Dishmon, wearing a white t-shirt, entered IBC Bank in Miami, Oklahoma. He asked .a teller, Jose Fonseca, for the location of the restroom. After using the restroom, he left the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">5 Dishmon returned to the bank later that morning, this time wearing a blue shirt. He went to the center island where he appeared to write something down. He then approached head teller Elaine Wagner at the counter, \u2022 handed her a white napkin, and told her to read it. The napkin said \u201c100s and 50s.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 130.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Wagner said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t see it,\u201d Dishmon replied, \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t understand, you\u2019re endangering your life and the life of your customer, now give me your 100s and 50s.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Because Wagner had been working at the drive-thru window, she told Dishmon she had no money at the counter. When Dishmon said he did not believe her, Wagner pulled out the money drawer to show him it was empty. She told him she would retrieve money from the drive-thru station. As she turned to do so, she made eye contact with Jessica Webb, another bank employee, and nodded. Believing something was amiss, Webb pressed the panic button under her desk. When Wagner returned from the drive-thru station, Dishmon was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Dishmon ran to his vehicle and sped away. While heading north on a two-lane highway, he tried to pass a tractor-trailer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>being driven by James Wivell. To do so, he entered the southbound lane of traffic, forcing two vehicles traveling south off the road. In attempting to avoid a head-on collision with one of those southbound vehicles, Dishmon swerved back into the northbound lane and collided with Wivell\u2019s truck. As a result of that contact, Dish-moris vehicle spun out in front of Wivell\u2019s truck. To avoid another collision with Dish-mon\u2019s vehicle, Wivell swerved to the left. He then made a hard steer to the right to stay on the road. The truck\u2019s weight shifted, causing it to tip over onto the driver\u2019s side. It slid into the median where Wivell was impaled and killed by a guardrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">When law enforcement officers arrived on scene, Dishmon could not be found. They eventually discovered him hiding in the tall weeds on the side of the road. He initially told officers his name was Thomas Burke.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Dishmon was indicted for attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (Count 1) and killing a person while attempting to avoid apprehension for the attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 2113(a) and (e) (Count 2). At trial, Dishmon attempted to persuade the jury that Wagner, due to three medications she took to treat fibromyalgia, confused his innocent actions at the bank for an attempted robbery. He also presented evidence that he was not the sole cause of Wivell\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury found Dishmon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>guilty on Count 1 but could not reach a verdict on Count 2. The government ultimately dismissed Count 2. Dishmon was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment to run consecutive to the sentences he received for violating his supervised release. <em>See supra </em>mi-</p>\n<p id=\"Aas\">ll. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In arguing the prosecutor made improper closing argument, Dishmon concedes our review is for plain error because he did not object at trial. <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>667 F.3d 1098, 1103 (10th Cir. 2011). \u201cPlain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Beierle, </em>810 F.3d 1193, 1200 (10th Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). Dishmon \u201chas the burden to prove each of the four requirements is satisfied; failure on any one requires affirmance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Evaluating a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is a two-step process. <em>Fleming, </em>667 F.3d at 1103. First we ask \u201cwhether the conduct was, in fact, improper.\u201d <em>United States v. Oberle, </em>136 F.3d 1414, 1421 (10th Cir. 1998) (quotation marks omitted). If so, we then determine whether reversal is warranted. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Rjeversal in the absence of contemporaneous objection is a rare exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>749 F.3d 1250, 1267 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The dispute in this case centers on remarks the prosecutor made in closing argument contrasting his role with that of the judge, defense counsel, and jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">Now, you know, I have to say that throughout the course of this week, my job has probably been and probably always will be one of the easier jobs in this courtroom and one of the easier jobs in this courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">The judge, he\u2019s got a very difficult job. He\u2019s got to give you the law. He\u2019s got to call the objections, the balls and strikes, what\u2019s legal, what\u2019s not legal. That is very difficult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">Mr. Lynn, the defense attorney, he has to represent the defendant. That is very difficult when you have the thumb of the United States government coming down. When it\u2019s the United States government versus Francis Harry Dishmon, that is very hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">You, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have a very difficult task, to weigh the law, the facts and the evidence and apply them as you see fit. That\u2019s hard. <em>But you see, my job, all I have to do, all I\u2019m paid to do is give people the facts. That\u2019s all there is. Call people cm that witness stand, admit exhibits, ask questions. Don\u2019t spin it this way, don\u2019t turn it that way, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m paid to do. I\u2019m paid to just give you the facts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">(R. Vol. 2 at 572-73 (emphasis added).) According to Dishmon, by telling the jury that his job is to present \u201cthe facts\u201d and not to \u201cspin it this way\u201d or \u201cturn it that way,\u201d the prosecutor improperly (1) placed his own integrity before the jury and (2) vouched for the credibility of his witnesses. <em>See United States v. Bowie, </em>892 F.2d 1494, 1498 (10th Cir. 1990) (\u201cIt is error for the prosecution to personally vouch for the credibility of its witnesses.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ainesworth, </em>716 F.2d 769, 771 (10th Cir. 1983) (a prosecutor may not \u201cplace his own integrity and credibility in issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Dishmon\u2019s argument has at least superficial appeal. A \u201cfact\u201d is defined as, among other things, \u201csomething that truly exists or happens: something that has actual existence\u201d or \u201ca true piece of information.\u201d http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/fact; <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cfact\u201d as, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[something that actually exists; an aspect of reality\u201d). In other words, a \u201cfact\u201d connotes \u201ctruth.\u201d Therefore, a reasonable interpretation of the prosecutor\u2019s statements about being paid to \u201cjust give you the facts\u201d is that his evidence, including the testimony of his witnesses, is true and indeed his only job is to present the truth. Such argument may be improper if it puts the prosecutor\u2019s integrity before the jury and amounts to vouching for the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">But context matters. <em>United States v. Lopez-Medina, </em>596 F.3d 716, 738 (10th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWhen evaluating allegedly inappropriate remarks of counsel for plain error, we must view the remarks in the context of the entire trial.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). After telling the jury \u201call I\u2019m paid to do is give people the facts,\u201d the prosecutor mentions \u201c[c]all[ing] people on that witness stand, admitting] exhibits, ask[ing] questions.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 572.) These actions refer to the presentation of evidence, not facts. The jury was told so at the beginning of trial and again prior to closing argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The context, therefore, reveals the prosecutor meant to say \u201cevidence\u201d rather than \u201cfacts,\u201d something the jury likely understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Fortunately, we need not decide whether there was error. Assuming error, Dishmon has not shown the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Fleming, </em>667 F.3d at 1103 (on plain-error review, \u201creversal is warranted only when ... the defendant demonstrates that the [prosecutor\u2019s] improper statement affected his or her substantial rights\u201d). An error affects substantial rights if there is \u201ca reasonable probability that but for the error claimed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>749 F.3d at 1263 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We are confident the jury got it right despite possible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The government\u2019s evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Wagner testified to Dish-mon\u2019s actions in the bank. Her version of the events was supported by the bank surveillance video as well as other witnesses. Patsy Wall, a customer at the bank at the time of the attempted robbery, heard Wagner tell Dishmon that \u201cshe didn\u2019t have any money there, that it was in another place\u201d and Dishmon respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 159.) Based on his tone and her prior experience as a bank teller, Wall assumed the bank was being robbed. Fonseca, who was helping Wall at the time, heard Wagner tell Dishmon that she did not have any money in the drawer. Webb saw Dishmon place something on the teller counter and heard Wagner tell him she could not read it. She also heard Wagner inform Dishmon several times that \u201cher money was not there, it was in the back\u201d and saw Wagner show Dishmon her empty drawer. <em>{Id. </em>at 183.) Webb confirmed Wagner\u2019s eye contact and nod, which triggered Webb to activate the alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The government also presented evidence that once outside the bank Dishmon ran to his vehicle, fled from pursuing officers at speeds over 100 mph, hid from law en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>forcement after the crash, and lied about his identity. These actions are strong evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Morales, 758 </em>F.3d 1232, 1236 (10th Cit. 2014) (\u201cIt is well recognized that a defendant\u2019s intentional flight from police officers may be used as circumstantial evidence of guilt.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Dishmon sees it otherwise. He says the government\u2019s evidence was not overwhelming because it largely depended on Wagner\u2019s ability to accurately perceive the events. And her ability to do so was called into doubt by his pharmacologist, Dr. Craig Stevens. Stevens testified each of the three medications Wagner took to treat her fibromyalgia had \u201ccognitive adverse effects.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 417.) These effects include anxiety, disorientation, confusion, hallucinations, and blurred vision. Stevens told the jury that these effects appear to a greater extent in individuals, like Wagner, who take the medications \u201cin combination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 433.) He opined that a person taking all three drugs \u201cmore than likely\u201d suffered from these adverse effects and \u201cbelieve[d] Ms. Wagner was affected by these drugs that may have affected her perception.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 432-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">However, Stevens could not in fact say Wagner was suffering from any side effects, or for that matter, which ones. That is because he never directly observed her in a medicated state. He also admitted that nothing in her medical records indicated she suffered any side effects from the medications. In contrast, the judge and the jury witnessed Wagner on her medications. She testified to having taken the same medications (as taken the day of the robbery) before testifying. The judge found Wagner to be \u201cunflappable and utterly credible.\u201d (R. Vol. 1 at 326.) There is no indication the jury would have found otherwise. Moreover, while none of the other witnesses heard Dishmon threaten Wagner, they did collaborate Wagner\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Dishmon also argues the jury\u2019s question during deliberations about the intimidation element of attempted robbery (discussed below) \u201csuggests at least some of the jurors were struggling with the case even in the face of the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing arguments.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. at 20.) Thus, \u201c[t]his Court can have no confidence that the jury could have convicted had that improper argument not occurred.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">In order to find Dishmon guilty of attempted robbery, the jury was told it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cattempted to take the money by means of force and violence or by means of intimidation.\u201d (R. Vol. 1 at 253.) Nevertheless, during the second day of deliberations, the jury requested \u201cclarification on intimidation and the boundaries defined as intimidation. Can attempted robbery occur without intimidation?\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 606.) The judge referred the jury to the instructions. We fail to see how the jury\u2019s question undermines confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury\u2019s question was- a legal one; it had nothing to do with the evidence or' what the prosecutor improperly referred to as \u201cfacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">We also take comfort in the jury instructions. Prior to closing arguments, the judge twice told the jury the evidence consisted of the testimony of witnesses, the exhibits, and any stipulations by the parties. <em>See supra </em>n.5. He also informed the jury, \u201cIt will be your duty to find from the evidence what the facts are.\u201d (R. Vol. 1 at 233.) We presume the jury followed these instructions. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>556 F.3d 1130, 1141 (10th Cir. 2009). These instructions \u201cimmunize[d]\u201d any improper argument from affecting Dishmon\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>stantial rights. <em>United States v. Vann, </em>776 F.3d 746, 760 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

At the time of the attempted robbery, Dish-mon was on federal supervised release in Florida and Alabama. A condition of his supervised release prohibited him from committing a new crime. Jurisdiction of the supervised release cases was transferred to the Northern District of Oklahoma and assigned to the same judge who presided over his attempted robbery trial. Due to his attempted robbery conviction, the judge revoked his supervised release in each case and sentenced Dishmon to concurrent 24 month terms. Dishmon filed a notice of appeal in each supervised release case (Appeal Nos. 15-5068, 15-5070) and those appeals were consolidated with his appeal in the attempted robbery case (Appeal No. 15-5069). His argument in Appeal Nos. 15-5068 and 15-5070 is narrow\u2014because the attempted robbery conviction must be reversed due to the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument, the revocations of his supervised release and corresponding sentences must also be reversed because they were based on the attempted robbery conviction. Because we affirm his attempted robbery conviction in 15-5069, his revocations and sentences in Appeal Nos. 15-5068 and 15-5070 are also affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-16\">, All references to the record are to the record in Appeal No. 15-5069.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. Dishmon took the stand and provided his own convenient version of events. While convoluted, his story basically came down to this. He decided to open a catering business. He contacted a man selling catering equipment on Craigslist and agreed to meet him in a store parldng lot. The store happened to share a parking lot with the bank. While he waited in the lot for the man to arrive, he had to use the restroom. He entered the bank, used the restroom, and returned to his vehicle. Because the man was running late, he decided to get something to eat. He spilled food on his shirt so he changed it. Still waiting, he decided to open a business account with the bank. He reentered the bank and approached Wagner, who appeared to be \"in her own world,\u201d with a deposit slip. (R. Vol. 2 at 471.) He said, \"Hi. How are you doing? I would like to look into opening a business account. How much would it be?\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Wagner responded, \"N[ig-ger], what are you talking about?\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Upset, he left the bank and sat in his car to contemplate what had just happened. He eventually exited the parking lot, heading north to find a different location to meet the man selling the catering equipment. He denied speeding. When he came upon Wivell\u2019s tractor-trailer, he decided to pass it. While he was passing, Wivell\u2019s' truck sped up and hit his vehicle, causing it to spin. He said the next thing he remembers is the police placing him in handcuffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">. Dishmon\u2019s accident reconstructionist testified that other - factors, besides Dishmon, \"caused the perfect storm ... for a bad event to occur.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 444.) Those factors included: (1) Wivell\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (.02) exceeded the federal limit for commercial drivers; (2) Wivell increased his speed from 65 mph (the posted speed limit) to 69 mph in the seconds before the crash, and (3) the guardrail which impaled Wivell was substandard because it did not contain the required safety devices on its ends to prevent it from becoming a spear. Dishmon also highlighted that the doctor who performed Wi-vell\u2019s autopsy ruled the cause of death an \"accident\u201d rather than a \"homicide.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 407-08.) The government countered most of this evidence: (1) the doctor who performed the autopsy testified Wivell\u2019s blood alcohol concentration could have resulted from postmortem decomposition of his body and his diabetes; (2) Wivell\u2019s fiancee testified he did not drink; (3) the government\u2019s accident re-constructionist testified Wivell\u2019s increased speed was due to the downward grade of the road; and (4) the autopsy doctor testified his conclusion was a medical one, not a legal one. It did not present any evidence rebutting the condition of the guardrail. While it is impossible to determine with any certainty what transpired in the \"black box\u201d of jury deliberations, <em>United States v. Benally, </em>546 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 2008), this lack of rebuttal evidence may explain the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict on Count 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\">.

Prior to closing argument, the jury was again instructed: \"The evidence in this case includes only what the witnesses said while they were testifying under oath, the exhibits that I allowed into evidence, and any stipulations that the lawyers agreed to.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 240.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
