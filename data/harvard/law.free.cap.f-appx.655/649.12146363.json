O\u2019Brien, United States Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Ryan A. Freeburg, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> wants to appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. His request for a certificate of appealability (COA) was denied by the district judge, prompting him to reapply in this .Court. Because he has not \u201cmade.a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>see 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we too deny a COA. .</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Freeburg pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). His criminal history included (1) possession of a controlled drug with intent to distribute in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, \u00a7 2-401(A)(l); (2) feloniously pointing a firearm in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 1289.16; and (3) aggravated assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.12(A)(1). The probation officer determined the drug conviction was a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d and the latter two convictions constituted \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) and therefore Freeburg was subject to the ACCA\u2019s enhanced penalties. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.4. Initially, Freeburg objected to the enhancement, arguing his Ohio aggravated assault conviction was not an ACCA predicate offense. He withdrew that objection prior to sentencing. The judge then sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment, the mandatory minimum sentence required by the ACCA, <em>Id, </em>We dismissed Freeburg\u2019s untimely appeal on February 13, 2014. <em>See United States v. Freeburg, </em>No. 14-6021 (10th Cir. Feb. 13, 2014). He did not seek certiorari review. Thus, his conviction became final on May 14, 2014. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. Rule 13(1); <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 532, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (\u201c[F]or federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with [the Supreme Court] on direct review, \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">Over a year later, in July 2015, Free-burg filed his \u00a7 2255 petition, arguing his convictions for feloniously pointing a firearm and aggravated assault no longer qualified as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court decided the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include any felony that \u201cotherwise involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d (commonly referred to as the residual clause) is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 2557, 2563. In so holding, however, it left untouched the remainder of the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d including a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d\u2014the physical force prong. <em>Id. </em>at 2563; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The district judge denied Freeburg\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. He recognized the motion was filed more than one year after Free-burg\u2019s conviction became final, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), but concluded the motion was nevertheless timely because it was filed within one year of <em>Johnson. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3) (one year statute of limitations runs from latest of \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\u201d). However, he decided <em>Johnson </em>did not affect Freeburg\u2019s sentence because his convictions for feloniously pointing a firearm and aggravated assault were \u201cviolent felonies]\u201d under the physical force prong of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Hood, </em>774 F.3d 638, 645-46 (10th Cir. 2014) (a conviction for violating Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 1289.16 (feloniously pointing a firearm) constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s physical force prong where the offense involves the defendant pointing a firearm for the purpose of threatening and intimidating the victim); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>695 F.3d 390, 400-01 (6th Cir. 2012) (a conviction for violating Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.12(A) (aggravated assault) is categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the physical force prong of the ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of a petition for a writ of habe-. as corpus. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Freeburg argues his Ohio aggravated assault conviction under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.12(A)(1) fails to satisfy the physical force prong of the ACCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to him, the statute\u2019s language does not require the use of physical force, only that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to-another. He relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Perez-Vargas, </em>where we held third degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-3-204(l)(a) did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)) because the statutory language does not necessarily require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the use or threatened use of physical force and we found no Colorado state court cases definitely holding it did.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 414 F.3d 1282, 1285-86 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">But <em>Freeburg </em>waived this claim by intentionally withdrawing it at sentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Teague, </em>443 F.3d 1310, 1314 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[W]aiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right\u201d; \u201ca party that has <em>waived </em>a right is not entitled to appellate relief.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted);' <em>see also United States v. Zubio-Torres, </em>550 F.3d 1202, 1205 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cWe typically find waiver in cases where a party has invited the error that it now seeks to challenge, or where a party attempts to reassert an argument that it previously raised and abandoned below.\u201d). However, even if he had not waived the argument, it is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Under \u00a7 2255(f)(1), Freeburg had one year from the date his conviction became final in May 2014 to file his \u00a7 2255 petition. He did not file his petition until July 2015. Both the government and the district judge recognized the untimeliness of his petition. Nevertheless, the judge decided his <em>Johnson </em>claim was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3). That statute extends the limitation period if the petition is based on a right newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactive to cases on collateral appeal. While his <em>Johnson </em>claim satisfies this requirement, his <em>Perez-Vargas </em>claim does not and he has withdrawn his <em>Johnson </em>claim. <em>See infra </em>n.2. By doing so, he has eliminated the basis for consideration of his otherwise untimely petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Simply put, \u00a7 2255(f)(3) allowed additional time for his <em>Johnson </em>claim; it does not extend the time so as to permit him to resurrect a claim he abandoned in the district court. He has outmaneuvered himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS this matter. We GRANT Freeburg\u2019s Motion to Amend his COA Application and Opening Brief and to Substitute his Amended COA Application and Opening Brief. Freeburg\u2019s request to proceed on appeal <em>in forma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>pauperis </em>or <em>ifp </em>is DENIED AS MOOT. The relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), does not permit litigants to avoid payment of fees, only prepayment of fees.. Since we have reached the merits of this matter, prepayment of fees is no longer an issue. Freeburg is, nevertheless, required to pay all filing and docketing fees ($505.00) to the Clerk of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-14\">. We have liberally construed Freeb\u00farg\u2019s pro se pleadings, stopping short, however, of serving as his advocate. <em>See United States v. Pinson, </em>584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\">. In his initial COA application and opening brief, Freeburg argued (1) his prior convictions for feloniously pointing a firearm and aggravated assault were no longer ACCA predicate offenses under <em>Johnson </em>and (2) the judge erred in concluding these convictions constituted \"violent felon[ies]\u201d under the physical force prong of the ACCA. He has since moved to amend his COA application and opening brief. We grant his motion. In his amended pleading, he argues only that his prior conviction for aggravated assault is not a \"violent felony\u201d under the physical force prong of the ACCA under <em>United States v. Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d 1282 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">. <em>Compare </em>Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-3-204(l)(a) (\"A person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if ... [t]he person knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury fo another person or with criminal negligence the person causes bodily injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon\u201d) <em>with </em>Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.12(A)(1) (\"No person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly ... [clause serious physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. Freeburg has not claimed his counsel was ineffective in withdrawing the claim prior to sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. Freeburg is not entitled to equitable tolling, \"Equitable tolling of the limitations period is available when an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure <em>to </em>timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>United States v. Gabaldon, </em>522 F.3d 1121, 1124 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted). <em>Perez-Vargas </em>was decided prior to Freeburg\u2019s sentencing and the filing of his \u00a7 2255 petition. Yet, he did not raise it until now. That is not diligence. Freeburg claims he is pro se, has no formal education or training in the law, and at the time he filed his original COA application and opening brief he was \"in transit and new to [the prison]\" and therefore \"had to rely on anyone he could find to assist him with [it].\u201d (Motion to Amend COA Application and Opening Br. at 1-2.) These are not extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling. <em>See Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000) (a pro se prisoner\u2019s ignorance of the law generally does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling and assistance from an inmate law clerk \"does not relieve [a petitioner] from the personal responsibility to comply with the law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
