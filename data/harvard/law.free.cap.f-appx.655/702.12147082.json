O\u2019Brien, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Plaintiff Todd Scribner appeals from the grant of summary judgment entered in favor of defendant Works &amp; Lentz, Inc. (W&amp;L), a debt collector, in this action under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692-1692p. Scribner\u2019s claims arise out of one telephone call made by a W&amp;L employee to the manager of his apartment complex. The district judge decided the call was not a prohibited communication actionable under the FDCPA. Circuit precedent compels us to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Here, Scribner focuses exclusively on whether W&amp;L violated the FDCPA\u2019s qualified restriction on contact with third parties, consisting of \u00a7 1692c(b), which prohibits \u201ccommunication[s]\u201d from debt collectors to third parties \u201cin connection with the collection of any debt,\u201d and \u00a7 1692b, which excepts from that prohibition a one-time communication by a debt collector who, as relevant here, \u201cidentifies] himself, state[s] that he is confirming or correcting location information concerning the consumer,\u201d and does \u201cnot state that such consumer owes any debt.\u201d See <em>Evankavitch v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, </em>793 F.3d 355, 362 (3d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[T]he FDCPA generally prohibits a debt collector from contacting third parties, with the debt collector\u2019s ability to seek location information framed as an exception to this general prohibition,\u201d). In a provision applicable \u25a0 throughout the FDCPA, the term \u201ccommunication\u201d is defined as \u201cthe conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(2). In <em>Marx v. General Revenue Corp., </em>668 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (10th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. granted in part by </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2688, 183 L.Ed.2d 44, <em>and judgment aff'd by </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1166, 185 L.Ed.2d 242 (2013), we decided \u00a7 1692c(b)\u2019s prohibition on third-party contact is limited to communications as defined in \u00a7 1692a(2) and, hence, once it is determined that a debt collector\u2019s contact with a third party (in <em>Marx, </em>a fax seeking to verify the debt- or\u2019s employment) does not convey information about a debt, there can be no violation of \u00a7 1692e(b). <em>Accord Brown v. Van Ru Credit Corp., </em>804 F.3d 740, 742-45 (6th Cir. 2015) (following <em>Marx).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">Turning to the operative facts here, in 2013 W&amp;L was attempting to collect a debt owed by Scribner. On May 30, 2013, W&amp;L employee Erica Pruitt called the manager of Scribner\u2019s apartment complex, Brigitte Coffman, for the purpose (she asserts) of confirming or correcting his current location information. While the record is not entirely clear as to whether Pruitt actually told Coffman this was the purpose of the call,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> another matter is undisputed: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Pruitt did not identify herself or her employer as a debt collector or refer to any debt owed by Scribner. Nor did Coffman understand or infer (from what she was told) the call to be concerned with a debt owed by Scribner. Pruitt did ask Coffman to post a note (to be faxed later) on Scribner\u2019s door\u2014a request calling for a tell-tale answer regarding Scribner\u2019s residence at the complex. Coffman\u2019s response was vague, agreeing only to see what she could do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No fax was ever received from W&amp;L. After concluding the short conversation with Pruitt, Coffman sent a text message about the call to Scribner, which prompted an exchange of multiple messages. Only through the exchange with Scribner did Coffman became aware of an attempt to collect a debt owed by Scribner.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Scribner brought this action alleging Pruitt\u2019s call to Coffman violated several FDCPA proscriptions, including the \u00a7\u00a7 1692c(b)/1692b limitation on third-party communications, the focus of this appeal. In a summary judgment, the district judge concluded the call did not constitute a communication within the meaning of the FDCPA, because the undisputed facts showed it neither directly nor indirectly conveyed information about Scribner\u2019s debt to Coffman. Consequently, relying on <em>Marx, </em>he decided as a matter of law there had been no violation of the cited sections of the FDCPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard as the district court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). <em>Certain Underwriters At Lloyd\u2019s London v. Garmin Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>781 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir. 2015). That is, we will affirm the district court\u2019s determination if \u201c \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Rule 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">While the primary focus of this appeal is on <em>Marx\u2019s, </em>legal holding regarding the interaction of the definition of communication in \u00a7 1692a(2) and the use of that term in \u00a7 1692b(c), Scribner does raise two factual issues. Both concern \u00a7 1692b\u2019s exception of location-information inquiries from \u00a7 1692c(b)\u2019s prohibition on third-party communications. He contends W&amp;L\u2019s showing (for this exception) in support of its motion for summary judgment was deficient because (1) evidence indicated W&amp;L already knew he lived at the apartment complex and (2) there is a genuine dispute as to whether Pruitt told Coffman she was confirming that fact. But these points relate to a factual matter immaterial to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>disposition. If (as, per <em>Marx, </em>we hold below) the absence of \u2022 third-party contact qualifying as a communication under \u00a7 1692a(2) precludes any violation of \u00a7 1692c(b), the question of \u00a7 1692b\u2019s exception for location-information inquiries never arises. To avoid this conclusion, Scribner seems to argue that a failure to satisfy the conditions for \u00a7 1692b\u2019s exception to liability for third-party communications is somehow itself a separate basis for such liability. Leaving aside the logical problem the argument presents, any independent claim under \u00a7 1692b would fail for the same reasons the \u00a7 1692c(b) claim fails. The introductory sentence of \u00a7 1692b states: \u201cAny debt collector <em>communicating </em>with any person other than the consumer for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer shall\u201d satisfy the six conditions that follow. (Emphasis added). Thus, \u00a7 1692b, like \u00a7 1692c(b), is not violated unless (per Marx) the third-party contact qualifies as a communication under \u00a7 1692a(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Which brings us back to the nub of this appeal\u2014the application of <em>Marx\u2019 </em>s holding to Scribner\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1692c(b)/1692b claim. He attempts to avoid this result in two ways. To begin with, he contends <em>Marx </em>is inap-posite because it dealt with a violation of \u00a7 1692c(b) rather than a violation of \u00a7 1692b. As indicated above, this argument appears to rest on a mischaracterization of the role \u00a7 1692b plays in determining an actionable violation of the FDCPA\u2019s qualified prohibition on contact with third parties, which is that of a limited exception to liability under \u00a7 1692e(b), not a separate basis for liability. Moreover, as also noted above, \u00a7 1692b itself refers to communication and hence implicates the definition in \u00a7 1692a(2). Consequently, Marx\u2019s holding that in the absence of a qualifying communication there can be no liability is analytically pertinent in any event. Nothing in <em>Marx </em>suggests its holding would not control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">According to Scribner, applying \u00a7 1692a(2)\u2019s definition of communication in this manner renders the exception in \u00a7 1692b superfluous\u2014a result to be avoided whenever it is possible to do so through a permissible contrary construction of the statute in question, <em>see Marx, </em>668 F.3d at 1183. His argument runs as follows: applying the statutory definition of communication, no actionable violation can arise unless a debt collector \u201cconvey[s] ... information regarding a debt directly or indirectly,\u201d \u00a7 1692(a)(2); but one of the conjunctive conditions for \u00a7 1692b\u2019s exception to liability is that the debt collector \u201cnot state [to the third party] that [the] consumer owes any debt,\u201d \u00a7 1692b(2); thus, the redundant requirement for the reference to debt in both prohibition and exception means that the exception will apply only when it is not needed, i.e., when there could be no violation in the first place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two considerations lead us to reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">First, the argument depends on equating \u00a7 1692a(2)\u2019s broad and inclusive reference to \u201cthe <em>conveying </em>of <em>information regarding </em>a debt <em>directly or indirectly\u201d </em>(emphasis added) with \u00a7 1692b(2)\u2019s strict and specific reference to \u201cstat[ing] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>[the] consumer <em>owes </em>a[] <em>debt\u201d </em>(emphasis added). These are not equivalent. One can convey some information 'regarding a debt (especially indirectly) to a third party so as to trigger \u00a7 1692c(b) without stating \u201cconsumer \u2018x\u2019 owes a debt.\u201d Thus, it appears \u00a7 1692b\u2019s location-information exception may still be available to excuse contact otherwise coming within \u00a7 1692c(b)\u2019s prohibition on third-party communications as defined in \u00a7 1692a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In any event, basically the same redundancy/superfluity argument, directed at one of the other conditions for invoking \u00a7 1692b\u2019s location-information exception, was squarely rejected in <em>Marx. </em>Sub-section 1695b(5) requires the debt collector to avoid use of language or symbols evincing a prohibited \u201ccommunication.\u201d In <em>Marx, </em>this court conceded the debtor\u2019s point that giving effect to the statutory definition of communication made \u00a7 1692b(5) superfluous (because it would be satisfied only when there had been no communication to violate \u00a7 1692c(b) in the first place), but noted \u201c[a] court should not apply the superfluity canon [in construing the statute] unless it first determines that the term being construed is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Marx, </em>668 F.3d at 1183. Holding \u201cthe statutory definition of the key term \u2018communication\u2019 is unambiguous,\u201d <em>Marx </em>\u201cdecline[d] to avoid [the superfluity the term created] by creating an ambiguity where <em>none </em>exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1184. We cannot accept Scribner\u2019s similar argument here without impermissibly diverging from our holding in <em>Marx.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-18\">. In an affidavit Pruitt\u2019s claims to having made a statement about the-purpose of the call. In her affidavit, (consistent with a text she sent Scribner at the time) Coffman denies such \u00e1 statement was made, although her l\u00e1ter equivocal deposition testimony suggests that possibility. As will be evident shortly, this point, which relates only to \u00a7 1692b's excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tion to \u00a7 1692c(b)'s prohibition on third-party communications, is not material; the prohibition was not violated in the first place. Moreover, \u00a7 1692b is inapplicable for the same ' reason \u00a7 1692c(b) is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. In this regard, there is some dispute as to whether Pruitt said Scribner had not been answering phone calls. Coffman affirms it is true; Pruitt denies it. That dispute is also not material to our disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">. At one point he loosely observed that the lack of a qualifying communication precluded any and all claims under the FDCPA. But, as Scribner notes, there are numerous prohibitions in the FDCPA not involving a communication, such as 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692d(l) (prohibiting use of violence or other criminal means for collection purposes), 1692f(2) (prohibiting acceptance of checks or instruments postdated more than five days), 1692f(4) (prohibiting early deposit of postdated checks or instruments), and 1692i (prohibiting filing of collection action in inconvenient forum). Because our holding is restricted to \u00a7\u00a7 1692c(b)/ 1692b, which expressly refer to communications, we affirm without embracing overbroad conclusions about the FDCPA as a whole. Scribner\u2019s several counterexamples do not undermine our more limited holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. Also immaterial, and for the same reasons, is Scribner's complaint that Pruitt exceeded the scope of permissible location-information contact under \u00a7 1692b when she asked about getting a message posted to his door,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. A consequence of this, he adds, is this: if third-party contact does not qualify as corn-munication under \u00a7 1692a(2), the debt collector is free to engage in conduct Congress clearly intended to curb through constraints imposed by the various other requirements for invoking the location-information exception in \u00a7 1692b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
