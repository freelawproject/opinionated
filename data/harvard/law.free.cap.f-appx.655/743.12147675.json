On appeal, Telusme challenges his designation as an armed career criminal under the Arrped Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), claiming that he does not have the three requisite qualifying predicate convictions. After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Telusme\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Ip 2015, a federal grand jury indicted Telpsme for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Telpsme pled guilty to possessing the firearm that year and a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The PSI assigned Telusme a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and gave him a 2-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) because the firearm involved in the offense was stolen. The PSI further reported that Telpsme qualified as an armed career criipinal because he had these three predicate felony convictions under Florida law: (1) one conviction for resisting an officer with violence,. in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01; and (2) two convictions for sale of cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">According to the PSI, Telusme\u2019s conviction for resisting an officer with violence occurred during a traffic stop. An officer pulled Telusme over and, as the officer approached the vehicle, Telusme put the car in reverse and attempted to run over the officer. Afterward, Telusme tried to ram the patrol car and flee from the scene. Telusme eventually abandoned his car when it spun out, and he continued fleeing on foot. When the officer caught up to him, Telusme swung his fists and kicked at the officer. Telusme did not object to these facts in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Due to Telusme\u2019s designation as an armed career criminal, his offense level increased to 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. With a 3-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 30. Telusme had 19 prior convictions, resulting in 20 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI. Taking this together, his advisory guidelines range was 180 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">Telusme did object to the PSI based on a claim that he did not have enough qualifying prior convictions to support an ACCA enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Telusme argued that resisting an officer with violence did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the elements clause in the ACCA because the crime did not contain a \u201cheightened or particularized intent\u201d element with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>to the use of force. Telusme recognized that his argument was foreclosed by United States v. Romo-Villalobos, 674 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir. 2012), but stated that he wished to preserve it for future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Telusme added that the Florida statute criminalizing resisting an officer with violence did not require sufficient \u201cviolent force\u201d to qualify as an ACCA-predicate offense. Telusme also claimed that Romo-Villalobos was wrongly decided and abrogated by recent Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">As to his two Florida sale of cocaine convictions, Telusme contended in his objections to the PSI that sale of cocaine was not an ACCA \u201cserious drug offense\u201d because Florida\u2019s drug statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13, did not contain a mens rea element as to the illicit nature of the substance sold. Telusme recognized, however, that his mens rea argument was foreclosed by United States v. Smith, 775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2014), and stated that he was raising the claim to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The district court overruled Telusme\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 180 months, which was the low end of his advisory guidelines range. Telusme now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Normally, a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces a 120-month maximum sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, under the ACCA, when the defendant has 3 prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense,\u201d he faces an enhanced statutory penalty of \u00cd80 months to life. Id \u00a7 924(e)(1). Whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions are ACCA-predicate offenses is a question this Court reviews de novo. See United States v. Robinson, 583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">A. Sale of Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The ACCA defines a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as, inter alia, \u201can offense under 'State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by \u25a0 law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Under Florida law, it is a crime to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">In Smith, this Court held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the ACCA. 775 F.3d at 1268. This Court pointed out that \u201c[n]o element of mens rea with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance is expressed or implied by\u201d the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d Id. at 1267. The Smith Court determined that the ACCA\u2019s definition was not ambiguous and, therefore, the rule of lenity did not require it to imply a mens rea element. Id As such, this Court has already rejected Telusme\u2019s arguments against using his sale of cocaine convictions as ACCA-predicate offenses..</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Telusme asks us not to follow Smith, though, because he believes that the Smith Court did not consider, or properly consider, the implications of Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), in reaching its holding. Of course, Smith was decided in 2014, well after Begay, and is binding circuit law. See In re Lambrix, 776 F.3d 789, 794 (11th Cir. 2015) (stating that this Court has \u201ccategorically rejected an overlooked reason or argument exception to the prior-panel-precedent rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">We also reject Telusme\u2019s argument that two other post-Smith Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>cases, Elonis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and McFadden,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have abrogated Smith, Those cases did not involve the ACCA at all, much less the definition of a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not err by using Telusme\u2019s two Florida sale of cocaine convictions to increase his statutory maximum penalty under the ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">B. Resisting an Officer with Violence</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... [that] has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 (emphasis added). Under Florida law, \u201c[w]hoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer .., in the execution of legal process or in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ,, is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 848.01 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In United States v. Hill, this Court concluded that the Florida crime of resisting an officer with violence, in violation of \u00a7 843.01, is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause. 799 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 2015) (relying on Romo-Villalobos, 674 F.3d at 1251, which held that resisting an officer with violence is a \"crime of violence\u201d under the analogous elements clause in the Sentencing Guidelines). The Hid. Court observed that Florida\u2019s courts have, held that violence is an essential element of the crime. Id. at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"AtO\">Telusme argues that Moncrieffe v. Holder, 596 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), establish that resisting an officer with violence does not qualify as an ACCA-predicate offense, but all three cases were decided before Hill, a 2015 case directly on point, and none of the cases involved the Florida statute here. See In re Lambrix, 776 F.3d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-18\">Moreover, the crux of Telusme\u2019s argument is that Moncrieffe and Descamps require this Court to consider a Florida state case, State v. Green, 400 So.2d 1322 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981), in evaluating the degree of violence required for a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Telusme argues that Green allows a \u00a7 843.01 conviction based on the de minimis force of wiggling and struggling. However, as Telusme admits, the Romo-Villalobos Court already considered Green and rejected this argument. See Romo-Villalobos, 674 F.3d at 1249 (noting that, in Green, a Florida appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal when the defendant moved pretrial to dismiss the \u00a7 843.01 charge on the ground that he merely wiggled and struggled, but concluding that\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>given the posture of Green and the appellate court\u2019s need to construe all evidence in the state\u2019s favor at the dismissal stage\u2014 Green did not establish that de minimis force was sufficient to establish a violation of \u00a7 843.01), Under our precedent, resisting an officer with violence under \u00a7 843.01 is an ACCA \u201cviolent felony,\u201d and the district court correctly sentenced Telusme as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Telusme\u2019s 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\">. The PSI also stated that Telusme had two convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), which could serve as ACCA-predicate offenses. Both times, Telusme was driving on a suspended license and fled when officers conducted a traffic stop. However, by the time of sentencing, the U.S. Supreme Court had invalidated the residual clause, and the government conceded that the Florida crime of fleeing or attempting to elude was no longer a violent felony. See Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">. Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015) (holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c), which criminalizes the transmission of threatening communications in interstate commerce, requires the government to prove that the defendant was aware of the'threatening nature of the communication).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\">.

We do not resolve this issue because, even applying de novo review as we do above, Telusme\u2019s arguments fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
