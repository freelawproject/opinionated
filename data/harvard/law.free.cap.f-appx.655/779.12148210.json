On appeal, Divine argues that the district court (1) misinterpreted its insurance contract, and (2) erred by discounting its proffered evidence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The relevant factual background is this. On June 20, 2012, Divine purchased the Royal Inn, a two-building property in Live Oak, Florida. The property had previously been run as a motel, until the previous owner defaulted on its mortgage and then ceased operations in November 2011. Rockhill issued an insurance policy to Divine, Insuring the Royal Inn against the risk of physical loss for the period from June 20, 2012, through June 20, 2013. The policy contained a coverage exclusion for rain damage to the building interiors (\u201cthe interior-rain-damage exclusion\u201d), which said: \u201c[Rockhill] will not pay for loss of or damage to ... [t]he interior of any building or structure, or to personal property in the building or structure, caused by or resulting from rain, ... whether driven by wind or not.\u201d The policy contained an exception to this exclusion, providing that Rockhill would pay for damage to the interiors caused by rain if \u201c[t]he building or structure first sustains damage by a Covered Cause of Loss to its roof or walls through which the rain ... enters.\u201d The policy listed \u201cwindstorm\u201d as a covered cause of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">On June 25, 2012, Tropical Storm Debby struck the Live Oak area. During the storm, a significant amount of rainwater entered the Royal Inn buildings, causing damage to the carpeting, drywall, and furnishings. Divine filed a claim under the insurance policy, which Rockhill denied based on the interior-rain-damage exclusion. Divine then sued Rockhill for breach of contract in state court, and Rockhill removed the case to federal district court. In district court, Divine argued that the exception to the interior-rain-damage exclusion applied because rainwater from Tropical Storm Debby. entered the Royal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Inn through portions of the roofs and walls that had been damaged by the storm. Rockhill moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted, concluding that Divine faded to proffer sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the exception applied. Divine filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">We review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard as the district court. Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003). We also review de novo legal questions, including a district court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract. Stephens v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., 749 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">At the summary-judgment stage, we view the material presented and draw all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 789 F.3d 1206, 1213-14 (11th Cir. 2015). Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant demonstrates that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The substantive law applicable to the case determines which facts are material. United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">If the burden of proof is on the nonmov-ant, the movant must either: (1) demonstrate that the nonmovant has failed to proffer sufficient evidence to support an essential element of its case; or (2) proffer affirmative evidence demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to prove an essential element at trial. Id. at 1437-38. If the movant demonstrates the absence of a genuine factual dispute by either method, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant, which must show that a genuine issue remains for trial. Id. at 1438. To discharge this burden, the nonmovant \u201cmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial\u201d and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. Id. (quotations omitted). \u201cAn issue is not \u2018genuine\u2019 if it is unsupported by the evidence or is created by evidence that is \u2018merely colorable\u2019 or \u2018not significantly probative.\u2019\u201d Baloco v. Drummond Co., Inc., 767 F.3d 1229, 1246 (11th Cir. 2014) (quotation omitted), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 410, 193 L.Ed.2d 317 (2015). In other words, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party\u2019s position is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment; there must be evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving] party.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">This diversity ease arises in Florida, and it is undisputed that the substantive law of Florida applies. Under Florida law, courts must construe insurance policies according to their plain meaning and resolve ambiguities in favor of the insured. Intervest Constr. of Jax, Inc. v. Gen. Fid. Ins. Co., 133 So.3d 494, 497 (Fla. 2014). However, the insured has the burden to prove its claim is covered under the policy. E. Fla. Hauling, Inc. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 913 So.2d 673, 678 (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. 2005). Where, as here, the policy is an \u201call-risk\u201d policy, \u201crecovery ... will as a rule be allowed for all fortuitous losses not resulting from misconduct or fraud unless the policy contains' a specific provision ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>pressly excluding the loss from coverage.\u201d Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Branch, 234 So.2d 396, 398 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 1970). Once the insured establishes \u201ca loss apparently witliin the terms of the policy,\u201d the burden shifts to the insurer to prove an exclusion applies. Id. If an exception to the exclusion exists, the burden shifts back to the insured to prove the exception applies. E. Fla. Hauling, 913 So.2d at 678; see La-Farge Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 118 F.3d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The operative issue in this case is whether Divine satisfied its burden\u2014at the summary-judgment stage\u2014to prove that the exception to the interior-rain-damage exclusion applied, by showing that Tropical Storm' Debby damaged parts of the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs or walls through which rainwater entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Divine first argues that the district court erred by relying on Florida Windstorm Underwriting v. Gajwani, 934 So.2d 501 (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. 2005), and requiring it to prove that wind from Tropical Storm Debby created an \u201copening\u201d in the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs or walls through which rainwater entered. Divine contends that, unlike in the policy at issue in Gajwani,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the exception in its insurance policy requires only \u201cdamage\u201d to the roof or walls through which rain enters, not an \u201copening.\u201d Divine maintains that the deposition testimony of structural engineer Michael Linehan, who performed a cause- and-origin analysis of the rain damage for Rockhill, demonstrated that rainwater entered the Royal Inn through damage to the walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Linehan performed a visual assessment of the property on July 12, 2012\u2014about two weeks after the storm\u2014and he issued his cause-and-origin report about a month and a half later, on August 28, 2012. In his report, Linehan identified the two buildings making up the Royal Inn as Building A and Building B. He concluded that rainwater from Tropical Storm Debby entered both buildings through gaps under the exterior entry doors and sliding glass doors of the individual room units. He opined that rainwater also entered Building B via \u201c[ljeaks through the exterior two-story south concrete masonry unit (CMU) wall as a result of a temporary overwhelming and saturation of the referenced CMU wall components in response to wind-driven rain with Tropical Storm Debby.\u201d Linehan explained that concrete block walls like Building B\u2019s south CMU wall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">[are made of] cementitious material, so they ... absorb moisture. It\u2019s considered a mass wall type system. So even if it\u2019s covered with cladding, like stucco, which is also cementitious, it is very normal for water to be absorbed and then dry out over time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-12\">That does not typically create a problem to the interior finishes because the mass of the wall is so great that water will typically not penetrate through the depth of the cladding and the complete width of the wall to negatively affect the interior finishes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">In this case, Tropical Storm Debby was a severe rain event and there [were] also other issues independent of simply hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ing a mass wall. There are cracks in the wall. There were other factors where water could have entered because of the cracks or deficient waterproofing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">But, in general, it was such a severe rain event that I do believe it was possible water could have seeped all the way-through the block wall without these other issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Divine focuses on Linehan\u2019s statement that heavy rains from Tropical Storm Debby caused temporary saturation of Building B\u2019s south CMU wall. It contends that the saturation constituted \u201cdamage\u201d through which the rainwater entered. However, Divine has not pointed to any evidence that the CMU wall was, in fact, damaged during the storm. Linehan testified that it is normal for concrete block walls to absorb water and that Building B\u2019s south CMU wall \u201ctemporarily\u201d became saturated during the storm so that rainwater likely seeped through it into the interi- or of the building. Linehan\u2019s testimony indicates that the wall functioned as it was designed to function and, because of the quantity of rain that fell during Tropical Storm Debby, some rainwater penetrated into the interior of Building B. Divine has not pointed to any evidence indicating the wall was not able to \u201cdry out over time\u201d\u2014 as Linehan testified these walls are designed to do\u2014or that Tropical Storm Debby otherwise caused damage to the wall through which the rainwater entered. Accordingly, the district court did not err in rejecting Divine\u2019s argument that saturation of Building B\u2019s south CMU wall constituted \u201cdamage by a Covered Cause of Loss to [Royal Inn\u2019s] roof or walls through which the rain ... enter[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Divine next argues that, even if an opening is required for the exception to apply, it proffered sufficient evidence to show that winds from Tropical Storm Debby created openings in the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs through which rainwater entered. Divine relies on the deposition testimony of: (1) Rockhill\u2019s insurance adjuster, Brian O\u2019Connor; (2) Linehan; and (3) Thomas Miller, an engineer Divine retained to perform a \u201cwater intrusion assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">O\u2019Connor inspected the Royal Inn about a week after Tropical Storm Debby hit. During his inspection, O\u2019Connor observed \u201cthree areas of the roof which were pulled up from the membrane.\u201d The areas consisted of \u201cthree strips measuring approximately six inches in width and varied in length from 5 feet to 8 feet.\u201d O\u2019Connor could not tell if the strips had been damaged by wind from Tropical Storm Debby, nor could he tell if rainwater had entered through the strips. Consequently, Rockhill retained Linehan to conduct a eause-and-origin analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Linehan concluded that rainwater did not enter Building B through the roof during Tropical Storm Debby. However, on Building A, Linehan observed \u201cdeteriorated sealants\u201d and \u201cunadhered, overlapped cap sheet of the modified bitumen roofing membrane\u201d which, he concluded, allowed rain to enter during the storm. Linehan opined, however, that these openings existed prior to Tropical Storm Debby, and had not been created or even exacerbated by winds from the storm. He based this conclusion on the weathering patterns surrounding the openings and the \u201cdistinct lack of wind-related damage\u201d to the roof as a whole, such as heavier patterns of damage to the edges of the roof, torn or missing portions of cap sheet, and missing or torn away gutters and downspouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">During his deposition, Rockhill\u2019s counsel questioned Linehan about an appraisal of the Royal Inn, done in April 2012\u2014nearly three months before Tropical Storm Deb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>by hit the Live Oak area. The appraisal report concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">[T]he subject motel facility is in poor cpndition and several items of deferred maintenance and damage to the buildings were noted.... The exterior of the building requires painting and based on interior signs of roof leakage, the roofs either need to be repaired or replaced. Damage to the interior rooms of the facility noted included several holes in the drywall walls, damaged ceramic tile in the guest rooms, missing or damaged acoustical ceiling tiles, water damaged drywall ceilings, soiled carpets, and mildewed and damaged furniture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Linehan testified that he had not been awqre of the appraisal report at the time he conducted his cause-and-origin analysis, but the report supported his conclusions. In particular, the fact that the furniture was mildewed \u201cstrongly suggested] a moisture problem,\u201d which was \u201cconsistent with [the] preexisting roof leaks ... documented in [his] report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Thomas Miller conducted his water intrusion assessment in March 2014, almost two years after Tropical Storm Debby. Based on his inspection and conversations with the property owner, Miller documented significant water damage to the interior of the Royal Inn, including the carpeting, ceiling, and drywall. He concluded, \u201cwithin a reasonable professional probability,\u201d that water intrusion from Tropical Storm Debby was the cause of the damage. Miller testified that Divine did not ask him to determine whether Tropical Storm Debby had caused any 'wind damage to the roofs or walls of the Royal Inn buildings, and his assessment report did not address that issue. However, Miller was aware of Line-han\u2019s August 28, 2012 report, which concluded that the buildings had not sustained any wind damage during the storm. Miller disagreed with Linehan\u2019s conclusion. He identified a photograph in Linehan\u2019s report, which he included in his own assessment report, depicting a breach in the roof about one square foot in size. Miller believed the breach could have been caused by winds from Tropical Storm Debby. He clarified, however, that he had not been asked to assess whether the buildings had sustained any wind damage, and he was \u201cnot saying that [the photo depicted] wind damage.\u201d He was \u201cjust saying [he couldn\u2019t] rule it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Divine maintains that the testimony of O\u2019Connor, Linehan, and Miller created a genuine factual dispute about whether Tropical Storm Debby created openings in the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs through which rainwater entered. The district court rejected this argutnent. It concluded that Miller\u2019s statement that he could not rule out wind as a cause of the roof damage Linehan documented amounted to a mere scintilla of evidence, from which a reasonable jury could not conclude that Tropical Storm Debby, in fact, caused roof damage to the Royal Inn through which rainwater entered. The district court noted that Miller\u2019s statement concerning the cause of the roof damage was outside the scope of his investigation. The court also noted that Miller did not opine that wind had actually caused roof damage and he provided no analysis that contradicted Linehan\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Divine argues that the district court erred in finding that its proffered evidence on the cause of the roof damage amounted to a mere scintilla that was insufficient to survive summary judgment. We disagree. While O\u2019Connor, Linehan, and Miller all investigated the damage inflicted on the Royal Inn by Tropical Storm Debby, none of them came to the conclusion that the property sustained roof damage during the storm through which rainwater entered. O\u2019Connor testified only that he observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>three areas of the roof that could have been damaged by winds from Tropical Storm Debby, but he was unsure whether the damage pre-existed the storm. Line-han testified that winds from Tropical Storm Debby had not caused any roof damage at the Royal Inn and that the roof damage he observed pre-existed the storm. Miller, whom Divine retained to investigate water intrusion at the Royal Inn, did not form an opinion as to whether Tropical Storm Debby caused roof damage. He merely identified a photograph in Line-han\u2019s report depicting roof damage and stated\u2014without any supporting analysis\u2014 that he could not rule out wind as a cause of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">On this record\u2014which includes the pre-storm appraisal report noting the need for roof repairs and the presence of mildew on the Royal Inn\u2019s furniture\u2014we conclude that Miller\u2019s testimony failed to \u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical [possibility]\u201d that Tropical Storm Debby damaged the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769. Miller\u2019s testimony that he could not rule out wind from Tropical Storm Debby as a cause of the roof damage depicted in one of Linehan\u2019s photos constituted \u201cmerely colorable\u201d evidence that Tropical Storm Debby created openings in the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs through which rainwater entered. See Baloco, 767 F.3d at 1246. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Miller\u2019s testimony amounted to a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence, which was insufficient to survive Rockhill\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">Divine also argues that the district court erroneously resolved a credibility dispute between Linehan and Miller in favor of Rockhill. Again, we disagree. It\u2019s true that Miller\u2019s statement that he could not rule out wind from Tropical Storm Debby as a cause of damage to the Royal Inn\u2019s roofs was at odds with Lmehan s expert opinion that the Royal Inn did not sustain any roof damage during the storm. However, as discussed above, Miller did not offer an opinion as to the cause of the roof damage and he did not testify that the damage was caused by the storm. The district court did not discredit Miller\u2019s testimony. Instead, the court found that the testimony was insufficient to prove that winds from Tropical Storm Debby did, in fact, cause roof damage through which rainwater entered. And as we\u2019ve already concluded, the district court did not err in determining that Miller\u2019s testimony was insufficient to discharge Divine\u2019s burden at summary judgment to create a genuine factual dispute on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">.
