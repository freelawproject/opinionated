The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County due to White\u2019s failure to (1) provide the amount of overtime compensation due and (2) establish a fact issue showing that the County\u2019s actions would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d White\u2019s protected activity under the FLSA. White appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to his retaliation claim. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-25\">The relevant facts in this c\u00e1se are not in dispute. Between December 2006 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>April 2013, White served as a Detention Officer with the sheriffs office in Denton County, Texas. In August 2012, White contacted County Treasurer, Cindy Brown, to notify her of his concerns that the County was neither properly nor timely paying him at time-and-a-half over his regular pay for overtime hours worked during multiple fourteen-day work periods. He filed suit five months later in January of 2013 against the County for its alleged violation of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">On April 5, 2013, White was involved in an excessive force incident while on duty at the county jail. Approximately twenty to thirty minutes before \u201clights out,\u201d and after entering the barracks where inmates were housed in the jail to conduct a time check,' White approached inmate Phillip Harrison SO # 59300 (\u201cHarrison\u201d) from behind. Harrison, who did not see White or appear to know that White was approaching him, was seated on two stacked milk crates in the middle of the room. White planted his right foot just behind the milk crates, brought his left leg into a swinging position, and kicked the crates from underneath Harrison. He extended his hands and quickly placed them behind Harrison easing Harrison\u2019s fall to the ground. While several others around Harrison laughed at his fall, Harrison cried out. White walked away smiling and Harrison remained on the floor for eight minutes. Shortly after returning to a seated position on the crates, Harrison walked toward White with a heavy limp and told an officer seated next to White that he has \u201cdecided'to let [White] keep his job.\u201d Although Harrison did not request medical attention of his own volition\u2014he walked away from his conversation with White, laughing, and with no limp at all\u2014Joseph Connolly, the Lieutenant for Professional Standards in the Denton County Sheriffs Office, recommended that Harrison undergo a medical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">.The Denton County Sheriffs Office maintains a Professional Standards Unit which, under \u2019the direction of Sheriff William Travis, addresses both background investigations of prospective employees and Internal Affairs Investigations of current employees. Assistant Chief Deputy Roy Davenport, who was the Assistant Chief in Charge of the jail at the time of the April incident; notified Chief Deputy Rex George of White\u2019s physical altercation with Harrison. Chief Deputy George notified Sheriff Travis. Chief Deputy George serves as the designee for Sheriff Travis, reviewing and determining what disciplinary action should be taken with regard to an officer\u2019s violation of department rules. Both Sheriff Travis and Chief Deputy George reviewed the video of the altercation between White and Harrison and agreed that the matter would go forward for investigation with Internal Affairs by Lieutenant Connolly. At the time, Chief Deputy George was aware that White was involved in the underlying lawsuit against the County. Sheriff Travis testified that when he originally viewed the video of the April incident and concluded that termination was warranted, he did not know that White had sued the County. On April 12, 2013, White was placed on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Lieutenant Connolly conducted an internal investigation into White\u2019s conduct. As part of his employment, White was responsible for performing specialized law enforcement work in the care and security of inmates to ensure their constitutional rights and welfare are safeguarded in the county jail. However, in a post-investigation memorandum, Lieutenant Connolly described White\u2019s behavior as \u201coutside the scope of his responsibilities,\u201d \u201cirresponsible,\u201d \u201cimmature,\u201d having \u201cthe potential to create liability,\u201d \u201cset[ting] a poor exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>pie,\u201d and \u201cpossibly constituting] criminal conduct and/or a violation of the inmate\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Lieutenant Connolly was aware that White filed a lawsuit against the County at the time of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Although Lieutenant Connolly did not recommend any particular disciplinary action at that time, he described White\u2019s conduct as \u201can offense serious enough to warrant termination.\u201d The Sheriffs Office Civil Service Commission is the body that has final authority regarding the conclusion of the investigation and determines what disciplinary action, if any, is warranted. Following the Internal Affairs investigation, Chief Deputy George recommended to Sheriff Travis that White be terminated. Sheriff Travis agreed, and Chief Deputy George terminated White on April 23, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">On or about January 10, 2013, White sued the County alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>three violations of the FLSA for (1) forced payment of compensatory time in- lieu of straight time, (2) forced compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay, and (3) failure to timely pay both straight time and overtime pay. After his termination, White filed a Second Amended Complaint, asserting that the County retaliated against him in violation of the FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a). White also sought declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, and class certification of similarly situated employees. On March 28, 2014, the district court dismissed White\u2019s claims for forced compensatory time in lieu of straight time and for failure to pay straight time and his request for declaratory judgment. The County moved for summary judgment on White\u2019s remaining claims, which the district court granted. White timely appealed the grant of summary judgment only as to his retaliation claim. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that the district court applied. <em>See Harvill v. Westward Commc\u2019ns, L.L.C., </em>433 F.3d 428, 433-34 (5th Cir. 2005).\u2019 Summary judgment is proper if the evidence shows that there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Kee v. City of Rowlett, </em>247 F.3d 206, 210 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). We view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Crawford v. Formosa Plastics Corp., </em>234 F.3d 899, 902 (5th Cir. 2000). \u201cEven if we do not agree with the reasons given by the district court to support summary judgment, we may affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>661 F.3d 216, 221 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Lifecare Hosps., Inc. v. Health Plus of La., Inc., </em>418 F.3d 436, 439 (5th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">The primary issue on appeal is whether the trial court correctly granted the County\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as to White\u2019s FLSA retaliation claim. The FLSA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person ... to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). White\u2019s claim is that the County retaliated against him in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>tion of the FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation provisions for filing his January 2013 lawsuit. \u201cAn employee asserting retaliation under the FLSA may proceed in one of two ways: by direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Monroe Firefighters Ass\u2019n v. City of Monroe, </em>No. CIV.A. 06-CV-1092, 2009 WL 772829, at *3 (W.D. La. Mar. 17, 2009). \u00edf a plaintiff does not have direct evidence of retaliation, then his claim is subject to the traditional burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green. See Kanida v. Gulf Coast Med. Personnel LP, </em>363 F.3d 568, 577 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting retaliation claims under the FLSA are subject to the Title VII <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis). As no direct evidence of retaliation has been presented in this case, we proceed in light of <em>SfcDonnell Douglas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">To establish <em>a prima facie </em>claim of retaliation under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) participation in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment ac-tiorj.; and (3) a causal link between the activity and the adverse action. <em>See Hagan v. EchoStar Satellite, L.L.C., </em>529 F.3d 617, 624 (5th Cir. 2008). If a plaintiff meets this initial burden, the defendant must then articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. <em>Id. </em>The burden thep shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Neither White nor the County disputes that White engaged in a statutorily protected activity or that he suffered an adverse employment action. Three months prior to his termination, White lodged a personal complaint about the wage and hour practices of his employer and asserted a right adverse to the County; he was fired soon thereafter. With respect to the third prong, White argues that because his termination occurred \u201ca mere three months\u201d after the underlying lawsuit was filed, he has established a causal connection between both events. White also attempts to bolster his argument that because decision-making County officials had knowledge of his lawsuit, he has established a causal link.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Assuming without deciding that the evidence presented is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the County has satisfied its burden of establishing a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing White: White\u2019s excessive use of force against an inmate in violation of the County\u2019s policy. According to the record, White was terminated for \u201cintentionally and recklessly\u201d kicking two stacked milk crates, causing an inmate to fall to the floor in a supine position, in violation of various provisions of the Denton County Sheriffs Office Code of Conduct. In support of its finding that White should be terminated, the County presented evidence including a video depicting physical action taken against the inmate and the affidavits of Lieutenant Connolly, Sheriff Travis, and others. The unprofessional use of force by White, even if in jest, presents sufficient justification for the County\u2019s decision to terminate White, as he was in violation of the County\u2019s clear and undisputed policies. <em>See McCoy, </em>492 F.3d at 561-62 (concluding that the city\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for retrieving a police lieutenant\u2019s badge and gun and placing the lieutenant on leave stemmed from unwanted workplace conduct and the need to comply with rules administered by the city).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">Assuming a <em>prima facie </em>case, and in light of the County\u2019s legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for White\u2019s termination, White must present evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the County\u2019s reason was pretext. <em>\u201cA </em>plaintiff may establish pretext either through evidence of disparate treatment or by showing that the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>er\u2019s proffered explanation is false or unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Laxton v. Gap Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir. 2003). \u201cAn explanation is false or unworthy of credence if it is not the real reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether pretext is present, we note that the issue here is not whether the County made an erroneous decision, but whether that decision was made with a retaliatory motive. <em>See Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Relying on <em>Pittman v. Collins, </em>White cites the following to establish pretext: (1) knowledge of White\u2019s lawsuit by those making the decision to terminate him; (2) the County\u2019s failure to adhere to established Sheriffs Office policies; (3) the County\u2019s discriminatory treatment of White in comparison to similarly situated employees; (4) evidence that the County\u2019s stated reason for discharge was false; and (5) Sheriff Travis\u2019s expression of a negative attitude toward employees who sue the County. <em>See </em>No. 4:08-CV-257, 2010 WL 1330752, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">First, White\u2019s attempt to prove pretext by showing that County decision-makers knew of his lawsuit and took an adverse employment action shortly thereafter fails. While close timing may be sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201conce the employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that explains both the adverse action and the timing, the plaintiff must offer some evidence from which the jury may infer that retaliation was the real motive.\u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Swanson v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>110 F.3d 1180, 1188 (5th Cir.1997)); <em>see also id. </em>(concluding that knowledge of a protected activity, without evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that defendant\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual, such as evidence of past discriminatory conduct toward plaintiff, is insufficient to survive summary judgment). At the time of Sheriff Travis\u2019s recommendation that White be terminated, he was -unaware that White had a suit pending against the County. White has failed to traverse this testimony. Furthermore, Lieutenant Connolly testified that, in conducting his investigation, knowledge of White\u2019s lawsuit in an unrelated matter did not impact his investigation nor did Lieutenant Connolly receive pressure, either formally or informally, to sustain an allegation against White.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">White\u2019s second claim\u2014that the County failed to adhere to established policy\u2014fails to pass muster. White cites no internal policy that was violated in carrying out his termination, nor is White\u2019s claim that his conduct was trivial sufficient to show pretext, as he was in clear violation of County policy. <em>See Pittman, </em>2010 WL 1330752, at *5 (\u201c[T]he undisputed evidence indicates Plaintiff was terminated for failure to comply with the County\u2019s uniform policy.\u201d); <em>see also Paris v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., </em>542 Fed.Appx. 370, 375 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Third, White points to alleged examples of disparate treatment to show pretext. He contends that numerous other detention officers violated County policies but were not terminated. \u201c[A]n employee who proffers a fellow employee as a comparator in an employment discrimination case [must] demonstrate that the employment actions at issue were taken under nearly identical circumstances.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 260 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe employment actions being compared will be deemed to have been taken under nearly identical circumstances when the employees being compared held the same job or responsibilities, shared the same supervisor or had their employment status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>determined by the same person, and have essentially comparable violation histories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While White has proffered evidence of several other incidents between detention officers and inmates, none involved the same supervisor nor was the employment decision made by the same person. Thus, in order to show pretext, White must present evidence of an employee who engaged in similar conduct, shared the same job or responsibilities as White- and who had comparable violation history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">He has failed to do so. Specifically, White points to a 2009 incident involving a verbal altercation with an inmate and a 2011 incident that involved mistreatment of and denying privileges to inmates. However, Sheriff Travis was not in charge at the time. Even if White could point to these instances, they are not sufficient. In both scenarios the officers received suspension without pay for two to three days for their \u201cunbecoming conduct.\u201d But neither of these incidents involved an officer instigating an unprovoked physical altercation. And indeed, the most similar incident to White\u2019s conduct occurred in 2011 and involved a former detention officer who was terminated after entering an inmate\u2019s cell, grabbing the inmate by the throat, and choldng him. Although White attempts to distinguish his conduct from that of another terminated officer, we conclude that this 2011 incident is most similar to White\u2019s conduct, as both detention officer\u2019s conduct involved unprovoked physical force. Just as termination was warranted there, White\u2019s physical force, however mild or in jest, warranted termination under the County\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">White also stated that his conduct occurred under nearly identical circumstances to a fourth incident involving an officer who lifted and slammed an arrestee on the ground while searching him in a holding area; that officer was not terminated. Although both scenarios involved physical force, we agree with the district court that unlike the instant case, the cited altercation involved a heightened security scenario and a potential for a struggle which warranted some use of physical conduct. Accordingly, White has failed to demonstrate that he was treated differently from similarly situated employees under nearly identical circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Next, although White argues the falsity of the County\u2019s non-retaliatory reasons, he has presented no evidence of inconsistencies or shifting explanations for his firing. <em>See Nasti v. CIBA Specialty Chems. Corp., </em>492 F.3d 589, 594 (5th Cir. 2007). In fact, the thorough investigation conducted by Lieutenant Connolly\u2014which included multiple interviews and the review of video surveillance\u2014along with the objective nature of the lieutenant\u2019s investigation greatly reduces the likelihood that the County\u2019s legitimate reason for terminating White is a pretext for an unlawful purpose. <em>See Jones v. Overnite Transp. Co., </em>212 Fed. Appx. 268, 274-76 (5th Cir. 2006). \u201cOur job as a reviewing court conducting a pretext analysis is not to engage in second-guessing of an employer\u2019s business decisions.\u201d <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 391 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Finally, White argues that Sheriff Travis possessed discriminatory animus generally towards those who have filed suit against the County and that this animus influenced the decision to terminate White. In an October 2012 letter to a former Denton County officer who sued the County following his firing, Sheriff Travis stated that the officer should, instead of suing, \u201chave enough self respect [sic] to go find another job and show that person, you never slowed me down!\u201d Sheriff Travis then went on to inform the former officer that he would need to drop his lawsuit if he ever again intended to work for the Denton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>County Sheriffs Office. While Sheriff Travis did express a negative attitude toward another detention officer\u2019s filing of a lawsuit against the County, White fails to point to any evidence that Sheriff Travis directed any animus toward White specifically. <em>See, e.g., Bergen v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>368 F.Supp.2d 567, 582 (N.D. Tex. 2005) (finding that a general negative attitude, by itself, is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact of a retaliatory motive in defendant\u2019s decision to terminate plaintiff because \u201c[t]he context and content of [defendant\u2019s] remark [wa]s devoid of any expression of a negative attitude toward [plaintiff]\u201d.).' Although Sheriff Travis\u2019s statement may indicate a general negative attitude, by itself, it is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact of a retaliatory motive in the County\u2019s decision to terminate White. <em>Id. </em>Since we have considered the remainder of White\u2019s evi-dentiary proffer and found it insufficient, White has failed to produce substantial evidence of pretext outside of Sheriff Travis\u2019s letter. <em>See, e.g., Ray v. United Parcel Serv., </em>587 Fed.Appx. 182, 195-96 (5th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that White has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext. There is no dispute that White engaged in excessive force in violation of County policy. Thus, White\u2019s belief that the County\u2019s \u201cdecision was motivated by discrimination, however genuinely held, is not sufficient evidence of pretext.\u201d <em>Septimus v. Univ. of Houston, </em>399 F.3d 601, 610 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>see also Ross v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, </em>139 F.3d 521, 526-27 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that the plaintiffs generalized statements about relative qualifications or treatment of similarly situated employees is insufficient to defeat summary judgment). Because White has failed to create a fact issue as to pretext, he has not shown that he would not have been terminated but for his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1043-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
