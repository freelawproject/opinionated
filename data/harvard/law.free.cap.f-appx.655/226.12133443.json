She was found ineligible for cancellation of removal because she had not shown that her Texas conviction for possession with the intent to deliver a controlled substance did not constitute an aggravated felony. Reyes Alvarado contends that the Texas statute under which she was convicted, Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112, is not divisible. Accordingly, she argues that, in analyzing whether her conviction for violating \u00a7 481.112 constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), we are limited to the categorical approach and prohibited from employing the modified categorical approach. She further argues that, because \u00a7 481.112 criminalizes offers to sell a controlled substance and the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) does not, a violation of \u00a7 481.112 may or may not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). As a result, Reyes Alvarado argues that a violation of \u00a7 481.112 is categorically not an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and the BIA committed error in dismissing her appeal on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Reyes Alvarado also argues that the BIA erred by relying on <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2007), in dismissing her appeal. She claims that <em>Ford </em>is inapposite because it only addressed whether a violation of \u00a7 481.112 constituted a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and not a felony under the CSA. Reyes argues that the Guideline\u2019s definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), differs from \u00a7 481.112 in that the controlled substances covered under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and \u00a7 481.112, respectively, are not exactly the same and, therefore, that \u00a7 481.112 is both broader and narrower than \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is ineligible for discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal is a question of law that [this court] review[s] de novo, deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.\u201d <em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 715 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). An aggravated felony conviction makes an alien ineligible for cancellation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>removal. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). A conviction for \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18)\u201d qualifies as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Reyes Alvarado has the burden of establishing that she is eligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Le v. Lynch, </em>819 F.3d 98, 105 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A)); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">As a preliminary matter, \u25a0we hold that Reyes Alvarado has not properly exhausted her claim that the BIA\u2019s reliance on <em>Ford </em>in dismissing her appeal was error. Despite the fact that both the immigration judge and the BIA relied upon <em>Ford </em>in their decisions, Reyes Alvarado never raised her arguments concerning Ford\u2014and the distinction between the controlled substances covered by \u00a7 481.112 and \u00a7 4B 1.2(b)\u2014with the BIA, either in her appeal brief or through a motion for reconsideration. By failing to do sp, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies as to this claim, and such a failure constitutes a jurisdictional bar to our review. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir. 2009); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, Reyes Alvarado\u2019s petition will be dismissed, in part, on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As concerns Reyes Alvarado\u2019s divisibility argument, this court has already conclusively found that \u00a7 481.112 is divisible. <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 459 (5th Cir. 2014) (\u201cBecause \u00a7 48\u00cd .112(a) criminalizes discrete acts\u2014 manufacturing,, delivering, and possessing with intent to deliver\u2014it is divisible.\u201d). Reyes Alvarado\u2019s arguments to the contrary are' unavailing. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 1993) (holding that one panel of this coqrt cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court). Because \u00a7 481.112 is divisible, we can implement the modified categorical approach, and look to the documents relevant to Reyes Alvarado\u2019s conviction to determine whether it constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>See Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Reyes Alvarado\u2019s conviction records reveal that she was convicted of the following offense in violation of \u00a7 481.112: \u201cPossession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Deliver, Methamphetamine, 4-200 grams.\u201d In <em>Vasquez-Martinez, </em>we conclusively held that a conviction under \u00a7 481.112 for \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d was a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d and an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). 564 F.3d at 718-19. Because it is clear that Reyes Alvarado was convicted of possession with an intent to deliver under \u00a7 481.112\u2014and we are bound by our holding in <em>Vasquez-Martinez </em>that a conviction under \u00a7 481.112 for possession with the intent to deliver is an aggravated felony for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)\u2014we hold that the BIA did not err in concluding that (i) Reyes Alvarado failed to satisfy her burden of establishing that she had not been convicted of an aggravated felony and (ii) she was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
