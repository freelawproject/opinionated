His sentence was based on a clause in \u00a7 2262A that authorizes 15 to 40 years in prison when a defendant \u201chas a prior conviction .,. under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). Without a prior conviction like this, \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) authorizes 5 to 20 years in prison for \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) violations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Caldwell argues his sentence is unlawful for four reasons. First, he argues that the term \u201crelating to\u201d in \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) is unconstitutionally vague. Second, he argues that an Iowa conviction for indecent contact with a child is not an offense \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d Third, he argues that a jury needed to decide if the Iowa offense was \u201crelat[ed] to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d Fourth, he argues that his prior conviction can\u2019t be used to increase his sentence because he pleaded guilty to the prior offense without admitting guilt. We reject each of these arguments and affirm Caldwell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">Caldwell first claims that \u00a7 2252A(b)(l)\u2019s \u201crelating to\u201d language makes the statute unconstitutionally vague. In the alternative, he argues that the rule of lenity requires us to construe this ambiguous language in his favor. Both are questions of first impression for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-20\">The Supreme Court has explained that the government violates the Fifth Amendment \u201cby taking away someone\u2019s life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\u201d Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2556, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). \u201cThese principles apply not only to statutes defining elements of crimes, but also to statutes fixing sentences.\u201d Id. at 2257; see also United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 123, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2204, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979) (\u201c[V]ague sentencing provisions may pose constitutional questions if they do not state with sufficient clarity the consequences of violating a given criminal statute.\u201d). Also, these principles apply even if a vague sentencing statute can be read to cover <em>some </em>conduct. See Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2560-61 (\u201c[Ajlthough statements in some of our opinions could be read to suggest otherwise, our <em>holdings </em>squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the provision\u2019s grasp.\u201d); Instead, the test for whether the vagueness doctrine voids a law is whether the law is so incoherent that it either \u201cdenies fair notice to defendants\u201d or \u201cinvites arbitrary enforcement by judges.\u201d Id. at 2557.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The rule of lenity creates a related but distinct limitation. This \u201ccanon of strict interpretation of criminal statutes\u201d is a \u201cjunior version of the vagueness doctrine\u201d and \u201censures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered.\u201d United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1225, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quotation omitted). The canon \u201capplies not only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The statute at issue here requires a minimum 15-year prison sentence if a defendant has \u201ca prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). This language is identical to language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) that also requires a minimum 15-year prison sentence. The Supreme Court recently interpreted the identical \u00a7 2252(b)(1) language in Lockhart v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 958, 194 L.Ed.2d 48 (2016), and held that the term \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d in \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d rather than all of \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct.\u201d Id. at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Lockhart didn\u2019t address the vagueness doctrine, but the opinion shows why neither \u00a7 2252(b)(1) nor \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) are unconstitutionally vague. Lockhart rejected the argument that \u00a7 2252(b)(1) should be construed using the rule of lenity. Id. at 968. This shows that the Supreme Court saw no reason to doubt that \u00a7 2252(b)(1) \u201censures fair warning.\u201d Lanier, 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. at 1225 (quotation omitted). The Court interpreted the language in \u00a7 2252(b)(1) based on what it called \u201ca sensible grammatical principle buttressed by the statute\u2019s text and structure.\u201d Id. Although Lockhart interpreted the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d rather than \u201crelating to,\u201d the opinion shows that the language of \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) can be read and applied in a coherent way.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This means \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) isn\u2019t \u201cso vague that it fails to give ordinary people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>fair notice of the conduct it punishes.\u201d Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Even without, Lockhart, it\u2019s clear that the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d doesn\u2019t make \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) unconstitutionally vague. Caldwell points to nothing that suggests that those two words in any way compare to the \u201cindeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry required by the\u201d language discussed in Johnson. Id. at 2557. Nor does he argue that courts have struggled in any way to make sense of either this phrase of any similar phrase in another context. And he does not show that either executive or judicial interpretations of this term have been at all inconsistent, unpredictable, or arbitrary. All he says is that \u201crelating to\u201d can be read broadly, to cover many state offenses \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d This breadth alone does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Caldwell next argues that his Iowa conviction for indecent contact with a minor is not an offense \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d When determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing purposes, courts apply what is called a \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d This means we look only to the elements of the earlier conviction and compare those elements to the elements of the offense mentioned in the federal statute. See generally Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). For traditional offenses like burglary, this comparison is based on the historical, generic definition of the offense. Id. at 598-602, 110 S.Ct. at 2158-60. For non-traditional offenses like sexual abuse, we simply interpret the plain language of the statute. See United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d 778, 784 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">We have interpreted the phrase \u201csexual abuse of minor\u201d to \u201cmean[ ] a physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d United States v. Padilla-Reyes, 247 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir. 2001). This</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">includes acts that involve physical contact between the perpetrator and the victim as well as acts that do not.... Furthermore, the modifier \u2018sexual\u2019 does not limit the phrase\u2019s scope to abuse of the physical variety. Rather than describing the form of the abuse as a \u2018sexual\u2019 physical contact, we think the word \u2018sexual\u2019 in the phrase \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 indicates that- the perpetrator\u2019s intent in committing the abuse is to seek libidinal gratification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Id. We have thus held that \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is not limited \u201cto instances where the perpetrator is present in front of the minor, where the minor is aware of the abuse, or where the perpetrator makes contact with the minor.\u201d Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Also, we have \u201cinterpreted the phrase \u2018relating to\u2019 broadly in the context of child exploitation offenses.\u201d United States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1284 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). The Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">has also interpreted the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d in an inclusive fashion. In Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., the Court considered the phrase in the context of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1) and determined that it means \u201cto stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.... \u201d Likewise, although not binding on us, the Ninth Circuit has similarly interpreted the statute in question, stating that \u201c\u00a7 2252A does not simply mandate a sentencing enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>for individuals convicted of state offenses <em>equivalent </em>to sexual abuse. Rather, it mandates the enhancement for any state offense that stands in some relation, bears upon, or is associated with that generic offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">United States v. McGarity, 669 F.3d 1218, 1262 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). McGarity held that \u00a7 2252A(b)(l)'covered a Georgia state conviction for \u201centicing a minor for .indecent purposes,\u201d even though the \u201cconviction was not predicated on touching or attempting to touch a minor\u201d and was instead \u201cfounded upon [the defendant\u2019s] discussions of illicit sexual acts with a minor.\u201d Id. at 1261-62. We held that these \u201cactions necessarily related to \u2018aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Here, Caldwell was convicted of violating a statute that made it a crime to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">commit[ ] any of the following acts with a child, not the person\u2019s spouse, with or without the child\u2019s consent, for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of either of them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">1. Fondle or touch the inner thigh, groin, buttock, anus, or breast of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">2. Touch the clothing covering the immediate area of the inner thigh, groin, buttock, anus, or breast of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">3. Solicit or permit a child to fondle or touch the inner thigh, groin, buttock, anus, or breast of the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">4.Solicit a child to engage in any act prohibited under section 709.8, subsection 1,2, or 4.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Iowa Code \u00a7 709.12 (1999). The district court ruled that \u201cCaldwell\u2019s conviction under the Iowa Statute 709.12 is a qualifying predicate offense under 2252A(b)(l).\u201d Caldwell says this was wrong because \u00a7 709.12 does not divide into alternative crimes in the way required by Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). But even if Caldwell is correct about the Iowa statute\u2019s divisibility, it doesn\u2019t make a difference here. The entirety of \u00a7 709.12 defines an offense \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). The first two subsections criminalize direct sexual abuse, and the second two subsections criminalize the solicitation of such abuse. Each of these subsections thus describes an offense \u201crelating to ... sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor,\u201d so \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) covers Caldwell\u2019s conviction no matter which subsection of \u00a7 709.12 he .violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">Caldwell claims all of \u00a7 709.12 is <em>not' </em>covered by \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) based on United States v. Pierson, 544 F.3d 933 (8th Cir. 2008), which held that \u201cconviction under subsections 1 or 2 of \u00a7 709.12 would qualify as a prior conviction for abusive sexual contact\u201d but \u201cconviction under subsections 3 or 4 would not.\u201d Id. at 942. The Eighth Circuit did not explain this distinction. To the extent that court relied upon the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>that subsections 1 and 2 criminalize direct physical contact and subsections 3 and 4 criminalize \u201csolicit[ing]\u201d or \u201cpermit[ting]\u2019\u2019 the same contact, our precedent does not allow this distinction. We have held that \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is not limited \u201cto instances where the perpetrator is present in front of the minor, where the minor is aware of the abuse, or where the perpetrator makes contact with the minor.\u201d Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d at 784. We have also held that a conviction for \u201centicing a minor for indecent purposes\u201d is \u201cnecessarily related to \u2018aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u2019 \u201d McGarity, 669 F.3d at 1261-62; see also United States v. Johnson, 451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding the same for the offense of \u201cperforming a lewd act in front of a minor\u201d). We must apply our precedent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Caldwell makes .two more arguments about his Iowa conviction, both of which are squarely foreclosed by precedent. First, Caldwell argues that a jury needed to decide if his Iowa offense \u201cre-lattes] to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d The Supreme Court has long held that a judge can increase a sentence based on \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d even if a jury never found that fact. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n.1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). And this Court has held that judges can decide- which state offenses fall under a federal statute\u2019s reference to prior offenses because this is a question of law. See United States v. Gibson, 434 F.3d 1234, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2006). Indeed, Caldwell\u2019s appeal brief argues that \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) covers the Iowa offense \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Caldwell cites no precedent requiring a jury to decide this matter of law, and Gibson held otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Caldwell next argues that his prior conviction can\u2019t be used to increase his sentence because his guilty plea in Iowa court was based on North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), which held that criminal defendants may plead guilty to crime while denying guilt. Id. at 38, 91 S.Ct. at 168. We treat Alford pleas the same as any other guilty pleas for purposes of future sentencing. See United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 755 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). So does Iowa law. See State v. Knight, 701 N.W.2d 83, 89 (Iowa 2005). Ramirez-Gonzalez bars Caldwell\u2019s claim that a conviction based on a Alford plea can\u2019t serve as the factual basis for increasing his sentence in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">. Even the two dissenting Justices in Lock-hart agreed that \u00a7 2252(b)(1) had a coherent meaning, although they thought a different one. See 136 S.Ct. at 977 (Kagan, J., dissenting). They added that any ambiguities should be construed using the rule of lenity. See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\">2. This section made it a crime</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">to perform any of the following acts with a child with or without the child\u2019s consent unless married to each other, for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of either of them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">1. Fondle or touch the pubes or genitals of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-18\">2. Permit or cause a child to fondle or touch the person\u2019s genitals or pubes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pASn\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-19\">4. Inflict pain or discomfort upon a child or permit a child to inflict pain or discomfort on the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">Iowa Code \u00a7 709.8 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. To be clear, Caldwell makes two separate claims about his Alford plea. First, he says Alford pleas can\u2019t ever serve as the factual basis for a higher sentence. Ramirez-Gonzalez says otherwise. Second, he says courts can't use Alford pleas to identify the crime of conviction when the statute of conviction is divisible into multiple crimes. Neither Ramirez-Gonzalez nor any other binding precedent seems\u2019 to have addressed this second issue. Other courts have held that the Sixth Amendment forbids this use of Alford pleas. See, e.g., United States v. Alston, 611 F.3d 219, 221 (4th Cir. 2010); United States v. Savage, 542 F.3d 959, 966 (2d Cir. 2008). Because we conclude that it would make no difference in this case which part of the Iowa statute Caldwell was convicted under, we do not decide this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
