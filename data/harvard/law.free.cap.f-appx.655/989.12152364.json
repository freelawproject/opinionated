Alexander sued the state of Mississippi and various counties and clerks (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in federal court, asserting that the clerks\u2019 refusals violated state law and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for judgment on the pleadings. Alexander then filed a \u201cmotion for relief\u2019 that asserted violations of the Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, and the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">The district court construed Alexander\u2019s \u201cmotion for relief\u2019 as a motion to amend his complaint, but denied the motion as futile because Alexander failed to state a plausible federal claim. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Alexander\u2019s state law claims, and dismissed the case. Alexander appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-18\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-19\">We review a district court\u2019s rulings on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Gentilello v. Rege, </em>627 F.3d 540, 543-44 (5th Cir. 2010). \u201cThe central issue is whether, in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states a valid claim for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend and its decision over whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>Powers v. United States, </em>783 F.3d 570, 576 (5th Cir. 2015); <em>Whitley v. Hanna, </em>726 F.3d 631, 638 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Alexander argues that the district court erred by granting Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings and by denying his motion for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The district court rightly granted Defendants\u2019 motions because Alexander\u2019s sole federal equal protection claim is without merit. To state an equal protection claipa, the plaintiff must allege, among other things, .that he has been intentionally treated differently from other similarly situated individuals. <em>Gibson v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Ins., </em>700 F.3d 227, 238 (5th Cir. 2012). Alexander fails to make such an allegation; his complaint is devoid of any allegations that he was treated differently from others similarly situated. Accordingly, he has failed to state an equal protection claim. <em>See Priester v. Lowndes Cnty., </em>354 F.3d 414, 424 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">The district court also properly denied Alexander\u2019s motion for relief as a futile motion to amend his complaint. Denying a motion to amend is not an abuse of discretion when the amendment fails to state a claim. <em>Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., </em>234 F.3d 863, 872-73 (5th Cir. 2000). Alexander fails to state an equal protection, \u00a7 1982, or due process claim. Again, even in his motion for relief, he fails to allege that the clerks treated him differently from other similarly situated persons. <em>See Priester, </em>354 F.3d at 424. Alexander fails to state a \u00a7 1982 claim because he does not allege intentional discrimination. <em>See Vaughner v. Pulito, </em>804 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir. 1986) (\u201cA cause of action based upon section 1982 ... requires an intentional act of racial discrimination.\u201d). And he fails to state a due process claim because he challenges state employees\u2019 actions, and Mississippi law provides adequate post-deprivation remedies\u2014either a suit under Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-45-1 against the clerk for misfeasance in office or a bill of chancery under Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-45-27 to enforce the lien acquired through the tax sale.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>784 F.2d 1287, 1291-92 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding that an adequate post-deprivation state remedy satisfies due process when a plaintiff challenges unauthorized conduct by state employees, rather than established state procedure).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion when, after dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>all of Alexander\u2019s federal claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims. \u201cDistrict courts enjoy wide discretion in determining whether to retain supplemental jurisdiction over a state claim once all federal claims are dismissed.\u201d <em>Noble v. White, </em>996 F.2d 797, 799 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>see Brookshire Bros. Holding, Inc. v. Dayco Prods., Inc., </em>554 F.3d 595, 602 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u201cThe general rule is that a court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over remaining state-law claims when all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial.\u201d). The district court, thus acted within its broad discretion when it declined jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-13\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">. Alexander asserted due process claims arising from: (1) the clerks\u2019 refusals to grant the land deeds; (2) a judge's refusal to comply with a state appellate court ruling; and (3) a state judge's barring him from suing with regard to certain land parcels and a state court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">. As to Alexander\u2019s due process claim arising from a state judge's alleged refusal to comply with a state court judgment, the plaintiff can seek a writ of mandamus in the state court of appeals. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb Cnty. Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973) (\"[A] federal court lacks the general power to issue writs of mandamus to direct state courts and their judicial officers in the performance of their duties.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">. As to Alexander's due process claim arising frpm a state court\u2019s barring him from suit, the district court properly concluded it lacked jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which dictates that federal district courts do not have power to review state court final judgments. <em>See Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 691 (5th Cir. 1986) (noting that plaintiffs cannot circumvent the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine by casting complaints about state court judgments \"in the form of civil rights suits\u201d); <em>Dist. of Columbia Ct. of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
