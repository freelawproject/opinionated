Phillips, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Paul Stan* sued his former employer, QuikTrip Corporation, claiming it violated certain provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-4335. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of QuikTrip and Starr appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings,</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Starr is a former Marine who worked for QuikTrip while serving in the Oklahoma National Guard. In 2007, he left the company temporarily to complete a yearlong deployment in Iraq, and again in 2011 for a nine-month tour in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">In June 2012, Starr returned to work at QuikTrip after his Afghanistan deployment. In August 2012, QuikTrip fired Starr for violating its written two-hour \u201cNo Call/No Show\u201d policy three times in just over a month. According to the policy, an \u201cemployee that arrives more than two hours late for [his] scheduled start time and has not called to inform [his] immediate supervisor of being tardy\u201d is subject to a written warning for the first offense and termination for the second offense, though \u201c[e]ach circumstance is reviewed on an individual basis.\u201d Aplt. App. at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">On July 20, 2012, Starr violated the policy, but QuikTrip chose not to give him a written warning in view of his recent military service. When Starr violated the policy a second time less than a week later, QuikTrip gave him a written warning. The warning, which Starr signed, described the two-hour policy and advised Starr that his next violation would \u201cresult in further disciplinary action including termination.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 96. It also stated that \u201c[t]his is the employee\u2019s last chance to improve; termination will result if the problem is not resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). Soon after his second violation, Starr met with QuikTrip\u2019s personnel manager. Starr testified that, despite the written warning, the personnel manager told Starr he \u201cwould be okay\u201d if he missed a shift as long so he called his supervisor \u201c[b]efore the start of the next working day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. On August 28, 2012, Starr failed to report for work or call within two hours of his start time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was later fired for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">Starr sued QuikTrip for premature termination under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316(c)(1) and for discriminatory termination under \u00a7 4311(a). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of QuikTrip on both claims and Starr appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">II. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Felkins v. City of Lake</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>wood, </em>774 F.3d 647, 650 (10th Cir. 2014). A party is entitled to summary judgment if he \u201cshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [he] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute \u201cis genuine if there is sufficient evidence on each side so that a rational trier of fact could resolve the issue either way.\u201d <em>J.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs., </em>813 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). A fact is material if it is essential to the disposition of the claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">At the summary-judgment stage, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and must resolve all factual disputes and make all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Cillo v. City of Greenwood Vill., </em>739 F.3d 451, 461 (10th Cir. 2013). The court may not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence, which are functions of the jury, not the judge. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">III. Premature Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The district court erred by granting summary judgment on Starr\u2019s premature termination claim because Stan' has raised a genuine dispute about whether he had notice that his failure to comply with the written two-hour policy .could result in termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316(c)(1), a reemployed service-member \u201cshall not be discharged from such employment, except for cause ... within one year after the date of such reemployment, if the person\u2019s period of service before the reemployment was more than 180 days.\u201d To prove cause, an employer must show (1) that it was reasonable to terminate the employee based on his conduct, and (2) that the employee had express or implied notice that the conduct in question would give the employer cause to terminate him. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.248(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Starr claims QuikTrip\u2019s submissions failed to show he had notice he would be fired for violating the written two-hour policy. He says that the company made exceptions for him in the past and that the personnel manager had told Starr soon before his firing that he \u201cwould be okay\u201d as long as he called his supervisor before the next day, which his wife did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court rejected this argument, reasoning that QuikTrip did not lose the right to enforce its written policy by previously having been willing to forgive Starr\u2019s earlier violations. It also concluded that, even if the personnel manager had told Starr he could call anytime before the next day, \u201cno reasonable factfinder could conclude that Starr reasonably relied on the alleged statement.\u201d Aplt. App. at 209-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">We .agree with the district court that QuikTrip\u2019s willingness to excuse Starr\u2019s prior violations did not bar it from enforcing its written policy on this occasion. QuikTrip chose not to give Starr a written warning after his July 20, 2012, violation in view of Starr\u2019s recent military service, and it chose not to terminate Starr after he violated the policy in 2009 and 2010. Quik-Trip\u2019s willingness to forgive these violations after-the-fact did not affect its right to fire Starr for continuing to violate the policy. <em>See To v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>651 F.3d 888, 893 (8th Cir. 2011) (employer did not \u201cforfeit its right to rely on written policies by being willing to occasionally forgive violation of those policies in the face of extenuating circumstances and equitable concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">But accepting as true Starr\u2019s account of the personnel manager\u2019s statements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>drawing all reasonable inferences' in his favor, we believe a rational jury could find that the personnel manager\u2019s promise to excuse a missed shift as long as Starr called before the next working day deprived Starr of notice that violating QuikTrip\u2019s written policy could result in termination. Especially given QuikTrip\u2019s willingness to deviate from its policy in the past, a rational jury could find that Starr reasonably relied on the personnel manager\u2019s assurance that he would be given similar leeway in the future. Finally, while we agree with the district court that allowing Starr to call anytime before the next day would not give QuikTrip an opportunity to cover for his absence, we have no reason to believe the company\u2019s written policy\u2014which allows employees to notify their supervisors of their absence up to two hours after their shift begins\u2014 would do much better. We therefore conclude there is a genuine dispute on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">QuikTrip points out that the personnel manager denied giving Starr permission to deviate from the written policy, and argues that Starr\u2019s \u201cuncorroborated and self-serving\u201d testimony regarding the personnel manager\u2019s statements is not enough to create a genuine dispute of fact. Aplee. Br. at 21. But it is only, when \u201cthe record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party [that] there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Pinkerton v. Colo. Dept. of Transp., </em>563 F.3d 1052, 1058 (10th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiffs testimony alone may be enough. <em>See Evers v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., </em>509 F.3d 1304, 1309 (10th Cir. 2007) (plaintiffs sworn testimony was \u201csufficient to establish a triable fact issue\u201d); <em>Berry v. Chicago Transit Auth., </em>618 F.3d 688, 691 (7th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[W]e long ago buried\u2014or at least tried to bury\u2014the misconception that uncorroborated testimony from the non-movant cannot prevent summary judgment because it is \u2018self-serving.\u2019 If based on personal' knowledge or firsthand experience, such testimony can be evidence of disputed material facts.\u201d (citation omitted)). The conflict between Starr\u2019s account and the personnel manager\u2019s does not render Starr\u2019s testimony so \u201cblatantly contradicted by the record ... that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>See Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). It merely presents a conflict in the evidence for the jury to resolve. <em>See Webco Indus., Inc. v. Thermatool Corp., </em>278 F.3d 1120, 1128 (10th Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is the province of the jury, and not th[e] court, to resolve conflicts in the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In sum, we conclude that a genuine dispute exists whether Starr had notice that failing to notify QuikTrip of his absence within two hours after his shift began could result in termination. The district court therefore erred by granting summary judgment on Starr\u2019s premature termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">IV. Discriminatory Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In contrast, the district court rightly granted summary judgment on Starr\u2019s discriminatory termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The USERRA prohibits employers from terminating service-members based on their membership in or obligations to the armed services. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a). An employee who brings a discriminatory-termination claim bears the initial burden -of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his status as a service-member was \u201ca motivating factor\u201d in the termination. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1); <em>Coffman v. Chugach Support Serv., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>Sheehan v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The employee need not show his status was the sole cause of his termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>nation, but only \u201cone of the reasons that the employer took action against him.\u201d- 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.22; <em>see also Coffman, </em>411 F.3d at 1238. If the employee makes this showing, \u201cthe employer has the burden to prove the affirmative defense that it would have taken the action anyway.\u201d \u00a7 1002.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Starr claims certain comments by his supervisor show that anti-military animus played a part in QuikTrip\u2019s decision to fire him. Specifically, Starr testified that when he returned to QuikTrip after his tour in Afghanistan, his supervisor (who, like Starr, is a former Marine) asked Starr whether he had \u201cgot all of his killing done,\u201d Aplt. App. at 148, and told him \u201c[y]ou ought to just go back into the military since you like it so much,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 133. It\u2019s true that a discriminatory motive \u201cmay be reasonably inferred from,\u201d among other' things, \u201can employer\u2019s expressed hostility towards [service-jmembers.\u201d <em>Sheehan, </em>240 F.3d at 1013. But while Starr\u2019s supervisor\u2019s comments may be insensitive, they do not unambiguously express an anti-military sentiment\u2014especially in this context, where the supervisor is a former service-member himself. And even if the comments had revealed a hostility toward service-members, \u201c[ijsolated remarks, unrelated to the disputed employment action, are insufficient to demonstrate discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Stover v. Martinez, </em>382 F.3d 1064, 1077 (10th Cir. 2004). We agree with the district court that Starr failed to establish any connection between his supervisor\u2019s comments and Starr\u2019s termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because a rational trier of fact could not conclude from these comments that anti-military animus played a part -in Starr\u2019s termination, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Starr\u2019s discriminatory termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-19\">.
