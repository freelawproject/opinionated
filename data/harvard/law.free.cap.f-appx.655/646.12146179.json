Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Bruce Mingo, a Colorado state prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application for habeas relief. We deny his request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A jury convicted Mingo of first-degree murder, and the state trial court imposed a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed Mingo\u2019s conviction and sentence, on direct appeal, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari. The state district court denied Mingo\u2019s motion for postconviction relief under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c), the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, 'and the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari. Mingo then applied for \u00a7 2254 habeas relief. The district court denied Mingo\u2019s habeas application and also denied Mingo\u2019s requests for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Mingo now asks us to issue a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). But we can do so only if Mingo makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). This means Mingo must \u201cshow[] that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner , or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Mingo asserts three claims: (1) his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in several respects violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, (2) the trial court violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process when the trial judge offered inducements to the chief prosecution witness, and (3) the trial court violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process when the trial judge failed to ensure that Mingo knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">The Colorado Court of Appeals rejected each of these claims on the merits when it affirmed the state district court\u2019s denial of Mingo\u2019s motion for postconviction relief. Thus, Mingo had to demonstrate to the district court that the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of these claims was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). In its 74-page order denying Mingo\u2019s habeas application, the district court thoroughly considered the Court of Appeals\u2019 treatment of each of Mingo\u2019s claims and determined Mingo wasn\u2019t entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">We have reviewed Mingo\u2019s combined opening brief and COA application, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>appellate record, the Colorado Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the district court\u2019s order denying habeas relief, and the applicable law. Based on this review, we conclude Mingo hasn\u2019t demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s resolution of his habeas application. Thus, we deny Mingo\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">. Because Mingo appears pro se, we liberally construe his combined opening brief and COA application. <em>Gallagher v. Shelton, </em>587 F.3d 1063, 1067 (10th Cir. 2009). But we don't assume the role, of his advocate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-15\">. Mingo asserted a fourth claim in his habeas petition\u2014that the State violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due-process rights when it failed to consider certain evidence in postconviction proceedings. The district court determined that claim wasn\u2019t cognizable in a federal habeas action. Mingo doesn't challenge that determination or reassert the fourth claim in his combined opening brief and COA application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
