The employees (\u201cDefendants\u201d) were allegedly involved in suspending John\u2019s state-issued electrician license for failing to pay child support. The employees moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The district court granted the employees\u2019 12(b)(6) motion and entered a Rule 54(b) judgment. The Littles timely appealed. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefing, the record, and the applicable law, we find no reversible error and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Beginning March 13, 2013, and continuing at least through September 23, 2014, John failed to pay his monthly court ordered child support. On February 23, 2014, John received notice that the Office of the Attorney General of Texas (the \u201cOAG\u201d) was requesting that his Master Electrician\u2019s license not be renewed and advising him to contact the OAG to avoid nonre-newal. Between February 23, 2014 and June 24, 2014, the Littles did not contact the OAG regarding a payment arrangement to satisfy past due child support and obtain a release. John\u2019s license expired on June 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The Littles sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985, contending that their constitutional rights were violated when Defendants suspended John\u2019s electrician license after he fell in arrears on paying child support, and challenging provisions of the Texas Family Code as unconstitutional. The Littles\u2019 complaint alleged that they were denied due process and equal protection of the laws, and also that they were retaliated against for filing suit. The district court dismissed the lawsuit based on Defendants\u2019 qualified immunity and because the Littles failed to state a plausible constitutional claim regarding the challenged sections of the Texas Family Code. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on the pleadings. The standard is the same for both. Viewing the facts as pled in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, a motion to dismiss or for a judgment on the pleadings should not be granted if a complaint provides enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Jebaco, Inc., v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co., Inc. </em>587 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir. 2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">The Littles raise a bevy of claims. A number of those claims, however, are unrelated to the district court\u2019s order on appeal. Below, we discuss the primary basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal\u2014qualified immunity\u2014and address the relevant claims\u2014the Littles\u2019 equal protection and procedural due process claims under \u00a7 1983, their conspiracy equal protection claim under \u00a7 1985(3), their First Amendment retaliation claim, and their challenge to the constitutionality of various Texas Family Code statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">A. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">Qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions \u201cfrom civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). To defeat a defendant\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity at the pleadings stage, the plaintiff \u201cmust plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official\u2019s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The plaintiff must also allege facts, that show that the violation was objectively unreasonable, that is, a reasonable government official, in the light of clearly established law, would not have acted so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">B. Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The district court found that the due process, equal protection, and retaliation claims against Defendants failed because the Littles\u2019 speculative and conclusory allegations did not identify specific conduct which could be interpreted as a violation of the their constitutional rights. Therefore, the district court concluded that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Based on our review of the. record, we agree with the district court\u2019s opinion and affirm the dismissal of the claims against Defendants based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">C. Texas Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">The Littles challenge the constitutionality of the Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7 232.0135, 157.263, and 154.068. As held above, the Littles have not alleged any basis for concluding that Defendants\u2019 conduct in applying the above-referenced statutes was unconstitutional. Aside from Defendants\u2019 alleged unconstitutional conduct under the color of state law, the Littles offer no other basis for holding that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the Littles\u2019 complaint for failure to state a plausible claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1050-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
