On appeal, Cockett argues that, despite his career-offender designation, he is eligible for a reduction because the district court fashioned his sentence based on his non-career-offender guideline range. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and for clear error the factual findings underlying those legal conclusions. United States v. Davis, 587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered; and (2) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the range \u201cdetermined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l). \u201c[Cjommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or- is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In order to obtain a reduction in a term of imprisonment based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(d). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). Amendment 782\u2014which is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(d)\u2014therefore may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. Id. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1. See U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">We\u2019ve explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes a reduction to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. United States v. Moore, 541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir. 2008). Thus, because the defendants in Moore were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, they were ineligible -for relief, since only their base offense levels, but not their guideline ranges, were impacted by the retroactive guideline amendment. Id. at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In this case, the district court did not have the authority to reduce Cockett\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3582(c)(2) allows a sentence reduction only if it is consistent with the applicable policy statement of the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10 requires a court to determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment had been in effect at the time of sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). In Cockett\u2019s case, that range is the career offender range. Therefore, regardless of whether the district court based Cockett\u2019s final variant sentence, in part, on the guideline range that would have been applicable if he was not a career offender, Cockett is a career offender and the guideline range applicable to Cockett has not been reduced by Amendment 782. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">As for Cockett\u2019s reliance on Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), we are unpersuaded. There, a four-justice plurality of the Supreme Court concluded that a defendant sentenced pursuant to a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>lar sentencing recommendation in his Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement typically would still be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The plurality reached this conclusion on the ground that, before a district court imposes a recommended sentence, it is required to consider whether the sentence is reasonable in light of the applicable guideline range. See Freeman, 564 U.S. at 530-34, 131 S.Ct. 2685. In a concurring opinion, however, Justice Soto-mayor noted that, typically, a defendant sentenced pursuant to a particular sentencing recommendation in his plea agreement is not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the recommended sentence is based on the agreement itself, and not on the applicable guideline range. Id. at 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685. She recognized, on the other hand, that where an agreement expressly uses the guideline range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment, the term of imprisonment is based on the guideline range. In those cases, she concluded, the defendant would be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Id. We\u2019ve said that this narrower concurring opinion can be viewed as the holding of Freeman. United States v. Lawson, 686 F.3d 1317, 1321 n.2 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Regardless of its precise holding, we\u2019ve made clear that Freeman did not overrule Moore. Id. We\u2019ve also held that Freeman is inapplicable to the issue of whether a district court has authority to reduce a sentence in the case of a defendant sentenced as a career offender. Id. at 1320-21. Freeman, therefore, did not alter the analysis we use in cases like Cockett\u2019s. See id. Accordingly, he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
