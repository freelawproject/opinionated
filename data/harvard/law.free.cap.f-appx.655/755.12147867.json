Upon review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">Davis\u2019s complaint alleges in relevant part that Daniels had breached each of five promissory notes executed between 1997 and 2000 and sought liquidated damages and attorney\u2019s fees. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment to-Davis on the issues of liability and granted partial summary judgment to Davis on the issue of damages. Specifically, while the court found that Davis was entitled to damages and attorney\u2019s fees as a matter of law, genuine questions of material fact existed about the calculation of those damages. Accordingly Davis\u2019 motion for summary judgment was granted in part and denied in part and Daniels\u2019 motion for summary judgment was denied. Davis then filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the damages portion of the summary judgment order and Daniels filed a motion for reconsideration of the entire order. The district court granted Davis\u2019 motion for reconsideration with respect to damages and denied Daniels\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The court then granted judgment in the amount of $2,076,325.38 in favor of Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">On appeal, Daniels argues that the district court erred in granting Davis\u2019 motion for - summary judgment on liability with respect to three of the notes. Daniels concedes that the remaining two notes are under seal. Daniels also argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting Davis\u2019 motion for reconsideration and denying his motion for reconsideration. Upon review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>Merritt v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1997). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"AOUA\">This Court reviews the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. Sanderlin v. Seminole Tribe of Fla., 243 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2001). A motion for reconsideration cannot be used \u201cto relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, 408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADi\">A. Summary Judgment Order</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">1. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Daniels\u2019 first argument is that the district court erred in the summary judgment order in holding that there was no genuine question of fact that Notes 1, 3, and 4 were executed under seal. Under Georgia law, actions on written contracts are generally governed by the six-year period of limitations of OCGA \u00a7 9-3-24. In contrast, contracts under seal are governed by the 20-year period of limitations of OCGA \u00a7 9-3-23. Because the claim was brought more than six years after the right of action accrued, the parties agree that Davis\u2019 claim is barred if the Notes were not executed under seal</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Under Georgia law, \u201cto constitute a sealed instrument, \u2018there must be both a recital in the body of the instrument of an intention to use a seal and the affixing of the seal or scroll after the signature.\u2019\u201d McCalla v. Stuckey, 233 Ga.App. 397, 504 S.E.2d 269, 270 (1998) (quoting Chastain v. L. Moss Music Co., 83 Ga.App. 570, 64 S.E.2d 205 (1951)). \u201c \u201cWords traced with a pen, or stamped, printed, or made legible by any other device whereby such act is for the purpose of putting down a [person\u2019s] name at the end of an instrument to attest its validity, and is adopted by the party whose name is so signed, is a sufficient signature and signing of the instrument to which it is signed.\u2019\u201d Davis v. Harpagon Co., LLC, 281 Ga. 250, 637 S.E.2d 1, 2-3 (2006) (quoting Bank of Ringgold v. Poarch, 30 Ga.App. 102, 117 S.E. 114 (1923)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that all of the Notes contain both a recital in the body of the instrument of an intention to use a seal, the affixing of a seal,- and Daniels\u2019 signature. Daniels\u2019 only argutoent is that on Notes 1, 3, and 4, his cursive signature appears roughly two inches to the left of the word SEAL rather -than immediately adjacent to it, and that h\u00bf has written his name in block print rather jthan cursive immediately next to the word SEAL. According to Daniels, the location of the cursive signature relative to the word SEAL raises a genuine question of fact as to whether the seal is affixed \u201cafter the signature.\u201d We disagree. Whether or not the cursive writing suffices for the purpose of the sealing requirement, it is clear under Georgia law that the printed writing immediately adjacent to the word SEAL constitutes a signature and thereby satisfies the seal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">2. Consideration</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Daniels next argues that the district court erred \u201cin reversing its initial Order and finding that no material facts exist with respect to Daniels\u2019 defense of lack of consideration\u201d for- Note 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On its face, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>argument, which appears to challenge the district court\u2019s order on cross motions for reconsideration, is difficult to understand. The consideration issue was decided in favor of Davis on summary judgment and the order on cross motions for reconsideration denied Daniels\u2019 motion for reconsideration with respect to that part of the summary judgment order. The motion for reconsideration did not \u201creverse\u201d the summary judgment order with respect to this issue. Therefore, we construe this argument as a challenge to the summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Under Georgia law, a plaintiff in a suit to enforce a promissory note \u201cestablishes a prima facie case by producing the note and showing that it was executed.\u201d Trendmark Homes, Inc. v. Bank of N. Ga., 314 Ga.App 886, 726 S.E.2d 138, 139 (2012). \u201cOnce a hcjlder of a promissory note establishes prinla facie right to judgment as a matter of kw, as would support holder\u2019s motion for \u00ed lummary judgment in action on note, burc en then shifts to the obligor to establish an affirmative defense to the claim, such as the lack of consideration.\u201d Han v. Han, 295 GaApp. 1, 670 S.E.2d 842 (2008). \u201cA contract under seal raises a prima facie presumption of consideration, which is re-buttable.\u201d Autrey v. UAP/GA AG Chem, Inc., 230 Ga.App. 767, 497 S.E.2d 402, 405 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Daniels argues that there is a genuine question of fact as to consideration because \u201cneither party has been able to produce a single check showing that consideration was given for Note 5\u201d and because Daniels\u2019 responses to Davis\u2019 Request for Admissions denied receiving the $281,000 from Davis. We disagree. Daniels has not satisfied his burden of adducing evidence sufficient to create a genuine question of material fact as to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">B. Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">1. Accord and Satisfaction</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Daniels\u2019 next argument is that the district court erred in \u201creversing its initial Order and finding that no material facts exist with respect to the apparent consolidation of Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4.\u201d On its face, this argument is difficult to understand. Daniels first raised the consolidation argument in his .motion for reconsideration. Because Daniels did not raise this defense at the summary judgment stage, the district court did not address it in the summary judgment order. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Daniels\u2019 motion to reconsider did not \u201creverse\u201d its initial Order. Instead, the district court held that it was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">\u201cA motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., 555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \u201cA district court has sound discretion whether to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to a motion for reconsideration, and its decision will only be reversed if it .abused that discretion.\u201d Id. \u201cDenial of a motion to amend is especially soundly exercised when a party gives no reason for not previously raising an issue.\u201d Id (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Daniels gives no reason for his failure to previously raise the consolidation argument at the summary judgment stage. Nor do we believe that the district court abused its discretion in declining to entertain this argument at the motion to reconsider stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">In any event, Daniels\u2019 consolidation argument lacked merit. As discussed above, under Georgia law, a plaintiff in a suit to enforce a promissory note \u201cestablishes a prima facie case by producing the note and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>showing that it was executed. Once that prima facie case has been made, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law unless the defendant can establish a defense.\u201d Trendmark Homes, 726 S.E.2d at 139. One such defense is accord and satisfaction. \u201cAccord and satisfaction occurs where the parties to an agreement, by a subsequent agreement, have satisfied the former agreement, and the latter agreement has been executed.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-4-101. \u201cUnder Georgia law, an accord and satisfaction is a contract which, like other contracts, requires a \u2018meeting of the minds.\u2019\u201d ADP-Financial Computer Services, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank of Cobb County, 703 F.2d 1261, 1266 (11th Cir. 1983) (citing Myers v. American Finance System of Decatur, Inc., 615 F.2d 368 (5th Cir. 1980)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Daniels argues that the grant of summary judgment to Davis on the issue of liability was error because there is a genuine question of fact as to whether the parties released the debt obligations in Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 by accord and satisfaction and whether Note 5 is a \u201cconsolidation\u201d of the earlier four notes. Specifically, Daniels points to two pieces of record evidence: (1) the handwritten words \u201cNote Update\u201d in the \u201cDate of Transaction\u201d field of Note 5 and (2) deposition testimony from Daniels that he received only \u201cabout $300,000\u201d in total consideration from Davis. Because the face value of Note 5 was $281,000, Daniels claims that there is a fact issue as to whether Note 5 was a consolidation of the Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4. We disagree. While it is not entirely clear what the words \u201cNote Update\u201d mean, the record does not contain sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were released through accord and satisfaction. Moreover, the signed and sealed note recites that Daniels received $281,000 as an \u201camount given to me directly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider this argument below.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">2. Calculation' of Liquidated Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Daniels next argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting Davis\u2019 motion to reconsider the damages portion of the summary judgment order, because there were genuine questions of fact about whether Davis had credited c&lt; \u00a1r-tain payments made by Daniels to t tie interest accrued on the principal value of the Notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">A motion for reconsideration is only \u00a3 p-propriate when \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to present: (1) newly discovered evidence; (2) an intervening development or change in controlling law; or (3) a need to correct a clear error of law or fact. Bryan v. Murphy, 246 F.Supp.2d 1256, 1258-59 (N.D. Ga. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Daniels argues that the district court abused its discretion because none of the three grounds for granting a motion for reconsideration existed. We disagree. The order on motion for reconsideration recognizes that the summary judgment order \u201cclearly erred\u201d with regard to its finding that it was impossible to calculate the exact amount of liquidated damages due to the insufficiency of evidence about whether Davis had credited certain payments made by Daniels to the interest accrued on the principal value of the Notes. As Davis pointed out in his motion for reconsideration, Daniels\u2019 response to Davis\u2019 statement of material fact admits that Davis properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>credited the payments at issue to the outstanding interest. Accordingly, there was no genuine question of fact that Davis credited the payments made by Daniels to the interest accrued on the principal value of the Notes. The district court correctly recognized its earlier clear error and did not abuse its discretion in granting Davis\u2019 motion to reconsider the damages portion of the summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">3. Calculation of Interest and Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Daniels\u2019 final argument is that the district court abused its discretion \u201cin reversing its initial Order and finding that no material facts exist with respect to the calculation of interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d But Daniels offers no argument\u2014beyond a reiteration of his claims about lack of consideration and accord and satisfaction\u2014as to why the district court\u2019s express conclusion that it \u201cclearly erred\u201d with regard to its earlier finding that it was impossible to calculate the exact amount of liquidated damages was an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s orders granting Davis\u2019 motion for summary judgment and motion to reconsider and denying Daniels\u2019 motion for summary judgment and motion to reconsider are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">.
