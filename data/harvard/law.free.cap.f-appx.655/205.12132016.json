Pinner has appealed the district court\u2019s judgment revoking her supervised release and sentencing her to 12 months of imprisonment. Pinner contends that the district court improperly considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in determining her revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">A properly preserved objection to a revocation sentence is reviewed under the plainly unreasonable standard. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir. 2013). However, because the instant objection was not asserted in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See id. </em>\u201cTo prevail on plain error review, a defendant must show that an 'error occurred, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>742 F.3d 614, 616 (5th Cir. 2014). If those factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is within the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">In determining whether to revoke a term of supervised release, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir. 2011). \u201cMissing from this list is \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which allows a court to impose a sentence that reflects \u2018the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>844 (quoting \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). This court has held that \u201c[w]hen sentencing a defendant under \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may not consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) because Congress deliberately omitted that factor from the permissible factors enumerated in the statute.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844. After <em>Miller, </em>this court clarified that a sentencing error occurs when an impermissible consideration is a dominant factor in the court\u2019s revocation sentence, but not when it is merely a secondary concern or an additional justification for the sentence. <em>See Walker, </em>742 F.3d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In setting forth its reasons at the revocation hearing, the district court first cited a permissible factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), stating that \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d justify the above-guidelines one-year revocation sentence. The court went on to cite \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) before stating that Pin-ner\u2019s \u201coffenses are serious,\u201d that she was, \u201cas part of the revocation proceeding, re-ceiv[ing] just punishment\u201d of 12 months, and that her prevarications and inconsistent statements to the court and during the investigation of her medical condition \u201cjustify a one-year sentence in order to promote respect for the law.\u201d The court twice described the revocation sentence as \u201cpure punishment\u201d and stated that Pinner \u201cwill be punished for the violations and the inability to follow rules and the false information that she has supplied to this Court\u201d regarding her medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Even assuming that the district court plainly erred by making the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) considerations a dominant factor in imposing the revocation sentence and that this error affected Pinner\u2019s substantial rights, this Court is not required to correct the forfeited error. <em>See Walker, </em>742 F.3d at 616. Under the fourth prong of plain-error review, this court \u201chas the <em>discretion </em>to remedy the error\u2014discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>784 F.3d 1012, 1018 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>797 F.3d 307 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). \u201cIn analyzing the fourth prong, w\u00e9 look to the degree of the error and the particular facts of the case to determine whether to exercise our discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Prieto, </em>801 F.3d 547, 554 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIn the past, we have declined to remedy some errors that may have caused sentence increases.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>784 F.3d at 1018-19, n.3 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u201c[T]he goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. The Sentencing Manual contemplates a distinction \u201cbetween <em>punishment </em>for the offense constituting the supervised release violation[] and <em>sanctioning </em>the violation itself.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>797 F.3d at 308-09. \u201cDrawing a (very) fine line,\u201d the Guidelines Manual states that \u201cthe revoking court should not sentence the defendant with an aim to punish the offense that constitutes the supervised release violation\u201d but that \u201cthe district court is instead punishing the defendant\u2019s breach of the court\u2019s trust.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>797 F.3d at 309. \u201c[T]he Manual also states that \u2018the nature of the conduct leading to the revocation [may] be considered in measuring the extent of the breach of trust.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2014)).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In the instant case, the transcript of the revocation hearing indicates that the district court was focused not on punishing Pinner for offenses alleged in the revocation petition, but upon sanctioning her for the breaches of trust exemplified by her repeated failures to comply with her su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>pervised release conditions and her misrepresentations to the court. <em>See Rivera, </em>797 F.3d at 308-09. Although it may have erred in articulating the reasons for its determination, the district court was attempting to effectuate the appropriate goal of sanctioning Pinner\u2019s supervised release violations and breaches of trust. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843-44; <em>Rivera, </em>797 F.3d at 308-09; U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. As the particular facts of this case thus indicate only a small degree of error that does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, we will not exercise our discretion to remedy it. <em>See Prieto, </em>801 F.3d at 554; <em>Rivera, </em>784 F.3d at 1018-19. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
