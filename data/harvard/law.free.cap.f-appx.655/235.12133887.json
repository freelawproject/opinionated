As to her First Amendment retaliation\u2019 claim, we agree with the district court that the actions taken by Defendants would not chill a person of ordinary firmness. As to Sle-gelmilch\u2019s due process claim that Defendants failed to provide her with a name-clearing hearing, we agree with the district court that Slegelmilch failed to introduce any evidence with respect to a necessary element of that claim, namely that the charges against her were made public. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Plaintiff-Appellant Lindalee Slegel-milch was formerly employed as a therapist by Defendant-Appellee Pearl River County Hospital and Nursing Home (the Hospital). At all relevant times, Defendant-Appellee Steve Vaughn was the chief executive officer and administrator of the Hospital, and Defendant-Appellee Sherry Grady was the human resources director of the Hospital. The Hospital terminated Slegelmilch\u2019s employment on October 29, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As its reason for termination, the Hospital stated that Slegel-milch\u2019s work performance had \u201cnot met expectations\u201d because she had not entered original signatures in individual patient charts consistent with Medicare policies and procedures. On October 29, 2013, Slegelmilch sent a letter to Grady requesting a meeting with Vaughn. Following Slegelmilch\u2019s meeting with Vaughn in the following month, she sent a letter on December 17, 2013, to the President of the Board of Directors of the Hospital requesting a meeting with the Hospital\u2019s board. On December 23, 2013, Vaughn sent a letter informing Sle-gelmilch that he was upholding the decision to terminate her employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">On January 27, 2014, Slegelmilch sent a letter to Carrie Rowden, the Executive Director of the Mississippi State Board of Nursing Home Administrators (BONHA), alleging that Grady, Vaughn, and two other Hospital employees engaged in \u201cunethical behavior\u201d and \u201cunethical conduct.\u201d Vaughn subsequently sent a complaint letter to the Mississippi Board of Examiners for Social Workers and Marriage and Family Therapists (the Board). As the district court noted, Vaughn alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>the following in the complaint letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">(1) that [Slegelmilch] \u201cfalsified Medicare documentation by using a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>template with a copied signature on \u2022 the progress notes instead of signing with an original or electronic signature as required by CMS rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">(2) that [Slegelmilch] violated Board rules 2.1(A)3.g \u201cConduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or attempted deception[\u201d]; and 3.1(b)(2) \u201cEngaging in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct of a character likely to deceive, defraud, or harm the public in the course of professional services or activities.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">(3) that [Slegelmilch] was \u201cinvolved in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or attempted deception by her actions\u201d and was terminated \u201cafter a thorough investigation of the allegation regarding fraudulent violar tion of signature requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Slegelmilch filed the instant suit on October 24, 2014, asserting two causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Specifically, she alleged that Vaughn filed his complaint with the Board in retaliation for her statements to the BONHA about Vaughn (and others) in violation of her First Amendment rights. She further alleged that Defendants violated her due process rights by failing to provide her with a name-clearing hearing as to her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on December 14, 2015. The court rejected Slegelmilch\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim, explaining that \u201c[t]he crux of Plaintiffs claim is that the fact alone of a complaint including allegedly false accusations damaged her, which is not enough\u201d to make out \u201can actionable First Amendment claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d The court also rejected Slegelmilch\u2019s due process claim. The court noted that, to succeed on such a claim, a plaintiff must show that the charges against her were made public and held that Slegelmilch had introduced \u201cno admissible evidence [showing] that the Hospital made public any of the charges against [her].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Slegelmilch timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment on January 11, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">This court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard on appeal as that applied below.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201cA genuine dispute as to a material fact exists \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers, </em>755 F.3d at 350 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). \u201c[T]his court construes \u2018all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir. 2010)). However, a plaintiffs \u201cburden is not satisfied with \u2018some meta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>physical doubt as to the material facts/ by \u2018conclusory allegations/ by \u2018unsubstantiated assertions/ or by only a \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence.\u201d <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted) (per curiam). \u201cConclu-sional allegations and denials, speculation, and unsupported assertions are insufficient to avoid summary judgment.\u201d <em>Sanches v. Carrollton-Farmers Branch Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>647 F.3d 156, 165 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">III. SECTION 1983 CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Slegelmilch argues on appeal that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to Defendants on the two claims she asserted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We address her First Amendment retaliation and due process claims in turn. On both claims, we conclude that the district court committed no error in granting summary judgment to Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">A. First Amendment Retaliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Slegelmilch claimed that Vaughn retaliated against her in violation of her First Amendment rights by filing a coha-plaint against her with the Board in response to her complaint against Vaughn (and others) to the BONHA. Slegelmilch conceded in the district court and concedes on appeal that she cannot state a First Amendment retaliation claim based on her public employment, as she was not an employee of the Hospital at the time she filed her complaint with the BONHA. Accordingly, we evaluate her claim under the requirements applicable to private citizens. To succeed on such a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must establish that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">(1) [she] [was] engaged in constitutionally protected activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">(2) the defendants\u2019 actions caused [her] to suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity, and (3) the defendants\u2019 adverse actions were substantially motivated against the plaintiff\u2019s] exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-12\"><em>Culbertson v. Lykos, </em>790 F.3d 608, 618 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Keenan v. Tejeda, </em>290 F.3d 252, 258 (5th Cir. 2002)). Assuming, as did the district court, that Slegelmilch was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity when she made her statements to the BONHA, we agree with the district court that, under Fifth Circuit precedent, the actions taken by Defendants would not chill a person of ordinary firmness. Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants on Sle-gelmilch\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">This court has previously stated that \u201ccriticism, an investigation (or an attempt to start one), and false accusations [are] all harms that, while they may chill speech, are not actionable under our First Amendment retaliation jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Colson v. Grohman, </em>174 F.3d 498, 512 (5th Cir. 1999). Applying <em>Colson </em>to a private citizen retaliation claim under the First Amendment, this court explained \u201cthat retaliatory criticisms, investigations, and false accusations that do not lead to some more tangible adverse action are not actionable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Matherne v. Larpenter, </em>No. 99-30746, 2000 WL 729066, at *3 (5th Cir. May 8, 2000) (quoting <em>Colson, </em>174 F.3d at 513). In an effort to show that she suffered \u201cmore tangible adverse action,\u201d Slegel-milch alleged that, because of Vaughn\u2019s retaliatory statements, she (1) was subjected to an investigation, (2) was forced to defend herself in this investigation, (3) has suffered \u201csubstantial stress and anxiety,\u201d (4) \u201chas been unable to find new employment,\u201d and (5) has had her \u201clifelong career ... tainted and destroyed.\u201d The district court correctly rejected each of these alie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>gations, holding that Slegelmilch failed to show anything sufficiently tangible to support a First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">As to the first two alleged adverse actions, the district court was correct that criticisms, investigations, and false accusations are not enough to support a First Amendment retaliation claim, as this court has previously recognized in <em>Colson </em>and <em>Matheme. </em>Slegelmilch urges us to disregard <em>Colson </em>and <em>Matheme </em>as inapposite. For example, she argues that <em>Colson </em>is distinguishable because, in that case, individuals attempted to recall a city councilman but were unsuccessful in \u201cinstigating] a recall election.\u201d 174 F.3d at 500. Slegelmilch argues that, instead of Colson, this court should look to <em>Smith v. Winter, </em>782 F.2d 508 (5th Cir. 1986), in which a recall election.was successfully initiated. However, the fact that the attempt to hold a recall election failed does not render <em>Col-son </em>inapposite to the instant case, and we decline to hold, as Slegelmilch apparently urges, that recall elections and investigations are equivalent. Indeed, the reason <em>Colson </em>controls our decision here is not because a recall election failed or succeeded but because the plaintiff in <em>Colson </em>was investigated by an assistant district attorney following allegations of criminal conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 174 F.3d at 500. The investigation in <em>Colson </em>was at least as intrusive as the one conducted by the Board here. Accordingly, we decline Slegelmilch\u2019s invitation to disregard <em>Colson </em>and <em>Matheme </em>and, instead, agree with the district court that the investigation conducted by the Board into Slegelmilch\u2019s alleged wrongdoing is insufficient to support a First Amendment retaliation claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">With respect to her allegations of stress and anxiety, the district court correctly noted that, under Slegelmilch\u2019s theory, anyone who suffers stress as a result of government conduct could state a constitutional violation. However, because the \u201cConstitution does not provide an <em>independent </em>right to be free from emotional distress,\u201d Slegelmilch cannot rely on her stress to support her First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>Flores v. City of Palacios, </em>381 F.3d 391, 401 n.8 (5th Cir. 2004). Finally, Slegelmilch offers only conclusory allegations, with no supporting evidence, that Vaughn\u2019s filing of a complaint with the Board harmed her employment prospects or \u201ctainted\u201d her career. As discussed in greater detail in connection with her alleged due process violation below, there is no evidence that the Board ever publicized the complaint filed against Slegelmilch. Thus, she has failed to introduce any evidence that the alleged violation of her First Amendment rights caused harm to her career or employment prospects. Because Slegelmilch has not shown a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether \u201cthe defendants\u2019 actions caused [her] to suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in [constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tionally protected] activity,\u201d the district court committed no error in granting summary judgment to Defendants on Slegelmilch\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>Culbertson, </em>790 F.3d at 618 (quoting <em>Keenan, </em>290 F.3d at 258).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">B. Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Slegelmilch also claims that her due process rights were violated when Defendants failed to provide her with a name-clearing hearing in connection with her termination. \u201c[A] constitutionally protected liberty interest is implicated only if an employee is discharged in a manner that creates a false and defamatory impression about him and thus stigmatizes him and forecloses him from other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Hughes v. City of Garland, </em>204 F.3d 223, 226 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>White v. Thomas, </em>660 F.2d 680, 684 (5th Cir. 1981)). To prevail on her \u00a7 1983 claim that the Hospital \u201cinfringed upon a cognizable liberty interest by denying\u201d her a hearing to clear her name, Slegelmilch must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">(1) that she was discharged; (2) that stigmatizing charges were made against her in connection with the discharge; (3) that the charges were false; (4) that she was not provided notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to her discharge; (5) that the charges were made public; (6) that she requested a hearing to clear her name; and (7) that the employer refused her request for a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 226. There is no dispute that Slegel-milch was discharged, that the charges made against her concerned the same conduct that was the basis of her discharge, or that she was not provided with a name-clearing hearing. However,- even maintaining the district court\u2019s assumption that the allegations in the complaint to the Board were false, we find that the district court correctly concluded that \u201cthere is ... no admissible evidence that the Hospital made public any of the charges against\u201d Slegelmilch.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Slegelmilch argues that the act of submitting a complaint to the Board itself constitutes public disclosure. In support of this argument, Slegelmilch points to Mississippi law, which provides that \u201c[i]t is the policy of this state that public records shall be available for inspection by any person unless otherwise provided by this chapter.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-61-2; <em>see also </em>Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-61-5 (providing members of the public a right to inspect public records). She further argues that complaints filed with the Board do not fall within the limited exceptions to this policy. While these provisions of Mississippi law may support Slegelmilch\u2019s argument that there was a public disclosure here, she is not relieved of her burden to produce more than \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated assertions\u201d in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <em>Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">As the district court noted, \u201cthere is no evidence that the Board has taken any action against her license or that it has ever disclosed the Board Complaint to potential employers or to anyone else for that matter.\u201d The district court held, based on this lack of evidence, that Slegelmilch\u2019s \u201cunsupported assertion that she lost job opportunities as a result of the Board Complaint ... is insufficient to meet the public disclosure prong.\u201d We agree. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>have held before, \u201c[cjonclusional allegations and denials, speculation and unsupported assertions are insufficient to avoid summary judgment,\u201d <em>Sanches, </em>647 F.3d at 165. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants on Slegelmilch\u2019s due process claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-16\">. Slegelmilch claimed she never received this letter. She further asserted in the district court, and continues to assert on appeal, that she did not learn of her termination until January 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. In response to these allegations, the Board sent Vaughn a letter on November 20, 2015, stating that Slegelmilch \"failed to meet organizational policy\u201d and that the Board had \"conclude[d] its investigation of th[e] complaint with a letter of advisement to the licensee pursuant to Section 73-53-23-6 of the MS Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b260-12\">. Slegelmilch also brought two state law claims, and the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims after dismissing the \u00a7 1983 claims. Those state law claims are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-5\">. For the first time in her reply brief, Slegel-milch raises the argument that <em>Colson </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because she was forced to hire legal counsel to defend herself. This argument, however, is waived, as Slegelmilch failed to raise it in her opening brief. <em>Tradewinds Envtl. Restoration, Inc. v. St. Tammany Park, LLC, </em>578 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. We similarly find that Slegelmilch cannot rely on <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963), to show that the investigation in connection with Vaughn\u2019s complaint was sufficient to support a First Amendment retaliation claim. In <em>Bantam, </em>a public commission without authority to impose punishment on its own sent numerous notices to stop the sale of certain publications, which were followed by police visits and threats of criminal prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 83 S.Ct. 631. There is no evidence that any such conduct occurred here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. Because we agree with the district court that Slegelmilch created no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants\u2019 actions chilled her from engaging in protected activity, we need not and do not consider whether \"the defendants\u2019 adverse actions were substantially motivated against the plaintiff[\u2019s] exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Culbertson, </em>790 F.3d at 618 (quoting <em>Keenan, </em>290 F.3d at 258).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\">. Although not explicitly challenged by the parties, we note that we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Slegelmilch\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
