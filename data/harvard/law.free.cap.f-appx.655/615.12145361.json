O\u2019Brien, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Jesus Manuel Gallegos appeals from a sentence imposed after remand in an earlier appeal. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>610 Fed.Appx. 786 (10th Cir. 2015) <em>(Gallegos I</em>). After pleading guilty to one count of kidnapping under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1) he -yvas originally sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. As a result of an appeal to this court we vacated the sentence and remanded for clarification as to whether a two-level or four-level sentencing enhancement was appropriate based on the severity of the victim\u2019s eye injury. On remand, applying the criteria set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>3(553(a) </em>the judge again imposed a sentence of 360 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Gallegos\u2019s appellate counsel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw based on his assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issues. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (if after a \u201cconscientious examination\u201d of the record, counsel finds an appeal \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d counsel may move to withdraw and contemporaneously file \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d). Gallegos filed a pro se response to his counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief in which he requested appointment of new counsel. The government did not file a brief. We have conducted an independent review of the 'record in addition to considering the issues raised in counsel\u2019s brief and Gallegos\u2019s pro se response. <em>See id. </em>(when counsel files an <em>Anders </em>brief, the reviewing judge should examine the record to determine whether the case is \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d); <em>accord United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief suggests several arguments Gallegos might possibly make in claiming procedural error. Procedural review addresses \u201cthe method by which a sentence was calculated.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 803 (10th Cir. 2008). Even so, he concedes that the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>raise a contemporaneous objection at the sentencing hearing relegates these claims to plain-error review. <em>See United States v. Ruby, </em>706 F.3d 1221, 1226 (10th Cir. 2013) (\u201cObjections to procedural reasonableness that are not contemporaneously raised ... are subject to plain error review.\u201d)- \u201cUnder plain error review, the defendant must demonstrate (1) there is error, (2) that is plain, (3) which affects substantial rights, and (4) which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The <em>Anders </em>brief poses three possible arguments suggesting how the sentence might be considered procedurally unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, he claims the sentencing judge gave the Guidelines no weight because nothing had changed between the original sentencing proceeding\u2014where the judge imposed a sentence at the lowest Guideline level\u2014and the resentencing proceeding\u2014where the judge selected a sentence above the lowest level. Second, he argues that even though the judge and the prosecution recognized a two-level enhancement as appropriate based on the victim\u2019s injuries (which was lower than the increase by four levels originally attributed to the injuries), the judge nevertheless again imposed a 360-month sentence. Thus, he contends the judge inappropriately gave more weight to the other \u00a7 3563(a) factors than to the Guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, he claims the judge\u2019s explanation for not imposing a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range on remand was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">We find no error. The first two arguments assume the judge was bound by findings made at the original sentencing proceeding, which resulted in a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. But \u201cthe default in this circuit is de novo resen-tencing.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>646 F.3d 745, 750 (10th Cir. 2011). This court in <em>Gallegos I </em>did not limit the scope of the remand, so the district judge had discretion to conduct a new sentencing proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 748-50 (discussing the scope of resentencing proceedings where the appellate remand did not limit the scope of the remand); <em>see also Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 476, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1251, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (where appellate court remands for de novo resentencing, the resentencing judge \u201ccan reconfigure the sentencing plan to satisfy the [statutory] sentencing factors\u201d (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted)). Gallegos was properly resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Moreover, the judge adequately explained his reasoning. \u201cWhen a district [judge] imposes a within-Guidelines sentence, the [judge] must provide only a general statement of [his] reasons, and need not explicitly refer to either the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or respond to every argument for leniency that [he] rejects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>arriving at a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Harry, </em>816 F.3d 1268, 1284 (10th Cir. 2016) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Here, the judge comprehensively addressed the relevant factors. He reviewed the circumstances of Gallegos\u2019s crime, noting that he and his eodefendant had terrorized and abused their victim for several hours, causing the victim legitimately to fear for his life. Moreover, the injury to the victim\u2019s eye was serious, even if it did not meet the Guidelines definition of \u201cpermanent or life-threatening bodily injury\u201d as is necessary to warrant a four-level enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G, \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(2)(A). In addition, the judge found the Guidelines offense level not adequate to account for Gallegos\u2019s criminal history. He specifically refuted the possible speculation that the original sentence of 360 months was selected solely because it was at the low end of the Guidelines range, observing that nothing about Gallegos\u2019s history and characteristics had changed since the original sentencing proceeding. On resentencing, the judge said a sentence of 360 months was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to satisfy the sentencing goals to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to deter criminal conduct,' and to protect the public from further crimes by Gallegos. In particular, he highlighted Gallegos\u2019s continuing alcohol problem, which contributed to his past violent crimes and probation violations. Consequently, the judge believed that Gallegos was likely to offend again. The judge adequately explained Gallegos\u2019s sentence; there was no error, let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Counsel also contends the imposition of the same sentence on remand as the original sentence demonstrates vindictiveness. Gallegos devotes most of his pro se response to this claim, as well. We review this constitutional due-process claim de novo. <em>See United States v. Heineman, </em>767 F.3d 970, 973 (10th Cir. 2014) (stating questions of constitutional law are reviewed de novo); <em>United States v. Medley, </em>476 F.3d 835, 839 (10th Cir. 2007) (recognizing that a claim of vindictiveness implicates due process). \u201c[T]he defendant has the burden \u2018to prove [that] actual vindictiveness\u2019 caused [a] higher sentence and .., a presumption of vindictiveness arises only in circumstances \u2018in which there is a reasonable likelihood that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medley, </em>476 F.3d at 839 (quoting <em>Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799-800, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief contends the new sentence (based on the Guidelines range) was greater than the original sentence. While the new sentence may have been proportionally greater (because the sentencing range was lower), the actual sentence was no longer than the original.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Condign punishment embraces a host of considerations: it is a loose aggregation of factors, not a mathematical equation (except in calculating the Guidelines range). The seriousness of the victim\u2019s injuries is relevant, but not solely determinative. When a sentence in the overlap of two Guideline ranges is (as here) adequately explained, we presume it to be reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>We perceive no reason to apply a presumption of vindictiveness, particularly in light of the district judge\u2019s thorough explanation of the reasons for the sentence. Gallegos does not claim to have evidence of actual vindictiveness; only speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We have considered the potential arguments presented in counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, as well as those raised in Gallegos\u2019s pro se response. In addition, we. have examined the record to determine whether there are any other claims arguable on their merits. Gallegos\u2019s appeal is wholly frivolous. Therefore, we dismiss this appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Gallegos\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\"> After examining counsel's brief, Gallegos's response, and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be oited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. At the original sentencing the range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) was 360 months to life in prison. At resentencing, the Guidelines range was computed to be 324 to 405 months. Gallegos does not challenge the calculation of the latter rqnge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\">. Appellate counsel was not the same as trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-13\">.In undertaldng our independent examination of the record, we have identified a potential ground for appeal\u2014Gallegos\u2019s trial counsel may have been ineffective for not interposing a contemporaneous objection to the sentence. This ground, however, is not appropriately brought on direct appeal. \"Ineffective assistance of counsel claims should be brought in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (10th Cir. 1995) (en banc). Thus, \u201cwhen brought on direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are presumptively dismissible, and virtually all will be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trestyn, </em>646 F.3d 732, 741 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations omitted). \u201c[E]ven if the record appears to need no further development, the claim should still be presented first to the district [judge].\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>56 F.3d at 1240. We see no reason to depart from that general rule in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">. Those arguments are included in Gallegos\u2019s pro se response, which also contends the imposition of the same sentence on remand resulted in a substantively unreasonable sentence because if the two-level enhancement had been correctly applied in the first place, he would \"undoubtedly\u201d have been sentenced to 324 months. Response, at 5. \"Substantive reasonableness involves whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Craig, </em>808 F.3d 1249, 1261 (10th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). Gallegos\u2019s speculative argument about his within-Guidelines sentence being substantively unreasonable is insufficient to rebut the \"presumption of substantive reasonableness on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-11\">. According to Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief the district judge did not appear to consider Gallegos\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, but it does not describe any such conduct or explain how it could have affected his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. In his pro se response Gallegos also claims there is no objective information in the record to justify the increased sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
