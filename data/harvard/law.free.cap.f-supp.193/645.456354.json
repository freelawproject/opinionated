The mooted portion, describing what petitioner may carry, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\u201cContractor\u2019s machinery and equipment, heavy machinery, and <em>commodities requiring the use of special equipment.\u201d </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (ital. suppl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIk\">The Commission ruled that the italicized phrase does not permit the carriage of petroleum products in tank trucks. Petroleum \u2014 Union Cartage Co., 1960, 309 I.C.C. 333. This action resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">It is true that in certain circumstances the phrase \u201ccommodities requiring the use of special equipment\u201d may refer, inter alia, to petroleum products in tank trucks. For example, where a carrier has a general commodities license but \u201ccommodities requiring the use of special equipment\u201d are excluded, this exclusion is held to encompass tank-carried products. Transport Motor Express, Inc., Extension \u2014 Lacquers and Paints, 1951, 53 M.C.C. 267. Petitioner claims that if a clause embraces a certain matter when used in one connection, it must in another. This simply is not so. The meaning of a phrase, like a word, is shaded and colored by its surroundings. Familiar principles of <em>ejusdem generis, in pari materia, </em>or <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>are all ways of saying that the whole must be looked at, and not a single part separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The Commission points out (and petitioner concedes) that the initial words \u201cContractor\u2019s machinery and equipment, heavy machinery * * * \u201d refer specifically to heavy haulers. It then says that the additional phrase \u201ccommodities requiring the use of special equipment\u201d in this association reads naturally on matter closely related,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and holds that interpreting the clause more broadly is to be avoided as introducing a new and totally unrelated activity. Correspondingly, with respect to petitioner\u2019s contention as to general commodity carriers, the Commission again points out that the carriage of bulk products in tank trucks is a separate, specialized field. Therefore, it says, in the one case the phrase \u201ccommodities requiring the use of special equipment\u201d is to be read narrowly, in order <em>not to introduce </em>a dissimilar activity, and in the other case broadly, in order <em>to exclude </em>a dissimilar activity. Compare Petroleum Carrier Corp. v. Black, 1950, 51 M.C.C. 717, with The Western Express Co., \u2014 Sealdtanks, March 22, 1961, No. MC-8902.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">The Commission must be allowed broad scope to regulate, which is its designed function, see A. B. &amp; C. Motor Transportation Co. v. United States, D.C.D.Mass.1955, 130 F.Supp. 87, and, within reason, it must be permitted to exercise its special competence by interpreting its own language and words of art. We see nothing arbitrary or capricious in the principle adopted, and, in the application of this principle, we see nothing incongruous in the construction giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>en the particular language of petitioner\u2019s operating authority. There is certainly no novelty in classifying motor carriers on the basis of commodities transported. Classification of Motor Carriers of Property, 1937, 2 M.C.C. 703; St. Johnsbury Trucking Co., Inc., Extension \u2014 Heavy Hauling, 1951, 53 M.C.C. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">An order will be entered denying the relief sought by the plaintiff and dismissing its complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. Subsequent, separate, paragraphs provide for the transportation of agricultural machinery, sand and gravel, and fertilizer, within much more limited geographical areas. Both sides seek to draw comfort from this. If it helps anyone, we think it is the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-14\">. \u201cThe words \u2018special equipment\u2019 in a number of motor-carrier certificates mean the use of such special equipment as may be necessary for the loading and unloading of the vehicles of the heavy haulers, and are used as a means of identifying the commodities which the heavy haulers may transport.\u201d 309 I.C.C. at 335.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
