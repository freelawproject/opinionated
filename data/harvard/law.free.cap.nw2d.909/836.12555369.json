On remand, because the factual basis for defendant's plea supported his convictions, defendant's convictions did not violate double jeopardy, and defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May 2015, the police arrested defendant after discovering that he was operating a mobile methamphetamine laboratory in his vehicle. Defendant was charged with five criminal offenses and given notice that he could be sentenced as a fourth-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.12. The prosecutor offered defendant a plea deal, pursuant to which defendant would plead guilty of manufacturing methamphetamine, operating or maintaining a methamphetamine laboratory, and possession of methamphetamine. In exchange, the prosecutor agreed to dismiss the of charges of maintaining a drug house, MCL 333.7405(1)(d), and operating a vehicle while his license was suspended, second offense, MCL 257.904(3)(b). The prosecutor also agreed that defendant could be sentenced as a second-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.10, as opposed to a fourth-offense habitual offender. At the plea hearing, the trial court engaged in the following colloquy with defendant to ascertain the factual basis for defendant's plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : The Count I offense charges you with manufacture of [sic] making some methamphetamine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Is that true, did you make some methamphetamine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : Did you know the substance that you were manufacturing or making was, in fact, methamphetamine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    The Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : And the Count II charge says that you were operating or maintaining a laboratory to make methamphetamine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Does that mean that you had chemicals or the necessary components to make it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : And did you make it in a building or a residence that was under you control?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Um, a vehicle, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : In a vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Yes.

In keeping with the plea bargain, the trial court sentenced defendant as a second-offense habitual offender to concurrent terms of 51 months' to 30 years' imprisonment for manufacturing methamphetamine and operating or maintaining a methamphetamine laboratory as well as a concurrent sentence of 117 days for the possession of methamphetamine. The case is now before us on remand from the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration as on leave granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. PERSONAL-USE EXCEPTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, defendant first argues that his guilty plea for manufacturing methamphetamine should be set aside because, as set forth in MCL 333.7106(3)(a), there is a personal-use exception to prohibitions on manufacturing a controlled substance and, absent evidence that defendant did not intend to use the methamphetamine for personal use, the factual basis for his manufacturing conviction was lacking and trial counsel was ineffective for not raising this issue. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Initially, we note that defendant never moved to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court. Under MCR 6.310(D), defendant's failure to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea bars him from raising on appeal the argument that his plea was not an accurate one. In particular, MCR 6.310(D) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A defendant convicted on the basis of a plea may not raise on appeal any claim of noncompliance with the requirements of the rules in this subchapter, or any other\n   claim that the plea was not an understanding, voluntary, or accurate one, unless the defendant has moved to withdraw the plea in the trial court, raising as a basis for withdrawal the claim sought to be raised on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant's challenge to the factual basis for his plea implicates the accuracy of his plea, and thus his claim falls squarely within the ambit of MCR 6.310(D). Because a motion to withdraw a plea constitutes a prerequisite for challenging the accuracy of a plea and defendant has not filed such a motion, our direct substantive review of this appellate argument is precluded under MCR 6.310(D).\n   <em>\n    People v. Armisted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3900076\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/295/32/#p48\">\n    295 Mich. App. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20N.W.2d%2047\">\n    811 N.W.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, defendant has also raised his argument as an ineffective-assistance claim, asserting that counsel provided ineffective assistance by not raising the personal-use issue in the trial court. While our direct substantive analysis of the personal use issue is precluded by MCR 6.310(D), this rule does not prevent us from considering the personal-use exception in the context of an ineffective assistance argument. As demonstrated by the Supreme Court order in\n   <em>\n    People v. Broyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12147673,12147554,12147612,12147741\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/498/927/\">\n    498 Mich. 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), a claim of ineffective-assistance of counsel can serve as a basis for relief relative to a plea despite a failure to comply with MCR 6.310. Specifically, the Court observed and ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Pursuant to MCR 7.305(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we vacate the Kent Circuit Court's order denying the defendant's motion for plea withdrawal and/or to correct an invalid sentence and we REMAND this case to the Kent Circuit Court. That court shall treat the defendant's January 26, 2015 supplemental\n   brief and February 20, 2015 supplemental motion as timely filed and evaluate the defendant's issues on the merits. The defendant's attorney acknowledges that the defendant did not contribute to the delay in filing a proper motion and admits her sole\n   responsibility for the error. Because a motion to withdraw a plea or correct an invalid sentence is a prerequisite to substantive review on direct appeal under MCR 6.310 and MCR 6.429, the defendant was effectively deprived of his direct appeal as a result of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.

The question is whether his cooking or making of methamphetamine constitutes the illegal \"manufacture\" of methamphetamine in light of the personal-use exception set forth in MCL 333.7106(3)(a) as part of the definition of \"manufacture.\" In particular, the term \"manufacture\" is defined in the Public Health Code as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Manufacture\" means\n   <em>\n    the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion, or processing of a controlled substance\n   </em>\n   , directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis.

In actuality, as set forth in \u00a7 7106(3), in relevant part, the definition of \"manufacture\" provides a list of six activities that constitute manufacturing: production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion, and processing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   From this list of six activities, the \u00a7 7106(3)(a) personal-use exception includes only two of these activities: preparation\n   and compounding. \"Generally, when language is included in one section of a statute but omitted from another section, it is presumed that the drafters acted intentionally and purposely in their inclusion or exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

By defining \"manufacture\" to include six activities and then including only two of those six activities under the personal-use exception, the Legislature made clear that a personal-use exception applies for \"preparation or compounding,\" but that there is no similar personal-use exception for production, propagation,\n   conversion, or processing.\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2276146\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/157/68/#p72\">\n    157 Mich.

Accordingly, the personal-use exception does not apply, and one who knowingly\n   makes or cooks methamphetamine is guilty of manufacturing methamphetamine without regard to whether the methamphetamine will be distributed or used personally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the present facts, at the plea hearing, when describing his activities, defendant admitted that he had chemicals and components to make methamphetamine, that he was \"manufacturing or making\" methamphetamine, and that he\n   had \"cooked or made\" methamphetamine. Clearly, defendant admitted to the creation of methamphetamine, and his factual admissions were sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant produced, propagated, converted, or processed methamphetamine in contravention of MCL 333.7401(1) and MCL 333.7106(3). In contrast, this level of activity is not consistent with the assertion that defendant engaged in the \"preparation or compounding\" of existing methamphetamine merely to make it ready for use. Defendant is, therefore, ineligible for the personal-use exception, and it is immaterial whether or not defendant cooked methamphetamine for his own use or for distribution purposes. In sum, the personal-use exception simply had no bearing on this case, and the trial court's failure to exclude the possibility of personal-use does not undermine the factual basis of defendant's plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In concluding that the trial court obtained a sufficient factual basis for defendant's plea, we also note that the personal use exception is an affirmative defense\n   to a charge of manufacturing a controlled substance, meaning that it was not an element of the crime on which the trial court had to elicit factual support for defendant's plea. MCL 333.7401(1) creates a general prohibition on the manufacturing of controlled substances. While there are potential exceptions to this general prohibition, pursuant to MCL 333.7531(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that, when offering proof of the elements of the offense, the prosecution has no obligation to negate any exemption or exception in Article 7 of the Public Health Code, which includes the personal-use exception in MCL 333.7106(3). Instead, \"[t]he burden of proof of an exception or exception is upon the person claiming it.\" MCL 333.7531(1). Once the prosecution has presented a prima facie case of manufacturing a controlled substance, the burden shifts to the defendant to present some competent evidence regarding the applicability of the personal-use exception.

In actuality, manufacturing a controlled substance may be a process with various steps, and the Legislature broadly defined the term \"manufacture\" to encompass myriad activities in this process, including tasks that may potentially be carried out without a right of control over the substance, such as labeling containers or mixing the brownie batter to which a controlled substance is added. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Eggers\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued February 14, 2006 (Docket No. 256618), p.5. Depending on the drug and the method of manufacturing, it is also possible that there will be no controlled substance to possess until the manufacturing process is complete, and the fact that one undertakes the manufacture of a controlled substance is no guarantee that there will be a right of control or dominion over the finished product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Ultimately, while manufacturing may often involve possession, it is not invariably the case that one who manufactures a controlled substance will also have possession of the substance manufactured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because it is not impossible to manufacture a controlled substance without also possessing that controlled substance, there is no double-jeopardy violation arising from convictions for manufacture and possession of the same substance.

Although his conviction for possession stems from the possession of the same methamphetamine that he manufactured, possession and manufacturing are distinct offenses. Consequently, defendant's conviction and sentencing for both offenses does not violate double jeopardy. Having concluded that defendant's convictions do not violate double jeopardy, we also reject defendant's argument that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise this meritless argument in the trial court.
