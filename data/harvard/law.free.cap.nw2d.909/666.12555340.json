He argues the district court improperly denied his motion to amend the parties' parenting time schedule and abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees. Mark Rath further asserts the trial judge acted prejudicially and with bias, warranting immediate recusal and relief through this Court's issuance of a supervisory writ. We affirm the district court's denial of his motion to amend the parties' parenting time schedule, reverse the court's award of attorney fees, and deny his request for a supervisory writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In January 2013, Mark Rath and Kayla Rath, now known as Kayla Jones, were divorced.

The court noted that the current motion was filed only three months after the latest parenting plan issued by the court and twelve to fifteen months before the planned vacation.

However, the motion to modify parenting time to allow Mark Rath to have an extended summer vacation with the children is not without some supportive facts and law. The parties' relationship is governed by their significant animosity for each other. As noted by the court, the parties have difficulty communicating in a civil manner. A reasonable person could believe that court intervention would be required to obtain a modification of the parties' parenting plan. Also, the denial of the modification was based, at least in part, on the timing of the motion and a finding of the district court that there had been insufficient unsupervised parenting time to allow a determination that the modification would be in the children's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 13] While we agree the district court's denial of the requested modification was not clearly erroneous, Mark Rath's motion did not have such a \"complete absence of actual facts or law\" that a reasonable person could not have expected the district court to render a decision in his favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Pedro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6913643\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/856/775/\">\n    2014 ND 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6913643\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/856/775/\">\n    856 N.W.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
