The application for leave to appeal the October 6, 2017 order of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court. The motion to add issues is DENIED; however, this denial is without prejudice to the defendant raising the issues in a motion for relief from judgment under MCR Subchapter 6.500.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
