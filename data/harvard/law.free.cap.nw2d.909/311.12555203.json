FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court's earlier opinion recites the following factual history underlying this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Notre Dame Marist Academy (Marist) is a private, Catholic middle school in Pontiac, Michigan. Notre Dame Preparatory School (Notre Dame) is a private, Catholic high school in Pontiac, Michigan. Together, Marist and Notre Dame constitute the defendant in this case, Marist Fathers of Detroit, Inc., [doing business as] Notre Dame Preparatory High School and Marist Academy. Plaintiff, Bettina Winkler, enrolled in Marist as both a seventh-grade and eighth-grade student. According to plaintiff's complaint, she was \"assured on numerous occasions that if she enrolled at Marist for 7th and 8th grade, she would\n   be guaranteed placement in Notre Dame Prep for High School 9th grade.\" However, plaintiff was not granted admission to Notre Dame. Approximately two months after being denied admission to Notre Dame, plaintiff was diagnosed with certain learning disabilities.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Thereafter, this lawsuit was filed, alleging in pertinent part discrimination under the Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA), [ MCL 37.1101 ]\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff alleged that despite being \"long aware that [she] had a learning\n   disability,\" defendant denied her admission to Notre Dame and \"consistently relied upon her learning disability ... as a justification\" for doing so. [\n   <em>\n    Winkler v. Marist Fathers of Detroit, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , unpub. op. at 1-2.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Procedurally, in the trial court, plaintiff's parents, Helga Dahm Winkler and Marvin Winkler, filed a complaint on behalf of their daughter, alleging disability discrimination under the PWDCRA, violation of Michigan's Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), MCL 445.901\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and claims of tortious fraud and misrepresentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(4) and (10). Defendant claimed that summary disposition was warranted pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4) and focused primarily on this Court's prior ruling in\n   <em>\n    Dlaikan\n   </em>\n   , asserting that civil courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over a religious school's admissions decisions pursuant to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Defendant also sought summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that it was not aware of plaintiff's disability at the time she was denied admission to the high school and that it had provided accommodations to plaintiff after learning of plaintiff's disability. Plaintiff responded to the motion, asserting, in relevant part, that defendant's status as a religious school did not exempt it from being subject to the PWDCRA. Plaintiff further asserted that defendant was on notice in 2012 of plaintiff's attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and suspected learning disability. Plaintiff also argued that\n   <em>\n    Dlaikan\n   </em>\n   was not applicable and was factually distinguishable from this case. In reply, defendant asserted that as a private school, it did not fall within the ambit of the PWDCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court issued an opinion and order denying defendant's motion for summary disposition. As relevant to the issue on remand, the trial court denied defendant's motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), explaining, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   While the [PWDCRA] does not expressly address religious schools, it is basic that under rules of statutory construction, words and phrases are to be construed according to the ordinary rules of grammar and dictionary meanings. Here it appears that Notre Dame Prep High School is a public or private institution or school system; Defendant fails to establish that the PWDCRA does not apply to the Notre Dame Prep High School given [the applicable] definitions in the Act. [Citations omitted.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, which was granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal in this Court, as relevant to\n   this remand, defendant argued that the PWDCRA is not applicable to religious schools. Plaintiff responded that the PWDCRA was clearly applicable to religious schools given the definition of an educational institution in MCL 37.1401, demonstrating the Legislature's decision to not exempt such schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, this Court reversed the trial court's ruling; we concluded the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because defendant's actions\n   in denying plaintiff admission to its school were protected by the First Amendment. Accordingly, this Court did not reach the issue whether defendant is an \"educational institution\" as contemplated by MCL 37.1401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed an application for leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court, and following the submission of briefs and oral argument, the Michigan Supreme Court issued an opinion holding, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The existence of subject matter jurisdiction turns not on the particular facts of the matter before the court, but on its general legal classification. By contrast, application of the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine is not determined by reference to the category or class of case the plaintiff has stated.... What matters instead is whether the actual adjudication of a particular legal claim would require the resolution of ecclesiastical questions; if so, the court must abstain from resolving those questions itself, defer to the religious entity's resolution of such questions, and adjudicate the claim accordingly. The doctrine, in short, requires a case-specific inquiry that informs how a court must adjudicate certain claims within its subject matter jurisdiction; it does not determine whether the court has such jurisdiction in the first place. The instant panel thus erred, albeit understandably, in deeming summary disposition warranted under MCR 2.116(C)(4), and we reverse that determination.

Defendant's argument was premised on \"an analogy between the students of its high school and the clergy and membership of a church.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, --- Mich. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20566\">\n    901 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202800040\">\n    2017 WL 2800040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8. Arguing that church authorities maintain the final say in matters of expulsion or excommunication from the church and that civil courts cannot interfere in such decisions, defendant contended that \"[a] parochial school's admission or expulsion\n   of a student is no different ... given the 'integral part' such a school can play in furthering 'the religious mission of the Catholic Church' and in 'transmitting the Catholic faith to the next generation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 343,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20566\">\n    901 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, the Michigan Supreme Court stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Whether this analogy is generally sound, and whether it holds up in the instant case (or in\n   <em>\n    Dlaikan\n   </em>\n   , for that matter), we see no reason to reach at this time. It is for the circuit court, in the first instance, to determine whether and to what extent the adjudication of the legal and factual issues presented by the plaintiff's claim would require the resolution of ecclesiastical questions (and thus deference to any answers the church has provided to those questions). It is enough for our purposes here to clarify that, contrary to the suggestion of\n   <em>\n    Dlaikan\n   </em>\n   and other decisions, the circuit court does, in fact, have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claim, and the judicial power to consider it and dispose of it in a manner consistent with the guarantees of the First Amendment. Simply put, to the extent that application of the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine might still prove fatal to the plaintiff's claim for relief under the PWDCRA, it will not be for lack of \"jurisdiction of the subject matter\" under MCR 2.116(C)(4).

With reference to the issue currently on remand before this Court, our Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the defendant's entitlement to summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), the Court of Appeals previously declined to reach those arguments on which the circuit court had not yet ruled; we see no reason to disrupt that decision. The circuit court did, however, reject the defendant's argument that the PWDCRA does not apply to its school, a ruling which the defendant challenged on appeal but which the panel saw no need to review given its jurisdictional determination. Having reversed the jurisdictional determination, we remand this matter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of that challenge. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 344,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20566\">\n    901 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The issue on remand-whether the PWDCRA is applicable to defendant, a religious school-is significant, yet narrow in focus. On remand, we are not instructed to evaluate whether defendant violated the PWDCRA with regard to its dealings with plaintiff. Rather, the Michigan Supreme Court has directed us to address only the first step in analyzing plaintiff's claim-whether defendant's school qualifies as an \"educational institution\" as that term is defined in MCL 37.1401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The starting point in our analysis is the statutory language at issue, and our analysis is guided by the rules of statutory construction. Certain legal principles are widely recognized concerning statutory construction. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [a] court's primary goal when interpreting a statute is to discern legislative intent first by examining the plain language of the statute.

MCL 37.1102(1) and (2). To achieve the stated purpose, MCL 37.1401 identifies an \"educational institution\" as including \"a public or private institution or a separate school or department of a public or private institution,\" including \"elementary or secondary school[s].\" Notably, defendant does not dispute its status as a \"private\" school; rather, it contends that omission from the statute of language specific to religious schools obviates the statute's application to defendant. According to\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed.), p. 1546, a \"private school\" is defined as \"[a] school maintained by private individuals, religious organizations, or corporations, funded, at least in part, by fees or tuition, and open only to pupils selected and admitted based on religious affiliations or other particular qualifications.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In addition, \"private school\" is defined in\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed.) as \"a school that is established, conducted, and primarily supported by a nongovernmental agencies.\" Given these definitions, the term \"private school\" must be broadly construed to encompass schools run by nongovernmental agencies, including religious organizations, such as defendant. Therefore, we conclude that defendant's schools qualify as \"educational institutions\" as that term is a defined by MCL 37.1401. Our determination is buttressed by related statutory provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act (CRA), MCL 37.2101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the private, denominational, and parochial schools act, MCL 388.551\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First addressing the CRA, MCL 37.2401 provides a definition of the term \"educational institution\" to that is almost identical to the definition set forth in the PWDCRA. Specifically, MCL 37.2401 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   As used in this article, \"educational institution\" means a public or private institution, or a separate school or department thereof, and includes an academy, college, elementary or secondary school, extension course, kindergarten, nursery, local school system, university, or a business, nursing, professional, secretarial, technical, or vocational school;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   and includes an agent of an educational institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Similar to the PWDCRA, the CRA also identifies prohibited practices of educational institutions to include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   An educational institution shall not do any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (a) Discriminate against an individual in the full utilization of or benefit from the institution, or the services, activities, or programs provided by the institution because of religion, race, color, national origin, or sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (b) Exclude, expel, limit, or otherwise discriminate against an individual seeking admission as a student or an individual enrolled as a student in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the institution, because of religion, race, color, national origin, or sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (c) For purposes of admission only, make or use a written or oral inquiry or form of application that elicits or attempts to elicit information concerning the religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, or marital status of a person, except as permitted by rule of the commission or as required by federal law, rule, or regulation, or pursuant to an affirmative action program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (d) Print or publish or cause to be printed or published a catalog, notice, or advertisement indicating a preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on the religion, race, color, national origin, or sex of an applicant for admission to the educational institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (e) Announce or follow a policy of denial or limitation through a quota or otherwise of educational opportunities of a group or its members because of religion, race, color, national origin, or sex. [ MCL 37.2402.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Notably, the CRA provides an exception in MCL 37.2403, which states that \"[t]he provisions of [ MCL 37.2402 ] related to religion shall not apply to a religious educational institution or an educational institution operated, supervised, or controlled by a religious institution or organization which limits admission or gives preference to an applicant of the same religion.\" The CRA's statutory language illustrates that the Legislature clearly intended that the term \"educational institution\" be broadly and inclusively interpreted unless an exception is specifically set forth as the Legislature did in MCL 37.2403. Consequently, we conclude that the rules of statutory construction do not favor defendant's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Similarly, a review of the private, denominational, and parochial school act, MCL 388.551\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , is\n   contrary to defendant's interpretation of the PWDCRA. The stated purpose of this act is \"to provide for the supervision of private, denominational and parochial schools; to provide the manner of securing funds in payment of the expense of such supervision; to provide the qualifications of the teachers in such schools; and to provide for the endorsement of the provisions hereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1921%20PA%20302\">\n    1921 PA 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , title. Specifically, in accordance with MCL 388.552, \"[a] private, denominational or parochial school within the meaning of this act\n   <em>\n    shall be any school\n   </em>\n   other than a public school giving instruction to children below the age of sixteen years, in the first eight grades as provided for the public schools of the state, such school not being under the exclusive supervision and control of the officials having charge of the public schools of the state.\" (Emphasis added.) While defendant suggests that the inclusion of the words \"denominational or parochial school,\" in addition to the word \"private,\" is consistent with its position regarding the meaning attributable to the omission of such wording in MCL 37.1401, it may just as easily be construed that the use of the words \"private, denominational\n   or parochial\" serves to reference any nonpublic institution encompassed by MCL 388.552, and also emphasizes the inclusiveness of the use of the term \"private\" in MCL 37.1401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In support of its position, defendant also cites language in a variety of other statutes that define or identify schools as religious, denominational, or parochial. Defendant specifically refers to the following statutory provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MCL 333.7410(8)(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is part of the Public Health Code, MCL 333.1101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , defines\n   \"school property\" to include \"public, private, denominational, or parochial school\" property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   MCL 207.213, which is part of the motor carrier fuel tax act, MCL 207.211\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , refers to the taxation of commercial motor vehicles and exempt those \"owned by, or leased and operated by, a nonprofit private, parochial, or denominational, school....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   MCL 207.1030(1)(c), which is also part of the motor carrier fuel tax act, refers to the exemption of motor fuel from taxation when \"sold directly by the supplier to a nonprofit, private, parochial, or denominational school ... and... used in a school bus owned and ... operated by the educational institution....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   MCL 257.627a(1)(b), which is part of the Michigan Vehicle Code, MCL 257.1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , defines \"school\" to \"mean[ ] an educational institution operated by a local school district or by a private, denominational, or parochial organization.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   MCL 750.212a(2)(e), which is part of the Michigan Penal Code, MCL 750.1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , defines \"vulnerable target\" to include \"[a] public, private, denominational, or parochial school offering developmental kindergarten, kindergarten, or any grade 1 through 12.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   MCL 28.733(d), which is part of the Sex Offenders Registration Act, MCL 28.721\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , defines \"school\" to mean \"a public, private, denominational, or parochial school....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Contrary to [defendant's] claim, use of the\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   canon of construction does not aid [defendant's] cause.\"\n   <em>\n    SBC Health Midwest, Inc. v.

We also take this opportunity to emphasize that the Michigan Supreme Court expressly stated that it will be \"for the circuit court, in the first instance, to determine whether and to what extent the adjudication of the legal and factual issues presented by the plaintiff's claim would require the resolution of ecclesiastical questions (and thus deference to any answers the church has provided to those questions).\"\n   <em>\n    Winkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20327\">\n    500 Mich. at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20N.W.2d%20566\">\n    901 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
