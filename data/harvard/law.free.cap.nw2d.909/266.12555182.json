The plaintiff attached her complaint to her brief, cited the governing statute, MCL 445.901\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., and provided a two-page discussion of her theory supporting her claims. Thus, the plaintiff did not simply announce her position and leave it to the court to rationalize her basis, nor did she require the court to search for authority either to sustain or reject her position in this statutory cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"802702\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/457/232/#p243\">\n    457 Mich. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20N.W.2d%20100\">\n    577 N.W.2d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), quoting\n   <em>\n    Mitcham v. Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1865412\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/355/182/#p203\">\n    355 Mich. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20N.W.2d%20388\">\n    94 N.W.2d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in declining to consider the plaintiff's MCPA claims. Therefore, we REMAND this case to that court for consideration of the trial court's grant of summary disposition on those claims. See\n   <em>\n    Brownlow v. McCall Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12303308\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/315/103/\">\n    315 Mich.App. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20N.W.2d%20295\">\n    888 N.W.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
