The court considered all of the factors described in MCL 600.2955(1) and determined that plaintiff's experts did not present sufficient evidence to support plaintiff's theory of causation. At the most, plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   evidence indicated only that pressure on the fetal head constitutes one \"risk factor\" for hypoxic/ischemic injury and stroke, along with a host of other \"risk factors,\" and that, even when\n   <em>\n    three or more\n   </em>\n   \"risk factors\" are present, hypoxic/ischemic injury or stroke results in no more than 0.5% of cases. Plaintiff did not present any evidence that head compression, rather than another risk factor, caused his injuries and none of the articles cited by plaintiff's experts directly supported their conclusion that pressure on the fetal head during labor and delivery causes either brain damage and/or strokes. See\n   <em>\n    Elher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302078\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/499/11/#p22\">\n    499 Mich. at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=878%20N.W.2d%20790\">\n    878 N.W.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A lack of supporting literature, while not dispositive, is an important factor in determining the admissibility of expert witness testimony.\"). Ultimately, the trial court ruled that plaintiff's experts had not adequately demonstrated the reliability of their testimony. Considering the underlying facts, this was a principled exercise of judgment, discussed at length in a thoughtful 30-page opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court of Appeals criticized the trial court for misunderstanding the gatekeeper role and resolving the issue of causation instead of determining whether plaintiff's experts could offer a reliable opinion. In particular, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Vanslembrouck v. Halperin\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued Oct. 28, 2014 (Docket No. 309680),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205462596\">\n    2014 WL 5462596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which similar testimony was admitted. Yet the trial court here was obliged to rule on the record of this case, not some other. And on this record, it clearly stated that plaintiff's experts failed to explain why their testimony was reliable. Indeed, the trial court noted that plaintiff's experts had argued in a conclusory way that the testimony was admissible under applicable standards, despite the court's prompting that they do so in a more robust manner. This does not mean that the experts were wrong or fabricated their theory. It simply means that they failed to adequately justify it in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   proceeding. The Court of Appeals thus erred by relying so heavily on\n   <em>\n    Vanslembrouck\n   </em>\n   . What mattered was that the trial court reached a principled decision on the facts before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because I do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding plaintiff's causation experts, I would reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and reinstate the trial court's order granting defendants' motion to exclude plaintiff's causation experts and granting defendants' motion for partial summary disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I, Larry S.
