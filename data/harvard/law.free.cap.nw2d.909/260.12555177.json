The parties do not dispute that her plea was defective, as the trial court did not inform her of her rights as required by MCR 3.971(B) : the respondent was not told she was giving up the right to conduct a trial, force the DHHS to prove its allegations, confront witnesses against her, and compel attendance of favorable witnesses. Nor-importantly here-was she told that her plea could be used against her in a later proceeding to terminate her parental rights. As a result of the defective plea, the court took jurisdiction over her children and adopted the DHHS's recommended service plan. Over the next two and a half years, the court held a series of review hearings to assess the respondent's progress. In 2016, DHHS sought to terminate the respondent's rights and the court did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The respondent appealed. She argued that because her plea was defective, the court lacked jurisdiction to terminate her parental rights. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that she was precluded from complaining about her plea by the collateral bar rule, citing\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    In re Hill, Minors\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued December 27, 2016 (Docket No. 332923),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207493894\">\n    2016 WL 7493894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is then that the proceeding is completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The collateral bar rule requires a litigant to challenge a trial court's erroneous decision in a direct appeal of that decision and forbids an attack in a different (collateral) proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   first applied the\n   collateral bar rule to child-protective proceedings but its application was novel.\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   effectively held that a child-protective action is really multiple actions with multiple final orders, each of which must be appealed immediately and separately.

Each proceeding starts with the filing of a petition, and ends with a determination of whether a parent's rights will be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This understanding is reinforced by our Court Rules. To the extent that MCR 3.993 can be read as permitting a parent to appeal a nonfinal order at the adjudication phase, there is no rule requiring that a parent be advised of that fact, much less any rule advising that if the parent does not appeal they will be barred from doing so at the end of the proceeding. Nor is there a rule requiring appointment of counsel to pursue such an appeal, as there is when a parent's rights are terminated. MCR 3.977(J). As a result,\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   that a parent appeal immediately after a court issues a nonfinal order in the adjudication phase is not made plain to a parent until it is too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These important differences set\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   apart from the precedent on which it relied.

Achieving finality for children in child-protective proceedings as soon as possible is a critical goal too. But the\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   rule disserves even that goal.
