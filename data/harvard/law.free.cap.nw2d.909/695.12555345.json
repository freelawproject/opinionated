Police were called to a Devils Lake restaurant between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. to check on a male, Varriano, who \"was passed out at a table.\" Varriano smelled of alcohol, \"had slurred speech and red watery eyes,\" and believed he was still in Fargo. His confrontation with officers eventually resulted in Varriano's arrest and a disorderly conduct charge, but the criminal charge was subsequently dismissed. Varriano was then terminated from the Lawyer Assistance Program for violating the terms of his individual assistance plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On January 31, 2017, disciplinary counsel filed a notice of noncompliance with conditions of reinstatement, alleging violations of conditions 5 and 6 of the order of reinstatement and seeking to revoke Varriano's reinstatement and suspend his license to practice law. This Court directed the Disciplinary Board \"to hold a hearing to determine if there is a potential for harm to the public.\" Following the hearing, the hearing panel found Varriano \"was a danger to the public while practicing law and using alcohol\" in the past and the \"reinstatement conditions were placed on Varriano's practice to safeguard the public.\" The panel found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Varriano is a solo-practitioner with an office located in Fargo, North Dakota. Mr. Varriano practices criminal law exclusively. He does work for Craig Richie and handles his own cases. He works part time, working approximately 15 hours per week. At the time of the hearing on August 2, 2017, he had one active case. In 2016, he had 10 to 12 cases. In 2017, he had four to six cases by the time of the hearing. He had tried three cases since his re-licensure and had obtained acquittals on two of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Craig Richie has been Mr. Varriano's supervising attorney since Mr. Varriano's reinstatement.

The panel was aware of no complaints from clients regarding Mr. Varriano's work or professional conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The hearing panel also found that \"on December 30, 2016, Varriano voluntarily consumed alcohol\" in violation of condition 6 of his reinstatement; he \"did not report his non-compliance with his reinstatement conditions to disciplinary authorities;\" he \"had no intention of reporting his non-compliance;\" he \"is unlikely to report any further non-compliance;\" he was terminated from the Lawyer Assistance Program in violation of condition 5; and he \"believes he would not benefit from participation\" in Alcoholics Anonymous or the Lawyer Assistance Program. The panel further found Varriano's termination from the Lawyer Assistance Program results in \"that safeguard [being] no longer in place and functioning to assist in the maintenance of his sobriety.\" The panel concluded that \"[b]y failing to comply with Conditions 5 and 6\" there is \"clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Varriano is a threat to the public.\" The panel recommended that Varriano's reinstatement be revoked, he be required to petition for reinstatement in accordance with N.D.R.

A factor for consideration in showing qualification for reinstatement under N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl. 4.5(F)(4) is \"[w]here alcohol or drug abuse was a causative factor in the lawyer's misconduct, the petitioner must show that the petitioner has been successfully rehabilitated or is pursuing appropriate rehabilitative treatment.\" Under N.D.R. Lawyer Discipl. 4.5(H), this Court \"may impose conditions upon the petitioner's reinstatement or readmission where the court reasonably believes that further precautions should be taken to ensure that the public will be protected upon the petitioner's return to practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 9] In\n   <em>\n    Aakre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409096\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/718/1/\">\n    2006 ND 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 1-4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409096\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/718/1/\">\n    718 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the attorney agreed to an immediate suspension after financial irregularities were discovered concerning two of his clients, in violation of conditions imposed in the order allowing him to continue practicing law after he had improperly taken\n   money from his law firm. Disciplinary counsel reads these authorities to mean \"if the conditions implemented to protect the public are violated or avoided, the lawyer acted as an active harm or the conditions are ineffective and no longer protect the public from the threat.\" Disciplinary counsel essentially argues that if an attorney violates a condition of reinstatement imposed to protect the public, there is automatically the potential for harm to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 10] We have said that if a reinstated attorney \"has failed to comply with the conditions of reinstatement,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   there exists a potential for harm to the public,\" the attorney may be suspended under N.D.R.

In this case, Varriano had one relapse in his sobriety during the past two years of practicing law, which resulted in his termination from the Lawyer Assistance Program. On this record, before that relapse he had been sober since March 19, 2011. Varriano has complied with all of the other conditions of his reinstatement. Varriano's relapse did not harm his clients, and during the last two years, there have been no complaints by clients or his supervising attorney about his work or professional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The primary purpose of the disciplinary process is not to penalize the attorney, but to protect the public and the integrity of the profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Disciplinary Bd. v.

We recognize that Varriano expressed misgivings about the efficacy of Alcoholics Anonymous and the Lawyer Assistance Program, and candidly stated he would not report relapses in his sobriety. However, Varriano continues to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings weekly and has gone beyond the requirements of his reinstatement conditions by attending monthly sessions with a licensed addiction counselor which he believes are more helpful in treating his alcoholism. On our review of the record, we conclude there is not clear and convincing evidence that Varriano poses a potential for harm to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Rule 3.1(G), N.D.R.
