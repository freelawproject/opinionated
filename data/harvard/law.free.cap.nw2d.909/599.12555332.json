Appellant also filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he raised several arguments. We affirm appellant's convictions but reverse and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2015, respondent State of Minnesota charged appellant Erick Longo with the following 14 counts: two counts of racketeering; four counts of conspiracy to\n   commit first-degree controlled-substance crime; one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree controlled-substance crime; one count of first-degree controlled-substance crime; three counts of second-degree controlled-substance crime; one count of third-degree controlled-substance crime; one count of fourth-degree controlled-substance crime; and one count of fifth-degree controlled-substance crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, the state presented evidence that between May 2014 and July 2015, confidential informants (CIs) purchased methamphetamine from Longo in multiple controlled buys conducted by law enforcement. As part of his drug operation, Longo used several individuals, including C.S., H.F., M.F., and B.W., as \"runners\" or \"mules,\" who delivered methamphetamine for Longo and returned with the sale money. C.S. testified that as compensation for \"being a runner,\" Longo paid him with money, methamphetamine, or \"good graces,\" meaning that if he wanted to purchase methamphetamine for himself, he could buy it from Longo at a cheaper price. C.S. also testified that as a runner for Longo, he assisted Longo with various tasks, such as stealing a car stereo from an individual who owed Longo money, and facilitating an arson as retribution for drugs that were allegedly stolen from Longo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   C.S. testified that Longo referred to a specific portion of his residence as \"The Crack Shack,\" where people purchased methamphetamine. Because Longo accepted property in exchange for methamphetamine, he sometimes referred to The Crack Shack as \"The Crack Shack Pawnshop.\" C.S. testified that Longo \"fronted\" methamphetamine to individuals in exchange for property, which was used as collateral for drugs. These individuals brought items, \"like, stolen car stereos to Longo,\" and Longo paid them in methamphetamine and wrote receipts for them. B.W. testified that Longo had several vehicles at his residence that he had obtained through \"debts and collateral\" for methamphetamine transactions. Longo posted ads for this property on \"Craigslist and ... on his Facebook page.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found Longo guilty of nine charges, including one count of racketeering, three counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree sale of methamphetamine, and five counts of sale or possession of methamphetamine. The district court denied Longo's motion for a new trial. Except in regard to the racketeering offense, which the court ranked as a severity-level nine, the court\n   <em>\n    Hernandized\n   </em>\n   all of Longo's sentences and imposed concurrent sentences for all offenses, for a total sentence of 189 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. Is the evidence sufficient to sustain Longo's convictions of racketeering and conspiracy to commit\n   first-degree sale of a controlled substance?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Did the district court err when it instructed the jury on the racketeering charge?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III. Did the prosecutor commit prejudicial misconduct during closing arguments?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IV. Did the district court err in sentencing Longo?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   V. Do any of the arguments raised in Longo's pro se supplemental brief have merit?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Longo argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions of racketeering and conspiracy to commit first-degree sale of a controlled substance. When considering a claim of insufficient evidence, we conduct \"a painstaking review of the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, were sufficient to allow the jury to reach its verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Loving v.

Therefore, a \"lone individual (unless operating as a sole proprietorship) cannot be an enterprise for purposes of RICO.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11977877\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/519/202/#p204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11977877\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/519/202/#p204\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Longo argues that the state characterized his \"enterprise\" as his thrift and pawnshop business, \"not ... that the 'enterprise' was a narcotics enterprise.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , Longo contends that because he ran these businesses alone, the state failed to prove the existence of an enterprise. Longo argues that because \"this was not an alleged narcotic-dealing enterprise,\" the state failed to show that a common purpose existed through Longo's operations of his thrift and pawnshop businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Longo's arguments that the state's case was limited to the pawn and thrift shops\n   mischaracterize the state's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended complaint specifically alleged that between \"May 1, 2014 and August 1, 2015, [Longo] committed various controlled substance crimes and invested the proceeds derived from [that] conduct into an enterprise identified as Longo's Dope House Auto Sales and Loan.\" And during closing arguments, the state emphasized that the crux of Longo's enterprise was the sale of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court recognized that the defendant, and the juveniles who worked for him, shared a common purpose by engaging in criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11977877\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/519/202/#p204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the common purpose associated with Longo's enterprise was the sale of methamphetamine. The state presented evidence that Longo was involved in numerous methamphetamine transactions and the jury convicted Longo of five felony methamphetamine-related offenses. The state also presented evidence that Longo used his thrift shop as a means of supporting his drug trade by taking personal property, rather than cash, as payment for methamphetamine. Longo would then sell this property at his shop or online. Moreover, the record reflects that Longo used various individuals to assist him in his methamphetamine transactions and often compensated them with methamphetamine. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to establish the common-purpose element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Continuity of structure and personnel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Longo also contends that the state failed to prove the enterprise element because \"the requirement of continuity and structure of personnel ... was missing.\" This element is satisfied \"where there is an organizational pattern or system of authority that provides a mechanism for directing the group's affairs on a continuing, rather than ad hoc, basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Huynh\n   </em>\n   , 519 N.W.2d at 199 (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The record reflects that the first controlled buy occurred in May 2014, and the last controlled buy happened in July 2015. This 14-month period satisfies the \"ongoing and continuing\" requirement. Moreover, the record reflects a clear organizational structure, with Longo as the principal and C.S. as Longo's \"right-hand man,\" acting as Longo's \"runner\" and assistant. And several other individuals, including H.F., M.F., and B.W., testified that they worked for Longo as \"runners\" or \"mules,\" delivering methamphetamine for Longo and returning with the sale money. Similarly, J.B. testified that he did various jobs for Longo to help pay for methamphetamine that he and his girlfriend received. B.W. testified that Longo liked to \"fashion himself after\" Pablo Escobar and that he wanted to run Thief River Falls \"like a cartel.\" Although Longo's scheme was not particularly sophisticated, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the conviction, the evidence is sufficient to support Longo's conviction of racketeering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    B. Conspiracy to Commit First-Degree Sale of a Controlled Substance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The jury found Longo guilty of conspiracy to commit first-degree controlled-substance crime in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.021\">\n    Minn.

Agreement or overt act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As long as the evidence objectively shows an agreement to commit a crime, the state need not prove the existence of a formal agreement.\n   <em>\n    State v.

C.L. testified that he participated in a controlled buy in July 2015, by contacting Longo for the purpose of \"acquiring an ounce of methamphetamine.\" According to C.L., he went to Longo's residence and \"asked him if [he] could ... get an ounce of methamphetamines dropped off at [his] mailbox\" and he would \"have $2,400 waiting in the mailbox for him.\" This testimony establishes an agreement to commit first-degree sale of methamphetamine. The overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was satisfied when Longo later provided C.L. with the ounce of methamphetamine. And the exact date of the conspiracy was established by Deputy Nelson, who testified that the controlled buy occurred on July 28, 2015. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to establish an agreement and an overt act with respect to count 14 of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Corroboration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Longo contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction because the accomplice testimony was not corroborated. We disagree. Accomplice testimony is inherently suspect.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, accomplice testimony is not sufficient to sustain a conviction, \"unless it is corroborated by such other evidence as tends to convict the defendant of the commission of the offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20634.04\">\n    Minn.

Longo.\" According to Deputy Nelson, the arrangement was made between C.L. and Longo that C.L. \"would put the money in his ... mailbox, and ... Longo was to come there, take the money out of the mailbox, put the methamphetamine in the mailbox, and then leave.\" Deputy Nelson's testimony was consistent with C.L.'s testimony, and Deputy Nelson stated that he observed the transaction occur. We conclude that sufficient evidence supports Longo's conviction of conspiracy to commit first-degree sale of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jury instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Longo argues that, even if the evidence is sufficient to convict him of racketeering, he is entitled to a new trial because the district court's jury instructions failed to (A) define enterprise; and (B) properly instruct the jury regarding the pattern of criminal activity. But Longo concedes that he did not request the omitted instructions or otherwise object to the jury instructions at trial. \"A defendant generally forfeits the right to contest jury instructions on appeal when the defendant fails to object at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

These offenses satisfy the statutory requirement that \" 'a person participates in a pattern of criminal activity' when the person is a principal with respect to conduct constituting at least three criminal acts\" and \"two of the acts constitute felonies other than conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.902\">\n    Minn.

The record reflects a plethora of evidence that the common purpose of Longo's scheme was the sale of methamphetamine. In addition, the record reflects that Longo's activities extended beyond the commission of the underlying criminal offenses; evidence was presented that Longo ran a pawnshop/thrift store with items he obtained in exchange for methamphetamine. He also ordered that J.H.'s family's barn be burned as retribution for failing to pay a drug debt, and\n   ordered that E.W.'s car be stolen so that it could be sold to satisfy E.W.'s drug debt. We therefore conclude that Longo is not entitled to a new trial based on the alleged erroneous jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Prosecutorial misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, Longo argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing arguments by \"express[ing] his personal opinion on [Longo's] guilt, the sufficiency of the evidence, the strength of the case, and whether accomplice testimony was corroborated.\" Longo, however, concedes that he did not object to the alleged prosecutorial misconduct.

We agree. The prosecutor used the phrase \"I think,\" or \"I believe\" at least a dozen times during closing arguments. The statement \"the state believes\" has been held to be plain error by the supreme court.\n   <em>\n    State v. Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9007975\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/707/645/#p656\">\n    707 N.W.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656 (Minn. 2006). The prosecutor's comments during closing arguments therefore constitute plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We next consider whether the plain error affected Longo's substantial rights. In addressing this question, we consider (1) the strength of the state's evidence; (2) \"the pervasiveness of the erroneous conduct\"; and (3) whether the defendant \"had an opportunity to rebut any improper remarks.\"\n   <em>\n    Peltier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6830816\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/874/792/#p804\">\n    874 N.W.2d at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record reflects that the state's evidence was very strong, particularly with respect to the controlled-substance crimes. Moreover, the pervasiveness of the misconduct does not weigh in favor of Longo. Although Longo points to at least a dozen times the prosecutor used the phrase \"I think,\" or \"I believe,\" during closing arguments, the record in this case is very large and the prosecutor's closing argument was lengthy. In addition, the frequency and context of the prosecutor's statements suggests \"that they were perhaps more idle clich\u00e9 than deliberate expression of personal opinion, and the absence of objection by the defense counsel who actually heard them adds to this impression.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Finally, Longo had the opportunity to rebut the misconduct in his closing argument but did not. For these reasons, Longo is not entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Longo challenges his sentence, arguing that (A) he is entitled to be resentenced under the Drug Sentencing Reform Act (DSRA); (B) the district court abused its discretion by ranking the racketeering offense at a severity-level nine; and (C) the district court erred by\n   <em>\n    Hernandizing\n   </em>\n   his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Longo is correct. The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   concluded that, in the DSRA, \"the Legislature did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend to abrogate the amelioration doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334639\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/899/485/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334639\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/899/485/#p490\">\n    at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All three factors necessary for resentencing under the DSRA therefore are satisfied.

But the record reflects that in considering the gravity of Longo's conduct, the district court found that \"this was an ongoing drug enterprise ... that included using arson as a tool to collect debts.\" In fact, the district court found that the \"gravity of\n   <em>\n    not just the drug offenses\n   </em>\n   , but the conduct around it associated with that to enforce the drug sales and drug debts ... actually exceeds the level 9.\" (Emphasis added.) Although the district court referenced an order from Longo to kill a dog belonging to the sheriff's daughter, an assertion that may not have been corroborated, the statement was made to emphasize Longo's conduct of \"enforc[ing] drug sales and drug debts.\" The district court properly exercised its discretion in considering this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With respect to the second factor, the district court referenced an unpublished case in which a severity-level ten was assigned after the defendant was convicted of racketeering. In assigning a severity-level nine here, the district court referenced the sophistication of Longo's drug scheme, but took into consideration that it was not as complicated as the scheme in the unpublished case, and assigned a lesser severity level accordingly. The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering the second\n   <em>\n    Kenard\n   </em>\n   factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Longo further argues that because the severity levels assigned to the offenses that constituted the predicate acts were lower than a severity-level nine, a severity-level eight should have been assigned. But although the district court admitted that it \"struggled\" with this factor, none of the\n   <em>\n    Kenard\n   </em>\n   factors is controlling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11484128\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/606/440/#p443\">\n    606 N.W.2d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"No single factor is controlling.\").

Krosch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9445834\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/642/713/#p719\">\n    642 N.W.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (Minn. 2002) (\"The brief contains no argument or citation to legal authority in support of the allegations and we therefore deem them waived.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The evidence is sufficient to sustain Longo's convictions of racketeering and first-degree controlled-substance crimes, and Longo is not entitled to a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct or erroneous jury instructions. But the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   method cannot be used to sentence Longo for both racketeering and controlled-substance crimes because multiple sentences under these circumstances unfairly exaggerate the criminality of the defendant's conduct. The district court therefore erred by using the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   method when it sentenced Longo. Moreover, Longo is entitled to be resentenced in accordance with the DSRA. Accordingly, we affirm Longo's convictions, but reverse and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In his reply brief, Longo claims that by failing to cite\n    <em>\n     Kelly\n    </em>\n    , the state ignored his claim that the state's enterprise argument was limited to Longo's pawn and thrift shop business. But a review of the state's brief demonstrates that the state specifically addressed Longo's argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
