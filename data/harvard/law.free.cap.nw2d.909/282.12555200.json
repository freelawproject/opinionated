The City denied MLive's FOIA requests. MLive filed suit, seeking production of the records, and moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). The trial court denied MLive's motion and dismissed the\n   case without prejudice. MLive appeals. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A man drove the wrong way down a one-way street and hit a parked car. Grand Rapids Police Officer Adam Ickes and Grand Rapids Police Sergeant Thomas Warwick responded to the accident. Officer Ickes called Grand Rapids Police Lieutenant Matthew Janiskee at a recorded police department telephone line and informed Lieutenant Janiskee that the driver of the vehicle was a \"hammered\" Kent County assistant prosecutor. Lieutenant Janiskee told Officer Ickes to hang up and call back on a different department line, (616) 456-3407, labeled \"Non-Recorded Line 3407.\" Officer Ickes then placed three calls to Lieutenant Janiskee on Line 3407. Sergeant Warwick placed two calls to Lieutenant Janiskee on Line 3407. Ultimately, Officer Ickes cited the assistant prosecutor for driving the wrong way down a one-way street, and Sergeant Warwick drove the assistant prosecutor home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The police department then conducted an internal investigation. The City states that during the investigation it discovered that the phone calls to Line 3407 had been recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City filed a declaratory action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan on February 17, 2017, seeking a determination of its rights and obligations to use and disclose the Line 3407 recordings. The City sought to use the recordings as evidence in officer disciplinary actions and legal proceedings. In the federal action, the officers asserted that use of the recordings would violate the federal wiretapping act, 18 USC 2510\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., and Michigan's eavesdropping statutes, MCL 750.539a\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The City denied violating the statutes. The City explained that it had received FOIA requests for the Line 3407 recordings. The City alleged that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the recordings were obtained in violation of the statutes, disclosure of the recordings would also violate the statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The two FOIA requests received by the City from MLive sought recordings, copies of recordings, and transcripts of the Line 3407 calls. The City denied both requests, asserting that its \"ability to release these records is the subject matter of the pending [federal] litigation....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MLive filed a complaint in the trial court, seeking an order to compel disclosure of the requested items and a declaration that the City had violated FOIA in that the City had failed to cite a FOIA exemption in support of its denial and that no such exemption exists. MLive also moved for summary disposition. In response, the City reiterated its argument that it did not believe that complying with MLive's FOIA request would violate the federal wiretapping act or Michigan's eavesdropping statutes. Nonetheless, it argued that it could invoke the MCL 15.243(1)(d) FOIA exemption because the federal court had not yet determined whether complying with the FOIA request would violate the federal wiretapping act or Michigan's eavesdropping\n   statutes. The trial court denied MLive's motion for summary disposition and dismissed the case without prejudice, citing the doctrine of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City argues that MLive could not appeal by right because it is not appealing a final order. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   MCR 7.202(6)(a)(i) defines a final order in a civil case as \"the first judgment or order that disposes of all the claims and adjudicates the rights and liabilities of all\n   the parties....\" Parties cannot create a final order by stipulating the dismissal of remaining claims without prejudice after a trial court enters an order denying a motion for summary disposition addressing only some of the parties' claims.

Therefore, the order is final, MCR 7.202(6)(a)(i), and\n   <em>\n    Detroit\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   MLive argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion for summary disposition. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. FOIA EXEMPTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court erred to the extent that it found that the City met its burden to prove that a FOIA exemption applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   FOIA proclaims that \"[i]t is the public policy of this state that all persons ... are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees ....\" MCL 15.231(2). Further, \"[t]he people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In keeping with this policy, FOIA provides persons a right to inspect, copy, or receive copies of a requested public record of a public body upon providing a public body's FOIA coordinator with a written request that describes a public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the public record, except as expressly\n   provided in MCL 15.243. MCL 15.233(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MCL 15.243(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (d) Records or information specifically described and exempted from disclosure by statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When a public body invokes this exception, it is necessary to examine the statute under which the public body claims disclosure is prohibited. See\n   <em>\n    Detroit News, Inc. v. Policemen &amp; Firemen Retirement Sys. of the City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035360\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/252/59/#p72\">\n    252 Mich.App. 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20N.W.2d%20127\">\n    651 N.W.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). For example, the federal wiretapping act prohibits the intentional interception and disclosure of an oral or wire communication. 18 USC 2511(1)(a) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, if the federal act prohibits disclosure of a communication, the communication would be exempt from disclosure under MCL 15.243(1)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   FOIA requires the public body receiving a FOIA request to interpret FOIA and decide whether to honor the request. See MCL 15.235. A FOIA request must be sent directly to the public body, specifically its FOIA coordinator. MCL 15.235(1). FOIA requires the public body to decide whether to grant or deny the request in whole or in part within five business days of receipt. MCL 15.235(2). Alternatively, the public body can seek a 10-business-day extension to make a decision. MCL 15.235(2)(d). If the public body denies any portion of the request because it determined that the content is exempt from disclosure, it must explain in writing the basis for its denial under FOIA or another statute. MCL 15.235(5)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A court only becomes involved in a FOIA request if a public body denies the request and the requester appeals. MCL 15.240(1)(b). Specifically, the person requesting the public record may \"[c]ommence a civil action in the circuit court ... to compel the public body's disclosure of the public records....\" MCL 15.240(1)(b). The public body has the burden to \"sustain its denial.\" MCL 15.240(4). The trial court reviews the denial de novo,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and construes FOIA exemptions narrowly, see\n   <em>\n    Detroit News, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035360\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/252/59/#p72\">\n    252 Mich.App. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20N.W.2d%20127\">\n    651 N.W.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The City failed to meet its burden to prove that a FOIA exemption applied. The City argues that it properly invoked the MCL 15.243(1)(d) exemption to deny MLive's FOIA requests because the federal wiretapping act prohibit the intentional interception and disclosure of an oral or wire communication, and \"the jurisdiction of a federal district court has already been invoked to make\n   th[e] factual determination[ ] ... of whether\" the federal wiretapping act applies. But the City never argued when denying MLive's FOIA request, during the trial court proceedings, or on appeal, that it actually violated the federal wiretapping act. Rather, it made the opposite argument: it accidentally or inadvertently recorded the Line 3407 phone calls and then refused to disclose the recordings to MLive. The federal wiretapping act does not prohibit the inadvertent interception or disclosure of communications. See 18 USC 2511(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Dulaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517219\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/744/#p748\">\n    970 F.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (C.A. 10, 1992).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated differently, the City needed\n   to argue that disclosure would violate the federal wiretapping act in order to invoke the MCL 15.243(1)(d) FOIA exemption and to deny MLive's FOIA requests. The City never made this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Any argument by the City that it properly invoked the MCL 15.243(1)(d) exemption because Michigan's eavesdropping statutes prohibit disclosure of the recordings similarly fails. Michigan's eavesdropping statutes prohibit the \"willful[ ]\" use of a device to eavesdrop on a private conversation without all parties' consent, MCL 750.539c, and \"us[ing]\" or \"divulg[ing]\" information that a person \"knows or reasonably should know was obtained\" through eavesdropping, MCL 750.539e. Accordingly, the City needed to argue that disclosure would violate an eavesdropping statute to invoke the MCL 15.243(1)(d) FOIA exemption. But the City never made this argument. Instead, it argued that it accidentally recorded the phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, FOIA requires the City to determine whether a FOIA exemption exists. See MCL 15.235(2). The City cited no FOIA provision that allows it to pass\n   this decision to a federal court. Therefore, the City failed to meet its burden to prove that a FOIA exemption applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. COMITY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court abused its discretion by determining that comity prevented it from ruling on MLive's FOIA complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The principle of judicial comity generally states that foreign courts can afford each other's judgment mutual respect and recognition. See\n   <em>\n    Gaudreau v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085563\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/298/148/#p152\">\n    298 Mich.App. 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20N.W.2d%20164\">\n    826 N.W.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Accordingly, \"principles of comity require\" us \"to defer to [a] federal court ruling\" when \"a federal district court [is] the equivalent of a state circuit court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouwman v.

As explained earlier, the issue before the trial court was whether the City met its burden to show that the narrowly construed MCL 15.243(1)(d) FOIA exemption\n   supported its denial of MLive's FOIA requests. See MCL 15.235(2) and (5)(a) ; MCL 15.240(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Detroit News, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035360\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/252/59/#p72\">\n    252 Mich.App. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20N.W.2d%20127\">\n    651 N.W.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As already explained in this opinion, the City failed to meet the burden. The trial court did not need to consider \"whether or not the recordings in this case were intentional\" and did not need to defer to the federal court's \"factual determination\" regarding this separate issue. The City did not argue in this case or in the federal case that it had intentionally recorded Line 3407, which could amount to violations of the federal wiretapping act\n   and Michigan's eavesdropping statutes. Because it never raised the argument, the MCL 15.243(1)(d) exemption does not apply, and the City necessarily failed to meet its burden to show that a narrowly construed FOIA exemption supported its denial of MLive's FOIA requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the trial court's decision to invoke the doctrine of comity was outside the range of principled outcomes, and the trial court erred by denying MLive's motion for summary disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   V. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because the trial court erred by denying MLive's motion for summary disposition, we remand for entry of judgment in MLive's favor. On remand, the trial court must order the City \"to cease withholding or to\n   produce\" the Line 3407 recordings. MCL 15.240(4). Accordingly, MLive prevailed because the suit \"had a substantial causative effect on\" and \"was necessary to\" \"the delivery of or access to\" the recordings. See\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Eaton Rapids\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1865495\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/196/671/#p673\">\n    196 Mich.App. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20N.W.2d%20433\">\n    493 N.W.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).
