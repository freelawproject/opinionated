Previously, defendant Eric Swager appealed in this Court as of right, asserting that the trial court erred by denying his motion for summary disposition on governmental immunity grounds under the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . In our prior opinion, we reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for entry of summary disposition in Swager's favor on the basis of our conclusion that reasonable minds could not conclude that Swager was \"the proximate cause\" of plaintiff Kersch Ray's injuries.\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

On remand, because issues of material fact remain that preclude summary disposition, we affirm the trial court's denial of Swager's motion for summary disposition, and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 2, 2011, 13-year-old Ray was struck by an automobile driven by Scott Platt. The accident occurred at the intersection of Freer Road and Old US-12 while Ray was running with the Chelsea High School cross-country team. Swager-the team's coach-was running with the team that morning. As the team approached the intersection in question, they encountered a \"red hand\" on the pedestrian signal, indicating that pedestrians should not cross the road. See MCL 257.613(2)(b). Although the eyewitness accounts vary, there is evidence that Swager said something to the effect of \"let's go,\" and the team crossed the street. Ray, who was in the back of the group, ran into the road, and he was hit by a car driven by Platt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the accident, Ray filed the instant lawsuit. Swager moved for summary disposition on governmental-immunity grounds, asserting that he was entitled to immunity as a governmental employee under MCL 691.1407(2) because he had not been \"grossly negligent\" and because his conduct was not \"the proximate cause\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   of plaintiff's injuries. The trial court denied Swager's motion, concluding that the case was \"fact laden.\" Swager then appealed as of right in this Court, and we reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded for entry of summary disposition in favor of Swager. Specifically, we concluded that Swager's verbal remarks could not reasonably be considered the proximate cause of Ray's injuries within the meaning of the GTLA, considering the other more immediate and direct causes of Ray's injuries, including Ray's own conduct of running into the street and the fact that Ray was hit by a car driven by Platt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Michigan Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded for reconsideration under a framework that clarifies \"the role that factual and legal causation play when analyzing whether a defendant's conduct was 'the proximate cause' of a plaintiff's injuries under the GTLA.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This requires \"considering defendant's actions alongside any other potential proximate causes to determine whether defendant's actions were, or could have been, 'the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause' of the injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant inquiry is not whether the defendant's conduct was the immediate factual cause of injury, but whether, weighing the legal responsibilities of the actors involved, the government actor could be considered \"the proximate cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Considering this standard in the context of the current case, we conclude that there are material questions of factual dispute that prevent us from assessing the actors' respective negligence, weighing their competing legal responsibilities, determining the proximate cause of Ray's injuries, and resolving Swager's claim to governmental immunity as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, from the record before us, it appears there are three persons whose conduct could potentially be considered a proximate cause-Swager, Ray, and\n   Platt. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the record before us is not uncontested with regard to the facts and circumstances surrounding the actions taken by these individuals. Instead, there are numerous accounts of the accident in the record before us, and these accounts differ widely in terms of the configuration of the group of runners, precisely what Swager said, and to whom he said it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In our previous opinion, we concluded that these factual disputes were not material because, even if Ray heard Swager, Swager's verbal remarks were simply too remote to be considered the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of Ray's injuries given that Ray ultimately ran into the street under his own power and was then struck by a car driven by Platt.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , unpub op. at 3-4. However, under the standard set forth by the Supreme Court, these factual disputes now preclude summary disposition. For instance, one of the main points of factual contention is how far Ray trailed the group of runners. Ray's location relative to the rest of the group bears on whether he even heard Swager, whether Swager's instruction applied to Ray, whether Ray had a duty to independently evaluate the safety of the road before crossing, and whether Ray could be considered negligent in relying on Swager's remark. Whether Swager's instruction applied to Ray-and how far Ray trailed the group-is also material to determining whether Swager was grossly negligent\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in giving this instruction and whether it was foreseeable that Ray would follow Swager into the road without looking. Aside from the actions of Swager and Ray, there are also factual disputes regarding Platt's conduct, including debate about whether he accelerated as he approached the yellow traffic light despite the presence of numerous runners in the area. In short, given the myriad variables affecting the actors' respective negligence and legal responsibility, and in light of the factual disputes relating to these issues, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that Swager was not grossly negligent and that this gross negligence did not constitute the proximate cause of Ray's injuries. See MCL 691.1407(2)(c). Consequently, Swager was not entitled to summary disposition based on immunity granted by the GTLA. See\n   <em>\n    Poppen\n   </em>\n   , 256 Mich.

(concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I concur with the majority opinion, but write separately to emphasize the following additional points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, courts must be ever vigilant to decide cases on the basis of legal merits, not emotion. This case presents an incident that by any measure was nothing short of tragic, and one young man and his family will suffer a lifetime of consequences that the rest of us can at best only imagine. In the face of such tragedy, judges should be appropriately sympathetic. Human empathy survives the donning of a black robe. That said, it is equally true (though perhaps less understood) that in a world of pure legal issues-such as the world of an appellate court whose charge is to assess whether legal error occurred in a lower court-even sympathetic judges must set emotion aside and dispassionately decide the legal issues presented without bias or favor toward any party. Appeals to emotion,\n   while understandable, belong elsewhere.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, I am compelled to suggest that this Court and the trial courts of this state would benefit from further articulation of the framework that the Supreme Court outlined in its recent decision in this case. See\n   <em>\n    Ray v. Swager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Majority indicated that its decision was intended to \"clarif[y] the role that factual and legal causation play when analyzing whether a defendant's conduct was 'the proximate cause' of a plaintiff's injuries under the [governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . ],\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 64-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I am convinced that I am far from alone in scratching my head as I attempt to envision how that framework will (and indeed how it can) be applied in the trial courts of this state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in my view, the Dissent was appropriately concerned that the approach of the Majority \"will almost inevitably result in jurisprudential confusion and upset in lower courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 97 n. 25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( WILDER , J.,\n   <em>\n    dissenting\n   </em>\n   ).

Because, respectfully, the Majority did not, in my judgment, achieve the well-intentioned clarity that it sought. It did appropriately recognize that long-standing confusion has existed in the caselaw of this state (and elsewhere) because courts have at various times given the term \"proximate cause\" two entirely distinct (and inconsistent) meanings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such confusion indeed merits clarification. To some extent, the Majority (as well as the Dissent) achieved some clarification on that score simply by acknowledging and\n   addressing the past discordant uses of the term \"proximate cause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, I would respectfully suggest that we have not yet achieved clarity with regard to the meaning of \"the proximate cause\" in the GTLA. See MCL 691.1407(2)(c). The Majority and the Dissent seem to agree that the dispositive issue is what the Legislature intended when, in 1986 it adopted a \"narrow exception\" to the \"broad immunity\" that is afforded to governmental actors for the consequences of any \"gross negligence,\" see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of the Court);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( WILDER , J.,\n   <em>\n    dissenting\n   </em>\n   ), and therefore what the Legislature intended when it limited the liability flowing from that narrow exception to \"conduct ... that is\n   <em>\n    the proximate cause\n   </em>\n   of the injury or damage,\" MCL 691.1407(2)(c) (emphasis added). But the Majority and the Dissent disagree about what the Legislature in fact intended by the term \"the proximate cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Resolving that dispute is obviously above my pay grade. I will therefore endeavor only to point out some of the problems that I foresee as the lower courts attempt to follow the Supreme Court's new framework. In defining \"proximate cause\" as \"legal causation,\" (thus abandoning the alternative description of \"proximate cause\"-as encompassing both factual causation and legal causation together-that the Court recognized it had sometimes employed in earlier decisions), the Court noted that \"[proximate cause] 'involves examining the foreseeability of consequences, and whether a defendant should be held legally responsible for such consequences.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of the Court), quoting\n   <em>\n    Skinner v.

Further, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [P]roximate cause, that is, legal causation, ... requires a determination of whether it was foreseeable that the defendant's conduct could result in harm to the victim. A proper legal causation inquiry considers whether an actor should be held legally responsible for his or her conduct, which requires determining whether the actor's breach of a duty to the plaintiff was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.

Specifically, the Court seems to be saying that whether conduct is a \"proximate cause\" is to be determined by assessing whether the actor \"should be legally held responsible,\" but that one determines whether an actor should be held legally responsible by assessing whether his conduct was a \"proximate cause.\" This statement strikes me as the equivalent of the tautological equation \"If A, then B. If B, then A.\" Its meaning and the reasoning in support of it appear unclear. What is a lower court to do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I also see confusion arising from the Court's decision not to provide guidance for how to determine which of potentially multiple proximate causes is \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   proximate cause\" under the GTLA. The Court repeatedly reendorsed its earlier definition of \"the proximate cause\" as \" 'the one most\n   immediate, efficient, and direct cause' \" of the injury.

And a legal cause appears to be one from which it was foreseeable that injury could result, in which case it would be appropriate to hold the actor legally responsible for his or her conduct. But where there are multiple such legal causes, what is the basis of the comparison? Is it, for example, \"from which of the legal causes was it most foreseeable that injury would result?\" If so, how is a court to make such a determination? Is it simply a subjective assessment of which actor one feels should most be held legally responsible? And how does foreseeability, or relative foreseeability (if such can be determined), or a subjective assessment of the most responsible actor, translate into a test that supposedly inquires into whether a cause is \" 'the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause' \" of the injury?\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. at 59, 65, 76, 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251321\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/462/439/#p446\">\n    462 Mich. at 446, 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20N.W.2d%20307\">\n    613 N.W.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
