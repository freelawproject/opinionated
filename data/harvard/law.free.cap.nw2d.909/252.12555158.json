On order of the Court, the application is again considered. MCR 7.305(H)(1). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REVERSE the judgment of the Court of Appeals holding that trial counsel provided constitutionally effective representation, we VACATE the defendant's convictions and sentences, and we REMAND this case to the Van Buren Circuit Court for a new trial. To establish that trial counsel was ineffective, defendant must first establish that counsel's performance was deficient.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

This requires a showing that counsel's errors were so serious that they deprived defendant of a fair trial with a reliable result.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Here, defense counsel was provided in pretrial discovery a medical report prepared by a physician assistant who examined the complainant and who was listed on the prosecution's witness list. The report, while repeating the claims of the complainant, was generally favorable to the defense in that it did not document any tearing, bruising, bleeding, lacerations, DNA evidence, or evidence of any sexually transmitted disease found on the complainant. Defense counsel did not attempt to interview this critical witness before trial and did not reasonably prepare to cross-examine the trial testimony of the physician assistant by relying on the report to ask targeted questions to elicit the exculpatory evidence. Rather, defense counsel asked the witness during cross-examination the open-ended question whether there was \"no medical evidence\" to support the complainant's claim of assault. The witness responded that an adult speculum had easily been used to examine the\n   12-year-old complainant. Defense counsel testified at the\n   <em>\n    Ginther\n   </em>\n   hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he thought he had elicited evidence from the witness that she had not mentioned the speculum in her report. But review of the record finds no such impeachment. Further, instead of using the report to impeach the witness on the failure to document the adult speculum in the report, defense counsel aggravated this inadequacy when, in his own words, he \"tried to be the expert\" on female anatomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That was not a reasonable trial strategy. Here, \"[a]ny attorney acting reasonably\" would have elicited the favorable exculpatory evidence from the report and then, if necessary, used the report to impeach the witness by presenting to the jury her failure to mention the speculum in her report documenting the complainant's examination.\n   <em>\n    People v. Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186615\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/490/281/#p290\">\n    490 Mich. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20N.W.2d%20676\">\n    806 N.W.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). This is particularly true when, as here, attacking the witness's credibility \"offered the most promising defense strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 291,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20N.W.2d%20676\">\n    806 N.W.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Moreover, defense counsel's conduct was not only deficient, it also prejudiced defendant. This case was solely a credibility contest between defendant and the complainant, and the physician assistant's testimony that she used an adult speculum to examine the 12-year-old complainant was the only medical evidence admitted at trial. Because defense counsel not only allowed this testimony to stand unchecked but also highlighted the testimony, there exists a reasonable probability of a different result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    <em>\n     People v.
