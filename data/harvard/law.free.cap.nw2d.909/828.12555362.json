We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other action. MCR 7.305(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The appellant shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing: (1) whether a parent/defendant, either as a principal or as an aider and abettor, can be convicted of first-degree child abuse or second-degree murder when a child suffers serious physical harm or death as a result of the parent/defendant leaving the child in the care of the other parent with knowledge that the other parent previously injured the child and that serious physical harm or death would be caused by leaving the child with the other parent; and (2) if so, whether the evidence is sufficient in this case to establish the defendant's knowledge that serious physical harm or death would be caused by leaving the child with the other parent. In addition to the brief, the appellant shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1).
