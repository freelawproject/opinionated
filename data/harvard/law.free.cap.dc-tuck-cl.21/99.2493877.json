Really, we have nothing to determine this motion by except the statement of counsel and the motion which is filed. If the appellant does not prosecute his appeal, the opposite party may apply to the Orphans\u2019 Court to proceed to the settlement of the estate, if the appellant has not filed a supersedeas. It is for the appellee, if he wishes to proceed here, to file the proper papers'. There are proceedings that may be taken by the appellee when the appellant fails to prosecute his appeal probably; but we are without a record of what has been done in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and must <em>overrule the present motion.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
