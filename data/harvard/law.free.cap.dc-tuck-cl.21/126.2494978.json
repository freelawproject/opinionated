The bill alleges that he had suffered costs and damages in consequence of his becoming such surety, and states that the costs and damages consist of moneys paid out by him in defence of an action on the official bond upon which he was such surety, the greater part of the moneys so paid out being for counsel fees. To this bill of complaint the defendant interposed a demurrer. The Special Term sustained the demurrer, thus deciding that as a matter of law the bill did not set up a good cause of action. The complainant appealed from this decree, and the General Term reversed the decree of the Special Term, and thus having disposed of the question of law, remanded the case to the Special Term, which passed a decree in favor of the complainant. From this decree the defendant appealed, and the decree of the Special Term was reversed and the bill dismissed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Afh\">The complainant then filed a -petition for a rehearing, which was <em>denied.</em></disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Messrs. H. O, &amp; R. Claughton for petitioner,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-4\">Messrs. J. Ambler Smith and Cole &amp; Cole for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The opinion of the court, delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AlM\">Mr. Justice James,</author>\n<p id=\"A9S\">upon the petition for a rehearing was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">This is a motion for a rehearing in the case of McKenzie <em>vs. </em>Underwood. In the reported opinion, only one of three or four points involved in the case was really discussed or positively decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Other points, however, were involved in the determination of the case and were considered and decided. One of them was that the fund which the petition proposed to reach, as the property of Judge Underwood in the hands of his administratrix, never formed a part of his estate, but consisted of an appropriation for the benefit of his wife after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">It is immaterial whether we were right or wrong on the point discussed in the opinion. In any case that fund could not be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">It is suggested in the petition for rehearing that the case was hastily decided by the court. It was carefully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The decree which we reversed held the defendant, who was an administratrix, personally liable. Of course that was incorrect if the assumption of the decree that she held the property in question as administratrix of the estate of John Underwood was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\n<em>The rehearing, therefore, is denied, and the motion is overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
