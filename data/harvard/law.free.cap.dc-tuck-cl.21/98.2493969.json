That rule provides that where a verdict is rendered in the court in special term against an administrator, reference may be had to the Auditor for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of ascertaining the assets; and that the court shall render a judgment for the amount reported by the Auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The assumption of the plaintiff in this motion is that no appeal lies from the judgment rendered upon such report. We think that an appeal lies from \u00e1 judgment so rendered as from any other judgment rendered by the court in special term. The same law which provides for appeals frOm judgments recovered in the court in special term generally, affects this case and authorizes an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>The motion will therefore be overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
