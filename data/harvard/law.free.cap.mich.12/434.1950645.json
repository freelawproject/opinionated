The commissioners of highways, after due notice, met to consider the application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and decided that the road as applied for was1 only necessary as far as Fort street; and ordered it laid out and established to that street and no further. The relators,, who were owners of a lot north of Fort street which would be crossed by the contemplated road, appealed from this order to the township board, by whom the action of the commissioners was confirmed. The relators then sued out a certiorari to remove the proceedings to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-5\"><em>H. M. Gheever </em>and <em>L.

They should have laid out the whole of the road asked for or no part of it. We think the statute is clear on this point. It provides that, when any seven or m\u00bbre freeholders of a township shall wish to have a highway in any township, not included within the corporate limits of a city or village, laid out, altered or discontinued, they may, by writing under their hands, make application to the commissioners of highways of the township for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>purpose, who shall proceed to lay out, alter or discontinue <em>-such </em>highway, &amp;c. <em>Laws </em>1861, <em>p. </em>256, \u00a7 1. They are to view the premises described in said application, and ascertain and determine the necessity of laying out, altering or -discontinuing <em>such highway. Ibid. </em>\u00a7 3. Not such highway\u2014 the one described in the application \u2014 or any part thereof; or such highway as the commissioners may deem \u25a0expedient, unless it be the one asked for in the application. It does not follow that the freeholders would have united in an application for the part laid out because they had asked for that and something more. However *that may be, the commissioners had no application before them to do what they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The road laid out crosses the relators\u2019 land, and if they are not interested in what the commissioners did, it would be hard to say who are. .</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The commissioners erred in laying out a part only of the road applied for, and the township board erred in affirming their action. The proceedings of both are quashed, but without costs, as the. board acted judicially on an \u2022application giving jurisdiction to the commissioners.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\">Martin Ch.
