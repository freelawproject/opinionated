Reed, to foreclose a mortgage given by said Stanton on two parcels of land. The bill was taken as confessed by Stanton. Reed, who was made a party as a subsequent incumbrancer, answered, disclaiming as to one parcel, and claiming the other by a title paramount to the mortgage. The Court below made the usual decree, for the sale of' the parcel as to which Reed disclaimed, on the failure by Stanton to pay the amount due and costs by a day named.. Reed appealed, claiming that the Court below should have dismissed the bill as to him, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\"><em>G. V. N.

The mortgage was of two-pieces of land. Reed answered, claiming one of them by a title paramount to the mortgage, and a decree was tahe\u00f1as to the other in which he disclaimed having any interest. He was under the necessity of appearing and answering to protect his interest in the piece that was dropped. The Court, we think, should have dismissed the bill as to him, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The decree is affirmed as to Stanton, the mortgagor,, and reversed as to Reed, and the bill as to him dismissed,, with costs in both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-12\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
