Hess had never had any interest in the first mentioned description, and his defense was, that he did not claim his own land through the mortgagors or either of them, and that neither of them had ever had any interest in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The Court below dismissed the bill, not only as to Hess, but also as to the Eatons.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>Walker db Kent </em>for complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-8\"><em>W L.

It was given to \u201c O. P. Ramsdell \u201d and signed <em>\u201c </em>Alexander Eaton, Jr.,\u201d Defendant Hess was made a party as claiming as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>a subsequent incumbrancer or purchaser. He answered, and upon testimony taken it appeared that he was the owner of the east half of lot twelve in block eighteen, and that Alexander Eaton never owned or claimed that portion of the lot. The evidence showed that Eaton owned the easterly twenty feet of the west half, and the only ambiguity which rendered this inquiry material, was in making a starting point of a point sixty feet from the northeast, instead of the southeast corner, which would, if followed, have interfered with Hess\u2019s right, but which the case shows clearly to have been a clerical error. The Court below dismissed the bill without prejudice, as against all of the defendants, although it had been taken as confessed against all but Hess. This dismissal as to the others was based on a supposed \"variance between the names of the parties to the bill and the parties to the mortgage, .there being no allegation of identity. Complainant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">So far as Hess is concerned the bill was properly dismissed. There is no evidence tending to show that he was properly brought in as an incumbrancer or owner of the mortgaged premises, as identified by the proof. He is entitled, therefore, to an affirmance of the decree, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The bill having been taken as confessed as against the other defendants, and the identity of the parties being open to proof if questioned, it must be assumed that it is admitted by the pro-confesso that defendants executed to complainant the mortgage set forth in the bill. As between the parties this is sufficient, and it does not concern Hess if he is not retained as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The decree must be affirmed with costs as to Hess, and reversed as to the other defendants. A decree niust be entered in the usual form for a [foreclosure and sale, to satisfy the sum of $641.85, with interest at 10 per cent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>from April 26th, 1862, unless paid within ninety days, together with costs of the Circuit Court. As Eaton and wife have not defended in either Court, complainants are not entitled to costs on appeal against them.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-5\">Manning and Christiancy JJ. concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b120-6\">Martin Ch.
