Bacon, Circuit Judge, as the same appears to me from the files in my office.\u201d The paper was entitled in this cause, and was a narrative of the proceedings therein, to and including the rendition of judgment.. It was signed by the Circuit Judge, but it was no where stated in the paper itself to be a case made, nor was there any recital therein that the parties had appeared before the J udge for the purpose of settling a case, or that he had settled the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b9-7\"><em>G.

It might have been prepared for any other purpose; and this Court could not presume that it had been deliberately settled by the Judge, on a hearing of the parties, where nothing appeared in the paper to show that fact.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b10-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00bfr. <em>V. </em>N <em>Lothrop, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b10-5\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"A96\">held the ease to be- defective, because not showing that it was settled and signed by tbe Circuit Judge for review by this Court; hut allowed it to be remitted to the Court below for correction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
