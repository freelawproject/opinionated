A. Stacy, </em>for a mandamus, directed to the Circuit Judge of the first Circuit, to compel him to settle and sign a case. It appeared by the affidavits presented, that the case of the relator against Andrew J. Gaumer, was submitted to the Court upon the facts, and that the Judge, on September 23, 1863 (in vacation), delivered to the clerk his decision in writing, in favor of defendant. On the next day, the defendant\u2019s counsel verbally informed the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of the decision, which was the only notice he received from any source. On October 4th, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney signed a stipulation consenting to the taxation of defendant\u2019s costs. Within ten days from that date, plaintiff\u2019s attorney prepared a case, and served it upon the attorney for defendant j and -due notice was afterwards given for settling the same by -the Judge. On appearing before the Judge, the defendant\u2019s attorney objected to the settlement, because the case was not prepared and served within ten days after the oral notification of the decision. The Judge, being in doubt as \u25a0to the proper construction of the rules on the subject, .declined to sign the case, that the question might be settled by this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\"><em>Mr. Stacy </em>argued that under <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a73441, and rules 81 and 6 of the Circuit Courts, the ten days allowed the party to make a case for review in this Court did not commence running until he had been served with written notice of the entry of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-6\"><em>A. JO. Miller d, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au\">referred to <em>Richardson v. Yawkey, </em>9 <em>Mich. </em>139, as settling the rule, that a party who has acted upon knowledge of a judgment can not after-wards insist upon his right to a written notice. In this case, the plaintiff had stipulated for the taxation of the costs, and, in so doing, had of course acted upon the notice received September 24th, since that was the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u25a0notice given Mm. He ha\u00e1 thus waived his right to insist that the notice thus received was not sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-5\">Martin Ch. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Under the statute, the clerk must at least serve notice of the judgment on the successful party; and either that party or the clerk should serve written notice upon the other party, before the ten days' will commence running. He is not to be deprived of his rights without written notice from some one.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-7\">Manning J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWH\">I think the correct practice is for the \u00ablerk to notify the successful party of the decision, and. the latter should .then serve written notice upon the other party.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-8\">Campbelu J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">If defendant, by stipulating for the taxation of the costs on October 4th, waived Ms right to insist upon a written notice, the waiver could not relate back of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\n<em>Mandamus granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
