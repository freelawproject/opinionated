That the plaintiff had urged that this did not embody all the arrangements, and that it was understood that neither the paper nor the property was to be delivered until something else should be done, viz: the assumption of certain debts by Wright. That it was competent for plaintiff to show what the consideration was, but not to contradict the legal effect of the instrument. That as it was not pretended there was any fraud, that by some prior or cotemporaneous verbal understanding, the plaintiff was not authorized to show that the property was not to be delivered till the happening of some event, as this would be inconsistent with the legal effect of the transfer of the instrument in writing, which was delivered as the evidence.

It does not of itself purport to be a conveyance or contract, but is more in the nature of a mere acknowledgment of facts which had already occurred without its aid. It was therefore as much open to contradiction or explanation by verbal testimony, as if the same facts had been proved by verbal testimony:\u2014 <em>Tobey v. Barber, 5 Johns. </em>68; <em>Southwick v. Hayden, </em>7 <em>Cow. </em>334; <em>Blood v. Harrington, </em>8 <em>Pick. </em>552; <em>Dunn v. </em>Hewitt, 2 <em>Denio, </em>637; 1 <em>Phil. Ev. by Cowen, Hill and Edwards, p. </em>587, <em>note </em>171; <em>Ibid. vol. </em>2 <em>p. </em>672, <em>note </em>494.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In <em>Hazard v. Boring, </em>10 <em>Cush. </em>267, the bill of parcels was precisely the same, both in form and substance, as that in the present case. The plaintiffs offered verbal-evidence to prove that the transfer was a pledge and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>an absolute sale, and that the defendant at the time orally agreed to return the goods upon being paid the amount advanced and certain charges. The Court say, \u201cThe rule that parol evidence is not admissible to vary, explain or control a written contract, is not applicable to mere hills of parcels made in the usual form, in which nothing appears but the names of the vendor and vendee, the articles purchased, prices affixed, and a receipt for payment. These form an exception to the general rule of evidence, being informal documents intended only to specify prices, quantities and receipt of payment, and not designed or intended to set out the terms and conditions of a contract of bargain and sale. They are in the nature of receipts, and always open to evidence which proves the real terms upon which the agreement of sale was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In this view of the law, we entirely concur. We think, therefore, the Court should have permitted the jury to take into consideration all the evidence tending to show the real nature of the whole transaction. The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
