Russell made a note for $548.42, payable on the first of September following, to the order of C. I. &amp; E. C. Walker, at the Michigan Insurance Bank, Detroit, with eight per cent interest. This note was indorsed by the Walkers, to plaintiff, who resides in New York city. May 12, 1862, plaintiff, still holding the note, wrote to E. C. Walker a letter in regard to it, saying, among other things, \u201cAdd the interest, and give m\u00e9 a new note at 3, 4, 5 or 6 months.\u2019\u2019 May 24, 1862, E. C. Walker replied to this letter, enclosing $100 in money, and a new note for $463.23, the balance, dated May 1, 1862, given by Russell and indorsed by the Walkers, payable six months after date at plaintiff\u2019s office in New York; and requesting the return of the old note. The old note was not returned by plaintiff, nor the receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Walker\u2019s letter acknowledged; nor were the indorsers notified when the new note fell due and remained unpaid. November 12, 1862, plaintiff wrote the Walkers requesting payment of this second note, or a new note \u201cto keep it alive.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">The present suit was brought against the maker and indorsers, to recover the amount of the old note; the plaintiff retaining both that and the new note in his hands until the trial, when he tendered the latter to the defendants, who refused to receive it. Certain questions of evidence were raised on the trial, but they become unimportant in the view of the case taken by the Court. The Circuit Court charged the jury, that the reception of the new note by the plaintiff, enclosed in a letter from defendants, and asking for the return of the old note, made it the duty of the plaintiff, either to return the old note as asked, or to refuse to receive the new note; and that the keeping of the new note under the circumstances was an adojDtion of the contract as understood by defendants, and a discharge of their liability on the old note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">.The jury returned a verdict for defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-7\"><em>P.

In the present case the correspondence of the parties, which went to make up the contract, shows that the second note was given and received in discharge \u201cof the first. Walker sent forward that note to be retained Only upon condition of a surrender of the first. Sage was bound to return one or the other. By retaining both, he left it with the defendants to say that he had taken the Hew note upon the conditions Walker required, and the first note must be considered as surrendered up. This appears to have been Sage\u2019s view, when he had by carelessness omitted to have the second note presented and protested; for he asked for a third note in renewal of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">'The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
