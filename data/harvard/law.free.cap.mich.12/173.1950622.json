But in case of non-payment by party of first part of the said papers so to be indorsed by parties, of the second part, and of its payment by the latter, or of the interest thereof, or any part of said principal or \u25a0interest, at the time, in the manner and at the place above limited and specified for the payment thereof, then and in such case it shall and may be lawful for the said parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and the said party of the first part does hereby empower and authorize the said parties of the second part, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, to grant, bargain, sell, release and convey the said premises, with the appurtenances, at public auction or vendue, and on such sale to make and execute to the purchaser or purchasers, Ms or their heirs and assigns, forever, good, ample and sufficient deed or deeds of conveyance in law, pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided, rendering the surplus moneys (if any there should be) to the said party of the first part, his heirs, executors or administrators, after deducting the costs and charges of such vendue and sale aforesaid, and also fifty dollars, as an attorney fee, should any proceeding be taken to foreclose this indenture: and said party of the first part hereby covenants with said party of the second part so to indemnify them as is hereinbefore expressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">In May, June and July, 1860, Ladue executed five several notes, payable to the order of Marvin <em>&amp; </em>Stevens) which were indorsed by them for the accommodation of Ladue, and delivered to the complainants. These notes in the aggregate amounted to less than $10,000, and were all payable on short time. They not being paid at maturity, and the liability of Marvin <em>&amp; </em>Stevens as indorsers being fixed, the complainants filed this bill, setting forth these facts, and also that Marvin, Stevens and Ladue were all insolvent, and praying that the mortgaged premises might be decreed to be sold to satisfy the said notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">Ladue demurred to the bill, and the demurrer being overruled, he afterwards filed an answer, and the case was heard on pleadings and proofs, and decree entered for complainants as prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-7\"><em>Douglass Andrews </em>for complainants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">The mortgage is more than a mere indemnity against actual pecuniary loss. It is conditioned that the (mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>gagor \u201c <em>shall promptly pay and discharge all notes </em>\u201d which the mortgagees might indorse. The added expression, <em>\u201c so as to save the said parties of the second part harmless,\u201d </em>means nothing more nor less than the expression, \u201c <em>and thereby save said parties </em>harmless,\u201d would have done. The mortgagor was not only to save the indorsers harmless, but he was to do this by the <em>prompt </em>payment of his -notes at their maturity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">\u25a0 The mortgage is declared to be intended as a <em>security, </em>as well as an <em>indemnity; </em>and against any <em>liabilities </em>which the mortgagees might, assume; but. it is held that a covenant to indemnify against liability, is broken whenever the liability becomes fixed: \u2014 8 <em>Cow. </em>639, 653 ; 8 <em>Wend. </em>452 ; 19 <em>Wend. </em>423; 10 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>293; 1 <em>Burr. </em>574; 2 <em>Stark. </em>167; 9 <em>Penn. </em>371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">Referring to liabilities to be assumed by the indorsers, the mortgage provides: <em>\u201cfor which engagements this indenture of mortgage shall operate to the said parties of the second part as collateral security; </em>\u2019\u2019 \u2014 not as a mere means for obtaining reparation and compensation for possible future losses, but as a collateral security, to be employed in the most efBcient manner for the protection of the mortgagees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">So, the condition, though awkwardly and ungrammatically expressed, is evidently intended to provide that the mortgagor shall pay the indorsed notes \u201cat the time, in the manner, and at the place\u201d therein stipulated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">But dismissing these verbal criticisms, ir is perfectly evident, from the whole tone of the instrument, that the parties intended the mortgage to operate not as a pure indemnity against actual loss \u2014 to be made available only by a process of foreclosure, which could not occupy less than a year, and could only be commenced after the mortgagees had themselves advanced the money, or had been ruined by executions \u2014 but as a present and continuing security, to be used by the mortgagees, and made availa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ble as a protection to them. If the construction of the instrument be doubtful, courts will not be anxious to construe it- in a manner which would defeat the end which the parties to it must have had in view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-5\">But even if the construction claimed for the instrument by the defendant were the true one, the complainants are entitled to maintain this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">The indorsers, before themselves paying the debt, might have filed their bill against the principal debtor, to enforce specific performance of his covenant to indemnify them, and to have the mortgaged property applied for that purpose:\u2014 1 <em>Story Eq. Juris. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 327, 639; <em>Rice Ch. </em>286 ; 6 <em>Blackf. </em>491; 2 Head, 549; 36 <em>N. H. </em>217; 13 <em>Vt. </em>88; 4 <em>Jones Eq. </em>212; 2 <em>Rich Eq. </em>179; <em>Ibid. </em>22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">Whatever may be the rule at law, courts of equity consider and treat a security given by the debtor, to either the surety or the creditor, as held in trust for the other \u2014 not in virtue of any supposed agreement of the parties to that effect, but because substantial justice and equity requires it. It is a fund appropriated by the debtor for the payment of the debt, and regardless of, and even in opposition to, the expressed intentions of the parties, a court of equity will appropriate the fund directly to its ultimate destination, whenever, from the insolvency of the parties, or other cause whatever, it is manifest that substantial justice cannot otherwise be accomplished: \u2014 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>119; 3 <em>Ired. Eq. </em>520; 1 <em>S. &amp; M. Ch. </em>559; 11 <em>Conn. </em>118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-8\">If this mortgage cannot be foreclosed until the indorsers have paid the debt, then the complainants are remediless. That Marvin <em>&amp; </em>Stevens are insolvent, there is no doubt. Ladue has no property except that covered by this mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-9\">We could not levy an execution on the mortgaged <em>property: </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>L. </em>\u00a7 3158; 4 <em>B. Monr. </em>142 ; 11 <em>Conn. </em>121.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-10\">And the result of the defendant\u2019s doctrines |is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Ladue has, by this mortgage, effectually locked up this property where neither the complainants nor any other creditor can reach it. The indorsers are unable to pay the debt, and thereby entitle either themselves or the creditors to foreclose the mortgage. If we should obtain judgment and issue execution against the indorsers, they have no property subject to execution, and would sustain no more loss or damage than they have sustained already.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-6\"><em>A. Russell </em>for defendant Ladue:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">1. This is solely an indemnity mortgage, \u201c <em>to save harmless </em>\u2019\u2019 Marvin <em>&amp; </em>Stevens from loss, cost and damage, and to pay <em>so as to indemnify </em>said Marvin &amp; Stevens; and it could only be foreclosed on payment by. the mortgagees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">The reading of the mortgage shows the intention of the parties; that it was intended as collateral to the covenant to indemnify, and not as a trust for the payment of the debt, or for its better security. It was solely for the protection of Marvin &amp; Stevens, who had already become indorsers for Ladue, and who were expected to indorse for him in larger amounts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-9\">2. Complainants can only be <em>subrogated </em>to the rights possessed by the mortgagees: \u2014 <em>Adams\u2019 </em>Equity, 269 ; 14 <em>S. &amp; M. </em>87. The mortgagees being indemnified against \u201closs, cost and damages,\u201d it would be necessary for them to prove, in order to sustain an action against Ladue, that they have suffered actual pecuniary loss: \u2014 <em>Sedg. on Dams. </em>303 <em>et. seq., Cowp. </em>525; 8 <em>Johns. </em>249; 10 <em>Wend. </em>498; 3 <em>Denio, </em>321; 1 <em>Zab. </em>73; 1 <em>Comst. </em>550; 11 <em>Ill. </em>218; 9 <em>Barr, </em>366; 11 <em>Ala. </em>702; 7 <em>Blackf. </em>464; 1 <em>Chip. </em>164; 3 <em>Vt. </em>532; 3 <em>Wheat. </em>89; 7 <em>Ind. </em>213; <em>Thurston v. Prentiss, </em>1 <em>Mich. </em>193; <em>Mich. State Bank v. Hastings, </em>1 <em>Doug. Mich. </em>251, 256 ; <em>Griggs v. D. &amp; M. Railway Co., </em>10 <em>Mich. </em>117.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-10\">3. It is however claimed 'that, by some operation of law, and in spite of the parties to the mortgage, a trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>arises immediately on its execution, in favor of creditors not existing at the time, but coming into existence after-wards. The following cases decide the precise point at issue under this head, and are decisive of the case: \u2014 7 <em>Conn. </em>478; 18 Ohio, 35; 14 <em>S. &amp; M. </em>87; 10 Leigh, 206; 6 <em>Conn. </em>37; 9 <em>S. &amp; M. </em>450; 1 <em>Wash. Real Prop. </em>574; <em>Story Eq. Juris. </em>\u00a7 635; 1 <em>Lead. Cas. in Eq. </em>163, 164, <em>American note to Derring v. Winchelsea.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">But the bill in reality is a bill to reach the equitable assets of the principal debtor, and is in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill. To entitle a party to file a bill of this character, 'and obtain the relief sought by it, it is well settled that he must show that he has exhausted his legal remedies: \u2014 <em>Mitf. Eq. Pl. </em>128; <em>Story Eq. Juris. </em>\u00a7 1216. The proper evidence of this is the production of a judgment against the [principal debtor, and execution upon it returned <em>unsatisfied: </em>\u2014 Wal. <em>Ch. </em>1, 62, 28 ; <em>Barnes v. </em>Baker, 2 <em>Mich. </em>380.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">[Counsel also argued that it did not appear, from any thing in the ease, that complainants have not a full, adequate and complete remedy at law; that the proof showed Ladue to have had, at the time of filing the bill, property more than sufficient to satisfy complainants\u2019 demands, openly and notoriously in his possession and under his control.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-7\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The bill in this case was filed to foreclose a mortgage, which is claimed by defendant to be one of indemnity, upon which no relief could be asked until the parties should be damnified by paying the debts secured. Complainants, on the other hand, claim that the mortgage was conditioned not only to indemnify after damage, but to pay the debts; and that a right of action accrued at once on non-payment, as decided in <em>Hall v. Nash, </em>10 <em>Mich. </em>303.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">1 The mortgage, after an ordinary condition to indemnify and save harmless, proceeds: \u201cand if said party of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>first part shall promptly pay and discharge all notes or other papers of his upon which said parties of the second part \u2022shall or may become indorsers or acceptors, together with all interest, costs and charges accruing thereon, so as to \u25a0save said parties of the second part harmless by reason of their connection with such paper,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This is a clear and unequivocal condition to pay, and the condition was broken at once upon a failure to meet the paper at maturity. And upon this breach a right of foreclosure arose, without further action on the part of the mortgagees.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The power of sale appended to the mortgage is undoubtedly limited to the case of the mortgagees being damnified, by paying the debts which the mortgagor failed to' pay. But the power of sale, although usual, is no necessary part of the mortgage, and need not be co- extensive with its conditions. It cannot do away with any condition actually expressed, and could only be resorted to for explanation where there should be some ambiguity requiring such aid. This mortgage is not ambiguous; and- the remedy in equity is open for every breach of condition, whether the parties have seen fit to provide for it or not by the power of sale, which is a private remedy by contract, and may be narrowed by agreement to any extent desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Complainants, therefore, had a good cause of action, and the decree in their favor is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
