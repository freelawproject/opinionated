Petitioners, who are individual residents of Santa Clara, seek review in this court, claiming that: (1) the annexations were unlawful because Santa Clara was a \u201cproposed city,\u201d and territory in a \u201cproposed city\u201d cannot be annexed to another city; (2) four of the annexations were legislatively validated by a statute, ORS 199.534, that violates constitutional restrictions on the power of the legislature to amend a city charter; and (3) the Boundary Commission had no authority to approve annexations to Eugene because the legislature that granted the Commission its authority had no constitutional annexation authority available to delegate to the Boundary Commission. The Court of Appeals upheld the annexations. <em>Donaldson v. Lane County Local Govt. Bdry. Comm., </em>93 Or App 280, 286, 761 P2d 1349 (1988). We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On April 18, 1984, a prospective petition for the incorporation of the City of Santa Clara was filed with the Lane County Clerk. At the time of the filing, the petition complied with the statutory requirements for such a petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The record does not indicate that the petition was ever signed by a sufficient number of electors or filed with the county court as required by ORS 221.040.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, the owners of seven separate tracts of land sought to have their property annexed by Eugene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Generally, the property owners sought annexation to obtain access to sewers and, in the cases of the undeveloped properties, to permit their development.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">At each of the annexation hearings before the Boundary Commission, at least one petitioner appeared and testified about the April 14, 1984, filing of a prospective petition for incorporation, warning that the petition for the incorporation of Santa Clara included those lands whose annexation was under consideration at the hearing. The petitioners also testified that some signature collection activities had been undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The executive director of the commission testified that there was no petition for the incorporation of Santa Clara pending before the Boundary Commission. The Commission determined that \u201cSanta Clara\u201d presented no statutory obstacle to annexation, and approved the annexations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sought judicial review of these orders in the Court of Appeals pursuant to ORS 199.461(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">LEGISLATIVE POWER TO ANNEX</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In <em>Mid-County Future Alternatives v. City of Portland, </em>310 Or 152, 795 P2d 541 (1990), we determined that the legislature had the constitutional authority to validate annexations to municipalities whose charters permitted such annexations. We further determine that Oregon Laws 1987, Chapter 818, section 3,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was a valid exercise of this legislative power. As the Eugene charter permits boundary changes \u201cin accordance with state law,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the rule of <em>Mid-County </em>effectively disposes of the arguments concerning the parcels bearing agency numbers 863, 864, 865, and 871, because the final Boundary Commission orders for all four of those annexations were adopted within the time period covered by Oregon Laws 1987, Chapter 818, section 3. Thus, the validity and constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tionality of the underlying Boundary Commission orders in those four cases are no longer relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Our opinion in <em>Mid-County </em>also disposes of petitioner\u2019s contention that the legislature did not have the constitutional authority to create a boundary commission with the authority to conduct annexations. If the legislature has the authority to directly make available territory to be annexed to Eugene, but no constitutional provision limits that power to the legislature acting in its legislative capacity, the legislature has the authority to create a state agency such as the Boundary Commission to carry out that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">WHETHER SANTA CLARA IS A\u201cPROPOSED CITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The only issue that remains is petitioners\u2019 contention that these annexations did not comply with the mandatory statutory limitations concerning annexation of land from one city to another. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">ORS 199.462(2) (b) limits the authority of a Boundary Commission to authorize annexation of territory: \u201cTerritory within a city may not be included within or annexed to another city.\u201d Former ORS 199.415 provided a definition of city:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u201cAs used in ORS 199.415 to 199.519, unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\u201c(6) \u2018City\u2019 includes proposed city.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Petitioners argue that these annexations are invalid because they cover territory included within the \u201cproposed city\u201d of Santa Clara. According to petitioners a \u201cproposed city\u201d comes into existence immediately upon filing of a prospective petition for incorporation with the county clerk. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">The statute provides no deadline for the completion of the signature collecting process, once a prospective petition for organization of a city has been filed. Thus, if petitioners\u2019 position were correct, the filing of a prospective incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>petition would ban annexation for as long as the incorporation petition was in the signature-gathering process \u2014 perhaps forever. We see no need to adopt such an irrational interpretation of the statutes when the incorporation process contains a number of additional steps, each of which could be a logical point for a \u201cproposed city\u201d to come into existence. As the legislature has eliminated proposed cities from the statutory scheme, we need not determine exactly when that point is reached.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We need only hold that at the time these seven tracts of land were annexed by Eugene there was no proposed city of Santa Clara, but only a proposal to propose the city. Thus, these annexation were performed \u201cin accordance with state law\u201d and were valid under the charter of the City of Eugene.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The ultimate power to authorize the procedure to be used for the annexation of territory by a municipal corporation belongs to the legislature. The legislatively mandated procedures were properly followed and did not conflict with the charter of the City of Eugene in this case. These seven annexations are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The orders of the Lane County Local Government Boundary Commission are affirmed. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> At the time of the filing, ORS 221.031 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(1) Before circulating a petition to incorporate unincorporated territory as a city, the petitioners shall file with the county clerk of the county in which the proposed city lies or, should it lie in more than one county, to the county clerk of the county in which the largest part of its territory lies, a petition for incorporation in a form prescribed by rule of the Secretary of State.

Upon the filing of the petition, the county court shall fix the time and place for the hearing of such petition and shall give notice thereof by publication once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in the county were the petition is filed and of general circulation within the boundaries, and by posting the notice for the same period of time in three public places in the area proposed to be incorporated.
