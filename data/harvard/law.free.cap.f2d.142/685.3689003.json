The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>word \u201cJuniors\u201d was disclaimed \u201capart from the mark as shown in the drawing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">It is conceded that \u201cGloria Jean\u201d is the \u201cgiven\u201d, or Christian name of a young girl (surname Schoonover) who became a juvenile \u201cmovie\u201d picture actress employed by Universal Pictures Company, 'Inc., a concern engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of motion pictures, in which business it employs numerous actors and actresses, young and old.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">As hereinafter will more distinctly appear, the determination of the controversy turns upon the so-called name clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Registration Act, the particular language involved reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\"><em>\"Provided, </em>That no mark which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or , association not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner * * * shall be registered under the terms of this Act.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The contract (which is in writing) whereby Miss Schoonover was employed as an actress by Universal Pictures Company, Inc., was executed December 8, 1938, it apparently being in consummation of an \u201coption\u201d agreement executed on November S, 1938, when she was between ten and eleven years of age. The option agreement of November 5, 1938, as was the later contract of December 8, 1938, was signed by F. H. Schoonover and Eleanor Schoonover, father and mother of Gloria Jean, and by Gloria Jean 'herself. The latter\u2019s signature to the option agreement reads \u201cAgreed to: Gloria Jean Schoonover (Gloria Jean) known as Gloria Jean.\u201d The option agreement of November S, 1938, appears to have been executed in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where the family resided, and after its execution the mother and daughter went to California and the contract of December 8, 1938, was executed there. There was an extension of the \u201cscreen test\u201d feature of the contract which need not be recited here, since it has no bearing on the decision of the case. It may be said that the contract (with certain exceptions apparently not. requiring court approval) was approved by the. Superior Court of the State of California, under the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The mother testified that the daughter was \u201cknown theatrically as Gloria Jean at the time of the signing of this November 8th, 1938\u201d option, and elsewhere she stated, in substance, that the daughter had been appearing publicly in theatrical work \u201cSince she is [sic] three and a half years old.\u201d It was not testified, however, that such early theatrical work was of a professional character.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">It is clear from the record that the name \u201cGloria Jean\u201d by which she had been christened was adopted as her stage or screen name, the- surname, Schoonover, being dropped or discarded so far as professional use was concerned at the time the option agreement was executed, or very shortly thereafter. It also appears that she was publicized by that name as a prospective juvenile performer in different publications available to her employer for publicity purposes in the moving picture profession prior to any claimed use of the notation by appellant as a trade-mark and several months before the filing of appellant\u2019s application for registration, which was after she had appeared as a participant in making a picture and very shortly after the picture had been shown in the city of Chicago, Illinois, the situs of appellant\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">It is not deemed material to set forth in detail the terms of the contract of employment between appellee and Universal Pictures Company, Inc., but, in view of certain contentions made before us on behalf of appellant, it is proper to recite that in paragraph 4 of the contract it is provided :</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">\u201c(1) The artist * * * gives and grants to the producer solely and exclusively * * * the <em>perpetual </em>right to use the name of the artist and pictures or other reproductions of the artist\u2019s physical likeness * * * in connection with the advertising and exploitation thereof, as well as in connection with the advertising and/ or exploitation of any other services which may be required of the artist hereunder * * (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">\u201c(2) The artist does also hereby grant to the producer, <em>during the term hereof, </em>the sole and exclusive right to make use of, and to allow others to make use of his [her] name for advertising, commercial and/or publicity purposes (other than in connection with the acts, poses, plays and appearances of the artist hereunder), as well as the sole and exclusive right to make use of and distribute, and to allow others to make use of and distribute his [her] pictures, photographs or other re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>productions of his [her] physical likeness and of his [her] voice for like purposes. The artist shall at no time during said term grant the right to, authorize or willingly permit any person, firm or corporation other than the producer to make use of his [her] name or to make use of or distribute his [her] pictures, photographs or other reproductions of his [her] physical likeness of his [her] voice, and authorizes the producer, in the name of the artist or otherwise, to institute any proper legal proceedings to prevent such acts, or any of them.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">It appears that under the authority of the last quoted paragraph Universal Pictures Company, Inc., from time to time licensed various business concerns (fifteen in all) \u201cto use the likeness of Gloria Jean Schoonover and the name Gloria Jean\u201d in connection with the advertising and exploitation of a great variety of articles of manufacture, the licensees paying what are designated in the contract as \u201croyalties\u201d for such licenses, and it was testified by one of the witnesses connected with the company that a portion of such royalties were paid to the artist although it was and is conceded that the contract does not obligate such payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">It may be stated at this point that the petition for cancellation were filed in the Patent Office jointly by Universal Pictures Company, Inc., and the appellee here, but the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences held that the former could not qualify \u201cunder the name clause\u201d and, in effect, eliminated it from the case. The company did not appeal from that decision. So, the question of the rights of the company was not before the commissioner and, of course, is not before us for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Throughout its brief appellant refers to \u201cGloria Jean\u201d (putting the name between quotation marks) as \u201cthe fictitious, assumed, professional or stage name\u201d of appellee, and makes the contention that she cannot qualify under the name clause of section 5, because of the conveyance of the right to use of the name to her employer. The brief goes so far as to assert that \u25a0\u201cshe had by written contract conveyed and granted <em>\u2018perpetually\u2019 </em>to her employer * * * \u2018solely and exclusively\u2019 all rights \u25a0of use and ownership she may have had in that \u2018fictitious, assumed, professional or stage name\u2019 \u2018Gloria Jean\u2019.\u201d This contention is based upon the appearance of the word \u201cperpetual\u201d in the first part of paragraph 4 above quoted from the contract, and the fact that in the second quoted part (granting the employer the right to make use of and authorize others to make use of her name for advertising merchandise) the use is limited to the duration (the language is \u201cduring the term hereof\u201d) of the contract was overlooked or disregarded. The distinction and the purpose of it are obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Appellant also contends that appellee has not alleged or shown any facts from which it could be determined that she was damaged by appellant\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Assuming, without deciding, that if appellee had perpetually granted to the Universal Pictures Company the sole and exclusive right to use her professional name, \u201cGloria Jean,\u201d she could not be damaged by appellant\u2019s registration, the facts in this case conclusively show that such right was not granted. The right to use her name was granted only for the term of her contract, and upon its expiration the name could be used only by the company in connection with services performed by appellee while the contract was in existence. It follows that when appellee\u2019s petition for cancellation was filed she had the legal right to make contracts with others for the use of her name, \u201cGloria Jean,\u201d after the termination of her contract with the Universal Pictures Company. This was a valuable right, and she would be damaged in its exercise by the existence of appellant\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Appellant argues before us, in effect, that the appellee has no right to maintain an action for cancellation, and that only Universal Pictures Company, Inc., has that right. The position so taken, in our opinion, is untenable. As has been stated, the right of the latter to maintain such action is not before us, but we think there is no question of the right of appellee herself to maintain it. The fact that her surname, Schoonover, is not involved does not affect her right. Gloria Jean is as much a part of her name as is Schoonover. It was, of course, made distinctive as a widely publicized stage name but it remained an actual Christian name while it became also a stage or screen name.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">The gist of the commissioner\u2019s decision is embraced in the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">\u201cIt seems to me that prior to September 28, 1939 the name \u2018Gloria Jean\u2019 had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>been so well established as the screen name of petitioner that by that time petitioner had two names; one, her true or private name, Gloria Jean Schoonover, and the other her professional or screen name, Gloria Jean, and that each one was then the name of petitioner as an individual, and the mark \u2018Gloria Jean Juniors\u2019 of appellant\u2019s registration consists merely of the name of \u2018an individual\u2019. I consider the disclaimed word \u2018Juniors\u2019 of the mark of the registration to be immaterial, and it is apparent that the name is not distinctively displayed in the registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We fail to find error in the holding so made.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
