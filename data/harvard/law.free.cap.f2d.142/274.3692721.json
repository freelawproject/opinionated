The Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., hereinafter referred to as opposer, filed notice of opposition to the said registration, alleging its ownership and use of the two \u201cregistered trade-marks \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d and \u201cSea Chicken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-33\">The Examiner of Interferences held that since the goods were identical, the marks as a whole were so similar that there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>be likelihood of confusion, sustained the opposition, and adjudged that applicant was not entitled to the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Commissioner of Patents, upon appeal, affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, and from the commissioner\u2019s decision applicant has here appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Applicant concedes to opposer priority in the use of the marks and presents here the sole issue as to whether or not the tribunals below correctly found that the marks were so similar as to lead to confusion within the meaning of the trademark law. Much is said in both briefs on the subject of the descriptive character of the marks or portions thereof, it being urged by opposer that the marks must be considered as a whole under the well-settled rule, and that, the term \u201cof the Sea\u201d in one of opposer\u2019s marks and in the mark of applicant being identical, the public would be led to believe, upon seeing applicant\u2019s goods, that they originated with opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We are of the opinion that the tribunals below fell into error in holding that the marks, when viewed as a whole, were confusingly similar. It is true, as pointed out by the opposer, that it is settled law that in determining the question of likelihood of confusion the marks must be viewed as a whole. So far as we know, the law has never been otherwise\u2014certainly not since the Supreme Court in the case of Beckwith\u2019s Estate, Inc., v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 40 S.Ct. 414, 417, 64 L.Ed. 705, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cThe commercial impression of a trademark is derived from it as a whole, not from its elements separated and considered in detail. For this reason it should be considered in its entirety * *</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">This fact, however, is no justification for a refusal to consider the similarity of certain portions of the marks and separating them for the purpose of such consideration. Marks may contain descriptive or geographical terms which, by themselves, anyone has the right to use, and their extensive common use is sometimes persuasive of the conclusion that such similar descriptive or geographical portions of a mark would not be looked to as indicating the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The correct rule has been stated by this court many times. We must look to the mark as a whole, regardless of descriptive portions, and determine whether or not the use of the whole mark in the same field in which the mark of another is used would be likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">While the facts in the case of Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., Inc., 94 F.2d 230, 231, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 886, in which the marks \u201cStarlash\u201d and \u201cKurlash\u201d were involved, differed from those at bar, we there said:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">\u201cIt is familiar doctrine that, in determining the question of confusing similarity of marks, they must be considered as a whole, but it does not follow that portions of marks which are similar must be given equal weight with portions of marks which are dissimilar. <em>* * </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">\u201cWe believe that purchasers would pay little attention to the last syllable of the marks as bearing upon the origin of the goods, but, seeing the marks as a whole, the mind would fasten upon the syllable \u2018Kur\u2019 in appellee\u2019s mark and \u2018Star\u2019 in appellant\u2019s mark, and the last syllable in each mark would be given little attention other than with respect to its descriptive character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">In Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Pepsodent Co., 104 F.2d 205, 207, 26 C.C.P.A. Patents, 1272, where the marks \u201cPepso-Seltzer\u201d and \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d were involved, this court, in holding that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d was descriptive, pointed out that any other conclusion than that at which we arrived would \u201cresult in appellant having practically a monopoly of the word \u2018Seltzer\u2019 in a trade-mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">To the same effect was our holding in Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. United Drug Co., 112 F.2d 814, 817, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1273, where the marks \u201cRex-Seltzer\u201d and \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d were involved. We there said:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">\u201c * * * if the term \u2018Rex\u2019 in appellee\u2019s mark is sufficiently dissimilar from the term \u2018Alka\u2019 in appellant\u2019s mark so that when considered in their entireties, the marks of the parties are not confusingly similar, appellee is entitled to have its mark registered. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-21\">See also Yeasties Products, Inc., v. General Mills, Inc., 77 F.2d 523, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">The case of Hall v. Pennzoil Co., etc., 126 F.2d 506, 508, 29 C.C.P.A., Patents, 933, seems to be closely in point on the nice question here presented. In that case we had before us the marks \u201cPennpayz\u201d and \u201cPennzoil.\u201d We held that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>likelihood of confusion and called attention to the fact that there was \u201clittle resemblance either in meaning or sound except in the syllable \u2018Penn\u2019 * * We also said that \u201cthe syllables \u2018Payz\u2019 and \u2018Zoil\u2019 are so different in appearance and meaning that we think, as applied to oils and greases, purchasers would not likely be deceived in the origin of the goods * * * \u201d, and we pointed out the generally recognized purpose in applying the term \u201cPenn\u201d to lubricants. There, neither party was entitled to a monopoly of the term \u201cPenn\u201d; so here, neither party is entitled to a monopoly of the term \u201cof the Sea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In so concluding., we do not mean to characterize the term as an improper portion of a trade-mark. It is generally recognized that most canned fish comes from the sea. The public should be free to use the term \u201cof the Sea\u201d in handling sea food. In doing so, howrever, one is not privileged to adopt a mark containing the said term, which mark as a whole is so confusingly similar to a mark owned and previously used by another as to mislead the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Now, with these principles in view, and dissecting the marks only for -the purpose of determining the meanings, sounds, and appearances of the same in relation to the question of confusing similarity it seems clear to. us that the word \u201cGem\u201d and the word \u201cChicken\u201d are so utterly dissimilar in sound, meaning, and appearance as to insure against the likelihood of confusion when the two marks containing the term \u201cof the Sea\u201d are concurrently used. \u201cGem\u201d has a wholly different significance from \u201cChicken.\u201d \u201cChicken\u201d may suggest (we have held that \u201cChicken\u201d is not descriptive, Van Camp Sea Food Co. v. Alexander B. Stewart Organizations, 50 F.2d 976, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1415) that the fish upon which the mark is used is young and tender or excellent in taste. When we think of \u201cGem\u201d, we think of a jewel\u2014something of great price or rare beauty, or the term may suggest desirability. No one is likely to be confused in buying an \u201cof the Sea\u201d product by reason of any similarity when that term is associated with the dissimilar words \u201cGem\u201d and Chicken\u201d, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">While cases of this character, as we have often said, presenting as they do close questions with respect to whether or not there is a likelihood of confusion, are largely matters of opinion and not easy of decision by reference to other cases because of the differing factual situations, we think the following decisions support our conclusion here; Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Horwitz, 35 F.2d 784, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 641, (holding \u201cWashington Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Park\u201d not confusingly similar); Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Simon Levin &amp; Sons Co., 37 F.2d 962, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 847 (holding \u201cCollege Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Park\u201d not deceptively similar); Bourjois, Inc., v. Cheatham Chemical Co., 47 F.2d 812, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1089 (holding \u201cPolly Peachtree\u201d not deceptively similar to \u201cPeaches\u201d, \u201cPeach Blow\u201d, \u201cPeaches and Cream\u201d, or \u201cVelvet of Peaches\u201d); L. Otzen &amp; Co. v. J. K. Armsby Co., 49 App.D.C. 134, 261 F. 1014 (holding \u201cBlossom and Sunshine\u201d and \u201cFrom the Land of Sunshine\u201d not confusingly similar); and Plough Chemical Co. v. Bullion, 55 App.D.C. 294, 5 F.2d 117 (holding \u201cBlack and White\u201d not deceptively similar to \u201cRed and White\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Opposer relies in part upon the decision of this court in the case of Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., 115 F.2d 921, 922, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 807, in which we held the marks \u201cCrepeglo\u201d and \u201cCrepetex\u201d confusingly similar. We there said:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u201cIt is very clear to us that the words \u2018Crepeglo\u2019 and \u2018Crepetex\u2019 bear a marked resemblance to each other in sound, appearance and meaning. The first syllable of each is identical and the last syllable certainly suggests a characteristic of the goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The facts there were wholly different from the facts here, since there was a greater resemblance between the marks there than there is between the marks at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">Opposer has devoted considerable space in its brief in contending that its mark is not descriptive and has cited a number of cases in support of such contention. As before stated, we have held that \u201cChicken\u201d is not descriptive, and, since \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d is a registered mark, it comes to us with the presumption that it is a valid mark and therefore not descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Applicant has devoted some space in its brief to a charge of \u201cunclean hands\u201d on the part of opposer. In view of our conclusion, it is, unnecessary for us to consider this question. We could not do so anyway, because applicant has assigned no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>reason of appeal covering this subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
