More specifically, we consider statutory amendments (1) eliminating earned risk reduction credit from the calculation of a violent offender's parole eligibility date, when such credit was not available at the time the offense was committed; Public Acts 2013, No. 13-3, \u00a7 59 (P.A. 13-3); and (2) altering parole eligibility hearing procedures to allow the Board of Pardons and Paroles to forgo holding a hearing. Public Acts 2013, No. 13-247, \u00a7 376 (P.A. 13-247). The petitioner, Dominic Perez, appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition claiming that application of these 2013 amendments to him violated his state and federal due process and liberty rights, the ex post facto clause of the United States constitution, the separation of powers\n   doctrine, and the equal protection clause of the United States constitution, and is contrary to the language of \u00a7 54-125a. The petitioner contends that the habeas court improperly dismissed his claims on the ground that it would be speculative whether the statutory changes would cause any injury to the petitioner because the award of risk reduction credit by the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, is discretionary. We agree with the petitioner to the extent that the habeas court improperly dismissed many of the claims raised in the petition solely on the basis of the \"speculative nature\" of earned risk reduction credit. Nevertheless, applying the proper test to each claim raised by the petitioner, we hold that the habeas court lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner's claims. We therefore affirm the judgment of the habeas court dismissing the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following procedural and statutory history is relevant to this appeal. The petitioner committed the offenses giving rise to his incarceration, which involved his use of deadly force, in November, 2010. At that time, the relevant parole eligibility provision of \u00a7 54-125a provided in relevant part: \"A person convicted of ... an offense, other than [certain parole ineligible offenses] where the underlying facts and circumstances of the offense involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person shall be ineligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served not less than eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed.\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as amended by Public Acts 2010, No. 10-36, \u00a7 30. At that time, the relevant parole hearing provision of \u00a7 54-125a provided that the board \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   hold a hearing to determine the suitability for parole release of any person whose eligibility for parole release is subject to the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section upon\n   completion by such person of eighty-five percent of such person's definite or aggregate sentence....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-125a (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2011, while the petitioner's criminal case was pending before the trial\n   court, General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   became effective, pursuant to which the respondent had discretion to award risk reduction credit\n   toward a reduction of an inmate's sentence, up to five days per month, for positive conduct. General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e(a) and (b). The respondent also was vested with discretion to revoke such credit, even credit yet to be earned, for good cause. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e(b). At the same time, the legislature amended the parole eligibility provision to provide: \"A person convicted of ... an offense ... where the underlying facts and circumstances of the offense involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person shall be ineligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served not less than eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed\n   <em>\n    less any risk reduction credit earned under the provisions of section 18-98e\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as amended by Public Acts 2011, No. 11-51, \u00a7 25 (P.A. 11-51). The subsection of \u00a7 54-125a addressing parole hearings was similarly amended to account for earned risk reduction credit. General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-125 (e), as amended by P.A. 11-51, \u00a7 25. Accordingly, under the 2011 amendments, earned risk reduction credit was to be applied to an inmate's definite sentence to advance the inmate's end of sentence date, and the parole eligibility date calculated as a percentage of the sentence would advance in similar measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May, 2013, the petitioner was sentenced to a total effective sentence of fifteen years incarceration after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a, and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 29-35(a), for the 2010 offense. Under the 2011 amendments to \u00a7 54-125a and \u00a7 18-98e, any risk reduction credit earned by an inmate, and not subsequently revoked, would have both reduced his sentence and rendered him eligible for a\n   hearing to determine whether he should be granted parole after he had served 85 percent of that reduced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Effective July 1, 2013, the legislature again amended \u00a7 54-125a. Specifically, with regard to offenses like one of those of which the petitioner was convicted, the legislature eliminated the language that permitted the parole eligibility date to be advanced by the application of any earned risk reduction credit. See P.A. 13-3. The legislature also eliminated the requirement that the board \"shall\" hold a parole hearing after such inmates had completed 85 percent of their definite or aggregate sentences. See P.A. 13-247. Instead, under the revised statute, the board \"may\" hold such a hearing, but \"[i]f a hearing is not held, the board shall document the specific reasons for not holding a hearing and provide such reasons to such person....\" General Statutes (Supp. 2014) \u00a7 54-125a(e). Thus, under the 2013 amendments, any risk reduction credit earned by an inmate, and not subsequently revoked, would still be applied to reduce his sentence, but would not be applied to advance his parole eligibility date. In other words, he would only be eligible for a hearing to determine whether he should be granted parole after he had served 85 percent of his\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   sentence (in the petitioner's case, after twelve years and nine months). Moreover, the board may decline to hold a hearing once that eligibility date arises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The petitioner thereafter filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the application of the 2013 amendments to the calculation of his parole eligibility date and to his right to a hearing on his suitability for parole. In the operative thirteen count petition, the petitioner alleged that he already had been awarded risk reduction credit by the respondent and that prior to July 1, 2013, the respondent had applied that credit to advance the petitioner's parole eligibility date. The\n   petitioner challenged the application of these amendments to him by the respondent\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a violation of his constitutional rights under the federal and/or state constitution-specifically, claims related to due process, liberty interests, the ex post facto clause, the separation of powers doctrine and the equal protection clause-and as contrary to the statutory text. Subsequently, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss all counts of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a hearing, the habeas court granted the respondent's motion to dismiss the petition. The habeas court's decision did not analyze each claim separately. Rather, it concluded that all of the petitioner's claims failed on the same basis, namely, that \"[g]iven the speculative nature of [earned risk reduction credit], and the [respondent's] discretion to both award and take [it] away as an administrative tool to manage the inmate population, [the habeas] court ... lacks subject matter jurisdiction\n   over the ... petition and ... [the petition] fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner asserts that the habeas court improperly dismissed all of his claims based on lack of justiciability, a conclusion that he contends the habeas court would not have reached had it properly analyzed each claim separately under the appropriate respective jurisdictional test. The petitioner argues that the habeas court improperly interpreted his claims as dependent\n   on the future award of risk reduction credit to the petitioner, and, therefore, too speculative a basis for habeas relief. He contends that the claims challenging the hearing provision are not dependent on whether earned risk reduction credit is applied to determine his parole eligibility date. He further asserts that the claims challenging the parole eligibility provision are not dependent on any future award of risk reduction credit because he already had been awarded credit, which the respondent used to calculate his new parole eligibility date prior to July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The respondent asserts that the habeas court properly dismissed all of the petitioner's claims, even though it did not address each claim separately in its analysis, because the claims were so clearly without a legal or factual basis that no analysis was required. The respondent further asserts that even if the reason stated by the habeas court for dismissing the entire petition was improper, the court nevertheless lacked jurisdiction over each claim, and this court may affirm the habeas court's granting of the respondent's motion to dismiss on alternative grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that, under a proper analysis of the individual claims, the habeas court properly dismissed the petition in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 provides: \"The judicial authority may, at any time, upon its own motion or upon motion of the respondent, dismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that: (1) the court lacks jurisdiction; (2) the petition, or a count thereof, fails\n   to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted; (3) the petition presents the same ground as a prior petition previously denied and fails to state new facts or to proffer new evidence not reasonably available at the time of the prior petition; (4) the claims asserted in the petition are moot or premature; (5) any other legally sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition exists.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[I]n order to invoke successfully the jurisdiction of the habeas court, a petitioner must allege an interest sufficient to give rise to habeas relief.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950256\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/241/#p251\">\n    281 Conn. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). \"We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ajadi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730509\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/514/#p532\">\n    280 Conn. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%20712\">\n    911 A.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Likewise, \"[w]hether a habeas court properly dismissed a petition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29(2), on the ground that it\n   'fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted,' presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaddah\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489010\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/1233/#p559\">\n    324 Conn. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489010\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/1233/#p559\">\n    153 A.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As reflected in the analysis that follows, we conclude that the habeas court improperly based its dismissal of all of the petitioner's claims, challenging the effect of the 2013 amendments, solely on the basis of the \"speculative nature\" of the future award of risk reduction credit. Insofar as the habeas court intended \"speculative nature\" to encompass both the discretionary nature of the risk reduction credit scheme and the prematurity of any claim based on the future award of such credit, we agree that those aspects of earned risk reduction credit are relevant to some of the petitioner's claims challenging the parole eligibility provision. The petitioner has raised a variety of claims challenging the\n   parole eligibility and hearing provisions, however, not all of which implicate the discretionary or prospective nature of earned risk reduction credit. See\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950256\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/241/#p251\">\n    281 Conn. at 260-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (comparing jurisdictional requirements for ex post facto claim with due process claim). Nonetheless, if the habeas court reached the correct decision, but on mistaken grounds, this court will sustain the habeas court's action if proper grounds exist to support it.\n   <em>\n    Perez-Dickson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20483\">\n    304 Conn. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%2069\">\n    43 A.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). Therefore, we conduct a plenary review to determine if the habeas court lacked jurisdiction over each claim raised in the petition, and we analyze the petitioner's claims together only insofar as they turn on the same legal framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The petitioner points to the fact that, prior to the effective date of the 2013 amendments, he had already earned risk reduction credit. In reliance solely on that \"earned\" credit, the petitioner claims that the 2013 amendment eliminating the application of that credit to advance his parole eligibility date\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates his right to due process under the federal and state constitutions and his right to personal liberty pursuant to article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut\n   constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See P.A. 13-3. The\n   petitioner similarly claims that the 2013 amendment eliminating the parole hearing mandate violates his right to due process under the federal and state constitutions and his right to personal liberty pursuant to article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution. See P.A. 13-247. We disagree with these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An essential predicate to all of these claims is a cognizable liberty interest. When a petitioner seeks habeas relief on the basis of a purported liberty interest in parole eligibility, he is invoking \"a liberty interest protected by the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause of the [f]ourteenth amendment which may not be terminated absent appropriate due process safeguards.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950256\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/241/#p251\">\n    281 Conn. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In order ... to qualify as a constitutionally protected liberty, [however] the interest must be one that is\n   <em>\n    assured\n   </em>\n   either by statute, judicial decree, or regulation.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)

It follows that if an inmate has no vested liberty interest in the\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   of parole, then the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of when the board could, in its discretion, grant parole does not rise to the level of a vested liberty interest either. The lack\n   of a vested interest giving rise to a due process claim is further compounded by\n   the fact that under the provisions effective in 2011; P.A. 11-51; the award of risk reduction credit itself is at the discretion of the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to the risk reduction credit previously granted to the petitioner, he overlooks the fact that such credit is not vested in him because it could be rescinded by the respondent at any time in the respondent's discretion for good cause during the petitioner's period of incarceration. The petitioner, in his brief, disputes that the award or revocation of risk reduction credit is wholly discretionary, but does not provide any analysis to support this assertion, instead claiming that the scope of the respondent's discretion is not necessary to resolve this motion to dismiss and would be addressed in a trial on the merits. The petitioner's position, however, is manifestly contradicted by the plain language of \u00a7 18-98e(a), which provides that an inmate may be eligible to earn risk reduction credit \"at the discretion of the [respondent] for conduct as provided in subsection (b) of this section,\" and \u00a7 18-98e(b)(2), which provides that \"the [respondent] ... may, in his or her discretion, cause the loss of all or a portion of such earned risk reduction credit for any act of misconduct or insubordination or refusal to conform to recommended programs or activities or institutional rules occurring at any time during the service of the sentence or for other good cause.\" Although the legislature has provided guidance to the respondent as to how to exercise his discretion, the respondent still has broad discretion to award or revoke risk reduction credit. As such, the statute does not support an expectation that an inmate will automatically earn risk reduction credit or will necessarily retain such credit once it has been awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The petitioner further relies on the monthly calculation of his parole eligibility date that he purportedly receives from the respondent, which included his earned risk reduction credit prior to July 1, 2013, as evidence that he has a vested interest in continuing to have that earned risk reduction credit reflected in his parole eligibility date. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e(a) (inmate is \"eligible to earn risk reduction credit toward a reduction of such person's sentence, in an amount not to exceed five days per month\"). The petitioner misapprehends the significance of the respondent's monthly parole eligibility date calculation. Under the scheme even prior to 2013, because the respondent could have rescinded any or all of that earned credit in his discretion, the monthly parole eligibility date is nothing more than an estimate of the inmate's parole eligibility date. As such, the monthly parole eligibility date calculation is simply an informational tool to allow the respondent and an inmate to know at any given time how close to parole eligibility the inmate would be if nothing changed.

Although the board is no longer required to provide an initial hearing, it must document its reasons if it declines to do so. Because the parole hearing provision does not alter the calculation of when an inmate is eligible for parole, and because the board must still consider the inmate's parole suitability at that time, the elimination of a mandatory hearing in the\n   2013 parole hearing provision does not increase the punishment imposed for the petitioner's offense.

As noted in part I of this opinion, when the petitioner committed his offense in 2010, a violent offender for whom parole was available would become eligible for parole after he had served 85 percent of his definite sentence. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-125a(e). Although a short-lived 2011 amendment altered this calculation to include earned risk reduction credit; P.A. 11-51, \u00a7 25; the challenged 2013 amendment restored the parole eligibility calculation to 85 percent of the violent offender's definite sentence. Far from creating a genuine risk that the petitioner would be incarcerated for a longer period of time, the 2013 parole eligibility provision simply returned the petitioner to the position that he was in at the time of his offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The petitioner contends, however, that, in conducting the ex post facto inquiry, this court is not limited to\n   comparing the challenged statute with the statute in effect at the time the offense was committed.

Specifically, the petition alleges that the board has an established policy of not awarding parole to any inmate whose parole eligibility date is within six months of the date on which the inmate will have completed serving his definite sentence. He further alleges that if he continues to earn \"all possible\" risk reduction credit-five days per month, every month-his sentence will be reduced to within six months of his parole eligibility date under the 2013 parole eligibility provision-85 percent of his original sentence. As such, he contends that the board will not consider him for parole, even though the legislature\n   has deemed his offense parole eligible, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Putting aside the significant problem that the petitioner has failed to allege that the determination of parole eligibility is a power solely vested in the legislature and may not be delegated to the executive branch, an essential element of a viable separation of powers claim; see generally\n   <em>\n    Massameno\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Statewide Grievance Committee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770636\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/234/539/#p552\">\n    234 Conn. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%20317\">\n    663 A.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ; he ignores the fact that the circumstance that he claims purportedly would give rise to such a constitutional defect is extraordinarily speculative. He not only would have to earn the maximum possible credit, but would also have to have had none of the credit revoked, both acts wholly left to the respondent's discretion. Even if such a circumstance could arise, any claim based on such facts would be premature. Further, the petitioner has ignored the fact that a 2015 amendment to \u00a7 18-98e(a), which he has not challenged in his petition, rendered him ineligible to earn any risk reduction credit as of October 1, 2015. See Public Acts 2015, No. 15-216, \u00a7 9. Accordingly, for a host of reasons, the habeas court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n   over this claim.

Put differently, he contends that there is disparate treatment because the board does not eliminate the inclusion of earned risk reduction credit from the parole eligibility calculation for the first class and in turn revoke their grant of parole calculated on the basis of that credit. Second, he contends that \u00a7 18-98e facially violates equal protection because it does not permit offenders to earn risk reduction credit while held in presentence confinement, as was the petitioner. As a result, offenders like the petitioner who cannot afford bail do not earn risk reduction credit for the entire period of their confinement,\n   whereas offenders who can afford bail are able to benefit from the award of risk reduction credit during their entire sentence.

Therefore, it follows that application of earned risk reduction credit to advance an inmate's parole eligibility date does not impinge on a fundamental right. As inmates are not a suspect class;\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605056\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/808/#p831\">\n    271 Conn. at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=860%20A.2d%20715\">\n    860 A.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; it follows that subsets of inmates differentiated only by the timing of when they were considered for parole are also not a suspect class. The petitioner has not alleged any other basis for considering as a suspect class those inmates who were awarded risk reduction credit prior to July 1, 2013, but had not yet been granted parole. In the absence of a fundamental right or suspect class, the application of earned risk reduction credit to parole eligibility based on whether an inmate had already been granted parole prior to July 1, 2013, does not violate equal protection if there is a rational basis for such differentiation. The determination by the board that it would not revoke a grant of parole that had already been awarded supports clarity in the administration of parole and also an understanding that revocation of parole due to no action on the part of the offender could have a negative impact on the offender's rehabilitation and reintroduction into society. Therefore, the\n   petitioner has failed to state a claim for which habeas relief may\n   be granted with regard to the parole eligibility provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to the petitioner's claim of disparate treatment under \u00a7 18-98e, even if we assume that indigent individuals who cannot afford bail and are held in presentence confinement prior to sentencing and nonindigent individuals who are not held in presentence confinement prior to sentencing are similarly situated, the petitioner's claim is without merit. As previously noted, an inmate has no fundamental right in the opportunity to earn risk reduction credit because such credit is a creature of statute and not constitutionally required. The petitioner has not alleged that the earned risk reduction credit statute has caused him, or other indigent individuals, to be imprisoned beyond the maximum period authorized by statute. Therefore, the class' status as indigent individuals does not constitute a suspect class. In the absence of a fundamental right or a suspect class, the exclusion of indigent individuals held in presentence confinement from the earned risk reduction credit scheme does not violate equal protection if there is a rational basis for such treatment. In\n   <em>\n    McGinnis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Royster\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957172\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/263/#p270\">\n    410 U.S. at 264-65, 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957172\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/263/#p270\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the United States Supreme Court rejected an equal protection challenge to a substantially similar New York good time credit statute that did not permit the award of credit during presentence confinement.

On the basis of the petitioner's brief to this court, we understand his claim to be that a proper interpretation of the 2013 parole eligibility and parole hearing provisions would limit application of those provisions prospectively to inmates who were committed to the respondent's custody to begin serving their sentences on or after July 1, 2013, the effective date of those provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining whether the habeas court had jurisdiction over the petitioner's claim, however, we are limited to the allegations in the petition.

It is impossible to know at this time whether the board will decline to conduct a hearing upon the petitioner's parole eligibility date.

See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e(b) (authorizing respondent to revoke credit, and if earned credit is insufficient, to deduct from future earned credit).

Reading the petitioner's brief fairly, we have determined that he has adequately asserted that the habeas court dismissed those claims for an improper reason and explained why the reason was improper. We conclude that the petitioner's brief is minimally sufficient for us to address whether the habeas court lacked jurisdiction as to those counts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The petitioner is not claiming that he has been deprived of his earned risk reduction credit, but merely that the credit he has earned is no longer being applied to advance his parole eligibility date. Therefore, we need not decide whether a deprivation of his actual earned risk reduction credit would violate due process.

We construe this allegation as a typographical error and note that the right to personal liberty is found in article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution. The petition does not allege, and the petitioner's briefs to this court do not contend, that the petitioner's right to personal liberty under the state constitution entitles him to any greater protection than he is due under the due process clause of the federal constitution. For purposes of this appeal, therefore, we treat those provisions as embodying the same level of protection.

Because we conclude that the parole hearing provision does not create a genuine risk that the petitioner will be incarcerated for a longer period of time than that under the provision in place at the time of his offense, we decline to reach the issue of whether the purported practice of the board prior to 2013 is an appropriate consideration in determining whether the petitioner has raised a valid ex post facto claim in the context of a motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We understand the petitioner's argument before this court at oral argument to include the assertion that, if he were to earn near the maximum amount of risk reduction credit authorized by \u00a7 18-98e(a) -five days per month, every month-the 2013 parole eligibility provision would not place him in the same position that he would have been in pursuant to the parole eligibility provision in effect at the time of his offense because, under those circumstances, he would be denied any possibility of parole. Although we explore and explain this speculative factual scenario in connection with the petitioner's separation of powers claim in part II C of this opinion, we note that the petitioner did not raise this argument in the ex post facto section of his petition or his brief to this court. Therefore, we decline to reach the issue of whether the court would have jurisdiction over his ex post facto claim based on such circumstances.
