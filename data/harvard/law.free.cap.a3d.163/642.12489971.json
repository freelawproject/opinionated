The defendant claims that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence the victim's recorded forensic interview as a prior consistent statement, and (2) the prosecutor committed an impropriety when he used a puzzle analogy in his rebuttal closing argument. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following evidence was presented at trial. The defendant lived with the twelve-year-old victim, N.A., and the victim's mother, T.M., in an apartment on the second floor of a three story house. N.A. had an older sister, K.D., who did not live with them, and a brother who lived on the first floor with their grandmother. The defendant slept on the couch while N.A. and T.M. each had a bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately one or two weeks before August 5, 2008, between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., N.A. was playing cards in the kitchen with the defendant. After they finished their game, N.A. went into her bedroom to watch television. Shortly thereafter, the defendant went into N.A.'s bedroom and sat at the foot of the bed next to her. He then got on top of her and kissed her lips and breasts and rubbed his fingers between her pants and underwear. He grabbed her arm, took her off the bed, and told her to bend over with her hands on\n   the bed. He took off her shorts and underwear and \"tried to put his penis in [her] butt.\" After he tried to anally penetrate N.A., he pushed her to her knees and \"put [her] hand on his penis and he tried to put his penis in [her] mouth.\" He then grabbed her arms, put her back on the bed, and put his penis in her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A day or two later, N.A. asked K.D. to visit her. When K.D. arrived, N.A. told her about the defendant's assault,\n   and K.D. relayed this information to T.M. As soon as K.D. told T.M. about the assault, the defendant left the apartment. No one called the police at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   John Maloney, a clinical coordinator at a therapeutic treatment center, was the family's therapist, and he often counseled N.A., her siblings, and T.M. together and individually. On September 24, 2008, N.A. told Maloney that a relative had assaulted her. Maloney called T.M. and reported the disclosure to the Department of Children and Families. After receiving this information from Maloney, T.M. contacted the police and took N.A. to a gynecologist to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases and to undergo a physical examination. On October 7, 2008, N.A. participated in a video recorded forensic interview (interview) with Donna Vitalauno, a social worker. The defendant was arrested in September, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant was charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). During the trial, the state filed an amended information charging the defendant, in addition to the charge of sexual assault in the first degree, with attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree. The court granted the state's request to amend the information pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    March\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1016747\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/39/267/\">\n    39 Conn.App. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20A.2d%201157\">\n    664 A.2d 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"389292,389381,389311\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/235/930/\">\n    235 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20A.2d%20801\">\n    667 A.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over the defendant's objection, the court admitted into evidence as a prior consistent statement the video of the interview for the limited purpose of assisting the jury in evaluating N.A.'s credibility. In addition, during his closing argument, the prosecutor explained to the jury the concept of \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" by using a puzzle analogy. Defense counsel objected, but the court ruled that the prosecutor's use of the analogy was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury found the defendant not guilty of sexual assault in the first degree but guilty of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of sixteen years imprisonment followed by twenty years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion when it admitted the interview into evidence as a prior consistent statement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On direct examination, N.A. testified that the defendant \"tried to put his penis in [her] butt.\" She testified that she was wearing a black tank top the night of the assault. She also testified that before the assault, the defendant asked her if she was a virgin, and she replied yes. She testified that she did not remember exactly which day of the week the assault happened, but she did remember that it happened on a weekend and that she told K.D. about the assault one or two days after it had happened. She said that on the day that she spoke with K.D., N.A. did not tell T.M. about the assault, but K.D. told T.M. on the same day. N.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   identified a DVD as the video of the interview, but the state did not introduce the video or the transcript of the interview into evidence during its direct examination of N.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's cross-examination of N.A. began with a series of questions relating to discussions she had with T.M. and the prosecutor. Specifically, defense counsel asked N.A. whether she had spoken with them prior to trial about her testimony or about the case. He elicited testimony that N.A. spoke with T.M. and the prosecutor a few days before the trial started, even\n   though she denied discussing her testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the course of two days, using the transcript of the interview, the defendant sought to impeach N.A.'s credibility by highlighting apparent inconsistencies between her trial testimony and the statements she had made to Vitalauno during the interview. The defendant attempted to show that the following statements were inconsistent: on which day the assault occurred, what she was wearing the night of the assault, whether she told the defendant that she was a virgin, whether the defendant performed\n   anal intercourse, the number of times the defendant performed anal intercourse, whether she told K.D.'s boyfriend about the assault, and whether she told T.M. about the assault on the same day she told K.D. about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the end of the defendant's cross-examination of N.A., outside the presence of the jury, the state requested that the court admit the video of the interview into evidence as a prior consistent statement. It argued that the interview was admissible because the defendant's questions suggested to the jury that N.A.'s testimony was influenced by the prosecutor and T.M. It also argued that because the defendant questioned N.A. about apparent inconsistencies between her trial testimony and statements she made during the interview, the entire interview was admissible in order to assist the jury in assessing whether her statements were inconsistent. The defendant argued that the interview was hearsay and did not qualify as a prior consistent statement because the defendant attempted to impeach N.A. only on\n   the portions of the interview that were actually inconsistent with her trial testimony. He argued that the state was trying to put the interview in evidence to bolster N.A.'s testimony. The court stated that it would rule on the state's request after it had reviewed the transcript and the video of N.A.'s interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After a recess, the court ruled that the interview was hearsay, but it was, nevertheless, admissible because it was being admitted solely \"to assist the jury in allowing them to evaluate [N.A.'s] testimony ... in court and her credibility.\" It reasoned that the defendant's cross-examination of N.A. left \"the jury with the impression that she had given prior inconsistent statements\" about, inter alia, \"what she told the interviewer in terms of who told her mother, what she told her mother, who told her sister's boyfriend, the clothing she was wearing and other questions challenging her credibility ....\" The court noted that it was particularly concerned that\n   the defendant's cross-examination left the jury with the impression \"that during [the] interview she claimed that the defendant engaged in anal intercourse with her on more than one occasion during this incident and\n   <em>\n    that is wrong.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) In addition, the court stated that the defendant challenged N.A.'s credibility when he \"tried to raise the notion that she met with [the prosecutor] several times, that she met with him with her mother present and that somehow perhaps her story ha[d] changed or been coached.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the video was played for the jury, the court instructed the jury that the interview was not being admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted but that it was only \"being admitted to allow [the jury] to evaluate her testimony ... in court and whether it was consistent or inconsistent with what she said previously during that interview.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the interview, N.A. said that \"[h]e stuck his thing in [her butt]\" when asked what the defendant did to her body. Later in the interview, she indicated again that the defendant anally penetrated her by pointing to an anatomical picture provided by Vitalauno. She told Vitalauno that she was wearing a red and white shirt the night of the assault and that when the defendant took her clothes off, she told him to stop. When asked when she was assaulted, N.A. stated that she thought that \"it was [a] Saturday\" because she \"looked at the calendar.\" She also stated that she told both T.M. and K.D.'s boyfriend about the assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting the video of the interview\n   into evidence because the interview did not qualify as a prior consistent statement, in that \"N.A.'s remarks during the forensic interview [were] inconsistent with her impeached trial testimony and do nothing to rehabilitate her credibility.\" To the extent that the statements were consistent, he argues that the video was not admissible because N.A.'s responses to the defendant's line of questioning about her meetings with the prosecutor \"clearly demonstrate [that] N.A. was not coached or subjected to undue influence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also argues that the\n   portions of the interview that were consistent with N.A.'s trial testimony should not have been admitted because he did not attempt to impeach her on those statements and, thus, admitting the entire interview into evidence only served to bolster N.A.'s credibility. The state argues that the interview was a prior consistent statement because the statements N.A. made during the interview and her trial testimony were \"substantially similar\" and that any ambiguities are a factual determination for the jury to resolve. It further argues that the interview tended to refute the defendant's suggestion that N.A. was coached by the prosecutor or T.M. Finally, the state contends that the entire interview was properly admitted because \"without [N.A.'s] statements in context, the jury would have been left with a distorted view of reality, and the mistaken impression\" that she gave inconsistent statements. We agree with the state.\n   \"[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence.... The trial court's ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court's discretion.... We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court's ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.... Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.... This deferential standard is applicable to evidentiary questions involving hearsay, generally ... and to questions relating to prior consistent statements, specifically.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Efrain M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661879\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/95/590/#p596\">\n    95 Conn.App. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20A.2d%2050\">\n    899 A.2d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669016,3669257,3668843\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/909/\">\n    279 Conn. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%201069\">\n    902 A.2d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a threshold matter, we disagree that the interview should not have been admitted because the statements N.A. made during the interview that the defendant used to impeach her testimony did not qualify as prior consistent statements. Many of the defendant's claimed inconsistencies between N.A.'s trial testimony and the statements she made during the interview were either substantially consistent with one another or susceptible to more than one interpretation. The fact that certain statements made during the interview were inconsistent with her trial testimony does not render the entire interview inadmissible as a prior consistent statement.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made the following statements: \"And as I eluded to earlier, listen to the court's instruction ... that we ... don't have to prove [the state's burden] beyond all ... to a mathematical certainty or remove every single doubt from your mind.... And as I stated before and I can't state it enough, we have to prove the elements beyond a reasonable doubt and [defense counsel] threw a lot of things on this table right here, a lot of facts out here, some favorable for the state, some favorable for the defense.\n   <em>\n    Almost like a jigsaw puzzle putting it together. You bring this piece over here, you bring this piece over here, bring this piece over here and you don't need every single piece to put that jigsaw puzzle together. For argument sake, if it was a jigsaw puzzle of an elephant, if it came in and you had a piece of the trunk and you had a piece of the grey body, the ... leg as well and there's still six or seven empty pieces over here, you don't need the whole puzzle to determine hey, that's a puzzle and the picture ... in the puzzle is an elephant.\n   </em>\n   Again, that's in keeping with the burden that the state has.\" (Emphasis added.) After closing arguments, outside the presence of the jury, the defendant argued that the use of the jigsaw puzzle analogy was improper, but the court disagreed and did not give a curative instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor committed an impropriety when he used the puzzle analogy in explaining the concept of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" He argues that the analogy \"diluted the state's burden of proof, creating a significant risk that\n   the jury would convict the defendant on a standard less than reasonable doubt.\" He contends that the prosecutor's language of \" 'six or seven empty pieces' suggested some level of mathematical certainty was required to convict the defendant\" and that the \"average American juror would recognize a jigsaw puzzle of an elephant long before all of the pieces are in place.\" He also argues that the puzzle analogy \"suggested that the jurors could convict the defendant in the absence of evidence proving the essential elements of the crimes charged.\" The state replies that the prosecutor's use of the puzzle analogy was not improper because it was used in direct response to defense counsel's closing argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also argues that the \"comment did not suggest any specific quantitative measure of reasonable doubt,\" and that, instead, the puzzle analogy was used to \"remind the\n   jury that it was not required to prove something to a mathematical certainty or beyond all doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We conclude the state's argument is more convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [the impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"As we previously have recognized, prosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments....

Thus, as the state's advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state's case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.... Moreover, [i]t does not follow ... that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper....

Thus, we find this argument unavailing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Alternatively, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video into evidence in order to refute the notion that N.A. had given inconsistent statements. After reviewing the transcript of the interview and N.A.'s trial testimony, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the defendant's cross-examination left the jury with the impression that N.A.'s interview was inconsistent with her trial testimony.

In context, she described only one instance of penetration, which was substantially consistent with her trial testimony that the defendant \"tried\" to engage in anal intercourse with her on one occasion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    We disagree with the state's argument that defense counsel invited the claimed impropriety during his closing argument. It contends that the defense counsel told the jury to clinically evaluate the evidence when he stated \"[the prosecutor is] relying on you to evaluate what you've heard here, to\n    <em>\n     take it apart, put it together, take it apart, put it together.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.). Thus, it argues that \"the puzzle theme was not introduced by the state, but, rather, it was first introduced by the defendant during his closing,\" so it was free to remind the jury that its burden was not to prove its case to a mathematical certainty. We fail to see how defense counsel's closing argument invited such an argument, as the comment was not directly referencing a puzzle analogy or the burden the state must meet to prove its case. We conclude, nevertheless, that the state's use of the puzzle analogy was not improper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
