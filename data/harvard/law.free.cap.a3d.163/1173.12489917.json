Petitioners, Representative Donald Turner, Jr. and Senator Joseph Benning, seek to enjoin respondent, Governor Peter Shumlin, whose last day in office is January 5, 2017, from appointing a successor to the office held by Associate Justice John Dooley, whose current term expires on April 1, 2017. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that petitioner Senator Benning has standing to bring this action and that respondent does not have the authority to appoint Justice Dooley's successor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. The parties have agreed to the following facts. Associate Justice John Dooley was appointed to a six-year term as a justice of this Court on June 12, 1987. The General Assembly voted to retain Justice Dooley for additional six-year terms in 1993, 1999, 2005, and 2011. Justice Dooley\n   did not file a declaration with the Office of the Secretary of State before September 1, 2016 indicating that he would seek retention for another term beyond March 31, 2017, the last day of his current six-year term. See 4 V.S.A. \u00a7 4(c) (\"A supreme court justice may file in the office of the secretary of state, on or before September 1 of the year preceding the expiration of the term for which he or she was appointed or retained, a declaration that he or she will be a candidate for retention.\"). He will remain in his office as an associate justice of the Court until April 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Respondent was elected as Governor in 2010, 2012, and 2014. He did not seek reelection in the fall of 2016 for another term as Governor. Phil Scott won the election in November 2016 and will be sworn in as the new Governor on the afternoon of January 5, 2017. The Vermont Legislature will commence its next biennium on January 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Following Justice Dooley's decision not to seek retention for another term, respondent announced his intention to appoint Justice Dooley's successor. The Judicial Nominating Board began its selection process. On December 16, 2016, after completing its review of applicants, the Board transmitted to the Governor a list setting forth the names of six candidates to replace Justice Dooley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. On December 21, 2016, petitioner Donald Turner, Jr., a state representative and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, filed a petition for quo warranto\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   contesting respondent's authority to appoint Justice Dooley's successor and asking this Court to enjoin him from doing so. Petitioner Turner asserted that although the Vermont Constitution authorizes the Governor to fill a vacancy on the Court, no vacancy will exist until Justice Dooley leaves office on April 1, 2017, nearly three months after Governor Shumlin leaves the Office of Governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. On December 23, 2016, the Office of the Attorney General filed a notice of appearance on behalf of respondent. That same day, this Court enjoined the Governor from appointing Justice Dooley's successor until further order from this Court, ordered the parties to file memoranda of law on or before December 30, 2016, and scheduled a hearing for January 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. On December 27, 2016, Senator Joseph Benning, who is Senate Minority Leader and Vice-Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, filed a motion to intervene\n   in the matter and join the petition. The following day, this Court granted the motion. Petitioners and respondent filed memoranda of law on December 30, 2016. On that same day, Senator Richard Sears, who is Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of respondent's position, along with a motion for permission to file the brief. On January 3, 2017, this Court granted Senator Sears's motion and held a hearing on the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Ripeness and Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. Before addressing the merits of the petition, we first consider whether the petition is ripe for resolution and whether petitioners have standing to bring this action. \"Vermont courts are vested with subject matter jurisdiction only over actual cases or controversies involving litigants with adverse interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Brod v.

Respondent contends that the instant matter is not ripe for judicial resolution because he has not yet nominated a replacement for Justice Dooley and, even if he proceeds with his intent to choose Justice Dooley's successor, there will be no justiciable controversy unless and until the Senate confirms the appointment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9.

There is nothing conjectural or hypothetical about either respondent's challenged conduct or petitioners' claimed injury. The Governor's pronouncement of his intent to fill a \"vacancy\" on the Court by naming Justice Dooley's successor is unequivocal, not conjectural or hypothetical-indeed, he is herein vigorously maintaining his right to do so. The agreed statement of facts provides that the Governor is prepared to nominate one of the candidates. Petitioners' claimed injury is that respondent's constitutionally unauthorized appointment interferes with their constitutionally provided legislative responsibilities regarding judicial appointments. As discussed more fully below, petitioners' legislative responsibilities in dispositive part involve a fundamental interest in ensuring that their votes are part of a sound constitutional process. This claim is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. We now turn, more specifically, to the question of standing. \"This Court has adopted the constitutional and prudential components of the standing doctrine enunciated by the United States Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Schievella v.

Standing, among other related doctrines, is rooted in respect for the separation of powers and is aimed at promoting judicial restraint by limiting judicial intervention\n   in a democratic society and in the political process.\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525578\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/542/#p543\">\n    173 Vt. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543-44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525578\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/542/#p543\">\n    790 A.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430-31 (2001) (mem.).

To satisfy the threshold requirement of standing, a plaintiff \"must present a real-not merely theoretical-controversy involving the threat of actual injury to a protected legal interest rather than merely speculating about the impact of some generalized grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Brod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993971\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/234/\">\n    2007 VT 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993971\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/234/\">\n    182 Vt. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993971\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/234/\">\n    936 A.2d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).

(quotation omitted). As a federal district court recently stated in summarizing the test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Rossito-Canty v.

In considering whether a particular plaintiff has satisfied these elements and thus is entitled to adjudication of the particular claims asserted, a court must ask whether \"the injury [is] too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate,\" to be judicially cognizable, whether \"the line of causation between the illegal conduct and injury [is] too attenuated,\" and whether \"the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling [is] too speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 32. That right necessarily encompasses an interest in being assured that his vote-pursuant to his constitutional duty to provide \"advice and consent\" on the Governor's Supreme Court appointments-is exercised with respect to a properly named appointee under the Vermont Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17. In other words, Senator Benning has a particular right and interest in not having his constitutional duty subverted by voting on an appointee who is not constitutionally entitled to hold office in the first instance.

The Senate has a right and an obligation to ensure that its advice and consent is exercised in compliance with the Constitution, and it should not be required to exercise that duty on a patently unconstitutional appointee. In sum, the interest at stake here is not simply the Senate's vote on the appointee, which it retains regardless of the appointee's qualifications-nor its right to reject the appointee, which it may do-but rather the fundamental interest in ensuring that its vote is part of a sound constitutional process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18.

The same is true of the Vermont Constitution. The section in the Vermont Constitution that permits the General Assembly to \"establish procedures for the implementation of the provisions of sections thirty-two through thirty-six\" does not authorize the Governor to create, as\n   opposed to fill, a vacancy. Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 36. Pursuant to that section, the Legislature has established procedures for the filling of vacancies, including those on the Vermont Supreme Court. Section 602(b) of Title 4 provides that \"[w]henever a vacancy occurs in the office of a Supreme Court Justice ...\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   when an incumbent does not declare that he or she will be a candidate to succeed himself or herself [pursuant to 4 V.S.A. \u00a7 4(c) ], the [Judicial Nominating] Board shall submit to the Governor the names of as many persons as it deems well qualified to be appointed to the office.\" (Emphasis added.) This provision, upon which respondent relies, cannot expand the governor's power beyond that established in the Constitution. See\n   <em>\n    Youngblood v.

In any event, \u00a7 602(b) does not purport to do so. Indeed, the use of the word \"or\" emphasized above indicates that an incumbent not declaring for retention, as was the case here with Justice Dooley, is distinct from the creation of a vacancy. Section 602(b) does not confer any power on the Governor; rather, it merely allows the Judicial Nominating Board, in anticipation of an expected vacancy, to submit the names of candidates to the Governor, nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 30. Other provisions in Title 4 regarding retention procedures support this conclusion. For example, 4 V.S.A. \u00a7 4(c) provides that if the General Assembly votes not to retain a justice, \"upon expiration of the term of office a vacancy shall exist which shall be filled by appointment in accordance with the constitution and chapter 15 of this title [concerning judicial nominations and appointments].\" We see no reason why a vacancy would exist at the end of a term when a justice is not retained, but before the end of the term when a justice does not seek retention. In addition, \u00a7 5(b) of Title 4 provides that \"[a] justice shall remain in office until a successor is appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed for cause or unless he [or she] resigns.\" This provision evidences the Legislature's concern that there will be a seamless transition and that the Court will be at full strength in the event the justice's successor is unable to start when a vacancy occurs at the time the term of the outgoing justice expires. There would be little need for such a provision if the Governor could appoint a successor to a justice before the justice's term of office expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31. In short, there is no support for respondent's position that the Vermont Constitution gives him the authority to appoint a successor for an opening on this Court that does not become vacant-unoccupied-until after he leaves office. Respondent cannot complete the appointment process by swearing in a new justice now-effectively adding a sixth justice-because the vacancy does not arise until Justice Dooley leaves office. See Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 56 (providing, in relevant part, that every judicial officer shall take oath or affirmation of allegiance to State of Vermont before entering upon execution of office). Nor will respondent have the authority to appoint a successor to Justice Dooley at the time the vacancy occurs, after respondent has left office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 32. We are aware, as was the Legislature in enacting the provisions cited above, that delay in filling a vacancy has the potential to create confusion and disorder in public service. For that reason, those provisions, including \u00a7 602(b), allow a portion of the appointment process to proceed on an anticipatory basis so that when the vacancy becomes effective the appointment and transition can be made as seamlessly as possible. But none of those provisions\n   give, or could give, the Governor authority to appoint a successor to a justice whose term expires, and thus becomes vacant, after the Governor leaves office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the court in\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Cornett\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   If it was necessary in all cases to delay making an appointment to fill a vacancy until the office was actually vacant, much confusion and disorder in the public service might be occasioned, and so we think that an appointment may be made within a reasonable time before the vacancy actually exists, to take effect when it occurs, if it be made by the authority that would have the right to make the appointment when the vacancy does occur. A person cannot be appointed presently to fill a vacancy when there is no vacancy, but he [or she] can be appointed to fill a vacancy that will shortly occur; his appointment to take effect when it does. This view of the law ... is generally accepted as correct. We can well understand that there might be good reasons presented against the practice of making an appointment to fill a vacancy that would occur at a distant date, and have no doubt that it would be very objectionable to allow an official to make an appointment to take effect in the future when the vacancy to fill ... would occur in the term of a succeeding official. To uphold the validity of such an appointment would oftentimes enable an official to take from his [or her] successor a part of the rightful powers and emoluments of his [or her] office and surround him [or her] with ... appointees not in harmony with his [or her] methods, or in sympathy with his [or her] purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4392534\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/136/628/\">\n    136 Ky. 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20S.W.%20870\">\n    124 S.W. 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (1910) (citations omitted); see also\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

We conclude that the Vermont Constitution does not authorize respondent to appoint an Associate Justice of this Court in anticipation of a vacancy that is not expected to occur until the expiration of the justice's term of office, which will occur months after respondent leaves office. In so holding, we emphasize that our decision today rests entirely upon the meaning and purpose of the Vermont Constitution. We reach our decision having in mind the overarching principles of our democracy: the integrity of our governing institutions and the people's confidence in them. The particular identity of the parties or potential nominees to the Office of Associate Justice have no bearing on our decision. Our sole responsibility in this, as in any, case is to apply the law evenhandedly, regardless of the identity of the litigants, the sensitivity of the issues, or the passing political interests of the moment. As we have elsewhere observed, \"[o]ur constitutional responsibility to consider the legal merits of issues properly before us provides no exception for the controversial case.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Prior to the amendments, Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices were selected by the Legislature, while District Court judges were appointed by the Governor. See generally J. Dooley,\n    <em>\n     The Judiciary\n    </em>\n    in\n    <em>\n     Vermont State Government Since 1965\n    </em>\n    187, 203-05 (M. Sherman ed. 1999). Each of these judges and justices had set terms, and, in order to obtain a new term, faced retention votes in the Legislature. In essence, the amendments applied the process for District Court judges to Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices. 1966, No. 64 (The Judicial Selection Act of 1966).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Legislature created a Constitutional Commission to propose amendments to the Vermont Constitution in 1968. 1967, No. 298 (Adj. Sess.). The Commission's report, issued on January 5, 1971, includes Proposal 5, which contained the proposed amendments to the judicial articles. See Report to the General Assembly of the Constitutional Commission 28-36 (1971). With minor language changes, the proposed articles were adopted by the Legislature and approved by the voters. Unfortunately, the Commission's report is relatively summary and provides little explanation that can guide us in deciding this case. It contains two paragraphs on judicial selection, appointment, confirmation, and retention, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    As regards judicial selection, the Commission believes that the judicial selection board presently existing by statute, the legitimacy of which on occasion has been questioned due to its lack of constitutional sanction, should be provided for and given explicit recognition in the Constitution. As noted above, the concept of the Missouri Plan has been given effect only as to the district judges, and in a modified form as to the supreme court justices and superior judges. The Commission supports the essential elements of this plan as now in effect with regard to the district judges, which contemplates the submission of nominees for judicial offices to the governor by a judicial nominating board, appointment by the governor from the nominees so submitted, and tenure in office thereafter unless voted out of office by a majority of the members of the General Assembly voting on the question at a stated interval. It is the belief of the Commission that this is the best method of selection for the purpose of insuring that persons selected as members of the judiciary will possess the necessary ability and professional qualifications, and that the selection process under this proposal would be as free as possible from the effects of political influence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    While under this proposal the General Assembly will no longer be empowered to elect supreme court justices and superior judges, it is proposed that the consent of the Senate be required for confirmation of all judicial appointments. Interim appointments to fill vacancies occurring between legislative sessions would be made by the Governor, subject to later confirmation by the Senate. This procedure, which is very similar to that which is presently followed in connection with the confirmation of appointments for numerous other positions in state government, would afford the legislature its traditional confirming role.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 31-32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    While these statements of intent are helpful in providing context for the question before us, they do not show any definitive intent, one way or the other, in resolving that question. Two points are worth making, however. First, the Commission report, as quoted above, makes it clear that it wanted to design a process as free from politics as possible. There is no time requirement for the Judicial Nominating Board to nominate candidates either in the statute or the Constitution. Respondent's position in the case would put the Board in the political position of deciding whether to get its nominations to the outgoing Governor or to wait to get them to the incoming Governor. This was plainly a serious concern when the 1974 amendments were added because, as noted in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    , under the preexisting law the time limit for a retention declaration was December 1, not September 1 as it is now, thereby requiring a very expedited process for the Board to get names to the outgoing Governor.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4772539\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/128/#p130\">\n     148 Vt. at 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4772539\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/128/#p130\">\n     530 A.2d at 553\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . If the incoming Governor makes the appointment, however, the political opportunity goes away. Second, the last sentence of the Commission report quoted above likens the appointment process to the preexisting and familiar process involving executive branch officials who are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Respondent argues that the processes are different because the Governor only \"nominates\" judges. Although one could argue that there are differences, the Commission report essentially states that the two processes should be looked at as being the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Respondent argues that the Governor is merely nominating a successor under \u00a7 32 and not appointing one, as under \u00a7 33. Similarly, amicus curiae argues that the Governor's nomination under \u00a7 32 is an \"incomplete appointment.\" We find these arguments unavailing. The term \"nominate\" is used in the Constitution to describe the list prepared by the judicial nominating body. See Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 32 ; see also\n    <em>\n     Wolfe v. Yudichak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8543383\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/153/235/#p253\">\n     153 Vt. 235\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 253,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8543383\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/153/235/#p253\">\n     571 A.2d 592\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 602 (1989) (\"We find nothing in the [Vermont] Constitution to establish a class of justices with different and diminished powers and prerogatives from those who have been confirmed by the Senate.\"). Moreover, absent the temporary injunction issued by this Court, the respondent could well have made an interim appointment governed by \u00a7 33 of chapter II of the Vermont Constitution because the Senate had not been in session. In any event, the arguments are beside the point. As explained below, there still must be a vacancy to fill, and a vacancy does not exist if an office is occupied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Most, if not all, of the cases holding that a vacancy occurs upon the submission of an irrevocable resignation are construing constitutional language different from ours and involve the necessity of establishing who the candidates are for elective office before election deadlines.

Edwards\n    </em>\n    , the court held that the resignations given by judges were irrevocable upon receipt by the governor and his proclamation calling for special elections, thereby \"creating a vacancy in the office which, under the constitution, may be filled by election, even though the effective date of the resignation is prospective.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9724365\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/361/880/#p882\">\n     361 So.2d 880\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 882 (La. 1978).

In that case, an incumbent sheriff was reelected and thereafter duly qualified to commence a second term of office that was to begin on January 20, 1959. When the sheriff died on December 24, 1958, the current governor appointed a successor for the remainder of the sheriff's unexpired term and for the new term commencing on January 20, 1959. The new incoming governor, whose term of office began on January 20, 1959, appointed a different successor to the late sheriff for the new term. Construing statutory and constitutional law, the court found in favor of the former governor, ruling that the sheriff's death created a vacancy in his office that the then-current governor could fill, notwithstanding the fact that the governor's term expired before commencement of the new term.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 489-92.
