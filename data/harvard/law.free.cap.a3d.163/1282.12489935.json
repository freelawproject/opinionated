(defendant).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) \"in failing to apply or misapplying fundamental tenets of wage and hour law\"; (2) \"in applying an incorrect burden of proof\"; and (3) \"in finding that [the] plaintiff has not proved that [the] defendant failed to pay any wages to which [the] plaintiff was otherwise entitled.\" We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts were found by the court or are not disputed. The defendant was a start-up company when the plaintiff began working there in January, 2003. The defendant manufactured hidden deck fasteners for the construction industry. David Hartmann, David Martel, and Donald Martel were corporate officers and held various managerial positions within the defendant. The plaintiff was hired as a sales representative for a new line of deck fasteners and was compensated on a commission basis, with an agreement that his first $10,000 in commission earnings would be withheld and invested in shares of the company's stock. Because the defendant was just starting up and had little support staff, it was further agreed that if the plaintiff was called upon from time to time to perform administrative functions that were not sales related, the defendant would compensate the plaintiff on an hourly basis, based on time records submitted periodically by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff worked primarily as a sales representative from January, 2003 until April, 2005, calling customers, visiting wholesalers and retailers, attending trade shows, creating and editing promotional materials, and keeping track internally and externally of the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the plaintiff had accumulated $10,027.26 in sales commissions, which was set aside in a stock fund, he was paid commissions for subsequent sales that he made and received Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms 1099 for that income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff submitted a record of time spent on administrative work to the defendant in February, 2003 for work performed in January, 2003. The plaintiff was not paid for the administrative work he performed in January, 2003, and he never demanded payment for that administrative work during his employment. The plaintiff did not submit any other records of time allegedly spent on administrative work until he stopped working for the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When it became clear that the plaintiff\n   would be leaving in March, 2005, the plaintiff presented the defendant with more than two years of administrative time records for which he demanded compensation. The defendant disputed the plaintiff's entitlement to compensation for such administrative time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff essentially stopped working for the defendant on March 16, 2005, and he resigned effective that date. On April 7, 2005, the defendant's counsel sent a letter to the plaintiff, officially terminating his employment. The defendant paid out all of his remaining earned commissions and reported on an IRS Form 1099 for the year 2005 that the plaintiff received $8861.49 for that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2006, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the state Department of Labor (department) for unpaid wages totaling $191,966.91. After an investigation, Blair F. Bertaccini, a department wage enforcement agent, determined that certain costs had been deducted improperly from one of the plaintiff's commission checks and that the plaintiff was owed $3603.67 in unpaid wages. The plaintiff was unwilling to resolve his claim for that amount, and he withdrew his complaint at the department. On August 13, 2007, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendant and against Hartmann and the Martels in their individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff's operative complaint alleged that the defendant, Hartmann, and the Martels (1) failed to pay him hourly and commission wages and/or the shares of stock to which he was entitled and (2) obtained the plaintiff's property, i.e., wages and/or stock, by false pretenses. The defendant, Hartmann, and the Martels filed special defenses alleging that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations articulated in General Statutes \u00a7 52-596 and by the doctrine of res judicata. Following a six day trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Robert I. Berdon\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, issued its memorandum of decision on April 27, 2011. Although the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, it limited his recovery for unpaid hourly wages to $3603.67, which was the amount Bertaccini recommended to resolve the wage claim filed by the plaintiff with the department. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata precluded any further recovery by the plaintiff for unpaid hourly wages. The court added $10,027.26 to that award, however, representing the sales commissions set aside for the purchase of corporate stock, for a total recovery of $13,630.93, plus taxable costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff appealed the judgment of the trial court claiming that \"the court improperly concluded that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the recovery of those wages because of a prior determination by a wage enforcement agent for the department of labor.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tiger Claw, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767216\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/141/110/#p112\">\n    141 Conn.App. 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%20533\">\n    61 A.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20926\">\n    310 Conn. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20146\">\n    78 A.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (2013). The defendant, Hartmann, and the Martels filed a cross appeal from the judgment, \"claiming that the court improperly (1) awarded the plaintiff $10,027.26 for unpaid commissions and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   found [Hartmann and the Martels] liable for the amounts awarded to the plaintiff.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20146\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This court reversed the judgment \"as to the according of res judicata effect to [Bertaccini's] determination of the plaintiff's wage claim\" and remanded the case for a new trial on that issue.

Prior to trial, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine requesting that the court \"limit any documentary or testamentary evidence that the defendant asserts shows the hours worked by or wages paid to the plaintiff and apply the burden-shifting framework set out in\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mt.

The court denied the motion without prejudice before trial \"because there is currently an insufficient basis upon which to make such a decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence that he was entitled to additional compensation at an hourly wage for substantial administrative work he purportedly performed for the defendant. In particular, the plaintiff produced as evidence several spreadsheets that he represented were contemporaneous records of his daily \"administrative hours\" for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005. The defendant rebutted that evidence primarily through the testimony of Hartmann, who explained why the plaintiff's figures in his spreadsheets were not credible or why certain tasks listed by the plaintiff in his spreadsheets constituted sales work, compensable through his sales commissions, not administrative work. Hartmann stated on several occasions that he did not know what many of the tasks identified by the plaintiff were.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Hartmann stated that, although he conceptually understood what some of the listed tasks were, he did not know that the plaintiff actually performed those tasks or why he would perform them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Hartmann testified that there were some tasks he knew that the plaintiff was performing despite being instructed not to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 6, 2015, the court issued its memorandum of decision, in which it concluded that \"the plaintiff ... failed to prove his entitlement to any additional compensation by a preponderance of the evidence ....\" Although the court noted that \"the plaintiff was always considered an independent contractor, not an employee\" by the parties, it assumed arguendo that the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme for unpaid wages claims by employees applied to the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court found that the plaintiff's spreadsheets of his \"administrative hours\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   were \"not a contemporaneous record of the plaintiff's administrative work\" and that \"the number of 'administrative hours' reflected on them is not believable (and, in some instances, barely humanly possible), especially when coupled with the plaintiff's primary [forty]-hour-per-week job as a sales representative, a job he performed well, according to David Hartmann. These time records cast doubt upon the entire presentation of the plaintiff about his performance of any administrative work at all for the defendant.\" The court further found that, \"with rare exception, the plaintiff was not directed by the defendant to do any of the administrative functions for which he finally submitted a demand. Rather from a review of the spreadsheets and an analysis of the evidence as a whole, particularly the plaintiff's own testimony, the court finds that the plaintiff busied himself with projects that he invented for himself which had only incidental value to the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Although ... Hartmann generously conceded that the plaintiff may have worked\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   compensable administrative hours on occasion, the court is not bound to accept such uncontradicted testimony.... Rather, despite the time records constructed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff's descriptions of the administrative time worked are so vague and sometimes contradictory that his account of his many hundreds of hours spent on administrative tasks simply does not ring true.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As a result, the court concluded that \"the plaintiff has not proved that the defendant failed to pay any wages or commissions to which the plaintiff was otherwise entitled. The absence of the compensation of which the plaintiff complains in this lawsuit is not evidence that the defendant withheld payments it knew or suspected that the plaintiff was owed for work he had performed. Rather, the court finds that the plaintiff either did not perform the hourly work claimed in the spreadsheets or that substantially all of the work he performed was in general or specific support of his own sales work, for which he received compensation not through an hourly wage but through commissions which were properly paid and reported.\" Because \"the plaintiff ... failed to prove his entitlement to any additional compensation by a preponderance of the evidence,\" the court rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the outset, we observe that the plaintiff's issues on appeal rest on two faulty premises: the trial court (1) found that he was an independent contractor and, as a result, (2) failed to apply, or misapplied, the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme. As we previously stated, although the trial court noted that \"the plaintiff was always considered an independent contractor,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   it assumed arguendo that the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme applied to the plaintiff's claim and rejected his claim because\n   he failed to meet his burden of proof. Accordingly, we also assume for the purposes of our analysis that the plaintiff was an employee and that the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme applies to his case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we conclude that the trial court properly applied the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme and did not err in its conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove his entitlement to additional compensation from the defendant, we reject the plaintiff's claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first set forth the standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis. \"[T]he scope of our appellate review depends [on] the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ravetto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957819\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/716/#p735\">\n    285 Conn. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20309\">\n    941 A.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 16 (b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 create a civil cause of action for an employee to collect unpaid wages.

The court did not conclude that the plaintiff was not entitled to compensation because he was not directed to perform the tasks listed in his spreadsheets. Instead, the driving force of the court's holding was its finding that the plaintiff's spreadsheets and testimony were not credible. It was because of this credibility determination that the court found that the plaintiff did not perform much of the work claimed in his spreadsheets and that, to the extent he actually performed certain tasks, he was properly compensated for them through his sales commissions, as they were sales related tasks. It was because of these factual findings that the court was not persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff in fact performed work for the defendant for which he was improperly compensated. As a result, we cannot conclude that the court's ruling was in contravention of state and federal employment law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Several additional parties were named as defendants in this action, but they have not participated in this appeal.
