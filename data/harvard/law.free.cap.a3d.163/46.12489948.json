The plaintiff, Doreen Spiotti, was a member of the International Brotherhood\n   of Police Officers, Local 332 (union), and was employed as a police officer in the Wolcott Police Department (department). After the plaintiff filed a complaint with an ombudsman for the department alleging that the department had engaged in retaliatory conduct against her, the department conducted an investigation and concluded that certain statements that the plaintiff had made in her complaint were false. Thereafter, Neil O'Leary, the chief of the department, recommended to the town council of the named defendant, the town of Wolcott.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the plaintiff's employment be terminated. The defendant terminated the plaintiff, who then filed a grievance pursuant to the procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the defendant and the union. In accordance with those procedures, the Connecticut State Board of Mediation and Arbitration (board of mediation) conducted hearings on the issue of whether the plaintiff's employment had been terminated for just cause, and it ultimately concluded that there was just cause on the basis of its determination that the plaintiff had made false statements in her complaint to the ombudsman and during the department's investigation of that complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought the present action alleging, among other things, that her termination was in retaliation for bringing a previous action against the defendant alleging sex discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4), and for engaging in\n   protected speech, namely, the complaint to the ombudsman, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the factual underpinnings of those claims had been decided adversely to her by the board of mediation in the arbitration proceedings. The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment as to these claims on the ground that, under this court's interpretation of \u00a7 31-51bb in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   , the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar a statutory cause of action that is brought after the same issue has been decided in arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. The defendant then filed this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant contends that (1)\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   should be overruled as a result of the legislature's subsequent enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   (2) even if\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   should not be overruled as the result of \u00a7 1-2z, it should be overruled because it was\n   wrongly decided under then existing law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   is still good law and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the underlying facts of this case have little bearing on the issue that is before us, we need not discuss them in further detail, but may proceed directly to our legal analysis. We begin with the standard of review. As we have indicated, the trial court's decision denying the relevant portions of the defendant's motion for summary judgment was premised on this court's interpretation of \u00a7 31-51bb in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738686\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/475/#p486\">\n    226 Conn. at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as barring the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to statutory claims brought subsequent to an arbitration in which the underlying issues were determined adversely to the plaintiff. The defendant's claims that\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   should be overruled as the result of the enactment of \u00a7 1-2z or that it should be overruled because it was incorrect at the time it was decided involve questions of statutory interpretation subject to plenary review.

After oral argument, this court in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   sua sponte raised the issue of whether \u00a7 31-51bb had any effect on the judgment of the trial court and requested supplemental briefs on that issue.

Nevertheless, it\n   concluded that applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel to preclude employment related statutory claims that previously had been determined in an arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement would defeat the intent of \u00a7 31-51bb, namely, \"to ensure that employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement receive the same opportunity to litigate their statutory claims as those employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\" Id., at 484,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The majority in\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   further determined that this interpretation was supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 31-51bb.

Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. ... It is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and ... is an obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Moreover, [i]n evaluating the force of stare decisis, our case law dictates\n   that we should be especially wary of overturning a decision that involves the construction of a statute. ... When we construe a statute, we act not as plenary lawgivers but as surrogates for another\n   policy maker, [that is] the legislature. In our role as surrogates, our only responsibility is to determine what the legislature, within constitutional limits, intended to do. Sometimes, when we have made such a determination, the legislature instructs us that we have misconstrued its intentions. We are bound by the instructions so provided. ... More often, however, the legislature takes no further action to clarify its intentions. Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature's acquiescence in our construction of a statute. ... Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142752\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/602/#p614\">\n    290 Conn. 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20148\">\n    966 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Factors that may justify overruling a prior decision interpreting a statutory provision include intervening developments in the law, the potential for unconscionable results, the potential for irreconcilable conflicts and difficulty in applying the interpretation.

That is not the case. Rather, by enacting \u00a7 31-51bb, the legislature limited \"an arbitrator's power to determine finally and conclusively\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   and legal issues that are critical to an employee's right to pursue a statutory cause of action in the Superior Court.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Genovese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738686\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/475/#p486\">\n    226 Conn. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%20946\">\n    628 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also id., at 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20657\">\n    923 A.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that arbitration does not have preclusive effect in subsequent statutory action in part because arbitration is less effective forum for resolution of factual claims than\n   judicial proceeding).
