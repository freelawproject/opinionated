The plaintiffs stated that although more than thirty days had passed since the court had ordered the defendants to remove the pole barn, the pole barn was still standing on the Medina lot. Moreover, the plaintiffs represented that the defendants failed to remove all portions of the stone wall within the 100 foot setback. The plaintiffs asked the court to find the defendants in contempt for every day they remained in violation of the court's order, and for costs and attorney's fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-256b. The defendants objected to the motion for contempt, arguing that they were not in wilful noncompliance with the judgment and that they did not have the financial wherewithal to remove the pole barn. On December 19, 2014, the court found Luis Medina to be in contempt of its orders. The court continued the matter to January 5, 2015, \"during which period of time the defendant is ordered to fully comply with the court's orders. If the contempt has not been full[y] remedied a fine will be imposed for every day there is noncompliance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 6, 2015, the court ruled on the plaintiffs' motion for contempt, ordering: \"The defendants, Luis Medina and Amanda Medina, are found to be in contempt of the orders of the court. The\n   defendants are ordered to remove all the stones from the wall on or before February 1, 2015. Commencing [January 5, 2015], the defendants shall pay the plaintiffs the sum of $100 per day until the stones are removed. The plaintiffs are awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $1,500.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 8, 2015, Harms filed an affidavit of noncompliance, attesting that Luis Medina had not fully complied with the court's order because he failed to pay the\n   plaintiffs $100 per day until the stone wall was completely removed. Luis Medina needed six days from, and including, January 5, 2015, to remove the wall, and had paid the plaintiffs only $400, not $600. In addition, Harms attested that Luis Medina had failed to remove the pole barn completely, as one of the pole supports remained standing. Luis Medina filed a counter affidavit in which he attested that the stone wall was removed within four days of January 5, 2015, and that other stones, not part of the stone wall, were removed two days later. He further attested that he had paid the attorney's fees of $1500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs filed another motion for contempt against the defendants on September 24, 2015. In that motion, the plaintiffs represented that the defendants had failed to fully remove the pole barn, failed to pay the $200 balance of the fine, and have \"reerected a stone wall in the exact area where they were ordered to remove it.\" The defendants objected, asking the court to deny the plaintiffs' motion for contempt because they had removed the stone wall that the plaintiffs claimed was a permanent structure. The defendants argued that they had removed the stone wall that the plaintiffs alleged was a permanent structure, and that the court's order did not prohibit them from having stones on their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties appeared for oral argument on the motion for contempt on November 23, 2015. At the hearing, Luis Medina argued that the stone wall to which the plaintiffs were then objecting merely consisted of loose stones along the southern boundary of the defendants' property. A photograph of what Luis Medina termed \"loose stones\" was placed into evidence. The court rejected the defendants' argument, stating: \"If that's not a stone wall, I don't know what it is.... There is no question in my mind that the law as laid down by the Appellate Court includes what's shown in that picture\n   as a stone wall.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court issued its ruling on November 25, 2015, ordering, \"[a]s to previously imposed fines, the court does not make a finding of contempt, but does find that Mr. Medina owes $200 to the plaintiffs, which is ordered to be paid by December 11, 2015. As to the remaining pole from the pole barn, the court finds it to be a negligible item that need not be removed, and the court does not make a finding of contempt. As to the stone wall, the court does make a finding of contempt against Mr. Medina. The stones [shown in the photograph that was placed into evidence] are ordered removed on or before [December 11, 2015]. The court orders Mr. Medina to pay $1500 in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs on or before December 11, 2015.\" The defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[O]ur analysis of a judgment of contempt consists of two levels of inquiry.

Second, if we conclude that the underlying court order was sufficiently clear and unambiguous, we must then determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in issuing, or refusing to issue, a judgment of contempt, which includes a review of the trial court's determination of whether the violation was wilful or excused by a good faith dispute or misunderstanding.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ciottone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ciottone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20780\">\n    154 Conn.App. 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%201004\">\n    107 A.3d 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that in granting the plaintiffs' 2015 motion for contempt, the court impermissibly modified the substantive terms of its judgment\n   by converting a mandatory injunction into a prohibitive injunction that forbade any structure, not just a permanent structure, from being constructed in the setback.

The facts found at trial reveal that the co-owners purchased the 55.72 acres of land to prevent it from becoming heavily developed and made the majority of the land available to the Norfolk Land Trust. The co-ownership agreement, which the\n   defendants signed, provided that there was to be a reasonable setback from the road for any permanent structures. The deed to the Medina lot provided that \"any permanent structure erected on the property shall be located at least 100 feet distant from the westerly line of Winchester Road.\" The defendants signed the deeds on August 10, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Avery I\n   </em>\n   , this court determined that the wall in question was a permanent structure. After reviewing the trial court's factual findings regarding the size, structure, height, and appearance of the stone wall, and examining the photographic evidence in the record, this court found that \"there can be no doubt that the defendants intend for the wall to remain firmly in the same place where it was erected and [not be] moved or relocated on a seasonal basis.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20433\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%201241\">\n    94 A.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thereafter, they placed stones lower in height in a similar position within the setback area. The plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt claiming, in part, that the defendants reerected a stone wall in the setback area and therefore failed to comply with the court's orders. The defendants objected to the motion for contempt arguing, in part, that the court did not prohibit any stones on their property. At the hearing on the motion for contempt, Luis Medina argued that there were just loose stones along the southern boundary of the defendants' property. The court rejected that\n   representation stating: \"If that's not a stone wall, I don't know what it is.... There is no question in my mind that the law as laid down by the Appellate Court includes what's shown in that picture as a stone wall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court modified the judgment whereby they were ordered to remove the stone wall. \"A modification is [a] change; an alteration or amendment which introduces new elements into the details, or cancels some of them, but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact.... In contrast, an order effectuating an existing judgment allows the court to protect the integrity of its original ruling by ensuring the parties' timely compliance therewith.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cords\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485146\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/778/#p484\">\n    165 Conn.App. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485146\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/778/#p484\">\n    139 A.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The substance of the defendants' claim is that the stone wall that replaced the wall they were ordered to remove is not permanently affixed to the land.
