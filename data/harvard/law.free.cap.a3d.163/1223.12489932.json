Prior to trial, the respondent,\n   the Commissioner of Correction, filed a motion in limine to preclude the petitioner from introducing testimony from the jurors in his criminal trial regarding their deliberative process. The habeas court granted that motion and subsequently denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration. At the habeas trial, the petitioner testified on his own behalf and presented testimony from Attorney Leon Kaatz, an expert in criminal defense practice. Attorney St. John testified for the respondent. The habeas court denied the petitioner's second amended petition in a\n   memorandum of decision dated December 18, 2014. Following the granting of certification to appeal, this appeal followed.

In support of this claim, the petitioner argues (1) that Attorney St. John was ineffective because, during voir dire, he neglected to ask any of the potential jurors whether they or someone close to them had been the victim of sexual assault; (2) that Attorney St. John was ineffective because he failed to request a more searching inquiry into potential juror bias or misconduct after a juror raised concerns about another juror's \"personal past\" during deliberations; and (3) that the habeas court improperly granted the\n   respondent's motion in limine precluding him from calling the jurors as witnesses in his habeas trial to establish that juror bias existed and prejudiced him in his criminal trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address each of these arguments in turn.\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The petitioner first contends that Attorney St. John rendered ineffective assistance during voir dire because he failed to ask potential jurors whether they or someone close to them had been a victim of sexual assault. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The record discloses the following facts. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Prescott, J\n   </em>\n   ., conducted jury selection from April 17 through April 19, 2006. At the start of each day, prior to the commencement of individual voir dire questioning, Judge Prescott informed each of the venire panels that the purpose of voir dire was to ascertain each prospective juror's ability to be impartial, instructed the panel to answer questions accurately and to the best of their ability, and posed an array of preliminary questions to the panels, including: \"Have you had any life experiences that in any way relate to the charges in this case that might prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror? Do you have any bias or prejudices that could in any way come into play in sitting on this case?\" Several members of the venire responded affirmatively to these preliminary questions and were ultimately excused for cause following individual voir dire because either they or their close friend or family member had been the victim of sexual assault. This is an indication in the record that Judge Prescott's preliminary questions were adequate to deal with any bias or prejudice that the prospective jurors may have had because either they or persons close to them had been victimized by sexual assault crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   None of the six venire members ultimately selected as jurors responded affirmatively to any of Judge Prescott's preliminary questions. The six prospective jurors then appeared before Judge Prescott, the prosecutor, and Attorney St. John for individual voir dire. Judge\n   Prescott began each examination by asking the prospective juror whether he or she was aware of anything that they thought might affect their ability to be fair and impartial. Each prospective juror responded in the negative. One prospective juror, V.B.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated in\n   response to a subsequent question from Judge Prescott that she had \"trouble\" with the nature of the charges, but stated she could nonetheless be fair and impartial. Attorney St. John asked V.B. whether there was \"any kind of a barrier to [her] being able to be a fair and impartial juror,\" to which V.B. responded that she believed she would be fair. Attorney St. John further asked V.B. if there was anything else the court and counsel should know that might impact her ability to be fair and impartial, and V.B. answered that she had lost a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Another prospective juror, J.B., informed Judge Prescott that she was \"a little partial to the sexual offenses\" because, given her training and work as a nurse, she tended to be more of a victim advocate. She indicated, however, that she would try to be fair. The prosecutor elicited from J.B. that, other than a patient she encountered at work, she had never known anyone who had been the victim of sexual assault. The four other prospective jurors were all asked, by Attorney St. John, the prosecutor or both of them, whether the nature of the charges or anything else impacted their ability to be impartial, and none of them raised concerns about past experiences with sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his habeas petition, the petitioner alleged that Attorney St. John provided ineffective assistance by failing to ask the jurors whether they had been the victim of sexual assault, which resulted in the empanelment of a juror who was biased against persons\n   accused of sexual assault crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court found that Attorney St. John's failure to pose this specific question did not amount to deficient performance because he and the prosecutor had \"cover[ed] the same territory\" by asking the jurors whether anything about the charges or their life experiences impacted their impartiality. The habeas court concluded that, under these circumstances, the failure to specifically ask whether the jurors had been a victim of sexual assault, \"using those exact words, was inconsequential.\" We discern no error in that reasoning on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Jury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20772\">\n    163 Conn.App. 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20105\">\n    137 A.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20905\">\n    321 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201273\">\n    136 A.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

Although Attorney St. John did not ask the prospective jurors the specific question of whether they or someone close to them had been the victim of sexual assault, the voir dire process as a whole adequately covered those subjects. Judge Prescott, in his preliminary questions, asked the members of each venire panel whether they had any \"life experiences\" or \"bias or prejudices\" that might color their ability to return a fair and impartial verdict. Attorney St. John and the prosecutor then asked each juror individually whether they knew of anything that might impact their impartiality. None of the jurors identified anything of concern, and each expressed confidence she or he could be impartial. Attorney St. John's failure to ask a specific question that would have been largely cumulative of other questions does not render his performance deficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we\n   have stated, attorneys need not question jurors in any particular manner to be effective.\n   Accordingly, the petitioner's claim fails to satisfy the performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ; we need not reach the issue of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The petitioner further argues, without analysis, that Attorney St. John should have \"asked that [J.B.] be excused for cause or should have exercised a peremptory challenge.\" To the extent the petitioner is attempting to raise a distinct claim of ineffective assistance, we disagree.

This deference soundly recognizes that a trial attorney is in the best position to determine whether a particular venireperson can fairly hear his client's cause. Here, J.B. repeatedly indicated that, despite her training and work as a nurse, she would try to be fair and had never known anyone who had been the victim of sexual assault.

The following morning, on May 16, 2006, Judge Cremins\n   brought one of the jurors, L.B., into the courtroom because she had \"expressed a concern.\" The following exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The Court: If the concern is something not related to deliberations, I want you to tell me what that is.

L.B. returned to the courtroom, and the court informed her that it would not inquire any further into her concern and instructed her to continue in the deliberations. The jury returned a guilty verdict the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In his habeas petition, the petitioner alleged that L.B. had been referring to a female juror who previously had been the victim of sexual assault, and that Attorney St. John rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a more searching inquiry into the potential bias. The habeas court rejected this claim, concluding that it was pure speculation to suppose that L.B. had been referring to a juror who had been the victim of sexual assault, especially in light of each of the jurors' representations during voir dire that none of her or his past experiences impacted her or his ability to be fair and impartial.

As an initial matter, we note that the petitioner made little effort at the habeas trial to overcome the presumption that Attorney St. John's decision not to pursue further questioning of L.B. was based upon reasonable professional judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20664\">\n    306 Conn. at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20948\">\n    51 A.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner did not question Attorney St. John about it, nor did he elicit an opinion from Attorney Kaatz about whether the response was constitutionally adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In any event, our review of the record convinces us that, under the circumstances, Attorney St. John's decision that further inquiry was unnecessary was not objectively unreasonable. L.B. explained during her brief colloquy with Judge Cremins that she was concerned about an unnamed female juror's \"personal past\" and how it \"might relate\" to deliberations. Attorney St. John was not required to infer from these statements that the jury's deliberations were infected by actual bias or misconduct. Rather, L.B.'s statements could easily have been construed as suggesting merely that the unnamed juror's past experiences had informed her understanding of the case, which is entirely proper. \"[J]urors ... are not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experiences, but rather, to apply them to the facts as presented to arrive at an intelligent and correct conclusion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warholic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665956\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/354/#p365\">\n    278 Conn. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20A.2d%20569\">\n    897 A.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Indeed, Attorney St. John stated following the colloquy that he believed a further investigation was unnecessary because \"when [jurors] come into this building ... they bring their life experiences with them, and they bring those life experiences so they can utilize that in terms of judging credibility of witnesses.\" Attorney St. John cannot have performed deficiently for failing to\n   investigate statements that he reasonably interpreted to be innocuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We certainly do not agree with the petitioner's argument that L.B.'s reference to the female juror's \"personal past\" should have alerted Attorney St. John to the fact that the juror had been the victim of sexual assault and was therefore biased. L.B.'s statements did not suggest that any of the jurors had been the victim of a crime, and even if they did, a juror's status as a victim or concealment of information during voir dire does not mean that the juror cannot be impartial. \"It is actual bias, rather than bias that is implied on the basis of a juror's status [as a victim] or on the basis of a juror's dishonesty during voir dire, that is dispositive in raising a claim of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104024\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/683/#p689\">\n    244 Conn. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20A.2d%20704\">\n    711 A.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).

During the petitioner's criminal trial, the state introduced testimony from three constancy of accusation witnesses, T, B, and S, who each testified about their conversations with the victim in early 2004 in which the victim reported that she had been sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by the petitioner. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Antwon W\n   </em>\n   ., supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057527\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/118/180/#p181\">\n    118 Conn.App. at 193-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20A.2d%201112\">\n    982 A.2d 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prior to the testimony of T, Judge Cremins\n   instructed the jury as follows: \"Ladies and gentlemen, before this testimony begins, I want to explain a couple of things to you. There are times when evidence is admitted for a limited purpose. You can use it for one purpose, but you can't use it for another purpose. The testimony here is going to be one of those situations. So, I want to tell you, at this point, the purpose for which you can use the testimony that [T] is about to give.\n   <em>\n    The evidence by this witness is admitted solely to corroborate or not corroborate the complainant's testimony in court.

Judge Cremins repeated a similar limiting instruction before B and S testified, and again after S testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After the close of evidence, Judge Cremins charged the jury, in relevant part, as follows: \"Constancy of accusation. The complainant testified here in court before you. Her testimony in court you may use as evidence and proof of the facts asserted in that testimony and give it the weight you find is reasonable. The state offered evidence of out-of-court statements made by the complainant to other persons that the [petitioner] sexually assaulted her.

The habeas court rejected this claim, finding that the petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. The habeas court ruled that, even if the instructions suggested that the constancy of accusation testimony could be used to corroborate the victim's testimony as to matters beyond the mere fact and timing of her complaint, any overbreadth \"was very minor and insubstantial, considering all the other evidence in this case, and had no discernible effect on the jury's deliberations.\" The habeas court further found that the constancy of accusation evidence was properly limited to only those details necessary to associate the victim's reports to the charged assaults, and that the instructions \"played no role in persuading the jurors to accept or reject the victim's accusations against the petitioner ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that the jury instructions did not prejudice him. He argues that the language, repeated in each instruction, that the evidence was admitted to \"corroborate or not corroborate the victim's testimony in court\" encouraged the jury to consider the evidence for substantive purposes, in violation of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200303\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/284/\">\n    237 Conn. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court concluded that constancy of accusation witnesses \"may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim's complaint; any testimony by the\n   witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim's complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator\n   ....

Attorney St. John attempted to impeach the victim's credibility by emphasizing that she did not report the assaults until months after they allegedly occurred, and had struggled to recall certain details surrounding the assaults. The victim's inability to recall extended only to minor details, however, and her statement to the police, which was admitted into evidence without limitation as a full exhibit, showed that she remained consistent with regard to the details of the assaults themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   More significantly, substantial evidence corroborated the victim's testimony that she delayed in reporting the assaults not because she had fabricated them, but because she was afraid of the petitioner and thought that the assaults were her fault. Diane Edell, a clinical social worker and expert in the field of child sexual\n   abuse, testified that child victims do not typically disclose their abuse immediately, but, rather, do so reluctantly and incrementally, often after a significant passage of time. This dynamic is especially prevalent, Edell explained, where the victim's assailant is a close family member, because the victim retains a sense of loyalty toward the assailant and does not want to get them into trouble. Consistent with the testimony of the victim and Edell, T and S testified that the victim was crying and seemed reluctant and afraid to tell them about the assaults.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sara Kasper, the physician who treated the victim after she reported the assaults to the police, testified that the victim identified her \"cousin\" as the person who assaulted her and became emotional when discussing the details of the abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   B also testified that, during the summer of 2003-when the assaults were still ongoing-the victim indicated that she was frightened of the petitioner and was afraid to visit her uncle's house if the petitioner were there. B recalled one occasion during that time period when, while bringing the victim to her uncle's house, the victim started to cry after learning that the petitioner would be there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, the state's case against the petitioner was strong even without the constancy of accusation evidence because the credibility of the victim's testimony was bolstered by independent sources.

He then sets forth numerous paragraphs of case law discussing the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   performance standard in the context of cross-examinations. The petitioner makes no attempt, however, to analyze how Attorney St. John's cross-examination or impeachment of the victim fell below the objective standard of reasonableness. He does not identify any subject matter that Attorney St. John could have explored but failed to explore. The only substantive discussion concerns Attorney St. John's failure to object to evidence adduced by the prosecutor during the victim's direct examination, an entirely distinct theory of ineffective assistance. The petitioner's claim as it relates to inadequate cross-examination is entirely unsupported by analysis or citation to the record. Accordingly, we decline to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The petitioner's next claim is that Attorney St. John rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to provide the petitioner with adequate legal advice regarding whether to accept the state's plea offers. Specifically, he claims that Attorney St. John failed to \"render any advice, candid or otherwise, that [the petitioner] should accept any [plea] offers made.\" A careful review of the petitioner's brief, however, reveals that his claim on appeal relates solely to the performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , whereas the habeas court rejected this claim of ineffective assistance on the basis of the prejudice prong. Crediting Attorney St. John's testimony that the petitioner expressed a \"strong desire\" to have the jury decide the case, the habeas court concluded that the petitioner\n   failed to demonstrate that he would have accepted any plea offer had Attorney St. John recommended that he do so. Because the petitioner has not\n   challenged the habeas court's finding with regard to prejudice, he cannot prevail on this claim.

The first concerns a witness, D, whom the petitioner claims could have impeached part of the victim's testimony. The habeas court correctly found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice with regard to this claim because D did not testify at the habeas trial. This court has explained that the failure to elicit testimony in the habeas court from allegedly exculpatory witnesses precludes a finding of prejudice because \"[w]ithout their testimony, the habeas court [cannot] evaluate them as witnesses, nor [can] it assess the import of their testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244942\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/129/188/#p194\">\n    129 Conn.App. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20A.3d%20705\">\n    19 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174762,12174722,12174741\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/901/\">\n    303 Conn. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201177\">\n    31 A.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065031\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/116/663/#p668\">\n    116 Conn.App. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20A.2d%201282\">\n    975 A.2d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (petitioner failed to show prejudice where only testimony at habeas trial regarding exculpatory witness came from petitioner), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147608,4146425,4148204\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/930/\">\n    293 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20916\">\n    980 A.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The petitioner also argues that Attorney St. John failed to investigate a third party culpability witness who he refers to as \"Tootsie.\" Although the petitioner testified about this witness at the habeas trial and mentioned the issue in his posttrial brief, the petitioner failed to specifically allege the failure to call this witness in his second amended habeas petition.

Accordingly, the court ordered that the petitioner's conviction of the three counts of sexual assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2) be dismissed and that the sentences imposed on that conviction be vacated.

The court,\n    <em>\n     Fasano, J\n    </em>\n    ., denied that motion on December 9, 2015, reasoning that the sentencing court did not rely on any of the vacated charges in imposing the petitioner's sentence.

In rejecting that claim, this court explained: \"The constancy of accusation doctrine traces its roots to the common-law concept of 'hue and cry' whereby victims of violent crime were expected to cry out immediately and alert their neighbors that they had been violently assaulted.... In the context of sexual assault, evidence of a victim's 'hue and cry' was 'a necessary prerequisite for a court to hear a rape case' such that a woman who had not so complained could not have her case prosecuted. ... Until 1974 in Connecticut, the state was required to offer evidence corroborating a victim's claims to obtain a conviction for sexual assault. See, e.g., General Statutes (Rev. to 1969) \u00a7 53a-68, which concerned certain sexual offenses and provided in relevant part: 'A person shall not be convicted of any offense under this part, or of an attempt to commit such offense, solely on the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged victim, except as hereinafter provided. Corroboration may be circumstantial ....' The General Assembly repealed this requirement of corroboration in Public Acts 1974, No. 74-131. Despite the repeal of the corroboration requirement, in cases such as the present one, the state often seeks to offer evidence corroborating the victim's complaint of sexual abuse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    \"In\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Troupe,\n    </em>\n    supra, 237 Conn. at 293-306,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n     677 A.2d 917\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , our Supreme Court reviewed the state of the constancy of accusation doctrine from the common law to the present, reaffirming its basic elements. The court acknowledged that the necessity of the doctrine is to counter the 'unwarranted, but nonetheless persistent, view that a sexual assault victim who does not report the crime cannot be trusted to testify truthfully about the incident.' Id., at 303,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n     677 A.2d 917\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court detailed the rule, concluding that 'a person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim's complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim's complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator.... Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim's testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported.'

The testimony of T, B and S was preceded by the victim's testimony covering the facts of the assaults and the persons to whom she had reported them. The constancy witnesses' testimony regarding the victim's out-of-court statements properly was limited to the fact that the victim had complained, the timing of each complaint and necessary details connecting the complaints to the assaults. Importantly, the testimony contained no extraneous details of the assaults, and it pertained only to the approximate time and place the assaults had occurred and the defendant's identity as the perpetrator.
