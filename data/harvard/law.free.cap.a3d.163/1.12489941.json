Fundamentally, we are called upon to determine whether the defendant's speech is protected under the first amendment to the United States constitution or, rather, constitutes criminal conduct that a civilized and orderly society may punish through incarceration. The distinction has profound consequences in our constitutional republic. \"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the [f]irst [a]mendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214891\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/397/#p414\">\n    491 U.S. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214891\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/397/#p414\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214891\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/397/#p414\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Only certain types of narrowly defined speech are not afforded the full protections of the first amendment, including \"fighting words,\" i.e., those words that \"have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    315 U.S. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    62 S.Ct. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    86 L.Ed. 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942).

Because the words spoken by the defendant were not likely to provoke a violent response under the circumstances in which they were uttered, they cannot be proscribed\n   consistent with the first amendment. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of September 30, 2013, the defendant telephoned the Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in Vernon to announce that she was coming to pick up a Western Union money transfer so they would not close the customer service desk before she arrived. The defendant spoke with Tara Freeman, an experienced assistant store manager who was in charge of the daily operations at the supermarket, which spanned approximately 65,000 square feet. Freeman informed the defendant that the customer service desk already had closed and that she was unable to access the computer that processed Western Union transactions. The defendant became belligerent, responded that she \"really didn't give a shit,\" and called Freeman \"[p]retty much every swear word you can think of\" before the call was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite Freeman's statements to the contrary, the defendant believed that as long as she arrived at the supermarket before 10 p.m., she should be able to obtain the money transfer before the customer service desk closed. Accordingly, a few minutes after she telephoned, the defendant arrived at the supermarket, which was occupied by customers and employees. The defendant proceeded toward the customer service desk located in proximity to the registers for grocery check-out and began filling out a money transfer form, even though the lights at the desk were off. Freeman approached the defendant, a forty year old woman who used a cane due to a medical condition that caused severe swelling in her lower extremities, and asked her\n   if she was the person who had called a few minutes earlier. Although the defendant denied that she had called, Freeman recognized her voice. After Freeman informed the defendant, as she had during the telephone call, that the customer service desk was closed, the defendant became angry and asked to speak with a manager. Freeman replied that she was the manager and pointed to her name tag and a photograph on the wall to confirm her status. Some employees, including the head of the cashier department, Sarah Luce, were standing nearby as this exchange took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant proceeded to loudly call Freeman a \"fat ugly bitch\" and a \"cunt,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and said \"fuck you, you're not a manager,\" all while gesticulating with her cane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite the defendant's crude and angry expressions directed at her, Freeman remained professional. She simply responded, \"[h]ave a good night,\" which prompted the defendant to leave the supermarket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace in the second degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of that charge and sentenced to twenty-five days incarceration. The defendant appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199(c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of breach of\n   the peace in the second degree because the words she uttered to Freeman did not constitute fighting words. Although the defendant asserts that her speech is protected under the first amendment to the federal constitution, her principal argument is that we should construe article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, of the Connecticut constitution to provide greater free speech protection than the first amendment so as to limit the fighting words exception to express invitations to fight. We conclude that it is unnecessary to decide whether the state constitution would afford greater protection because the evidence was plainly insufficient to support the defendant's conviction under settled federal constitutional jurisprudence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court has not considered the scope and application of the fighting words exception for more than two decades. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200416\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/613/\">\n    237 Conn. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to consider the exception's roots and its scope in light of more recent jurisprudential and societal developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The fighting words exception was first articulated in the seminal case of\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    315 U.S. at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    62 S.Ct. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After noting that the right of free speech is not absolute, the United States Supreme Court broadly observed: \"There are certain well-defined and\n   narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any [c]onstitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words-those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate\n   breach of the peace.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    Id., at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p573\">\n    62 S.Ct. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unlike George Carlin's classic 1972 comedic monologue, \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is well settled that there are no per se fighting words.

We begin with the fact that the confrontation in the supermarket did not happen in a vacuum; it was preceded by a telephone call in which the defendant was belligerent and used\n   many of the \"swear word[s]\" that she would later say to Freeman in person. After the defendant arrived at the supermarket a few minutes later, Freeman correctly surmised that she was the woman who had just called. Consequently, when Freeman approached the defendant to reiterate a message that she knew the defendant did not want to hear, Freeman reasonably would have been aware of the possibility that a similar barrage of insults, however unwarranted, would be directed at her. Freeman's position of authority at the supermarket, however, placed her in a role in which she had to approach the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition, as the store manager on duty, Freeman was charged with handling customer service matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant's angry words were an obvious expression of frustration at not being able to obtain services to which she thought she was entitled. Store managers are routinely confronted by disappointed, frustrated customers who express themselves in angry terms, although not always as crude as those used by the defendant. People in authoritative positions of management and control are expected to diffuse hostile situations, if not for the sake of the store's relationship with that particular customer, then for the sake of other customers milling about the store. Indeed, as the manager in charge of a large supermarket, Freeman would be expected to model appropriate, responsive behavior, aimed at deescalating the situation, for her subordinates, at least one of whom was observing the exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Significantly, as a store manager, Freeman would have had a degree of control over the premises where the confrontation took place. An average store manager would know as she approached the defendant that, if the defendant became abusive, the manager could demand that the defendant leave the premises, threaten to have her arrested for trespassing if she failed to comply, and make good on that threat if the defendant still refused to leave. With such lawful self-help tools at her disposal and the expectations attendant to her position, it does not appear reasonably likely that Freeman was at risk of losing control over the confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We recognize that a different conclusion might be warranted if the defendant directed the same words at Freeman after Freeman ended her work day and left the supermarket, depending on the circumstances presented. Given the totality of the circumstances in the present case, however, it would be unlikely for an on duty store manager in Freeman's position to respond in kind to the defendant's angry diatribe with similar expletives. It would be considerably more unlikely for a person in Freeman's position, in the circumstances\n   presented, to respond with a physical act of violence. Indeed, in keeping with the expectations attendant to her position and the circumstances with which she was confronted, Freeman did not respond with profanity, much less with violence, toward the defendant. Instead, she terminated the conversation before it could escalate further with the simple words, \"Have a good night.\" Although the reaction of the addressee is not dispositive; see\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529419\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/684/714/#p718\">\n    684 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   718-19 ; it is probative of the likelihood of a violent reaction. See\n   <em>\n    Klen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Loveland\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050269\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/498/#p510\">\n    661 F.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he reaction of actual hearers of the words constitutes significant probative evidence concerning whether the speech was inherently likely to cause a violent reaction\");\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Camby\n   </em>\n   , supra, 104 Wn.2d at 54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=701%20P.2d%20499\">\n    701 P.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the addressee's reaction or failure to react is not the sole criteria, but is a factor to be considered in evaluating the actual situation in which the words were spoken\"). There is no reason to believe that Freeman's reaction was uncharacteristic of\n   a reasonable professional in a like situation. Therefore, on the basis of our independent review of the record, we cannot conclude that an average store manager in Freeman's position would have responded to the defendant's remarks with imminent violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nonetheless, the state contends that \"courts in sister states and in Connecticut have found comparable abusive epithets to constitute 'fighting words' where they have been directed at police officers who, because they are 'properly trained,' 'may reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen,' \" quoting this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200416\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/613/\">\n    237 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   620 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as one such example. We disagree that this case law is sufficiently relevant or persuasive. We observe that all of the cases cited were decided two or three decades ago, and therefore do not consider case law recognizing that public sensitivities have been dulled to some extent by the\n   devolution of discourse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   , a case not involving words directed at a police officer, although there are superficial factual similarities to the present case in that the expletive fuck you was directed at an employee of a Stop &amp; Shop supermarket;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    id., at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4373960\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/67/608/\">\n    680 P.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; that is where the similarities end. Significantly, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   pointed to a \"heated exchange\" that had ensued between the store detective and the defendant after the former accused the latter of shoplifting and to a threatening remark directed to the store detective as part of the \"cumulative\" evidence supporting the application of the fighting words exception.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4373960\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/67/608/\">\n    Id., at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4373960\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/67/608/\">\n    680 P.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the majority's conclusion in that case is consistent with others that considered whether the words at issue were preceded by a hostile exchange or accompanied by aggressive behavior when determining the likelihood of a violent reaction.

Indeed, precisely for these reasons, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   was convicted under a different subdivision of the breach of the peace statute than the one at issue in the present case; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 614,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; requiring the defendant to have engaged \"in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181(a)(1).\n   Insofar as there is dictum in a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   suggesting that, in order for the heightened expectation of restraint applicable to police officers to apply to another type of addressee, the addressee must have received the same level of training as that of a police officer; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200416\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/613/\">\n    237 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   620 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we need not consider the propriety of that conclusion. We do not rest our decision on the nature of the training received by the average supermarket manager; rather, we focus on\n   the expectations attendant to such positions under the particular circumstances of the present case. We observe that the court in\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   recognized that it did not have the benefit of briefing on this issue, as the defendant had made no such claim. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We further observe that the court in\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   relied on the actual training afforded to the particular store detective, a focus that appears to be in tension with the established objective standard of the average listener in the addressee's position. Cf.\n   <em>\n    In re Nickolas S.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754642\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/182/#p188\">\n    226 Ariz. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754642\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/182/#p188\">\n    245 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering how ordinary teacher would respond to insults from student in classroom setting). Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   does not dictate a contrary conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the natural reaction of an average person in Freeman's position who is confronted with a customer's profane outburst, unaccompanied by any threats, would not be to strike her. We do not intend to suggest that words directed at a store manager will never constitute fighting words. Rather, we simply hold that under these circumstances the defendant's vulgar insults would not be likely to provoke violent retaliation. Because the defendant's speech does not fall within the narrow category of unprotected fighting words, her conviction of breach of the peace in the second degree on the basis of pure speech constitutes a violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, ROBINSON and D'AURIA, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   EVELEIGH, J., with whom ROGERS, C.

In my view,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200416\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/613/\">\n    237 Conn. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%20473\">\n    678 A.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), is binding on this court. Indeed, the facts underlying present case, in my view, provide even stronger support for a breach of peace conviction. Furthermore, the defendant, Nina C. Baccala, represented to this court in her brief that she \"does not ... challenge ... the scope of the fighting words exception under the first amendment.\" We should take her at her word. While I acknowledge that the defendant has argued that this court should do its own analysis under the first amendment, she never retracted this position. The briefing was cast in the light of a claim that our state constitution provided greater protection than the federal constitution and, accordingly, contained an analysis pursuant to this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546505\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/672/#p684\">\n    222 Conn. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684-86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201225\">\n    610 A.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The majority does not deem such an analysis necessary in view of its position that the first amendment controls. I am of the opinion that the briefing of this issue was woefully inadequate for a constitutional claim. Therefore, I would not have reached that issue. Further, after conducting an analysis under\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   , I would conclude that our state constitution does not afford greater protection then the federal constitution. In the final section, I agree with the defendant that the charge was not sufficient on the issue of imminence and, therefore, I\n   would reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   FIRST AMENDMENT ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of September\n   30, 2013, the defendant drove to a grocery store in Vernon with the intention of retrieving a money transfer. Prior to arriving at the store, the defendant phoned ahead to inquire whether she would be able to retrieve the money transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After arriving at the store, the defendant proceeded to the service desk where she began to fill out a money transfer form. Tara Freeman, an assistant manager at the store, approached the defendant and informed her that she would be unable to retrieve her money transfer because she lacked the authority to access the money transfer machine. The defendant became very upset and asked to speak to the manager. Freeman replied that she was the manager, pointing to her name tag and picture on the wall as proof. At this point, the defendant became belligerent, raised her cane toward Freeman,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and began directing every swear word \"in the book\" at Freeman. The defendant said \"fuck you\" to Freeman, stated that Freeman was not the manager, and called\n   Freeman a \"fat ugly bitch\" and a \"cunt.\" The defendant, who did not substantially controvert this account of her tirade,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that she directed such language at Freeman because she felt hurt as a result of purportedly being misled about the availability of money order services and \"was trying to hurt back.\" Freeman replied by saying \"have a good night\" to the defendant, who responded by mumbling and saying some \"choice words\" as she departed the store. The entire encounter lasted between fifteen and twenty minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After an investigation by the police, the defendant was arrested and charged with, inter alia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181(a)(5).

The defendant said \"fuck you\" to Freeman and called her a \"fat ugly bitch.\" The defendant also used the word \"cunt,\" which is generally recognized as a powerful, offensive, and vile term.

When the abusive language is directed to a particular person, the level of\n   outrage certain words are likely to engender is correlated to how insulting certain words are to that person. Language that targets certain personal attributes that have served as bases for subjugation and dehumanization when directed to individuals with those attributes is among the most harmful.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Powell once suggested that \"a properly trained officer\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen, and thus be less likely to respond belligerently to fighting words.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172554\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/130/#p135\">\n    415 U.S. 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172554\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/130/#p135\">\n    94 S.Ct. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172554\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/130/#p135\">\n    39 L.Ed.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974).

Ideally, no one would ever respond to abusive speech with violence especially given the likelihood of criminal, professional, or other collateral consequences that could result from violent conduct. Nevertheless, fighting words are so pernicious that they tend to provoke an ordinary person to respond viscerally to scathing insults in a manner that is invariably irrational-that is, with violence. For this reason, a post hoc analysis of the circumstances of the addressee will not accurately\n   reflect whether an ordinary person would reflexively respond with some degree of violence\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a defendant's abusive language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is simply no evidence in the record regarding what the average store manager knows or does not know.

The majority further concludes that \"it would be unlikely for an on duty store manager in Freeman's position to respond in kind to the defendant's angry diatribe with similar expletives\" and that \"[i]t would be considerably more unlikely for a person in Freeman's position ... to respond with a physical act of violence.\" It is interesting that the jury in the present case found precisely what the majority deems so unlikely. This is a new test for fighting words directed at the position of the person to whom the words are directed. The United States Supreme Court has not gone this far. In view of the fact that this matter is analyzed under the first amendment, I would follow the case law of the United States Supreme Court and require that the test be restricted to that of the average person.

The state claims that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction because the defendant's abusive epithets were likely to provoke an ordinary person to respond with immediate violence. The defendant, however, rested her entire sufficiency of the evidence claim on her position that the state constitution protected the defendant's speech because she did not expressly challenge Freeman to a fight. Indeed, the defendant expressly represented that she \"does not ... challenge ... the scope of the fighting words exception under the first amendment.\" Thereafter, in a mere footnote, the defendant indicates that she \"does not concede\" that her speech was unprotected by the first amendment and claims that we must analyze the sufficiency of the evidence under the first amendment standard if that standard is adopted as a matter of state constitutional law. The defendant, however, does not provide such an analysis herself. Similarly, in her reply brief, the defendant claims, without citing a single case, that whether her speech is protected in this case is based on whether an ordinary store manager, rather than an ordinary person, would have responded with immediate violence. Because the defendant has failed to adequately brief the issue of whether the evidence in this case is sufficient under the federal fighting words standard, I would decline to address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"We repeatedly have stated that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief....

See\n   <em>\n    Cologne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westfarms Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684502\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/48/\">\n    192 Conn. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=469%20A.2d%201201\">\n    469 A.2d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, this court has interpreted the text of \u00a7 4 to permit punishment, within certain bounds, of abuse of the freedom of speech. Additionally, the text of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 in no way suggests that the legislature's authority to punish abuses of expressive liberties was limited to then prevailing statutory criminal law. Thus, while the language of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 provides for broader protection than afforded under the federal constitution, the language of \u00a7 4 more directly pertains to the state's authority to punish the abuse of expressive liberties. Accordingly, I find that the text of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 does not support the\n   defendant's position that our state constitution defines the concept fighting words more narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I turn next to historical analysis to further clarify the scope of the state's expressive rights protections. The historical analysis is the central focus of the defendant's constitutional claim. She advances the theory that the only exceptions to the broad expressive rights protections afforded by the Connecticut constitution are those extant at the time of the ratification of the Connecticut constitution in 1818, and that there was no statute proscribing profane name calling at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result,\n   according to the defendant, in light of the statutory law at the time of ratification, the state may only punish abusive language that includes a challenge to fight. The state, on other hand, points to preconstitutional records\n   that, in very general terms, support the qualified character of the civil liberties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's contention, ratification era constitutional law is not the sole source of state constitutional principles. Indeed, the common law provides valuable insight to inform our understanding of constitutional principles. See E. Peters, \"Common Law Antecedents of Constitutional Law in Connecticut,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Alb.%20L.%20Rev.%20259\">\n    53 Alb. L.

Just as the precepts of the common law influence the style of constitutional adjudication in common law courts, so common law case law itself is part of our 'usable past.' \" [Footnote omitted.] ). In 1828, this court observed that when a person sends a letter containing \"abusive language\" to another person, it was \"an indictable offence, because it tends to a breach of the peace.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6753471\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/7/266/#p269\">\n    7 Conn. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (1828).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that, while the letter would not constitute libel because it was not published to a third party, it was \"clearly an offence of a public nature, and punishable as such, as it tends to create ill-blood, and cause a disturbance of the public peace.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6753471\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/7/266/#p269\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This common law offense originated in England where it was observed that sending an \"infamous\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   letter to another person constituted an \"offense to the King, and is a great motive to revenge, and tends to the breaking of the peace ....\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wooton\n   </em>\n   , 77 Eng.

The defendant correctly points out that this court previously has recognized that \"our\n   constitution's speech provisions reflect a unique historical experience and a move toward enhanced civil liberties, particularly those liberties designed to foster individuality. ... This historical background indicates that the framers of our constitution contemplated vibrant public speech, and a minimum of governmental interference ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Trusz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    UBS Realty Investors, LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20175\">\n    319 Conn. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%201212\">\n    123 A.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this broad observation about the historical context in which the declaration of rights was adopted does not support any particular analytic framework for delineating the scope of expressive rights doctrine, let alone the one advanced by the defendant. In sum, there is no basis for the 1818 code alone to serve as the lodestar of present day state constitutional expressive rights doctrine. Accordingly, I find this factor supports the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I next turn to the state precedents factor of the\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   analysis.

Rather than looking to the substantive criminal law extant at the time of ratification of the state constitution in 1818 to determine the validity of this more recent statutory offense as the defendant urges, Justice Hamersley relied on the broader principles of expressive liberty to sustain the statute.

The defendant asserts that the fighting words doctrine reflects an archaic conception of honor according to which it is normative for ordinary people to respond to name calling with violence. Additionally, the defendant claims that the Connecticut citizenry is generally peaceable, relying principally upon the state's relatively low incidence of assault for support. In addition, the defendant claims that the fighting words doctrine presents a shifting standard that is ascertained by the \"unpredictable\" determinations of judges and juries. The state responds that the defendant has failed to sever the connection between abusive language and the likelihood of immediate violence because the statistics she cites do not shed light on the precipitating circumstances of the assaults. Finally, the state claims that the question of whether fighting words actually lead to violent responses is best left to the legislature. I conclude that the fighting words doctrine is consonant with the public policy of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   To begin with, abusive language and epithets are not entirely harmless expression. Indeed, there is certain speech that does more than just offend sensibilities or merely cause someone to bristle. One commentator has\n   observed the following\n   about abusive language: \"Often a speaker consciously sets out to wound and humiliate a listener. He aims to make the other feel degraded and hated, and chooses words to achieve that effect. In what they accomplish, insults of this sort are a form of psychic assault; they do not differ much from physical assaults, like slaps or pinches, that cause no real physical hurt. Usually, the speaker believes the listener possesses the characteristics that are indicated by his humiliating and wounding remarks, but the speaker selects the most abusive form of expression to impose the maximum hurt. His aim diminishes the expressive importance of the words.\" (Footnotes omitted.) K.

This argument has received some traction, principally among commentators. See, e.g., B. Caine, \"The Trouble with 'Fighting Words,' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"448\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Marq.%20L.%20Rev.%20441\">\n    88 Marq. L.

First, as the state points out, the defendant has not severed the connection between abusive language, including epithets, and violence. The assault statistics provided by the defendant shed no light on the precipitating circumstances of the assault cases. In any case, the fighting words doctrine, by requiring the jury to determine whether an\n   <em>\n    ordinary person\n   </em>\n   would respond to the abusive language with immediate violence, already contemplates a fluid community standard for fighting words that naturally includes the extent to which the people of this state are peaceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Ultimately, I conclude that the fighting words doctrine strikes the appropriate balance. It permits the state to regulate\n   speech that is so abusive and hurtful that it will provoke an immediate violent response, while protecting harsh, but less hurtful speech that has cognizable expressive value. The consequence of limiting the\n   fighting words doctrine to the extent advanced by the defendant would be to protect degrading speech that has the recognized effect of causing palpable impact-enough impact to provoke the listener to immediate violence-in order to preserve, at most, such speech's practical utility as emotive expression. In other words, fighting words are not constitutionally protected merely because they could be used as a tool to express how strongly a speaker feels about an idea or belief. Accordingly, I find that the public policy factor favors the state's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   G\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In resolving this issue, I conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   factors do not support the theory advanced by the defendant. This state's constitution expressly contemplates holding a citizen responsible for the abuse of expressive liberty. See Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4. As previously discussed in this concurring and dissenting opinion, this state has historically embraced a civil libertarian philosophy that is permissive of government regulation of the abuse of expressive liberties when such abuse tends toward a breach of the peace. The defendant has not advanced a persuasive theory to adopt a historical exception approach to delineating the scope of expressive liberties. Moreover, while there was no statute criminalizing fighting words at the time the Connecticut constitution was ratified, common law principles embraced punishing such abusive language. The defendant's reliance on Oregon case law is unpersuasive because that state employs a different analytic framework to delineate the scope of expressive rights. Also, federal precedents demonstrate that the fighting words doctrine draws its essence from Connecticut law, further supporting a conclusion that protection in this area is coextensive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finally, the public policy factor does not demand additional protection for fighting words. I acknowledge that \"[t]he Connecticut constitution is an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"561267\" index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/209/98/#p115\">\n    209 Conn. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%2010\">\n    547 A.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). This progressive principle surely counsels against an interpretation that seeks to apply the mores and norms of yesteryear to modern constitutional law. To be sure, our society's discourse has become progressively coarser. This does not mean, however, that this state's constitution should be converted into a license to gratuitously inflict psychic injury and push people to their limits. The present case makes this point crystal clear. The defendant testified that she\n   did not believe that her tirade would achieve her original goal of retrieving the money transfer. To the contrary, she explained that she felt hurt by the fact that she was purportedly misled about her ability to retrieve the money transfer and she wanted to hurt Freeman back. Perhaps implicit in her purposely hurtful speech was an emotive expression-the strength of her desire to retrieve her money transfer. Nevertheless, the Connecticut constitution does not demand that citizens should be forced to bear extreme personal denigration-abuse that pushes a person to the brink of violence-so that others may freely employ wanton vilification as a form of expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that, under the state constitution, speech directly challenging the listener to a fight is not a necessary element of the fighting words doctrine. Rather, the standard is whether the speech at issue is so abusive that it would provoke an ordinary person to respond with immediate violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   I next turn to whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction under \u00a7 53a-181(a)(5). I conclude that the cumulative force of the evidence in the present case is sufficient to support such a conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, in a belligerent and angry manner, used harsh and scornful language designed to debase Freeman. She insulted her on the basis of her gender, body composition, and apparent suitability for her position as a manager of the store. She utilized the word \"cunt,\" which is generally recognized as a powerfully offensive term. I cannot say that, as a matter of law,\n   this evidence is insufficient to find that the defendant's speech was so offensive that it would provoke an ordinary person to immediately respond with violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   CHARGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Next, I address whether the issue of whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of the fighting words gloss placed on the abusive language prong of \u00a7 53a-181(a)(5). The state claims that the defendant impliedly waived her instructional impropriety claim by pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The defendant claims that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support an implied waiver under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Alternatively, the defendant\n   claims that the trial court's failure to properly instruct the jury on the elements of the fighting words doctrine resulted in manifest injustice necessitating reversal under the plain error doctrine. On the basis of this court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/\">\n    324 Conn. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), I agree with the defendant that she is entitled to plain error review and a reversal thereunder. Accordingly, I need not decide whether the defendant impliedly waived review under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The record reveals the following additional facts. After the jury departed on the first day of the defendant's two day trial, the judge furnished to counsel a first draft of the jury charge. The draft charge was marked as an exhibit and dated September 11, 2014. The judge discussed with counsel an issue pertaining to the jury instruction on the two counts of threatening on which the defendant was ultimately not convicted. See footnote 4 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. The judge indicated that he had drafted additional language regarding those counts over lunch, read the language into the record, and indicated that he would\n   provide counsel a hard copy of that language the following day. Thereafter, the judge considered a request to charge on the breach of the peace count. Specifically, defense counsel had requested that the jury be instructed that swearing alone is not enough to convict on that count. After a brief colloquy on the issue, the judge stated that his \"inclination\" was not to give the requested charge and that the \"committee charge available online comes at it quite properly ....\" The judge stated that he was \"satisfied that it's sufficient to tell [the jury] what does constitute the crime of breach of the peace.\" Wrapping up those two issues, the judge stated he had \"a pretty good idea of what [his] charge [was going to] consist of.\" As defense counsel began to raise other issues pertaining to the jury charge, the judge requested that counsel point out any typographical errors in the draft because \"[t]he jury [is] getting a copy of this.\" Defense counsel raised an issue with respect to the instruction on the obscene language prong of \u00a7 53a-181(a)(5). Defense counsel specifically indicated that she was referring to language on page nineteen of the first draft. The judge permitted the jury to be instructed that there was \"no evidence of language that meets the legal definition of obscenity ....\" There was additional discussion regarding the draft instructions and then court adjourned for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The next day, before resuming the presentation of evidence, an off the record supplemental charging conference was held at which a number of the defendant's requests to charge were considered. The defendant's request to charge, a written copy of which was filed with the court that morning, contained citations to the draft charge disseminated the previous day. During the charging conference, the judge discussed with counsel some changes that were made to the first draft and rejected the defendant's requests to charge. The jury instruction relevant to this appeal that was ultimately\n   provided to the jury was precisely the same as it appeared in the first draft. The challenged instruction is as follows: \"Language is 'abusive' if it is so coarse and insulting as to create a substantial risk of provoking violence. The state must prove that the defendant's language had a substantial tendency to provoke violent retaliation or other wrongful conduct. The words used must be 'fighting words,' which is speech that has a direct tendency to cause immediate acts of violence or portends violence. Such speech must be of such a nature that it is likely to provoke the average person to retaliation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As a threshold matter, I address the proper standard of review for this issue. In her opening brief, the defendant seeks review\n   of her unpreserved claim of instructional impropriety pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). The state claims that the defendant cannot satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   in light of her trial counsel's implied waiver of the claim pursuant to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . The defendant requests in her brief, in the alternative to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review, that this court review her instructional impropriety claim for plain error. This court recently addressed the question whether a\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver precludes review under the plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cl\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/\">\n    324 Conn. at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"460\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court answered that question in the negative, concluding that a defendant may seek plain error review of unpreserved claims of instructional impropriety.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"461\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Because I conclude that the defendant is entitled to relief under the plain error doctrine, I need not decide whether the defendant impliedly waived her right to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   I begin with a review of the legal principles that govern review of this issue. \"[The plain error] doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party.

In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ...

The relevant instruction comprises four sentences. While the instruction excels in verbosity, it fails in accuracy. The instruction impermissibly describes the state's burden of proof\n   to be proof of a broader class of speech than that which would provoke an ordinary person, as recipient of the abusive language, to respond with immediate violence. The second sentence begins the instruction on the legal standard that the state must satisfy with respect to this element of the substantive offense. That sentence starts by stating that \"[t]he state must prove that the defendant's language had a substantial tendency to provoke violent retaliation ....\" If the sentence stopped there, it would be redundant of the first sentence, which defines abusive language to be \"so coarse ... as to create a substantial risk of provoking violence.\" Instead of stopping there, the instruction impermissibly broadens the scope by indicating that the state could prove the element by showing that the speech tended to provoke \"other wrongful conduct.\" The third sentence does not limit the speech to that which provokes an immediate violent response, but broadens it to speech that \"portends violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final sentence describes\n   that speech as that which merely provokes \"retaliation.\" Moreover, to the extent the instruction even conveys that the response to the speech must also be violent, it fails to convey that the jury must find that such violence be\n   <em>\n    imminent\n   </em>\n   . None of the four sentences that illustrate that standard indicates that a violent response\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be imminent. The only sentence that does suggest immediacy is the third sentence, but that sentence employs a disjunctive thereby broadening the class of speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   To a lay juror, the instruction used in the present case describes the legal standard in broad terms. Read together, the jury's instruction was that the state must\n   show, at a minimum, that the defendant's language \"portend [ed] violence\" and was likely to \"provoke the average person to retaliation\" in the form of \"wrongful conduct.\" In other words, this instruction apprised the jury that it could find that the state met its burden if an ordinary person would respond to the defendant's speech-which could have portended violence by coupling the insulting language with the raising of her cane-with threats or fighting words, not necessarily violence. Therefore, this description of the legal standard that the state must satisfy clearly broadens the class of speech deemed illegitimate beyond constitutionally permissible bounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Next, there is no doubt that this jury instruction was manifestly unjust. The harm in permitting a jury to criminally sanction such an impermissibly broad class of speech is readily apparent. It is inimical to our system of justice to punish speech that a properly instructed jury may well have found to be constitutionally protected. The state claims that the language used by the defendant was so abusive that any instructional impropriety was harmless. I disagree. The standard for fighting words is an objective one; it asks the jury to make a finding with respect to the degree of offensiveness of the speech. As previously discussed in this concurring and dissenting opinion, permitting a properly instructed to jury to assess the offensiveness of the speech accounts for the evolution in normative values and culture. See part III G of this concurring and dissenting opinion. In the present case, the dispositive issue for the jury with respect to this count was principally the degree of offensiveness of the defendant's language; the defendant admitted berating Freeman and did not stridently dispute the testimony of the state's\n   witnesses regarding the precise language she used. The instruction in the present case apprised the jury of a standard that permitted it to consider an impermissibly broad class of speech sufficient to find guilt. The federal constitution-as well as fundamental fairness-demands that a finding with respect to the degree of offensiveness of the speech-i.e., whether the speech would provoke an ordinary person, as the recipient of the abusive language, to respond with immediate violence-be made, in the first instance, by a properly instructed jury. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In conclusion, I would decline to review whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the defendant's conviction under the federal fighting words standard because she has failed to adequately brief her sufficiency claim under this standard. Even if I were to reach the issue, however,\n   I would conclude that the test proposed by the majority-that is, a test that evaluates the individual circumstances of the addressee at a granular level-is not appropriate and is contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the \"ordinary person\" test.\n   <em>\n    Gooding\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722895\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/518/#p525\">\n    405 U.S. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722895\" index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/518/#p525\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I conclude that it would not be appropriate to implement a more subjective test. The flaw in such a standard is twofold: (1) it invites the speaker to make value judgments about the proclivity for violence of the individuals involved, and (2) creates corresponding asymmetry in expressive liberty. The first flaw is that it invites the fact finder to make judgments about the circumstances of the individuals involved and the general likelihood that the recipient would respond violently, which invites judgments about the violent tendencies based on traits such as profession, size, age, physical capability, or even gender and race. Second, the asymmetry in expressive liberty is created by virtue of the fact that abusive language against those less likely to respond violently such as the feeble would be protected, whereas abusive language directed against a strong, chauvinistic person would not be protected.
