Appellees, Barbara Brown and Herbert E. Spencer, Jr., (\"Brown and Spencer\", or collectively \"Appellees\") are individuals who each purchased vehicles from\n   Appellant's dealership. On March 13, 2015, Brown and Spencer filed a class action lawsuit (the \"Class Action\") in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Liberty Ford, in which they challenged Liberty Ford's practice of providing customers with an alleged free lifetime Limited Warranty for their vehicles. The alleged free\n   warranty was conditioned on the consumer's continued use of and payment for other services provided by Liberty Ford, which, Appellees aver, is an arrangement that violates federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In lieu of filing a motion to compel arbitration in the Class Action matter, Liberty Ford commenced an independent action in the same court on April 27, 2015 (\"the Arbitration Action\") seeking to compel arbitration in the existing Class Action case. The Circuit Court ruled that Brown and Spencer's claims in the Class Action were not subject to binding arbitration. Liberty Ford appealed. In the Court of Special Appeals, Brown and Spencer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal arguing that the Circuit Court's order denying arbitration was not an appealable final judgment. The Court of Special Appeals denied the motion, and Brown and Spencer petitioned this Court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about July 6, 2007, Appellee Brown purchased a used 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe from Liberty Ford. Ms. Brown signed multiple documents in connection with the sale, including a buyer's order, dated July 6, 2007, and a retail installment sales contract (\"RISC\"), dated July 11, 2007. The buyer's order presented to Ms. Brown by Liberty Ford reflected the following provisions related to claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the purchase of the Santa Fe:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties irrevocably agree that any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the purchase or the financing of this vehicle included but not limited to this Purchase Agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by binding arbitration, pursuant to the separate Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes. However, binding arbitration will not\n   apply to the failure of the Purchaser to provide consideration including failure to pay a note, a dishonored check, failure to provide a trade title, or failure to pay a deficiency resulting from an additional payoff on a trade. In addition, binding arbitration will not apply to Dealer's right to retake possession of the vehicle.

Spencer, Jr., filed a class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Liberty Ford. Brown and Spencer's complaint alleged that Liberty advertised a \"Liberty for Life\" Warranty for new and used vehicles that was \"free of charge\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   and \"for life\" then conditioned those benefits upon certain mandatory and costly requirements of the consumer. Specifically, Brown and Spencer allege that, with respect to Mr. Spencer's warranty, when \"Mr. Spencer refused to have the mandatory 15,000 mile service performed by Liberty Ford because of the dealership's excessive $265 charge, Liberty Ford voided his warranty and refused to honor or provide Mr. Spencer any of the benefits under the [']Liberty for Life' Limited Warranty program.\" Brown and Spencer allege that Liberty Ford \"informed Ms. Brown that, by obtaining required service work on her vehicle at a location other than Liberty Ford, Ms. Brown voided the terms of her 'Liberty for Life' Limited Warranty.\" According to Brown and Spencer, the practice of requiring additional costly maintenance services, which were outside the scope of a vehicle's warranty and could only be performed at Liberty Ford, is a \"tying arrangement\" because the consumer is forced to pay for non-warranty service and maintenance charges if the consumer wants the promised benefits of the \"Liberty for Life\" Warranty. In effect, the consumer is \"tied to\" the continued receipt of benefits\n   through non-warranty and costly services at Liberty Ford. Brown and Spencer allege that this tying arrangement constitutes a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In lieu of filing a motion to compel arbitration in the Class Action suit, Liberty Ford commenced the independent Arbitration Action in the same court on April 27, 2015. The matter was assigned to the same judge presiding in the Class Action. In the Arbitration Action, Liberty Ford sought to compel arbitration of any and all claims contained in the Class Action and to stay the Class Action. On June 23, 2015, Brown and Spencer filed a Motion to Consolidate the Class Action and the Arbitration Action. Liberty Ford did not file a response. The Circuit Court denied Brown and Spencer's motion pursuant to an order issued on June 29, 2015. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   While Plaintiffs are correct that these actions involve common questions of law and fact and a common subject matter, in this instance the consideration of \"convenience\" addressed in Md. Rule 2-503(b) dictates that these matters not be consolidated. This is the case because Plaintiffs are correct about another point, that enough information is before the Court to allow a determination to be made in the Arbitration Action. A hearing will be held on the pending Petition in that case on August 4, 2015. The Court's determination of that Petition will end proceedings in the Arbitration Action and will either result in the staying of the Class Action or in allowing the Class Action to proceed outside of the shadow of the Arbitration Action. That is, one way or the other, aside from any potential appeal, the Arbitration Action will be concluded after August 4, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   That being the case, the only thing consolidation will accomplish at this point will be to keep the case file in the Arbitration Action active after it should be closed. It has been the Court's experience that the Office of the Clerk of the Court has a great deal of difficulty docketing papers in an orderly fashion where cases-especially cases involving complex civil litigation as in these matters-are consolidated. Where cases have been consolidated, but then one case\n   file subsequently should be closed, further chaos-and the habitual misdocketing of papers-ensues. Therefore, since the Arbitration Action will not need to be active after August 4, 2015-unless, again, the matter is appealed-it will only cause inconvenience to the Court-and negatively impact judicial efficiency-to consolidate the matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 4, 2015, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the petition in the Arbitration Action. On August 7, 2015, the Circuit Court issued a written order ruling that Brown and Spencer's MMWA claims in the Class Action were not subject to binding arbitration. In denying the petition to compel arbitration, the Circuit Court wrote, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Having considered the various arguments advanced by [Liberty Ford], the Court is not convinced that the instant matter can be meaningfully distinguished from\n   <em>\n    Koons Ford of Baltimore, Inc. v.

The language of\n   <em>\n    Koons Ford\n   </em>\n   is clear and it is broad: \"It is clear ... that Congress intended to preclude arbitration [of Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims].\"\n   <em>\n    Koons Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852827\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/38/\">\n    398 Md. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852827\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/38/\">\n    919 A.2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals has held that, per its reading of the intent of Congress,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims are exempt from binding arbitration. While the Court understands that [Liberty Ford] disagrees with this holding, this Court is not free to disregard a decision of this state's highest court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 10, 2015, Liberty Ford filed a notice of appeal of the Circuit Court's order. On January 27, 2016, Brown and Spencer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the judgment of the Circuit Court denying the petition to compel arbitration was not an appealable final judgment under Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\"). The intermediate appellate court denied Brown and Spencer's motion to dismiss on February 11, 2016, and Brown and Spencer petitioned this Court for review on September 16, 2016. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to answer the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Is an order of the circuit court denying a petition to compel arbitration, the sole issue in a separately-docketed case, a final judgment when there is pending a previously-filed case in the same court addressing all the substantive issues between the same parties in the same transactions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Deer Auto.

They contend that in\n   <em>\n    Am. Bank Holdings, Inc. v. Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    436 Md. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    82 A.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013),\n   <em>\n    Schuele v.

Brown and Spencer concede that this Court has never had occasion to decide whether a denial of a petition to compel arbitration in a separately-filed action is a final judgment where there is a previously-filed case currently pending in the same court between the same parties and regarding the same substantive disputes in the same transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Brown and Spencer acknowledge that in\n   <em>\n    Litton Bionetics, Inc. v. Glen Const. Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1969722\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/292/34/\">\n    292 Md. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20A.2d%20208\">\n    437 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), this Court held that the denial of a petition to consolidate two separate arbitration disputes into one proceeding is a final judgment where there is no pending case in the\n   circuit court other than the petition to consolidate. Brown and Spencer distinguish\n   <em>\n    Litton\n   </em>\n   from the present case because in\n   <em>\n    Litton\n   </em>\n   there was not a pending related case in circuit court. Brown and Spencer additionally suggest that the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"220205\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/360/602/\">\n    360 Md. 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"220205\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/360/602/\">\n    759 A.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) supports their contention, in that the granting of a motion to transfer venue, which is appealable as a final order, puts the parties out of a particular court, whereas the denial of such a motion, which is not an appealable final order, permits litigation to continue in the court that issues the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Brown and Spencer rely on\n   <em>\n    Haynie v. Gold Bond Bldg. Prods\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2062166\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/306/644/\">\n    306 Md. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2062166\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/306/644/\">\n    511 A.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) to bolster their assertion that Liberty Ford filed a separate action in an attempt to artificially manufacture appellate jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Haynie\n   </em>\n   , this Court declined to decide an appeal from a separately-filed declaratory judgment action where there was an existing tort action between the parties. Brown and Spencer assert that the end-run that was rejected in\n   <em>\n    Haynie\n   </em>\n   is the same end-run that Liberty Ford is attempting in this case. Next, Brown and Spencer posit that whether the action-here, the Arbitration Action-is embedded in the previously-filed action or is an independent action where there is a currently-pending action is a distinction without a difference. For that proposition, Brown and Spencer rely on a case from the Supreme Court of the United States,\n   <em>\n    Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/\">\n    531 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), which rejected the distinction between embedded and independent actions as to the finality of judgments when interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act. Brown and Spencer, finally, contend that permitting an appeal of the denial of a petition to compel arbitration would allow parties to eviscerate the final judgment rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Liberty Ford, of course, disagrees. Liberty Ford contends that Brown and Spencer's efforts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Litton\n   </em>\n   are unavailing because the sole issue raised in the separately-filed action was whether arbitration could be compelled, and the Circuit Court's denial of the petition to compel arbitration denied all relief sought by Liberty Ford, thereby, terminating the case. Further, Liberty Ford contends that the test of appealability cannot be based on the pendency of a related case because that test conflates otherwise separate proceedings. Liberty Ford asserts that\n   <em>\n    Haynie\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable in the\n   present context, because a ruling on arbitration, if sustained, puts the parties out of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition, Liberty Ford distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Addison, Case Handyman,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   from the instant case based on the filing and subsequent denial of a petition to compel arbitration in an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   case. Liberty Ford insists that where such an order denying a petition to compel arbitration was issued in \"a separate, independent, and freestanding action\" with arbitrability of a claim as the sole issue in that case, the order was final. To support its conclusion, Liberty Ford relies on\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   where we suggested that an order denying a petition to compel arbitration in a separate and independently-filed action is a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Liberty Ford further asserts that the Federal Arbitration Act applies, by virtue of reference to the Federal Arbitration Act in the Appellees' RISC. To the extent that this Court finds that the order is not appealable under the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, Liberty Ford asks this Court to follow the federal statute, which expressly allows an immediate appeal of an order denying arbitration. Finally, Liberty Ford urges this Court to adopt the reasoning\n   employed by the Court of Special Appeals in\n   <em>\n    FutureCare NorthPoint, LLC v. Peeler\n   </em>\n   , where the intermediate appellate court held that \"an order denying an independent, freestanding petition to compel arbitration is a final judgment from which the aggrieved party has the right to appeal.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767302,12486311\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/229/108/\">\n    229 Md.App. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767302,12486311\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/229/108/\">\n    143 A.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    The Final Judgment Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud.

The reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Haynie\n   </em>\n   applies in equal force to this case. A party, in this case, Liberty Ford, should not be permitted to circumvent the final judgment rule by filing a separate cause of action to compel arbitration of a claim that is the subject of litigation in a pending lawsuit between the same parties and the party seeking to compel arbitration could have filed previously a motion to compel arbitration in the pending case. To allow\n   otherwise undermines the final judgment rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The legislative history of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act supports our conclusion as well as our rejection of Liberty Ford's contention that the appeal provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act are dispositive. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   , the appeal provisions of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act were deleted as duplicative in 1973 as part of the Annotated Code revision process.\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    436 Md. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    82 A.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appeal provisions, \"which permitted an appeal to be taken from an order denying an application to compel arbitration only 'in the manner and to the same extent' as other final judgments in civil actions,\" were eliminated because \" '[m]ost of its language deals with appeals from final judgments and is thus covered by \u00a7 12-301.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    436 Md. at 472-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057021\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/457/\">\n    82 A.3d at 876-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 1973 Maryland Laws, Ch. 2, Revisor's Note to \u00a7 12-303).

We hold that the Circuit Court's denial of Liberty Ford's petition to compel arbitration is not a final appealable order pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, we note that in the instant case the Circuit Court denied Brown and Spencer's Motion to Consolidate the Arbitration and Class actions. In doing so, the court explained that consolidation of the two actions was unnecessary because the issue of arbitrability in the Arbitration Action would be determinative of further proceedings in the Class Action. The court commented that consolidation would only serve to create \"further chaos [due to] the habitual misdocketing of papers\" and would result in inconvenience to the court. We are sympathetic to the Circuit Court's frustration, but its rationale for denying Brown and Spencer's motion to consolidate is unavailing in this case. The question of arbitrability of the same issue that was pending in the Class Action should have been considered as part of that action because, as the Circuit Court pointed out, a \"determination of th[e] Petition [to Compel Arbitration] will end proceedings in the Arbitration Action and will either result in the staying of the Class Action or in allowing the Class Action to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 2-503 (\"When actions involving a common question of law or fact or a common subject matter, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order a joint hearing or trial or consolidation of any or all of the claims, issues, or actions.\"). Here, in an effort to avoid chaos, the Circuit Court engendered it. In fact, at oral argument\n   before us, counsel for Liberty Ford conceded that Liberty Ford filed the separate Arbitration Action for the purpose of taking an immediate appeal. The Circuit Court\n   could have dismissed Liberty Ford's petition, directed Liberty Ford to file its motion in the pending Class Action, or consolidated the two actions. Instead, the court unnecessarily bifurcated the two actions, giving rise to Liberty Ford's impermissible appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Circuit Court's order denying Liberty Ford's petition to compel arbitration is not a final, appealable judgment under Cts. &amp; Jud.
