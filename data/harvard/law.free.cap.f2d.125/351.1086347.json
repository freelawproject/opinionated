These rules have the force and effect of law. National Candy Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 104 F.2d 999 and Hill v. Federal Trade Commission, 5 Cir., 124 F.2d 104, decided December 23, 1941. The Commission\u2019s findings of fact cover every fact alleged in the complaint and are within the issues tendered. Under the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, where an alleged fact is left without denial, any issue with respect to such allegation is foreclosed by the. pleadings. National Candy Company case, supra, 104 F.2d page 1003. A fact admitted by answer is no longer a fact in issue. Hill case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> A reading of petitioner\u2019s answer discloses that he admits he sold his merchandise in competition with others engaged in selling like merchandise in interstate commerce, that in the sale and distribution thereof he furnishes devices involving the use of games and lottery schemes, and that his purchasers use the devices for the purpose of conducting lotteries in disposing of his merchandise. The statute condemns any method of competition in interstate commerce which is contrary to public policy. Ostler Candy Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 10 Cir., 106 F.2d 962, 965. The use of a sales method which involves an element of chance is contrary to public policy, Federal Trade Commission v. R. F. Keppel &amp; Bro., 291 U.S. 304, 313, 54 S.Ct. 423, 78 L.Ed. 814, and such method is an injury to the public, National Candy Company case, supra, 104 F.2d page 1006, and injures competitors, Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 258 U.S. 483, 494, 42 S.Ct. 384, 66 L.Ed. 729, and International Art Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 109 F.2d 393, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Petitioner also complains of the use of the words \u201cor may be used\u201d in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order. A like complaint was made in the National Candy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Hill cases, supra, but was rejected. We think the conclusions reached in those cases were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The petition to set aside the order is denied and the order of the Federal Trade Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\"> (1) Supplying to or placing in the hands of others any merchandise together with punch boards, push or pull cards or other lottery devices, which said punch boards, push or pull cards or other lottery devices are to be used, or may be used, in selling or distributing such merchandise to the public;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">(2) Supplying to or placing in the hands of others, punch boards, push or pull cards, or other lottery devices, either with assortments of merchandise or separately, which said punch boards, push or pull cards, or other lottery devices, are to be used, or may be used, in selling or distributing such merchandise to the public;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">(3) Selling or otherwise disposing of any merchandise by means of a game of chance, gift enterprise or lottery scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
