Int.Rev.Acts, page 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">The plaintiff manufactures a line of children\u2019s garments which it sells as \u201cplay suits.\u201d They are made in age sizes ranging from 4 to 16 inclusive and include garments called \u201cBaseball Play Suits\u201d which are. made in imitation of baseball uniforms worn by professional players, except that they are inferior in quality of material and bear insignia on front and back with the words \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d or \u201cDizzy Dean\u201d and \u201cDaffy Dean.\u201d They are sold to chain stores and department retail stores but not to sporting goods stores. The commissioner of internal revenue determined that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cBaseball Play Suits\u201d in age sizes 12 to 16 inclusive were taxable under section 609 and assessed a tax of $3,-591.17 on sales thereof between June 21, 1932, and May 31, 1935. The tax was paid under protest, a timely claim for refund was filed and rejected, and the present action was brought to recover said sum with interest. The case was tried to a jury, which found in answer to specific questions that the plaintiff\u2019s baseball play suit of said age sizes was a \u201cbaseball uniform\u201d and was \u201cincluded in either the common or commercial sense of the phrase sporting goods.\u201d Accordingly the jury, pursuant to instructions, found a verdict for the defendant and judgment was entered dismissing the complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-21\">Article 54 of Treasury Regulations 46 has construed the statute to tax \u201call paraphernalia, equipment and uniforms specially designed for or commonly used in athletic contests, * * * baseball * * * and similar games and contests.\u201d It is not suggested that this is not a reasonable and valid regulation. We entertain no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s suits in the larger sizes which were subjected to tax were taxable as \u201cuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>forms\u201d designed for or commonly used in baseball games. Though used by children, they are not within the statutory exception of \u201cchildren\u2019s toys and games.\u201d See Samuel Winslow Skate Mfg. Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 50 F.2d 299, certiorari denied sub nom. Endicott v. United States, 285 U.S. 555, 52 S.Ct. 456, 76 L.Ed. 944. We believe that the tax can also be supported on the jury\u2019s finding that the suits were \u201csporting goods.\u201d See Art. 53, Reg. 46. It is not material that the plaintiff does not sell its products to sporting goods stores. Chicago Flag <em>&amp; </em>Decorating Co. v. United States, 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 413. No error appears in the Judge\u2019s charge or refusals to charge or in the exclusion of evidence. Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
