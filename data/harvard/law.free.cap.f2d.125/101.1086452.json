On May 31, 1939, appellant returned the property to appellee and delivered to appellee a notice stating that appellant thereby rescinded the contract of May 22,1939. The notice further stated: \u201cThis rescission is made on the ground that the consideration for this obligation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has failed in a material respect, and particularly because the equipment set forth in [the contract] was not at the time of the delivery of said equipment to [appellant], or now, in proper form or order to use in the manner for which it was intended to be used, and such use up to date has been had only by the expenditure of large sums of money by [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">Appellee commenced this action on November 10, 1939. The complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> set out the contract, alleged appellee\u2019s performance and appellant\u2019s breach thereof, and alleged that, in consequence of the breach, appellee had been damaged in the sum of $14,-475.14, itemized as follows: (1) Expense of feeding and caring for the leased animals for a period of four weeks,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> $1,600; (2) insurance premium alleged to have been paid by appellee, $66; (3) agreed rental of the leased property, $12,500; (4) interest on said rental to November 10, 1939, $309.-14. The prayer of the complaint \u2014 due, obviously, to an error in addition \u2014 was that appellee have judgment for $15,475.14, but the complaint stated no claim for that amount. The amount actually claimed was $14,475.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">Answering, appellant admitted execution of the contract, but denied performance thereof by appellee; pleaded the at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tempted rescission of May 31, 1939; alleged that the leased equipment was not in good condition and ready for use when delivered to appellant, but was defective and badly in need of repairs; alleged that appellant had expended $2,500 for such repairs and had been damaged in the sum of $50,000 by appellee\u2019s non-performance of the contract; and, by way of counterclaim, prayed judgment against appellee for $52,500. Jury trial having been waived, the court tried the case, made and filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law and, on December 3, 1940, entered judgment in favor of appellee. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The court found that the expense of feeding and caring for the leased animals from May 31, 1939, to June 28, 1939, was $1,600, as alleged in the complaint, but concluded that appellee was not entitled to recover that amount or any part thereof. Since appellee has not appealed, this conclusion is accepted as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">There was no finding, nor any evidence warranting a finding, that appellee expended $66 or any other sum for insurance of the leased property. There was, therefore, no basis for awarding that sum or any part thereof to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The court found that the leased equipment was in good usable condition when delivered to appellant, but that some of it was in need of repairs; that, prior to its delivery, appellant saw and examined the equipment and knew its condition; and that, having such knowledge, appellant accepted delivery of the equipment, had the necessary repairs made and, with appellee\u2019s consent, charged the expense thereof ($1,-511.77)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to appellee. These findings are amply supported by evidence and will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The court concluded that when appellant, knowing the condition of the equipment, accepted delivery thereof, had the necessary repairs made and, with appellee\u2019s consent, charged the expense thereof to appellee, appellant waived \u201creconditioning\u201d of the equipment \u2014 meaning, obviously, that appellant waived the right to demand that the equipment be repaired or \u201creconditioned\u201d before delivery. This conclusion was clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">The equipment delivered to appellant included a certain rope which subsequently was broken while being used by appellant. Witnesses for appellant testified that the rope was \u201cdry-rotted.\u201d No part of the rope was produced in evidence. The court remarked that its non-production \u201cwould indicate the contrary idea to the dry rot.\u201d Apart, however, from any inference the court may have drawn from the non-production of the rope, the finding that all the equipment, including the rope, was in good condition when delivered to appellant was amply warranted. We therefore need not consider appellant\u2019s contention that the inference drawn by the court was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">One of the leased wagons had a \u201chot box\u201d \u2014 an overheated spindle \u2014 while being used by appellant. The court observed that there was no evidence that the wagons had been greased or oiled since their delivery to appellant. There was evidence, however, that after one overheating, the spindle in question was greased and shortly thereafter was again overheated. This may or may not have resulted from improper or inadequate lubrication. Whatever its cause, it does not require a rejection of the court\u2019s finding that all the equipment, including this wagon, was in good condition when delivered to appellant. We therefore need not consider appellant\u2019s contention that, in the absence of evidence, the court should have presumed that the spindle had been greased.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Appellant complains of the admission of testimony of Patrick Graham, J. V. Austin and Paul Eagles, witnesses for appellee, regarding the condition of the wagons when delivered to appellant. Graham testified that the wagons were in good condition. Austin testified that they looked to him to be usable. Eagles testified that they were \u201cin such condition as used circus wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>gons would normally be in at such a time.\u201d Regarding an accident to one of the wagons, Eagles testified that such an accident could be caused by \u201cwrong turning\u201d if the driver did not handle the pole of the wagon properly. All this testimony was objected to as being opinion testimony. The objection was not well taken. The witnesses were circus men of many years\u2019 experience, and their testimony (if not otherwise admissible) was admissible as expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Appellant says the court erred in \u201cconcluding that appellant closed the circus because threatened with a closed shop by labor unions.\u201d The court stated no such conclusion. The court did, however, allude to the fact \u2014 which is undisputed \u2014 that, on May 31, 1939, before attempting to rescind its contract with appellee, appellant sent fourteen telegrams each of which stated, in substance, that appellant was closing the circus because of labor difficulties. Whether the telegrams were true or false need not be decided; for, regardless of their truth or falsity, the attempted rescission was unwarranted and ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The complaint alleged and the answer denied that, after appellant returned the leased property, appellee \u201cmade every endeavor during the remainder of the term of said contract to let said property to others, but was unable to do so.\u201d By a pretrial order <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dated November 25, 1940, this issue was excluded from the case, thus obviating the need of a finding thereon. There is, therefore, no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that, for lack of such a finding, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">From the foregoing it is clear that appellee should have had judgment for $988.23,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with 7% interest<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from May 23, 1939 ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> $2,500, with 7% interest from May 31, 1939; $2,500, with 7% interest from June 7, 1939; $2,500, with 7% interest from June 14, 1939; and $2,500, with <em>7% </em>interest from June 21, 1939 \u2014 -a total<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of $12,129.34. Instead, the court gave appellee judgment for $15,006.07, an amount exceeding by $2,876.73 that which should have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The judgment is modified by reducing the amount thereof from $15,006.07 to $12,-129.34 and, as thus modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-14\"> Appellant\u2019s obligation under the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-15\"> The complaint was in three counts.
