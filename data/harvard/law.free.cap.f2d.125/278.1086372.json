HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b340-25\">The plaintiff appeals from a judgment, dismissing after trial his complaint against the defendants \u2014 filed under \u00a7 17 of the \u201cFair Labor Standards Act of 1938\u201d \u2014 to restrain violation of \u00a7 15(a) (2) of that act 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 217, 215(a) (2). The only question is whether \u00a7 7(a) 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207(a) requires the defendants to pay \u201ctime and a half\u201d to their employees. (We may ignore the defendant, Spear &amp; Co., Inc., for any decision as to it must concededly follow that as to the Arsenal Building Corporation, of which we shall speak as the defendant.) The facts are as follows. The defendant owns a twenty-two story loft building in New York City, of which it lets out substantially all the space to manufacturers of women\u2019s clothes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>who are concededly engaged in interstate commerce: i.e., they import part of their raw materials into the state and send out of the state a large part of the completed clothes. (With the exception of three of these manufacturers, the sales of two of whom were very small, the percentage of interstate shipments was in every case more than two-thirds; the percentage of the total shipments was 82.) All but two occupy less than a single story of the building; one occupies one and a half stories, and the other, five and a half. The defendant has no other business but leasing the space, collecting the rent and such services as are incidentally necessary: e.g., protecting the tenants\u2019 property, keeping the building itself clean, warm, lighted and in repair, furnishing steam and hot water, and manning and running the elevators. To render these services it employs 25 workmen of various sorts (besides a superintendent, concededly not within the act) and it has refused to pay them \"time and a half\u201d for overtime as defined by \u00a7 7(a) (1) and \u00a7 7(a) (2) of the act. The plaintiff\u2019s position is that, although these employees do not have any part in the actual handling of materials or of the finished goods (except insofar as running the elevators may be such) they are nevertheless \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d and \u201cin the production of goods for commerce\u201d within \u00a7 7(a). The defendant denies this, and further asserts that it is in any case exempted by \u00a7 13(a) (2), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (2) because the employees are engaged in a \u201cservice establishment the greater part of whose * * * servicing is in intrastate commerce.\u201d Finally it says that the act does not cover the employees of employers who are not themselves \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d The district judge held that the employees were not \u201cengaged in the \u2018production of goods for commerce,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cin commerce\u201d; and that the defendant was a \u201cservice establishment\u201d all of whose activity was intrastate.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We think that the employees here in question are \u201cengaged * * * in the production of goods for commerce\u201d within \u00a7 7(a), and for that reason we do not find it necessary to decide whether they are also \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d First, are they engaged in the production of goods at all? Section 3(j), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(j), defines that phrase as meaning, \u201cemployed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof.\u201d Whatever may be thought of the applicability of this definition down to the last clause, we are satisfied that the \u201coccupation\u201d of these men was \u201cnecessary to the production\u201d of the clothes. If instead of leasing space in the defendant\u2019s building, the manufacturers had each owned and occupied a whole factory of his own, this conclusion seems to us scarcely debatable. Cutters and stitchers cannot work in a cold or filthy building; they must have light and' power to drive their machines; they cannot be required to carry goods from one story to another. Those who make and keep the factory fit for them in these- ways are as \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201cproduction\u201d as they are themselves.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yet it would as much defeat the purpose of the act, as expressed in \u00a7 2, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 202, to deprive such workmen of its protection when they chance to be employed by a different employer, as when they are employed by the employer of the cutters and stitchers. And a competing dressmaker may find his rival\u2019s lower rent as \u201cunfair\u201d a differential against him in the cost of production, as lower wages; he will indeed feel it less directly, but it may still be felt. We may therefore start with the assumption that Congress did not mean to draw any line, based merely upon the division of the same duties among several employers, unless the language of the act very plainly requires us to believe that it did. We can find none that compels us so to believe; on the contrary \u00a7 3(i) which includes \u201cparts and ingredients\u201d of \u201cgoods\u201d with the goods themselves, confirms our understanding. The history of the clause affords further confirmation; it originally read: \u201cor in the making of tools or dies used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>production of such goods in any State.\u201d That obviously implied that the later use of the tools and dies \u2014 otherwise outside the act \u2014 might characterize them enough from the outset to put within it those who made them. The final form of words chosen was far more general, it is true, but there is no indication of any change in the original intent in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">To this the defendant answers that it proves too much, for Congress could not have meant to impose \u201cfair labor standards\u201d upon everyone who might chance to contribute any necessary \u201cingredient,\u201d or service to the production of goods. \u201cproduced for commerce.\u201d The miller who furnishes the flour to a baker who sells bread in other states could not have been intended; or the cutler who sells knives to a wholesale butcher; or the service station which repairs and fills a manufacturer\u2019s trucks; or the chemist who supplies alcohol to a perfumer. Stated so generally, the argument may be sound; at any rate we will assume arguendo that the purveyor of \u201cingredients\u201d or services to all-comers at random will not find himself within the act merely because some part of what he sells eventually finds its way into \u201cgoods produced for commerce.\u201d Perhaps in the end it will turn upon the distribution of his customers among those who are engaged in interstate commerce and those who are not; here, as so often, the test may be one of degree. We need not answer, for here at any rate no such dilemma presents itself. As we have said, the work of the defendant\u2019s employees is in kind substantially the same as it would be if the manufacturers employed them directly. That is the substance of the matter. Since the words and the purpose of the act coalesce so far, we will not allow ourselves to be drawn into dialectical niceties which are not before us and whose answer need not compromise the step we are taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"> Nor do we think that the defendant is a \u201cservice establishment the greater part of whose * * * servicing is in intrastate commerce\u201d; \u00a7 13(a) (2). Possibly it is not a \u201cservice establishment\u201d at all; perhaps that phrase should be limited to those who serve consumers directly, like tailors, or garages, or laundries; the juxtaposition of retail selling and \u201cservicing\u201d does indeed suggest as much. But it is enough for our purpose that, if it is a \u201cservice establishment,\u201d at least its exemption must depend upon the extent to which its servicing is intrastate. Suppose for example, that these manufacturers, instead of pressing the clothes themselves, sent them out to other shops which pressed only for them; the fact that the pressing took place in the same state as the cutting and stitching would not, we think, exempt the pressers; their servicing would be \u201cin interstate commerce.\u201d The \u201cservicing\u201d being a part of \u201cproduction,\u201d the test should be what kind of production it is a part of. The question is really the same as that we have just considered: i.e., whether it is important how that production is divided among employers. It cannot be that if the exemption extends beyond retail \u201cservicing,\u201d it is the character of the \u201cservicing\u201d itself that counts, divorced from the \u201cproduction\u201d of which it is a part. Again, we should, be met by the anomaly arising from such an interpretation' \u2014 -the capricious incidence of the act resulting from the accident of the industrial division of the whole process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The defendant\u2019s last argument is based upon \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 8, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 205, 208, which prove, it says, that the act covers only the employees of employers who are themselves \u201cengaged in\u201d interstate commerce. Acknowledging, as it must, that \u00a7 6, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206, commands \u201cevery employer\u201d without limitation to \u201cpay to each of his employees\u201d the standard wage, and that \u00a7 <em>7 </em>declares that \u201cno employer\u201d shall \u201cemploy any of his employees\u201d for more than the prescribed hours, the defendant rests its argument upon the constitution and functions of the \u201cindustry committees.\u201d Since these must be composed only of employers \u201cengaged in\u201d interstate commerce, and since they have power to fix the rate of wages, the argument is that the act cannot apply to employers who are not represented upon them. We do not agree. Section 5(a) does not confine the \u201cAdministrator\u201d to committees for \u201ceach industry engaged in commerce\u201d; he may also appoint them for industries \u201cengaged * * * in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d One third of its membership must, it is true, \u201crepresent employers in the industry\u201d; and \u00a7 8 gives power to the committees to fix the ' wage in the \u201cindustry\u201d (not oyer 40 cents an hour) and to report to the \u201cAdministrator,\u201d who is to approve the report \u201cif he finds that the recommendations are made in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>.with law, are supported by the evidence * * * and * * * will carry out the purposes of this section\u201d; otherwise he is to refer back the question to the same or another committee. (Subd. d.) Section 3 (h) defines an \u201cindustry\u201d as including not only a \u201cbranch\u201d of an industry, but \u201ca group of industries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">It is certainly undesirable, and it is probably impossible, to define with accuracy just what are the limits imposed upon the \u201cAdministrator\u2019s\u201d choice by \u00a7 5, but if we read subdivisions a and b together and interpolate in their proper places the definitions of \u00a7 3(h) and \u00a7 3(j), we get substantially the following. The \u201cAdministrator\u201d is directed to appoint a number of persons \u201crepresenting employers\u201d for each \u201cgroup of industries\u201d whose employees are \u201cemployed * * * in any process or occupation necessary to the production\u201d of \u201cgoods for commerce.\u201d Certainly this grants him the power if he thinks best to put upon one committee an employer \u201cengaged * * * in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d like the defendant, with employers \u201cengaged in interstate commerce,\u201d like the tenants. Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, 312 U.S. 126, 149, 150, 61 S.Ct. 524, 85 L.Ed. 624. The history of \u00a7\u00a7 6 and <em>7 </em>in Congress leaves no doubt that this is the right view. In the Senate the sections read in substance as they now do, though the wording was somewhat different (Senate Bill <em>2475 </em>passed July 31, 1937). The House amended them to limit them to employers engaged in commerce or in industry affecting commerce (taking the view now urged by the defendant) and to include all the employees of such employers. The conference report particularly dealt with this difference (House Report 2738, 75th Congress 3rd Session pp. 29 and 30) and declared that the only test should be the occupation of the employees; Senator Pepper, one of the managers in the Senate, expressly stated on the floor that this was its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">As has already appeared from the decisions cited, the question now at bar has come up a number of times when the ancillary service was performed by employees of the same employer who was himself \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d; and the result has been fairly uniform. We have found five decisions of appellate courts which have dealt with employees of an employer, who was not \u201cengaged in commerce,\u201d or whom at least the courts treated as not so \u201cengaged.\u201d So far the score is four to one against the view we take. In Killingbeck v. Garment Center Capitol Inc., 259 App. Div. 691, 20 N.Y.S.2d 521; Robinson v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., Tenn.Sup., Nov. 29, 1941, 158 S.W.2d 441; Cecil v. Gradison, Ohio App. 1st Dist. Nov. 17, 1941, 40 N.E.2d 958; and Pedersen v. Fitzgerald Construction Co., 3rd Dept. Nov. 12, 1941, 262 App.Div. 665, 30 N.Y.S.2d 989, it was held the act did not apply to employees who were assisting in the work of another employer, himself \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d It is true that in some of these it would have been something of a strain upon the word, \u201cproduction,\u201d to say that the employees were \u201cengaged in the production of goods\u201d at all; but it is doubtful that the courts meant to rely upon any such distinction, and it is for this reason that we count them against our view. On the other hand the Third Circuit in Fleming v. A. B. Kirschbaum Co., 124 F.2d 567, agrees with us and indeed in one or two matters went further than we have found it necessary as yet to go. In the district courts Farr v. Smith Detective A. &amp; N. W. Service Inc., 38 F.Supp. 105, went off upon the fact that the ancillary services to the employer engaged in interstate commerce were occasional; but Allen v. Moe, 39 F.Supp. 5, must be counted with Fleming v. Kirschbaum Co., though it is not on all fours.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Obviously the question will not be set at rest until the Supreme Court makes an authoritative ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> Bowie v.
