Perkins received two parcels of real property as gifts and that such parcels had been used by the donors for purposes of residence and pleasure, and that since acquisition thereof by the petitioner Katharine H. Perkins both parcels have been operated for profit; and that petitioners have claimed depreciation upon such property under Sections 113(a) and 114(a) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 113(a), 114(a), which provide that the basis \u201cshall be the same as it would be in the hands of the donor\u201d; and the court considering that the Board of Tax Appeals correctly decided that where non-business property is converted to a business use, the basis of depreciation is fair market value on the date of conversion (Heiner v. Tindle, 276 U.S. 582, 586, 587, 48 S.Ct. 326, 72 L.Ed. 714) ; and no reversible error with respect to any other issues appearing in the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-25\">It is ordered that the decisions be and they hereby are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
