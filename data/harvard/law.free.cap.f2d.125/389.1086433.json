This mark has been continuously used by the Corporation on its lamp bulbs since about 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u201cEach of the registered Trade-Marks 110,463 and 288,095 includes the printed word \u2018Hygrade\u2019 as a prominent part of the mark, and Trade-Mark 216,203 consists of the word \u2018Hygrade\u2019 in a particular form of lettering.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Copies of the respective registrations and a copy of the unregistered mark were placed in evidence. Registration 110,463, which recites that it is for electric incandescent lamps, comprises a triangular figure in association with the word \u201cHygrade\u201d placed within the triangle above a representation of an incandescent lamp, or light bulb, both the word and the representation of the bulb being disclaimed apart from the mark as shown in the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Registration 288,095, which recites that it is for electric radio tubes, shows a quite similar triangular figure having within it the word \u201cHygrade,\u201d which word is disclaimed \u201capart from the mark shown in the drawing; no common law rights however being waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">Registration 216,203 (under the act of March 19, 1920), which recites that it is for electric incandescent lamps, consists solely of the word \u201cHygrade.\u201d In each instance the word appears in fanciful type.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">The unregistered mark referred to in the notice of opposition and alleged to. have been used for lamp bulbs.since about 1925 consists of the word \u201cHygrade\u201d placed above a small triangular figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">It may be said that appellant had predecessors in business from or through whom it derived whatever of title it holds to the marks above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">In the notice of opposition, as amended, appellant asserted two grounds of opposition which are tersely stated in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">\u201cThe allegations of fact contained in the notice of opposition relate to and seek to draw in both the name and confusion in trade clauses of Section 5 as the statutory grounds for negativing the right of registration (Section 7) claimed by the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">It may be said that the answer of appellee to the notice of opposition conceded the recording \u201cby the opposer of its alleged corporate name with the Commissioner of Patents.\u201d The Examiner of Interferences, citing certain authorities, says of what we may designate the \u201cname phase\u201d of the controversy :</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">\u201cConsidering first the name clause, the evidence shows that opposer uses the notation \u2018Hygrade Sylvania Corporation\u2019 to distinguish itself from other persons. Inspection of the application involved herein shows that the mark sought to be registered by the applicant is the notation \u2018Hy-Ray.\u2019 The examiner is not persuaded that use in trade of \u2018Hy-Ray\u2019 by the applicant to indicate the origin of its goods will be likely to result in any confusion of persons such as the parties hereto.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">The reasons of appeal set forth in the appeal to the commissioner from the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of the Examiner of Interferences made no reference to that part of the latter\u2019s decision relative to the allegation respecting confusion by reason of the name clause of the trade-mark registration act. -The allegation did not appear in the notice of opposition as originally filed, but was inserted by the amendment of October 20, 1937, wherein it was alleged that the application \u201cincludes the distinguishing features of the corporate name of the Hygrade Sylvania Corporation, and would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public, leading the latter to believe that the goods bearing the mark were products of the Hygrade Sylvania Corporation, and thereby causing damage to the latter corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The reasons of appeal to the commissioner not having directed his attention to that question he, of course, was not required to take notice of it, but he did make reference to it as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u201cThe examiner [of Interferences] appears to have assumed that opposer was asserting as an additional ground of opposition that applicant\u2019s mark is an appropriation of opposer\u2019s corporate name; I find no such allegation in the notice of opposition, and even had it been pleaded I am clearly of the opinion that it is untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In a petition for rehearing appellant pointed out the amendment along with other matters. The commissioner denied the petition without comment. The assumption is that he regarded the allegation respecting the \u201cname phase\u201d to be \u201cuntenable,\u201d as stated in his first decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> The seventh reason of appeal set forth in the notice of appeal to this court alleges :</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\u201cThe Commissioner erred in holding that there was no allegation in the notice of opposition that applicant\u2019s mark is an appropriation of opposer\u2019s corporate name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">In the light of the record that reason of appeal is not apt. There is no reason of appeal alleging that error was committed in the decision on this point, which necessarily implied that the applicant (appellee here) was not seeking to register appellant\u2019s corporate name, or any part thereof. We may say, however, that if such an allegation were before us it would be clearly untenable. \u201cHy-Ray\u201d is not appellant\u2019s name, nor is it any part of appellant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">In passing upon the second ground embraced in the notice of opposition, that of the likelihood of confusion by reason of the alleged similarity of the marks of the respective parties, both tribunals of the Patent Office (holding that the goods were of the same descriptive properties) discussed at some length the question of ownership and there seems to have been disagreement between them on the question of law respecting ownership. As we understand the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, he held, in effect, that the word \u201cHygrade\u201d in appellant\u2019s marks is clearly descriptive and indicates the claimed character of the tubes and bulbs, not their origin, and by reason of its descriptive character appellant was not the owner of same and, therefore, not entitled to oppose appellee\u2019s application, he holding that the term \u201cHy-Ray\u201d was not descriptive of appellee\u2019s goods and hence was susceptible of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The commissioner said, in substance, with respect to registration No. 216,203 (consisting solely of the word \u201cHygrade\u201d), granted under the act of March 19, 1920, that there was no satisfactory proof of opposer\u2019s ownership of it and that hence it might be disregarded. With respect to the other two registrations which were under the act of February 20, 1905, he held that only one, 288,-095, need be considered. As above pointed out, the latter mark was registered for use on electron radio tubes, practically identical with the goods upon which appellee claims use of the notation \u201cHy-Ray,\u201d and consists of a triangular figure within which is embraced only the disclaimed word \u201cHygrade.\u201d We do not find in the commissioner\u2019s decision any express holding respecting the ownership by appellant of the two registrations entered under the act of February 20, 1905. We deduce from his decision, taken as a whole, that he regarded the question of ownership immaterial so far as the right of appellant to oppose in the instant case is concerned, and, therefore, did not pass upon it. He quoted from his decision in a prior case (Illuminating Engineering Society v. Seelig Specialties Co., 504 O.G. 856, 42 U.S. P.Q. 282) wherein he expressed the opinion that \u201can opposer is not required to own a trade-mark or to use it strictly as such in order to prevent registration to another of a confusingly similar mark,\u201d and added, \u201cI think that is a correct statement of law * # *</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">In the case of Trustees for Arch Preserver Shoe Patents v. James McCreery &amp; Co., 49 F.2d 1068, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1507, the appellee was seeking registration of the notation \u201cFoot Preserver\u201d for use on boots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and shoes. Appellant was opposing the registration, basing its opposition upon its claimed ownership, registration and use of certain marks containing the notation \u201cArch Preserver\u201d for identical goods. The notice of opposition alleged four registrations, two of them being under the act of February 20, 1905, and two under the act of March 19, 1920. It was there conceded that the two last might not be relied upon, as registrations, as a basis for opposition, in consequence of which concession we gave them no consideration. In the first of the two registrations (dated October 24, 1916) under the act of February 20, 1905, the notation \u201cArch Preserver\u201d had been disclaimed apart from the mark shown, but in the second it had not been disclaimed. We held, citing authorities, that by reason of its original disclaimer appellant did not by its second registration acquire any rights to oppose which it did not possess under its first registration, but agreed with the commissioner that appellant had the right to oppose \u201cby reason of the use shown of \u2018Arch Preserver\u2019 and without reference to whether \u2018Arch Preserver\u2019 is or is not descriptive as used, * * * notwithstanding its disclaimer in the certificate of October 24, 1916.\u201d The principle of that decision is in point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In thfe reasons of appeal embraced in the notice of appeal to us, appellant challenges the correctness of the commissioner\u2019s holding that there is no satisfactory proof of appellant\u2019s ownership of the mark disclosed in the registration under the act of March 19, 1920, and also alleges that the commissioner \u201cerred in entirety [entirely] neglecting to consider or mention\u201d its unregistered mark above described, which was introduced in evidence as appellant\u2019s Exhibit C, and in its brief before us appellant argues that the \u201cCommissioner\u2019s decision is clearly inconsistent and is very confusing.\u201d We fail to discern any particular force in the allegations of error respecting the matters so named or in the argument respecting such allegations, since appellant had the right to base an opposition upon prior use irrespective of the question of ownership. The ultimate question is whether the marks are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Appellant placed four marks in evidence in each of which the only word is \u201cHygrade,\u201d an obviously descriptive term meaning \u201chigh grade.\u201d The commissioner took the particular mark of appellant which is applied to goods identical with the goods of appellee for purposes of comparison and, while stating that there \u201cis some resemblance in appearance and in sound between the notations \u2018Hy-Ray\u2019 and \u2018Hygrade\u2019,\u201d declared, \u201c * * * when opposer\u2019s mark in its entirety is compared with applicant\u2019s mark, I think there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We are in agreement with that statement, and, in our opinion, it is applicable no matter which of appellant\u2019s marks may be taken for the purpose of comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In the brief of appellant before us it is asserted, in substance, that the term \u201cHy-Ray,\u201d when applied to the goods of appellee is a descriptive term. This was not set forth as a ground of opposition in appellant\u2019s notice of opposition, nor was its claimed descriptive character therein referred to directly or indirectly. The Examiner of Interferences in the course of his decision said: \u201c* * * it appears the notation \u2018Hy-Ray\u2019 used by the applicant does not perform the function of descriptiveness.\u201d Since the question was not raised, nor even hinted at, by anything in the notice of opposition, it is our assumption that the quoted statement of the Examiner of Interferences was based upon a consideration of appellee\u2019s mark in an ex parte manner, a proceeding proper under section 7, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 87. The commissioner made no reference to the question in his decision. Doubtless he would have done so had he disagreed with the Examiner of Interferences regarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Whatever may be the fact as to descriptiveness of appellee\u2019s mark, appellant here has not placed itself in \u00e1 position to make that matter a basis of opposition, nor is the case deemed to be before us in a situation where we now should pass upon the question as an ex parte matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
