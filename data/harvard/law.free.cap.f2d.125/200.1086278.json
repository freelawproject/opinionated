A car which appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>driving collided, at the corner of 15th and I Streets, N.W., with one which appellee Alice H. Lewis was driving and in which her husband, appellee Fulton Lewis, Jr., was a passenger. Appellant was going north, appellees east. The testimony, most of which we need not recite, presented typical jury questions of negligence and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"> Appellant complains of the admission in evidence of official reports made by police officer Richardson, who investigated the accident shortly after it occurred. He made out the reports, in his own handwriting, the same night. They located the point of impact, and also showed that, in approaching it, appellant\u2019s car left skid-marks some 15 feet long but appellee\u2019s car left none. Richardson was a witness at the trial. He testified that he located the point of impact by marks which he found on the pavement, and that he saw skid-marks extending 15 feet south from that point. We find no basis for appellant\u2019s contention that Richardson did not personally measure the marks. Officer Goode testified that he saw officer Kuhns measure them, but no one testified that Richardson did not measure them. Without the aid of his reports, he was unable after six years to testify to the length, position, or point of intersection of the marks; but having refreshed his recollection, he testified from memory. He was, of course, entitled to refresh his memory by consulting his own records of his own observations. In my opinion the records themselves were rightly admitted, since they were within the express words of the Act of 1936 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorizes the admission of records made in the regular course of any business, profession, occupation, or calling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority of the court express no opinion on that point. But we all agree that, in any event, the admission of the records was not prejudicial, since they added practically nothing to Richardson\u2019s testimony. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Officer Goode testified, from his own recollection, to the general position of the marks on the pavement. He also testified that he estimated, from measurements made and communicated to him by officer Kuhns, that the northbound skid-mark was 15 feet long. Whether or not the admission of this testimony was technically erroneous, it was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">At the time of the accident Mrs. Lewis was pregnant. Some months later her child was born prematurely, and died. Her complaint herein claimed that the accident caused premature delivery, and her counsel, in his opening statement, proposed to show that it caused the child\u2019s death. After the trial had begun, a doctor stated out of court that the accident did not cause the child\u2019s premature birth and death. Later in the trial, Mrs. Lewis\u2019s counsel abandoned this claim, and the court instructed the jury that no such claim was in the case. Counsel\u2019s closing argument implied, perhaps inadvertently, that there was a connection between the accident and the death; and appellant now urges that counsel\u2019s repeated references to Mrs. Lewis\u2019s difficulties during pregnancy and to the child\u2019s death prejudiced the jury. Since this point was not raised during the trial, by a motion for the withdrawal of a juror or otherwise, it was in effect waived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Appellant urges that there was no sufficient evidence to show that any of Mrs. Lewis\u2019s injuries were permanent. Apart from some slight medical evidence of permanence, there was substantial evidence that at the time of the trial, six years after the accident, she was still suffering from its effects. A jury may infer permanence from such persistence. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">Appellant submitted to the court a proposed instruction to the jury which, after correctly stating that the burden of proving defendant\u2019s negligence rested on plaintiffs, went on to say that if the jury could not decide \u201cwhether plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages resulted solely from the charged negligence of the defendant or from some act or acts of the plaintiffs themselves in the operation and control of their automobile, then the jury is not to guess between such causes and return a verdict for the plaintiffs, but if the jury so find, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>verdict of the jury must be for the defendant in each case.\u201d The court refused to give this instruction. Since the phrase \u201csome act or acts of the plaintiffs\u201d was not limited to negligent acts, a jury might well have understood the proposed instruction to mean that if any act of plaintiffs, however prudent, contributed to cause the accident, they could not recover. This, of course, is not the law. If damage did not result solely from defendant\u2019s negligence, but resulted partly from her negligence and partly from acts of plaintiffs, plaintiffs were nevertheless entitled to recover, unless their contributory acts were negligent. The trial court was therefore right in refusing the instruction; and it was under no \u201cduty to supply correct instructions, the plaintiffs\u2019 requests being defective.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant did not ask the court to charge separately that part of the instruction which was well drawn. Moreover, it is not disputed that appellant\u2019s counsel was permitted to explain,, and did explain, to the jury what the plaintiffs\u2019 burden was. In these circumstances, we think we should not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> 49 Stat. 1561, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> Wigmore, Evidence, 3d ed., \u00a7 1530.
