The point does not appear to have been decided, although an indictment charging transportation \u201cby means of a certain motor vehicle, to wit, an automobile\u201d has been held to be insufficient. Alpert v. United States, 2 Cir., 12 F.2d 352, 354. We think the contention should not be sustained. The indictment informs appellant what was intended to have been charged and what he must be prepared to meet. In view of the demurrer, the record will show that a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 399 was intended to be charged, so that he may not again be convicted for the same offense. We think that is sufficient. Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 431, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861; United States v. Behrman, 258 U.S. 280, 288, 42 S.Ct. 303, 66 L.Ed. 619. Evidently the air line was proven to be a common carrier at the trial, so the defect, if any, was one of form. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-20\">The other contention of appellant is that neither count charges a crime because the statutes relied on do not apply to the Territory of Hawaii. The contention is based on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403, which provides in part: \u201cThe term \u2018Territory,\u2019 as used in sections 397 to 404 of this title, shall include the District of Alaska, the insular possessions of the United States, and the Canal Zone * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b158-22\">It is argued that thereby the Territory of Hawaii was excluded. We think there is no merit in this argument. Both statutes, upon which the indictment was based, cover transportation \u201cin any Territory\u201d which would include Hawaii because it was a \u201cTerritory\u201d when such statutes were enacted. Section 403 merely brings, within the reach of the act, transportation in those places belonging to the United States which were not then \u201cTerritories\u201d, that is, \u201cthe District of Alaska, the insular possessions of the United States, and the Canal Zone\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
