Until examination of the record after submission of the case, it was not discovered by this Court that no certificate of probable cause had been made, as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>quired by statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 466. Such a certificate is a prerequisite to jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal where, as here, \u201cthe detention is by virtue of process issued out of a State court\u201d. Botwinski v.
