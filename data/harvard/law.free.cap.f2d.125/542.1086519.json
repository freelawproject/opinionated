Co., 3 Cir., 105 F.2d 358; but ordered that it should \u201creceive notice of all matters arising in this proceeding with the right to participate therein.\u201d Not satisfied with this, the committee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">Section 77B, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, gave to \u201cany creditor or stockholder * * * the right to be heard\u201d only as to \u201cthe permanent appointment of * * * trustees, and * * * confirmation of any reorganization plan\u201d sub. c; \u00a7 206 now gives them \u201cthe right to be heard on all matters arising in a proceeding\u201d under Chapter X. This change was deliberate and was probably supposed ordinarily to give adequate protection, though \u00a7 213 assumes that a committee of creditors or shareholders may at times be allowed to intervene. We may assume arguendo that there are situations in which a single creditor or shareholder also may do the same. What the reasons are which should move a judge to exercise his discretion to allow either a committee or an individual to intervene, we need not consider, for the order on appeal gave to the committee at bar everything that it could possibly need \u2014 certainly in the district court. It will get notice of all \u201cmatters\u201d which will come up in that court, and the statute itself, \u00a7 206, gives it a right to be heard generally, as we have seen. There remains therefore only the possibility that it may not have the right of appeal if overruled. However, under \u00a7 77B we twice held that creditors might appeal from any order which decided a \u201cmatter\u201d as to which the statute then gave them the right to be heard. In re Barclay Park Corp., 2 Cir., 90 F.2d 595; In re Day &amp; Meyer, Murray &amp; Young, 2 Cir., 93 F.2d 657. And there can be no doubt that that is true under Chapter X which therefore extends the right to appeal to all \u201cmatters arising in a proceeding.\u201d In re Keystone Realty Holding Co., 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 1003, 1005, 133 A.L.R. 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Thus the order gave to the committee every substantial privilege which formal intervention would have given, even though \u00a7 206 alone would not have entitled it to any notices other than those especially provided in Chapter X \u2014 a point on which we do not pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
