The single question is whether the bankrupt kept sufficient records to merit the privilege of discharge under \u00a7 14, sub. c(2), of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-30\">On May 10, 1940, Marx filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and on the same day the court entered the adjudication. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>pellees, the trustees of the segregated trust of Park Savings Bank of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, duly made specification of four objections to the bankrupt\u2019s discharge. Hearings thereon were had before the Referee, who disallowed three of the four objections and denied the discharge for the remaining objection \u2014 the failure to keep books of account or record, from which his financial condition and business transactions might be ascertained. The District Court affirmed this decision and order of the Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Marx was a real estate broker. He sold properties on the commission basis, and bought and sold property in his own interest and collected rents. The depression hurt his business and by 1935 he \u201cwas practically hopelessly broke\u201d and creditors were beginning to \u201cdog\u201d him for the large amounts he owed. Starting in 1936 he bought and sold property in the name of his daughter, Marie C. Marx, and to protect against garnishment, he began to take bank accounts in her name per John H. Marx, trustee, or some similar designation. Marie had interest neither in the accounts nor, apparently, in the property bought and sold in her name. Marx paid no regard to the source of the monies, whether they were from commissions, rents, or sales; he deposited them all together in the same account and actively drew upon the account for every purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Marx kept no cash book, no day book, and no ledger. The bank and check books which he had were at variance with the bank\u2019s statements and Marx could not reconcile the differences. Some bills and receipts, and cancelled checks, he kept in card board filings. He produced an incomplete record of property listings with the name of the owner and commission paid, but the bankrupt admitted he did not sell all of them because some of them had \u201cflunked.\u201d He filed income tax returns for several years, but kept no copies, and the returns for three of these years had disappeared from the assessor\u2019s office and could not be found. These are the bankrupt\u2019s books of account or records from which his financial condition and business transactions are to be ascertained. The bankrupt admitted he could not show from the records how much money he took in or paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">What books of accounts or records satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 14, sub. c(2), are, of course, not a constant: In each case they are a function of the nature of the particular bankrupt\u2019s business transactions and financial condition. What would suffice in one, would be hopelessly unsatisfactory in another. Yet, the absence of articulated mechanics does not leave a broad area of uncertainty in which all must wander with no idea of whether they would be entitled to a discharge if economic misfortune should overtake them. Records or books of accounts are' but means to an end, the ascertainment of the bankrupt\u2019s financial condition and his business transactions, and any records which meet that end are satisfactory. They should show in some way his loss and gains, and present a satisfactory explanation of the receipts and disbursements. This condition precedent to discharge strikes at otherwise nondemonstrable fraud, for no longer does the successful objecting creditor have to .prove the absence or inadequacy of the records was with intent to conceal: the bankrupt must now really have the necessary records or explain why the circumstances of his case excuse his failure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By no longer requiring proof of such intent, the statute has narrowed the bankrupt\u2019s road to the salutary discharge. White v. Schoenfeld, 2 Cir., 117 F.2d 131, 132. Now, whenever a \u00a7 14, sub. c(2), objection to the discharge is raised, the bankrupt\u2019s records must be adequate, unless excused by circumstances, or the discharge will be denied. With this considerable penalty upon inadequate books'or records, perhaps the adequacy of the records kept will increase and thereby at least help remove whatever causal relation exists between inadequate bookkeeping and bankruptcy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The statute lodges in the bankruptcy court a reasonably wide judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>discretion in determining whether the failure to keep books of account or records was justified under all the circumstances of the case, and the determination of that question will not be disturbed on appeal except in case of abuse of such discretion. Rosenberg v. Bloom, 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 249 and Nix v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 38 F.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In our case, no study of the bankrupt\u2019s papers shows his financial condition and transactions. There is no acceptable justification under the circumstances ; consequently the bankrupt was not entitled to a discharge, Nix v. Stern-berg, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The judgement of the District Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-31\"> 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 32, sub. c(2). \u201cThe court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has * * * destroyed, mutilated, falsified, concealed, or failed to keep of preserve books of account or records, from which his \u2022financial condition and business transactions might be ascertained, unless the court deems such acts or failure to have been justified under all the circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> Prior to the 1926 amendment, the objecting creditor had also to show the bankrupt\u2019s intent to conceal. Prior to 1903 the objecting creditor had to show that such intent was also fraudulent and in contemplation of bankruptcy. Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Edition 1940, \u00a7 14:33 said \u201cthese stringent requirements, in many cases\u201d worked \u201cunmerited good fortune to the bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\"> Cf.
