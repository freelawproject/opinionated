In this order the Board found the respondent guilty of unfair labor practices in violation of Sections 8(1) and 8(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(1, 3). The trial examiner found there was no violation of the Act, and recommended dismissal of the complaint. The order affects the status of only one man, William Moegenburg. The Board entered a cease and desist order and provided that Moegenburg be reinstated with back pay. The only question presented is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">The respondent manufactures chairs and tables at Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Efforts had been made in 1934, 1937 and 1939 to organize respondent\u2019s plant by the Furniture Workers and Finishers, Local 133-B of the Upholsterers International Union of North America, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, hereinafter called the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">After the efforts of 1939, an election was held on March 15, 1940 and the union was designated as the bargaining agent. An effort was made to negotiate a contract but no agreement was ever reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">Immediately following the election, the union held a meeting. William Moegenburg, a fireman in respondent\u2019s plant, attended. He had formerly belonged to the union but had dropped out and had only recently rejoined. He complained at the union meeting about the firemen having to work seven days a week. The union took this up with the respondent, and the latter promptly arranged for the firemen to have one day off each week. There is no evidence that the respondent knew that Moegenburg had complained to the union or that he had attended the union meeting, or even that he was a union member.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">While Moegenburg and another fireman were discussing the change in their working conditions with engineer Nelson, the plant superintendent, Hamilton, came up and according to Moegenburg, \u201cbawled me out for squawking to other people and not coming to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">The evidence showed without dispute that Moegenburg was always \u201csquawking\u201d and there is no evidence as to what particular \u201csquawk\u201d of Moengenburg Hamilton had reference to or what \u201cot-her people\u201d he had in mind. There is no evidence that Hamilton knew Moegenburg was a union man or that he had attended the union meeting or that he had made a complaint at such meeting. It was common knowledge among those who worked with Moegenburg that he was not only a \u201csquawker\u201d but that he did not do his share of the work and was generally very non-cooperative. The trial examiner who saw and heard Moegenburg testify stated in his findings: \u201cThe undersigned, from his observation of Moegenburg during this testimony, concludes that Moegenburg has a very definite non-cooperative attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">Moegenburg had been a fireman in the respondent\u2019s plant since February, 1934. He was discharged May 4, 1940, for the reason, as assigned by the respondent, that he had failed to perform his work properly-</p>\n<p id=\"b499-20\">As stated before, the undisputed evidence shows that Moegenburg was non-cooperative, that he did not do his share of the work and that he was always complaining to his fellow employees. He was a \u201ctrouble maker,\u201d as his fellow firemen characterized him. He would not even cooperate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>affairs affecting the union that seeks now to protect him. On the day of the election for the purpose of determining the collective bargaining agent, Moegenburg was requested by his superior officer to come down and fire the boilers for a half-hour on that day to enable the other firemen to go vote, and he was promised pay for that half-hour. He said he was not interested in the union, he wanted to get his sleep, and he did not come down; but he had the effrontery to request the half-hour\u2019s pay for services he never rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Nelson, the engineer, plainly became annoyed with Moegenburg, due to his non-cooperative attitude and his failure to perform his duties. It became so bad that Nelson said either Moegenburg must go or he would go. There is not the slightest evidence that Nelson\u2019s attitude was in the least influenced by Moegenburg\u2019s membership in, association with or activities in the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The climax was reached the day before his discharge, when Nelson gave Moegenburg eighteen boiler caps to clean. This job should have taken Moegenburg not more than twenty or thirty minutes to perform. Moegenburg, however, had on previous occasions said to his fellow firemen that this was not a fireman\u2019s job, to clean boiler caps. Before his shift ended, he had cleaned only four caps, although he had had ample time to clean all of them, and he left the balance for the fireman on the succeeding shift to clean. Nelson had been watching Moegenburg and knew he had shirked his work. Nelson called the superintendent, Hamilton, and asked that Moengenburg be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Even after the decision, when Nelson and Hamilton communicated the facts concerning Moegenburg\u2019s conduct'to the personnel man, McNeill, who was also president of the company, the latter said: \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t you fire the man on account of this boiler cap business?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In the meantime, Mr. Fred Braasch, active in the company\u2019s management, joined in the discussion relating to Moegenburg and said:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u201cWell, you don\u2019t know the man, Harry. The man has a wife and a family and he is buying a house, I think. You have got to think of those things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u201cSurely,\u201d (McNeil said) \u201cwe have got to think of those things. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s just too bad, bat that sort of thing Mr. Hamilton has been describing can\u2019t go on. No matter how kind hearted you are, if that\u2019s the case, as the engineer says, that the man isn\u2019t doing his work, that he was told to do it and don\u2019t do it, the only thing is to get rid of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">The decision was to discharge Moegenburg because of his failure to do his work properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Notwithstanding this positive testimony that Moegenburg was non-cooperative, did not keep up his end of the work and had failed to clean the caps, as above outlined, and the positive testimony of the engineer, the superintendent, and the president of the company that Moegenburg was discharged because he failed to perform his work, and the fact that their testimony is not discredited in the least; and notwithstanding the fact that the trial examiner found there was no violation of the Act and he saw the witnesses and heard the testimony and found Moegenburg was non-cooperative, the Board found that because Moegenburg belonged to the union, attended a union meeting about two months before and complained to the union about having to work seven days a week, and during the discussion about the seven-day week, the superintendent, Hamilton, according to Moegenburg, \u201cbawled me out for squawking to other people and not coming to him,\u201d the Board found that the respondent had thereby violated Sec. 8(1) of the Act and that the discharge of Moegenburg was because he had complained to the union and not to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">No other employees, union or otherwise, were discharged, and there had been only one or two discharges in the plant for any cause over a period of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">The Board found this in face of the fact that Moegenburg himself testified that he was discharged because he had failed to clean the boiler caps as directed by Nelson. The following is Moegenburg\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">\u201cQ. So far as you know, they (meaning the respondent\u2019s officials) never knew that you were a member of the organization? A. I never spoke to them about it, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">\u201cQ. Then, how do you connect up the idea that you were fired because of union activities? I can\u2019t understand that. A. I didn\u2019t say that I was fired on account of union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t claim that? A. No, because they told me right out I was fired because I didn\u2019t have the caps cleaned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>That\u2019s what Johnny Nelson told me that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>That is, your impression is that you were fired because of your failure to clean the caps? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u201cQ. Is that right? A. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u201cQ. And. not because of union activities ? A. No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u201cQ. Then you, yourself, don\u2019t believe that you were laid off there because of any union activities? A. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Moegenburg went to Braasch, and asked to get his job back. About that effort to get back his job, Moegenburg testified as \u25a0follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u201cQ. You went to see Fred Braasch, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\u201cQ. Was there anything said about union activities that day? A. No, not a word.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\u201cQ. You told him you were fired, didn\u2019t you? A. That\u2019s what Johnny Nelson told me. I told him what Johnny Nelson told me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">\u201cQ. At least, you and Mr. Fred Braasch didn\u2019t get very far with Mr. Nelson, did you, in your efforts to get him to take you back again; is that right? A. Yes, that\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">\u201cQ. And Mr. Nelson was the engineer there, and he was your immediate boss? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">We think the Board was unwarranted in its conclusions based upon an inference drawn from the fact that Moegenburg belonged to the union, attended a union meeting, there made a complaint, and during the adjustment of that complaint Moegenburg said Hamilton \u201cbawled me out for squawking to other people.\u201d There is not one scintilla of evidence that Hamilton or any of the officials of the respondent knew that Moegenburg belonged to the union or that he had attended the meeting or knew about the complaint he had made at the meeting. There is no evidence as to who the \u201cother people\u201d were to whom Hamilton \u2022.referred. There is an abundance of undisputed evidence that Moegenburg was a chronic \u201csquawker\u201d and \u201csquawked\u201d to his fellow workmen repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">When honorable men, wholly unimpeached, testify' under oath to their reasons for discharging a man and such reasons are supported by all the evidence in the case and are not in any way connected with the discharged employee\u2019s union activities, the Board is not justified in discarding all of this evidence and finding the employer guilty of an unfair labor practice based upon a sequence of three or four unrelated events. Especially is this true when the employer had no knowledge of any of the events except one and the meaning of it was not established; and when the discharged employee testifies positively that he was not discharged because of union activities but because he had not done the work that had been given him to do, and thereby corroborates the contention of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-20\">Moegenburg was the only witness the Board had. The Board did not believe him or anyone else who testified directly in the case. It not only disregarded all the direct testimony in the case but also disregarded the trial- examiner\u2019s findings and report, even though he had seen and -heard all the witnesses and had made an adverse finding and observation as to the employee, Moegenburg. The Board should not discard the positive credible testimony of witnesses in favor of an inference drawn from tenuous circumstances that at best could have supported only an anemic suspicion. Such an inference does not meet the test of substantial evidence. Consolidated Edison Co. v.
