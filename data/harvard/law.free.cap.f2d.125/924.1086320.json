HAND, and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b987-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">The question presented is whether the constitutional \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d can be availed of by one who claims no interest in the premises searched or property seized. Without a warrant officers of the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue entered the house of one Nassetta and found in the attic an illicit still in operation. Nassetta and Daddio were forthwith arrested. The house was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Nassetta as their home. Daddio was Nassetta\u2019s uncle and had slept on the premises the previous night but he resided with his wife and children in a home of his own in the Bronx. He claimed to be a visitor at the Nassetta house and asserted no interest therein or in the property seized. Applications to suppress the evidence were made by both Nassetta and Daddio; the former\u2019s application was granted and the latter\u2019s denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">With practical unanimity the circuit courts of appeal have ruled that one who has no proprietary or possessory interest in the premises searched or property seized may not suppress evidence obtained by a search and seizure violative of the rights of another. The cases were collected in Connolly v. Medalie, 2 Cir., 58 F.2d 629, and there has been no later divergence. United States v. Goldstein, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 485, 489. In Alvau v. United States, 9 Cir., 33 F.2d 467, 470, the evidence was suppressed on the motion of a \u201cguest or employee\u201d who \u201cwas domiciled in the residence\u201d of another, and in distinguishing this case in United States v. Messina, 2 Cir., 36 F.2d 699, 701, we said that the party complaining of the evidence \u201cshould at least be dwelling\u201d on the invaded premises as an employee or guest. In two later cases we said that workmen \u201cnot dwelling\u201d on the premises could not raise the constitutional question. United States v. Muscarelle, 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 806; United States v. Conoscente, 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 811. Assuming without decision that these cases imply that a guest who did \u201cdwell\u201d on the premises might raise the question, the implication cannot avail the appellant who appears to have been merely a casual and temporary visitor. He was \u201cdwelling\u201d with his family in a home of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
