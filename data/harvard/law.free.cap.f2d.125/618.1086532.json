The jurisdiction of this court is invoked pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 836 (b). The petitioner is a non-profit wholesale cooperative association under the laws of Minnesota and is required by the statutes under which it is organized and its by-laws to annually distribute its \u201cundivided surplus\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d on the basis of patronage. Registered \u201cdistributors\u201d are permitted under the Act and Regulations to purchase coal at a discount from established prices and the controversy between the Coal Division of the Department and the petitioner concerns the right of this cooperative to receive such discounts on the coal which it purchases. The order to be reviewed recognizes petitioner\u2019s right to receive the discounts upon qualifying as an intervening agency for all sales of coal in not less than cargo or railroad car-lots to retail associations which are \u201cbona-fide legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organization [s]\u201d, but the right is denied in respect to any bituminous coal which petitioner purchases for re-sale to any organizations which do not come within the description of farmers\u2019 cooperatives. The order, as indicated by the accompanying opinion, was based on the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s distribution of its net income on the basis of patronage comes within the prohibition of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II (i) of the Act against securing for its patrons \u201ceither directly or indirectly a discount, dividend, allowance, or rebates, or a price other than that determined in the manner prescribed by this Act [subchapter]\u201d and that it can only be excepted from th.e prohibition as specified in paragraph 13 .of-Section 4 II(i), in respect to its business with \u201cbona-fide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organization]^]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Although on final analysis the question for our decision is narrow, its importance justifies somewhat extended dist\u00edussion. Counsel for petitioner have elaborated many particulars of hardship which have resulted and will result to it from denial of the \u201cdistributors\u201d registration and have clearly pointed out the highly beneficial character of its co-operative method of purchasing commodities and the desirability of extending the method to bituminous coal. On the other hand, counsel for respondent have taken the burden of epitomizing the general objects, scope and administrative application of the Bituminous Coal Act and the provisions thereof which they contend prevent allowance to the petitioner of any broader registration than it has been accorded in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The provisions of the Act primarily involved here are:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cSection 4 11(e) [\u00a7' 833(e)]. No coal subject to the provisions of this section shall be sold or delivered or offered for sale at a price below the minimum or above the maximum therefor established by the Commission [Division], and the sale or delivery or offer for sale of coal at a price below such minimum or above such maximum \"shall constitute a violation of the code * <em>* *.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\u201cThe making of a contract for the sale of coal at a price below the minimum or above the maximum therefor established by the Commission [Division] at the time of the making of the contract shall constitute a violation of the code, and such contract shall be invalid and unenforceable * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\u201cSection 4 11(h) [\u00a7 833(h)]. The Commission [Division] shall, by order, prescribe due and reasonable maximum discounts or price allowances that may be made by code members to persons (whether or not code members) herein referred to as \u2018distributors\u2019, who purchase coal for resale and resell it in not less than cargo or railroad carload lots; and shall require the maintenance and observance by such persons, in the resale of such coal, of the prices and marketing rules and regulations established under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">\u201cSection 4 II(i) [\u00a7 833(i)]. The following practices with respect to coal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shall be unfair methods of competition and shall constitute violations of the code:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">\u00ed|\u00ed jjc \u00ed|\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">\u201c12. Selling to, or through, any broker, jobber, commission account, or sales agency, which is in fact or in effect an agency or an instrumentality of a retailer or an industrial consumer or of an organization of retailers or industrial consumers, whereby they are [or] any of them secure either directly or indirectly a discount, dividend, allowance, or rebates, or a price other than that determined in the manner prescribed by this Act [subchapter].</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">\u201c13. * * * It shall not be an unfair method of competition or a violation of the code or any requirement of this Act [subchapter] (1) .to sell to or through any bona-fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organization duly organized under the laws of any State, Territory, the District of Columbia, or the United States whether or not such organization grants rebates, discounts, patronage dividends, or other similar benefits to its members; (2) to sell through any intervening agency to any such cooperative organization; or (3) to pay or allow to any such cooperative organization or to any such intervening agency any discount, commission, rebate, or dividend ordinarily paid or allowed, or permitted by the code to be paid or allowed, to other purchasers for purchases in wholesale or middleman quantities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">The Congress enacted the Bituminous Coal Act in an effort to stabilize the bituminous coal industry and to preserve the vast coal resources of the nation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In furtherance of these objectives it promulgated a system of regulation which centered around (1) the establishment of prices for bituminous coal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) the promulgation of a code of fair trade practices in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>order that producers of bituminous coal might realize, as nearly as practicable, their weighted average costs of production.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In the light of the history of the destructive competition which characterized the bituminous coal industry, it was clear that the Congressional purpose could be achieved only if care were taken to provide against avoidance or evasion of the price provisions of the Act. To that end Congress provided in Section 4 11(e) of the Act that \u201cNo coal * * * shall be sold or delivered or offered for sale at a price below the minimum or above the maximum therefor established * * From this broad prohibition Congress authorized only two exceptions. In Section 4 11(h) it authorized the allowance of discounts (in the amounts prescribed by the Division) from the minimum prices on sales of coal to \u201cdistributors\u201d who purchase coal for the purpose of resale and in the last paragraph of Section 4 II (i) it made a similar exception for coal sold to a \u201cbona-fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative\u201d or to its \u201cintervening agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In furtherance of the objectives of the Act, the Congress provided that a series of practices were to be deemed unfair methods of competition and were not to be engaged in by producers. Such proscribed practices are set out in Section 4 II (i) of the Act. Speaking generally, they are practices, previously employed in the coal industry, which have the effect of depressing the price of coal and which, if allowed, would facilitate the evasion of the price provisions of the Act. Among the proscribed practices are secret concessions, discriminatory extension of services, unjustified allowances, rebates, refunds, fee-splitting, and the sale to or through any broker, jobber, commission account, or sales agency which is an agency or an instrumentality of a retailer or an industrial consumer whereby they or any of them secure, either directly or indirectly, a discount, dividend, allowance, or rebate, or a price other than that determined in the manner prescribed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Pursuant to statutory direction, the Director, following lengthy public hearings, promulgated schedules of minimum prices which became effective on October 1, 1940. Coincident with the establishment of minimum prices, the Director also issued the Marketing Rules and Regulations. These rules and regulations were designed to implement the regulation of prices by establishing rules controlling the various aspects of the sale of coal. They are concerned, among others, with such matters as sales agents, discounts, spot orders, contracts, terms of payment, and unfair methods of competition. These rules and regulations also provide that discounts from the minimum prices may be allowed only to persons authorized to receive them \u2014 which, under the Act, means distributors and bona fide farmers\u2019 cooperatives \u2014 and shall not exceed the maximum discount prescribed by the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">In furtherance of the Congressional policy of permitting sales of coal to distributors and farmers\u2019 cooperatives the Division has set up a system of registration under which the maximum discounts <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prescribed by the Director are allowable only to those distributors and bona fide farmers\u2019 cooperatives which are registered with the Division.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Registration is afforded a distributor upon a showing that he is actively, continuously, and regularly engaged in the business of purchasing coal for resale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is stated by counsel that \u201cthe Division has since October 1, 1940, grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ed registration to 1,987 distributors. Registration is awarded a farmers\u2019 cooperative upon a showing that it is a bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organization duly organized under the laws of any State, Territory, the District of Columbia, or the United States. To date the Division has registered twenty-three bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperatives and four intervening agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Though the Division has recognized that it is not necessary for farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations to comply with the same requirements demanded of \u201cdistributors\u201d in order to receive discounts from the minimum prices and has consequently provided an entirely independent system of registration of each, it is required of both distributors and farmers\u2019 cooperatives as a condition to registration that they file an agreement not to violate, among other things, the minimum price provisions of the Act, the Marketing Rules and Regulations and the unfair trade practices enumerated in Section 4 II(i).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The essential facts are not disputed and it clearly appears from the evidence and findings of the Director that Midland Cooperative Wholesale, petitioner, is a nonprofit wholesale cooperative organized in 1926 under the laws of Minnesota. It is owned by approximately 200 retail cooperative associations operating in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota. Those retail associations are composed of approximately 110,000 individual members of whom over 85 per\u2019cent are farmers. All these constituent associations are not farmers\u2019 cooperatives but many fall within the category of consumers\u2019 cooperatives. Petitioner serves in the capacity of a wholesaler to '(or purchasing agent for) its member cooperative associations, supplying them with many types of commodities. Since 1934 petitioner has been supplying bituminous coal to about 45 of its constituent retail associations. The coal purchased by petitioner is purchased chiefly from mines operating in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky and shipped to the retail associations by rail or lake. Petitioner\u2019s annual sales to its retail associations have amounted to about 600 carloads or about 24,000 tons of coal. All coal handled by petitioner is purchased for resale and is resold in not less than cargo or railroad carload lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Under the Minnesota law and petitioner\u2019s by-laws (par. 7, ch. 382, Laws of 1919, amended by ch. 23 of the Laws of 1921 and ch. 326 of the Laws of 1923; By-laws, Art. VII), petitioner is required annually to distribute its \u201cundivided surplus\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d on the basis of patronage. Patronage dividends are distributed to each constituent retail association on the basis of gross operating margins on the total quantity of each major commodity purchased by it. If petitioner were permitted to register as a \u201cdistributor\u201d or otherwise permitted to purchase coal at a discount from the established prices the amount so derived and not expended in connection with the resale of the coal, and all other amounts made from the resale of the coal and not so expended, would be available for distribution to its constituent members as a patronage dividend.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>On December 9, 1940, petitioner filed an application pursuant to Section 304.11 of the Rules and Regulations for Registration of Distributors seeking permission to register as a distributor in accordance with Section 4 11(h) of the Act. A public hearing on such application was held before an examiner of the Division on January 6, 1941. The parties waived the preparation and filing of an examiner\u2019s report and the matter was thereupon submitted to Director Howard A. Gray, who, on May 22, 1941, made and entered his findings of fact and conclusions of law in this matter, in which he concluded that petitioner was not a \u201cbona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative,\u201d on the one hand, and could not qualify as a \u201cdistributor,\u201d on the other hand, because it was obligated to distribute patronage dividends on its coal business. However, the Director went on to say that because of the preponderance of farmers in the membership of the constituent organizations petitioner could qualify as an \u201cintervening agency\u201d in connection with the resale of coal to bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">To that end the Director entered an order as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u201cIt Is Ordered, That petitioner, Midland Wholesale Cooperative, may qualify as an intervening agency under paragraph 13 of Section 4 II(i) of the Act, for all sales of coal in not less than cargo or railroad carload lots to retail associations which are bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations, in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u201c(a) By certifying to the Bituminous Coal Division, under oath, the names of all its retail associations which are bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations duly organized under the laws of the state in which they are incorporated;</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\u201c(b) By agreeing, under oath, that it will not accept or retain any discount, price allowance, or commission on any bituminous coal which it purchases for resale to others than the bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations whose names are filed with the Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">It is from this action of the Director that petitioner has appealed and it is this order that it seeks to have set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">It is contended for petitioner (1) that being incorporated as a purchasing agent it is ideally qualified to serve the best interests of consumers of coal; (2) that Congress was not aware of any distinction between and did not intend to discriminate between so-called \u201cconsumer cooperative organizations\u201d like petitioner and so-called \u201cbona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperatives\u201d but intended to favor both alike in the Coal Act; (3) that the cooperative principle upon which petitioner is required by the Minnesota statute and its by-laws to distribute its savings is beneficial and not within the scope of any of the evils in the coal industry intended to be guarded against in the Act; (4) that petitioner comes within the class referred to in IS U.S.C.A. \u00a7 833(h) as distributors and therefore is entitled to be registered as a distributor, even though it may subsequently make distribution of savings contrary to the intent of the Act; (5) that its distribution of its savings is a matter remote from interstate commerce and not connected with it; (6) that the order of the Director should be vacated and set aside because its provisions are contradictory and inconsistent and impose arbitrary and unreasonable conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">(1) (2) Bearing in mind the primary objective of Congress in enacting the Coal Act to stabilize the bituminous coal industry and the provision of the Act that no bituminous coal should be sold at a price below the minimum therefor established, it is to be noted that two exceptions were made by authorizing sale of coal at a discount from the established minimum prices to \u201cbonafide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative [s]\u201d in paragraph 13 and to \u201cdistributors\u201d in Section 4 11(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">The phrase \u201cbona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative\u201d is not uncertain or ambiguous and there is nothing in the Act to indicate that the words were used in other than .their customary and understood meaning. The form of the phrase is obviously chosen to accentuate the particular type of cooperative organization to be distinguished from other types of cooperative organizations and the other types are excluded. To expand the exception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>paragraph 13 by identifying a consumers\u2019 cooperative with the farmers\u2019 cooperative would violate the cardinal rule of statutory construction which requires exceptions to be strictly construed. Also the description in paragraph 13 of a particular type of cooperative which is to be excepted from the general prohibitions of paragraph 12 necessarily excludes other types on the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The phrases \u201cfarmers\u2019 cooperatives\u201d and \u201cconsumers\u2019 cooperatives\u201d are words of art which have acquired a fixed meaning through judicial interpretation and otherwise. See Garden Homes Co. v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 64 F.2d 593, 596; Sunset Scavenger Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 84 F.2d 453, 455; National Outdoor Advertising Bureau v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 89 F.2d 878, 880; Co-operative Central Exchange v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 17. Numerous federal statutes expressly restrict their provisions to farmers\u2019 cooperatives, whereas others refer either to cooperatives generally or to specified .types of cooperatives. For example, Section 6 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 17, Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 291, the Agricultural Credit Act of 1913, 42 Stat. 1479, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 351, Section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 49 Stat. 317, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1141j; Section 203(b) of the Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 544, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(b); and Section 3(a) (5) of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 75, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77(c), are limited by their terms to farmers\u2019 cooperatives. On the other hand Section 4 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1528, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13b, refers to cooperative organizations generally<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> while the District of Columbia Cooperative Association Act, 54 Stat. 480, Pub. No. 642, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., refers to consumer cooperative associations alone (Section 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The pertinent legislative history of the Coal Act also demonstrates that the Congress intended to exclude such consumer cooperative organizations as the petitioner, which are not farmers\u2019 cooperatives, from the privileges accorded to farmer cooperatives in paragraph 13. The history has been summarized by counsel and is included because it is directly pertinent to decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\u201cN. I. R. A. Period. \u2014 The Standards of fair competition in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 are in a large measure carried over from the \u2018Code of Fair Competition for the Bituminous Coal Industry\u2019 existing under the National Industrial Recovery Act [48 Stat. 195], The provisions of Section 18, Article VI of that Code are so strikingly similar .to the provisions of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II(i) of the Act that it is deemed advisable to set them out in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The provisions of the N. R. A. Code were interpreted to prohibit the sale of coal to or through or .the giving of discounts to any cooperative organization. To correct this condition the President on October 23, 1933, issued Executive Order No. 6355, in which he recited that:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">\u201cIn a number of codes * * * which have heretofore been approved * * * there have been included provisions designed to limit or prohibit the payment or allowance of rebates, refunds, or unearned discounts, * * *. Question has arisen as to whether provisions of such tenor do not preclude the payment of patronage dividends to members of bona fide and legitimate cooperative organizations, including farmers\u2019 cooperative associations. * * <em>*\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Thereupon the President ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">\u201c * * * That no provision in any code of fair competition, agreement, or license, which has heretofore been or may hereafter be approved * * * shall be so construed or applied as to prohibit the payment of patronage dividends in accordance with law to any member by any bona fide and legitimate cooperative organization, including any farmers\u2019 cooperative, duly organized under the laws of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia or of the United States, if such patronage dividends are paid out of actual earnings of such cooperative organization and are not paid at the time when such member makes a purchase from such cooperative organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\u201cOn February 17, 1934, the President issued Executive Order <em>No. </em>6606-A, which supplemented and amplified Executive Order No. 6355, in which it was ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"ANh\">\u201c1. No provision in any code of fair competition agreement or license which has heretofore been or may hereafter be approved, prescribed, or issued pursuant to Title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act, shall be construed or applied so as to make it a violation of any code of fair competition to sell to or through, any bona fide and legitimate cooperative organization, including any farmers\u2019 cooperative, duly organized under the laws of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or of the United States, or to sell through any intervening agency to such cooperative organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u201c2. No such code of fair competition shall be construed or interpreted so as to prevent any such cooperative organization from being entitled to receive, and/or distribute to its members as patronage dividends or otherwise the proceeds or benefits directly or indirectly derived from any discount, commission, rebate, or dividend (a) ordinarily paid or allowed to other purchasers for purchases in wholesale or middleman quantities, or (b) paid or allowed pursuant to the requirements or provisions of any code of fair competition to other purchasers for purchases in wholesale or middleman quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\u201cThus by virtue of the Executive Order all cooperative organizations, farmers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 cooperatives alike, were afforded similar treatment. However, in May 1935 the National Industrial Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its decision in Schechter Poultry Corporation et al. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570, 97 A.L.R. 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">\u201c74th Congress. \u2014 Shortly after the invalidation of the N. I. R. A. both Houses of Congress passed substantially similar bills designed to salvage for the depressed coal industry at least certain of the benefits experienced under the Recovery Program. The bill passed by the Senate, borrowing the language of the President\u2019s Executive Orders, exempted all \u2018bona fide and legitimate cooperative organizations (including any farmers\u2019 cooperative * * *)\u2019 from the provisions of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II (i). But the House, whose original bill contained no exemption for cooperatives, did not join in this proposal, and in the conference the provision was narrowed to exempt only \u2018bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations.\u2019 It was this compromise version which passed both the Senate and the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">\u201cThe history of this legislation in greater detail is as follows: On June 13, 1935, Representative Snyder introduced in the House of Representatives H. R. 8479, a Bill designed to regulate the bituminous coal industry. This bill, while containing an enumeration of unfair methods of competition similar to that contained in Section 4 II (i) of the present Act, made no exemption for cooperative organizations. The Bill<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was reported to the House without amendment (79 Cong.Rec. 13195). In debate before the House numerous amendments were proposed but none concerned unfair methods of competition or exemption therefrom (79 Cong.Rec. 13442-13489, 13507-13572). On August 19, 1935, the bill passed the House with the unfair methods of competition provision unchanged (79 Cong.Rec. 13667).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">\u201cBeginning in January 1935 several bills for the regulation of the coal industry had been introduced in the Senate. The last of these, S. 2481, which was similar to H.R. 8479 and H.R. 9100, had been reported out of committee, but on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>22 consideration thereof was postponed indefinitely at the request of Senator Guffey, its author, because of the passage by the House of H.R. 9100 (79 Cong.Rec. 14085). During the debate on H.R. 9100 which took place on the floor of the Senate, Senator Murphy, of Iowa, proposed an amendment to Section 4 II (i) by adding an exemption for \u2018bona fide and legitimate cooperative organizations (including any farmers\u2019 cooperative duly organized under the laws of any State, Territory, District of Columbia, or the United States) * * *.\u2019 The introduction of this amendment was accompanied by a discussion in which Senator Murphy pointed out that he was trying to accomplish under the Act what the President had accomplished by his Executive Orders under the N. I. R. A., and that in the absence thereof paragraph 12 would make unlawful the sale of coal to or through cooperatives on the same terms as sales to conventional wholesalers. After some discussion, the amendment was agreed to (79 Cong.Rec. 14061, 14062) and subsequently the bill was passed by the Senate (79 Cong.Rec. 14084).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">\u201cThereupon a conference was had on the bill between the House and the Senate conferees. The conferees amended the provision adopted by the Senate and limited it to \u2018any bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperative organization\u2019 (H. Rept. No. 1895, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The \u2018Statement of the Managers on the Part of the House\u2019 accompanying the Report makes reference to the amendment with the following explanation (at p. 4):</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\u201cThe House recedes with an amendment which confines the operation of the provision to farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations and to intervening agencies in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">\u201cBoth the House and the Senate agreed to the conferees\u2019 report, and the Act passed both Houses of Congress (79 Cong.Rec. 14240, 14247, 14363-4), and upon approval on August 30, 1935, became Public No. 402, 74th Cong., generally known as the \u2018Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935.\u2019 49 Stat. 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">\u201cThe Act was short-lived however, for on May 18, 1936, because of certain labor provisions therein contained, it was declared to be unconstitutional. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160. Following this decision of the Supreme Court, attempts were made in both the House and the Senate during the Second Session of the 74th Congress to have new bills regulating the bituminous coal industry passed, but these attempts proved unsuccessful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">\u201c75th Congress. \u2014 The history of the provision exempting cooperatives from the effect of Section 4 II (i), which provision is the present paragraph 13, in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, parallels that of the similar provision contained in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1935. The single difference .was that this time the Senate proposed to limit the exemption to farmers\u2019 cooperatives as it had been enacted in the 1935 Act, which exemption the House, still somewhat inclined to oppose any special treatment for cooperatives, reluctantly accepted. This clearly appears from the more detailed history of the provision in the 75th Congress as is set forth below. '</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">\u201cOn January 6, 1937, promptly upon the convening of the 75th Congress, Senator Guffey introduced S. 1 which was referred to the Committee on Interstate Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(81 Cong.Rec. 64). The hill was similar to the 1935 Act except that it had been stripped of its labor provisions. The provision with respect to farmers\u2019 cooperatives was the same as that contained in the 1935 Act. During the hearings on this bill, attention was again directed to the problem of the exemption afforded farmers\u2019 cooperatives. See Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 1, 75th Cong., 1st Session, pp. 24 and 69. Certain members of the Subcommittee indicated a desire to drop the cooperative exemption, whereas others felt that if the exemption was to be granted, it might well be extended to all types of cooperatives. However, after some discussion the Subcommittee determined to retain the provision of the 1935 Act. This provision was accepted by the Senate Subcommittee and later recommended to the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">\u201cIn the meantime the House was considering H.R. 4985, a bill introduced by Representative Vinson on February 22, 1937, and referred to the Ways and Means Committee (81 Cong.Rec. 1476). That bill differed from S. 1 in that it contained no exemption for farmers\u2019 cooperatives. The House Committee on Ways and Means reported the bill without any amendment and with a recommendation that it be passed. See H.Rept. No. 294, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. During the debate and discussion which ensued in the House, Representative Boileau of Wisconsin, offered as an amendment to Section 4 II (i) the present farmers\u2019 cooperative exception, stating (81 Cong.Rec. 2115) :</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u201cThe sole purpose of this amendment is to provide that the restrictions of Paragraph 12 shall not apply to farmers\u2019 cooperatives and farmers\u2019 cooperatives only.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cIn the discussion that followed, the question was posed whether the amendment ought to be changed to avoid discrimination against consumers\u2019 cooperatives, but no move to effect any change was made (81 Cong.Rec. 2116). Following some discussion, the amendment, even though limited to farmers\u2019 cooperatives, was rejected (81 Cong.Rec. 2118) and the bill was passed by the House on March 11, 1937 (81 Cong.Rec. 2126).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\u201cOn the following day the bill was referred to the Senate which body referred it to its Committee on Interstate Commerce. In its report on that bill, as well as on S. 1 (S.Rept. No. 252, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.), it was recommended that the bill be passed upon the inclusion therein of the present paragraph 13 of Section 4 II (i). The bill with such a provision included passed the Senate on April 5, 1937 (81 Cong.Rec. 3145). The House refused to agree to the amendment and requested a conference (81 Cong.Rec. 3173). At the conference, the Senate included provision again controlled and the House voted on and passed a bill which contained the present paragraph 13 (House Conference Rept. No. 578, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; 81 Cong.Rec. 3390). The Senate also accepted the Bill as agreed to by the conferees, after assurance was given Senator Borah that the farmers\u2019 cooperative exemption had not been removed (81 Cong.Rec. 3315). The bill was signed by the President on April 26, 1937, and became Public No. 48, 75th Congress, known as the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">\u201c77th Congress. \u2014 Since by its terms the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 was to expire on April 26, 1941, the question as to the wisdom of extending it and as to the form in which it should be extended again brought before the Congress the necessity of considering the treatment given cooperatives under the Act. That the Division felt itself bound by the language of the Act to limit the exemption of paragraph 13 of Section 4 II (i) to farmers\u2019 cooperatives had already been indicated. Consequently representatives of consumers\u2019 cooperatives appealed to the Congress that the Act be amended to cure \u2018the defect\u2019 so as to include consumers\u2019 cooperatives within the scope of paragraph 13. Both the House and the Senate Committees rejected the requested modification. An attempt to amend the Act in this respect was made on the floor of the House and was defeated; a similar amendment proposed on the floor of the Senate was withdrawn.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Act, then, so far as cooperatives are concerned, was extended without change, paragraph 13 of Section 4 II (i) remaining limited to farmers\u2019 cooperatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">\u201cThe history of the discussion as to the modification of this section in connection with the consideration given the exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sion of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, is particularly illuminating. On January 31, 1941, Senator Guffey introduced S.J. Res. 32 and Representative Boland introduced H.J.Res. 101 (87 Cong.Rec. 438, 459), the functions of which were to extend the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 for a period of two years. Extensive hearings were held on these resolutions (and related measures). Hearings were first held by the House Committee on Ways and Means, at which representatives of consumers\u2019 cooperative organizations appeared and urged the immediate amendment of the Act in order to extend the exemption of paragraph 13 of Section 4 II (i) to wholesale consumers\u2019 cooperatives. Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.J.Res. 101 (Revised), 77th Cong., 1st Session, pp. 26-28, 125-131, 136, 138-141, 145-151, 153-155, 158-164, 172-174, 601. Though at the time Director Gray had not yet acted upon the application of petitioner, Mr. Fortas, then general counsel of the Division, made it known to the Committee that in his opinion the provisions of the Act precluded the extension to consumers\u2019 cooperatives of the treatment afforded farmers\u2019 cooperatives. Mr. John Carson, on behalf of the Cooperative League of the United States, was one of the many witnesses who presented the case of the consumers\u2019 cooperatives. He asked that the Act be amended so as to remedy \u2018a defect.\u2019<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">\u201cSeveral other persons, including Arthur J. Smaby, general manager of petitioner, appeared and testified in support of an amendment. Despite the many requests for amendment by representatives of cooperative organization interests, the Committee recommended extension of the Act, but declined to recommend any amendments concerning consumers\u2019 cooperatives.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When the bill was brought up on the floor of the House, Representative Gehrmann, of Wisconsin, asked that an amendment be adopted so as to extend to consumers\u2019 cooperatives the same treatment afforded farmers\u2019 cooperatives. The amendment, however, was defeated and the bill was passed without the amendment (87 Cong.Rec. 2665-2666).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">\u201cOn March 31, 1941, H.R. 4146 was referred to the Senate which body referred it to its Committee on Interstate Commerce (87 Cong-.Rec. 2692, 2698). A Subcommittee held hearings on the bill along with S.J.Res. 22 and S.J.Res. 32 and H.J.Res. 101. Here again the matter of amending the bill to provide for an exemption to paragraph 13 of Section 4 II (i) for consumers\u2019 cooperatives was acutely presented. Indeed, there was submitted for consideration a proposed amendment, introduced by Senators LaFollette, Ball and Capper, designed to accomplish that purpose. Here again extensive consideration was given to the desirability of amending the Act. See Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S.J. 22, S.J.Res. 32, H.J.Res. 101, and H.R. 4146, 77th Cong., 1st Session, pp. 4-18, 20-27, 30-36, 41-52, 55-610, 62-64, 102-105. The 'Subcommittee reported to the full committee which, while recommending passage of the bill extending the Act for two years, refused to recommend an amendment designed to allow discounts to wholesale consumers\u2019 cooperatives. Indeed, it said that \u2018more experience in the administration of the Act and more detailed consideration than is [now] possible * * * are necessary before the committee can recommend such legislation, if any, as is necessary to deal with these problems.\u2019 S.Rept. No. 169, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">\u201cOn the date of submission of this report, the Senate proceeded to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the bill. Senator LaFollette on the floor of the Senate offered the amendment previously considered by the Senate Subcommittee which was designed to authorize the granting of discounts to wholesale consumers\u2019 cooperatives. After some discussion, however, the amendment was withdrawn (87 Cong.Rec. 3039), but in the ensuing discussion, statements by Senators Barkley, Bone, and Norris gave ample evidence that there was a complete understanding in the Senate of the difference between farmers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 cooperatives (87 Cong.Rec. 3039-3042). Thereupon, H.R. 4146 was passed by the Senate on April 4, 1941 (87 Cong.Rec. 3044) and approved by the President on April 11, 1941, as Public No. 34, 77th Cong., 1st Session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">This legislative history indicates clearly that Congress was well aware of a distinction between consumers\u2019 and farmers\u2019 cooperatives, that it was well aware that the Act extended certain treatment to farmers\u2019 cooperatives which it did not extend to consumers\u2019 cooperatives, and that it fully intended to do so. Under such circumstances, petitioner\u2019s contention that Congress was uninformed and that it had intended to extend certain benefits to consumers\u2019 cooperatives in the enactment of this Act and the extension thereof cannot be sustained. Congress had the right to discriminate between the types of cooperatives and it manifestly did so,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the failure to treat them alike is neither novel nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Laws fostering cooperative marketing and purchasing by farmers have a common genealogy. They stem from a desire on the part of federal and state legislators to extend to farmers ways to enable them to counteract the effects of an increasingly urban economy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, loc. cit. 145 et seq., 60 S.Ct. 879, 84 L.Ed. 1124, 130 A.L.R. 1321; Liberty Warehouse Co. v.

The time may well come when the legislators will choose to extend the same or other encouragement to consumers\u2019 cooperatives. But, at least in the Coal Act, Congress has not taken that step.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">(3) (4) The nature of petitioner\u2019s activities is fixed by the Minnesota law of its incorporation and by its by-laws which impose upon it the obligation to operate upon the cooperative principle of distributing its savings on the basis of its patronage. As the petitioner is concededly an agency or instrumentality of its member retailers and consumers, its method of distributing its savings derived from discounts received by it manifestly results in securing to them \u201ceither directly or indirectly a discount, dividend, allowance, or rebates, or a price other than that determined in the manner prescribed by this Act [subchapter]\u201d within the plain meaning of paragraph 12. On these considerations the Director concluded the petitioner was not entitled to be registered as a \u201cdistributor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It is true the petitioner is an organization which purchases coal for resale and sells it in not less than cargo or railroad carload lots and Section 4 II (h) of the Act<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> makes provision for discounts and price allowances to be made to such purchasers referred to as \u201cdistributors\u201d. But the section does not provide that every one who purchases coal for resale and sells it in not less than cargo or railroad carload lots automatically qualifies as a distributor and becomes eligible to receive discounts from the minimum price. To be engaged in the occupation is merely one of the requirements. Another is that the \u201cdistributor\u201d, in the resale of coal, observe both the price schedules and the Marketing Rules and Regulations established under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">It is clear that in terms of the purposes of the Act and its general scheme of regulation it would be impossible to maintain a floor under the prices paid producers by retailers and consumers if distributors, who are given the privilege of buying coal at discounts from the minimum prices, stood outside the regulatory pattern. Distributors would then be able consistently to undersell producers prohibited by the Act from selling coal at prices below the minimum price levels established by the Division. The framers of the Act, cognizant of the difficulties which would result from leaving distributors unregulated, therefore imposed upon the Division the duty of requiring distributors to maintain and observe the schedule of prices and the Marketing Rules and Regulations. These Marketing Rules and Regulations declare the practices enumerated in Section 4 II (i) of the Act as unfair methods of competition for producers, to be unfair practices for distributors. The effect of this is to ensure that distributors do not take an unfair competitive advantage of producers as a consequence of the privilege they enjoy of receiving discounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">In furtherance of the duty imposed upon it by Section 4 II (h) of the Act of requiring distributors to observe the price and marketing regulations established under the Act, the Division requires, as a condition precedent to registration as a distributor, that each applicant for registration ' execute an \u201cAgreement\u201d to observe the prices established under the Act, to abide by the Marketing Rules and Regulations, and to comply with Section 4 II (i) of the Act. The exaction of such an agreement as a condition precedent to registration is in exact conformity with the statutory mandate that the Division \u201cshall require\u201d the maintenance by distributors of the regulations under the Act. Even in the absence of such a clear mandate, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>right of the Division to set up such condition as a prerequisite to the granting of a license to obtain the privilege of buying coal below the minimum could not be questioned. United States v. Shissler, D.C., <em>7 </em>F.Supp. 123. It is clear, however, that the authority of the Division to require each applicant for registration as a distributor to execute an agreement to observe the Act does not depend upon any general authority; it stems directly from the provisions of Section 4 II (h), the section dealing specifically with distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It is the nature of petitioner\u2019s activities which disqualifies it from obtaining authorization to accept discounts from the established minimum prices. Petitioner is not like conventional wholesalers, engaging in the business of buying coal and then reselling it to such customers as it is able to find; it is not a distributive agency standing between producer and consumer and independent of both; it is a .\u201cpurchasing agent\u201d for its member associations. <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As such it is an \u201cinstrumentality of retailers\u201d within the provisions of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II (i) \u2014 or Rule 12 of Section XIII of the Marketing Rules and Regulations \u2014 and therefore is prohibited from receiving any discounts from the established prices. This prohibition applies irrespective of whether or not petitioner thereafter distributes any part of this discount to its member associations in the form of a patronage dividend. The prohibition is against the acceptance of the discount without regard to whether the discount is subsequently passed on to the member associations. Petitioner\u2019s argument that it should not be denied registration as a distributor until it has actually distributed patronage dividends on its coal business, must, therefore, be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Moreover, even if we were to assume, in the face of the petitioner\u2019s articles of incorporation, that it is a distributive agency standing between producer and consumer and independent of both, this would not establish its right to a listing on the Division\u2019s list of approved distributors. For it is not every distributor that is entitled to such listing, but only those distributors who will proceed in compliance with the Act and with regulations issued thereunder. It is incumbent upon each distributor seeking to be listed by the Division to show affirmatively that its practices conform to these requirements and that it intends to continue to conform thereto. The Director is not bound to assume the burden of proving that any given applicant violates or intends to violate those requirements. On the contrary, the Director is justified in refusing the listing applied for in any case where the applicant fails to show the conditions that would affirmatively justify a granting of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">The record does not show either that the applicant was conforming to the requirements in question at the time the application was filed or that it intended to do so in the future. This alone suffices to justify the rejection of petitioner\u2019s application. The argument for petitioner that petitioner may perhaps fail to violate the requirements by not ultimately distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>buting its savings on a patronage basis does not suffice to compel, or even to justify, a listing of petitioner on the Division\u2019s list of approved distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In fact the record is less favorable to the petitioner than it would be if it contained no evidence whatever on the question of petitioner\u2019s conformity or intent to conform with the requirements of the statute. Actually, petitioner insists upon its right to pass along to its members, and ultimately to the consumers that it serves, the savings that might be derived from the distributor\u2019s discount that it seeks. \u25a0 Petitioner states that if it has any profit on its coal business, it plans to distribute it in the form of a patronage dividend.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, under the Minnesota law and its by-laws it is required to do so. Therefore, even if the only practice prohibited by the provisions of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II (i) were the passing along of the discount, petitioner still would not be entitled to registration as a distributor for it has failed to demonstrate that it does conform or that it intends to conform to all the requirements of the act, and has instead shown that it intends not to conform to those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">There can be no question that the distribution of a patronage dividend on coal sold at the minimum price would operate to decrease the sale price below the established minimum or \u2014 to use the words of the Act \u2014 to \u201ca price other than that determined in the manner prescribed by this Act.\u201d Having this effect, the payment by petitioner of a patronage dividend on such sales would be in violation of paragraph 12 of Section 4 II (i) and the corresponding provision \u2014 Rule 12 of Section XIII of the Marketing Rules and Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">in short, in the language of Section 4 II (h) of the Act, petitioner has not shown ability or intention to maintain and observe, in the resale of coal, the price provisions of the Act and Marketing Rules and Regulations established under Section 4 II (a) and (b). Every indication points to its being incapable of complying and unwilling to comply with the requirement, properly established by the Division <em>in </em>accordance with the language of Section 4 II (h) as a condition precedent to registration as a distributor, that it agree to observe the price provisions and the Marketing Rules and Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Under all these circumstances, it is clear that whatever discretion the Director has in the registration of distributors was properly exercised here by denying petitioner\u2019s application for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">It is of course true that there is nothing inherently evil in petitioner\u2019s practice of giving patronage dividends to its retail cooperative members, and that such dividends partake in no way of the unsavory character normally associated with rebates. But regardless of moral connotations, the Act is explicit in prohibiting \u201ca discount, dividend, allowance, or rebates\u201d whereby a retailer or industrial consumer is enabled to purchase coal at a price below the minimum price established under the Act. It is clear that what is prohibited here is any device which permits a code member to furnish coal to a retailer or consumer at a price below the minimum; since patronage dividends clearly tend to do so they are embraced within this broad prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">The classes of persons privileged to buy below the minimum price are by the Act strictly confined to distributors, who perform a marketing function of service to producers, and to bona fide farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations, which Congress has singled out to be favored in many statutes. There is no inconsistency with state law but the mere fact that consumer cooperatives have been given by state law the privilege of operating does not compel that they be given on that account an additional privilege under a federal law, namely, a privilege to buy coal at a discount from the established prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">(5) Petitioner\u2019s activities in the purchase of coal in the coal producing states and the sale of it in other states in interstate commerce and its receipt of discounts and ultimate distribution of the savings on the basis of patronage are intimately and directly connected with and affect such commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">Though a patronage dividend on its coal business would not be paid by petitioner until after the coal had come to rest in the retailer\u2019s yard or even later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>fact remains that the dividend is related to and based upon the sale of the coal which the record shows to be coal which was moved, in interstate commerce by rail or lake shipment from West Virginia and eastern Kentucky to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota. <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The fact that this payment comes after the shipment of the coal is completed does not serve to immunize its relationship from the interstate movement of coal. It is still as much a part of the transaction as if it were paid after each individual sale. Uniform Printing &amp; Supply Co. v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 88 F.2d 75, 76, 109 A.L.R. 966. Indeed, decisions under other federal acts regulating trade practices have never held that interstate commerce was not affected because the payment of the prohibited refund, rebate, discount, or dividend, or other prohibition took place after the movement of the goods in interstate commerce had ended. Quality Bakers of America et al. v. Federal Trade Commission, 1 Cir., 114 F.2d <em>393; </em>Biddle Purchasing Co. et al. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 687; Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 3 Cir., 106 F.2d 667, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 625, 60 S.Ct. 380, 84 L.Ed. 521; Webb-Crawford Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 5 Cir., 109 F.2d 268, certiorari denied 310 U.S. 638, 60 S.Ct. 1080, 84 L.Ed. 1406; Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 13 F.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">To accept petitioner\u2019s argument on this matter would go far to render impotent, if not completely to nullify, the effect of the provisions of Section 4 II (i) 12. To accept petitioner\u2019s contention would indicate to members of the coal industry that without violating the Act they may sell coal under a promise later to return to the vendee a rebate or discount and postfactum penalties would be completely ineffective as a corrective measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The patronage dividend is as much a part of the transaction as the price itself. If petitioner did not distribute patronage dividends or hold out they would do so\u2014 as under Minnesota law and its by-laws it must \u2014 there would doubtless be no sales of coal by it. Petitioner admits this.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is its promise and obligation to pay patronage dividends on this coal business that provides the incentive for the purchase of coal from petitioner, and it is not denied that petitioner\u2019s purchases of coal are purchases in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The payment of such dividend has the effect of decreasing the sale price below the established prices. It thus has an effect upon the price structure which sets the price for most of the bituminous coal production, all of which moves in or has been held directly to affect interstate commerce. Anything which affects that price structure necessarily affects interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Furthermore, the payment or even the expectation of the payment of patronage dividends has a direct and immediate effect upon interstate commerce in that the commission of any unfair competitive practices, enumerated in the Act, affects part of the industry and acts to disrupt the existing pattern of distribution and thereby must inevitably affect the interstate movement of coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The constitutionality of the regulation of unfair methods of competition by Congress, which regulation has been sustained by the courts, is predicated in a measure upon the disorganization of interstate commerce by competitive advan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>tages unfairly enjoyed. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 395, 60 S.Ct. 907, 84 L.Ed. 1263; cf. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238-330, 332, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160. In drafting the Bituminous Coal Act it was recognized that minimum prices could not be established, maintained, and protected if rebates, refunds, and discounts, and other allowances given purchasers which act to lower established prices were permitted. Such practices, if permitted, would serve to give one seller an unfair advantage over others. Translated into this case, it means that petitioner, owing to the distribution of patronage dividends, enjoys some competitive advantage over the conventional distributor. An advantage of this kind, it is obvious, would tend to increase the business of petitioner at the expense of its competitors and would thereby affect the distribution of coal in the area in which petitioner operates. The distribution of patronage dividends must, therefore, necessarily intimately affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">(6) We find no inconsistency or contradiction in the order made by the Director, The problem presented to the Director by the petitioner\u2019s application to be registered as a distributor was whether, in view of the nature of its organization and obligatory practices, petitioner could be authorized to purchase coal at a discount from the minimum prices for resale to those of its members which are consumers\u2019 cooperatives. That is the only question settled by the Director\u2019s order and the only question decided here. Responsive to that question the order consistently provides that petitioner may buy coal at- a discount for resale to bona fide and legitimate farmers\u2019 cooperatives, but may not accept a discount on coal purchased for resale to others than farmers\u2019 cooperatives. The only conditions imposed are that the names of the farmers\u2019 cooperatives be furnished, together with an agreement to proceed in compliance with the order. The requirements appear to be fairly and reasonably adapted to aid in the enforcement of the Act and are entirely consistent with its provisions and requirements and with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Whether consumers\u2019 cooperatives should be permitted to receive the discounts allowable generally to those who buy bituminous coal for resale and sell it in not less than cargo or railroad car load lots is for Congress and not for the courts, and Congress has acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> <em>Section 17 </em>(a) of <em>the </em>Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 847 (a), provides \u201cThe term \u2018coal\u2019 means bituminous coal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\"> Though this provision is found in the last paragraph of Section 4 II (i),' it will be sometimes referred to as \u201cparagraph 13\u201d of Section 4 H (i) for the sake of convenience and to avoid confusion with petitioner\u2019s brief wherein it is referred to as paragraph 13 and the Director\u2019s Order wherein it is similarly referred to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-19\"> The constitutionality of the regulatory provisions of the Act has been upheld.

The discussion of the 1937 Act on the floor of the House of Representatives included the following (81 Cong.Rec. 2116):</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">\u201cMr. O\u2019Malley. Would this amendment affect city people who happened to belong to a cooperative?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">\u201cMr. Boileau. My amendment applies only to farmers\u2019 cooperatives. It is the same language as appeared in the original Guffey bill (act) and in the bill as originally offered by the Gentleman from Kentucky. I anticipate the gentleman\u2019s question \u2014 why should it not apply to the cities?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">\u2018Mr. O\u2019Malley. That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">\u2018Mr. Boileau. We are out in the country. We do not have a coal agent out there in every community of the country. They want the right to buy coal in large lots, and the right to distribute it to the individual members of the cooperatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">See also the colloquy between Mr. Oarson of the Cooperative League of the United States and Representative Knutson which took place before a session of the House Committee on Ways and Means during the consideration' of the resolution to extend the Act, Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.J.Res. 101 (Revised)) 77th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 145-146:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">\u2018Mr. Knutson. Why can\u2019t you come in under subsection 2, page 12? Because you are not a farmer organization?</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">\u2018Mr. Carson. Tes. Midland and C.C. W. (Central Cooperative Wholesale) are not seeking to be classified as farmers. The Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperative is very determined to go into the cities. It is recognized as a farmer cooperative, but it prefers the right to expand its operations into cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">\u201cMr. Knutson. When they go into cities, with all due respect to them, they are not going to be able to get the concession given to farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">\u2018Mr. Carson. I think Mr. Lincoln will be willing to abandon those concessions if they prevent him from expanding his cooperatives into cities. I think he will be very happy to.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">\u201cMr. Jenkins. Tou know there are certain groups in the country, such as the farmers, that have the inside traek in the affections of the people, and the legislators. The farmers haven\u2019t got any more than is coming to them, but if they go down into the city to engage in business they cease to be farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">\u2018Mr. Carson.

In these cases the cooperatives have successfully contended that such funds are not taxable as income for they represent undistributed refunds or rebates upon the original sale. Gallatin Farmers Co. v. Shannon, 109 Mont. 155, 93 P.2d 953; Midland Cooperative Wholesale v. Com\u2019r, 44 B.T.A. 824, where the Board of Tax Appeals in sustaining petitioner\u2019s contention said, \u201cThe justification for the ruling rests upon the fact that the so-called dividends are in' reality rebates upon the business transacted by the association with its members rather than true income to the association.\u201d If for purposes of taxation the dividend is part of the original transaction, is it not equally a part of the original transaction for the purpose of this ease?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
