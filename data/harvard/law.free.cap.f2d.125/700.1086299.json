The jury and defendants\u2019 counsel noticed that the judge was gone, and counsel continued his argument. Nothing else happened. No motion or objection was made. The jury found the defendants guilty, and the action of the judge was complained of in a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-24\"> In a trial by jury the judge is an essential actor, and he should be present during all the proceedings. If he has to leave the bench, the trial should be sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>pended. It has by some courts been held reversible error in capital or other felony cases for the judge to leave the bench without suspending the trial, even when defendant\u2019s counsel is arguing to the jury. Slaughter v. United States, 5 Ind.T. 234, 82 S.W. 732; State v. Beuerman, 59 Kan. 586, 53 P. 874; Graves v. People, 32 Colo. 127, 75 P. 412, 2 Ann.Cas. 6; Turbeville v. State, 56 Miss. 793; See 23 C.J.S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 972. In the present case it clearly appears that no prejudice of any sort to the defendants occurred. Nothing happened during the absence of the judge except what their owfi counsel was saying. Counsel, on observing that the judge was absent, could have paused for his return, but saw fit to continue, and made no complaint until after a verdict of guilty. We think this is a clear case for applying the provision of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 391: \u201cOn the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions, which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">No other error being complained of, the judgment is affirired.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
