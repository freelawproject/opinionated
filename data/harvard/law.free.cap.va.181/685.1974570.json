Bazile, stated the question presented in this appeal and his reasons for his decision so clearly and so convincingly that the court adopts his opinion as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">\u201cThis suit started as a suit for the partition of a valuable farm in Henry District, Hanover County, known as \u2018The Grove.\u2019 By deed of May 2, 1903, R. R. Horne and wife, reserving a life estate therein for themselves, gave remainders therein for life to their sons George R. Horne and C. R. Horne with remainders after their deaths \u2018to their lawful children.\u2019 The deed also provided \u2018I wish my son George R. Horne to be given my dwelling house and seventy-five acres of land and no more, running from the main road towards Chickahominy Swamp.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">\u201cThis deed, although witnessed by two witnesses and duly acknowledged before W. C. Newman, a Justice of the Peace for Hanover County, was not admitted to record until September 15, 1909, after the death of the grantor. Who had possession of the deed in the meantime is unknown. However, the testator in his will, probated in the Clerk\u2019s Office of Henrico County on June 9, 1909, and dated July 30, 1908, speaks of this deed in such a manner as to indicate that it had been delivered prior to the making of the will, and it is the opinion of the court that it conclusively appears from the will that the deed in question was delivered prior to July 30, 1908, the day on which the will was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">\u201cIt may also be noted that the grantor R. R. Home, who had been the Treasurer of Hanover County for a number of years, was the owner of a large number of valuable tracts of land in Henry District, Hanover County, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>that, by the deed of May 2, 1903, he divided his various farms among his several children. The most valuable of these tracts was \u2018The Grove,\u2019 and it is the clause of that deed which disposed of \u2018The Grove\u2019 which is the subject of this suit. This clause of the deed will be quoted later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">\u201cC. R. Horne died July 15, 1930, leaving four children, the plaintiffs in this suit. It appears that they had contracted to sell that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 in which their father had been given a life estate, and the title examiner had raised some question as to whether the property had been properly partitioned between C. R. Horne in his lifetime and George R. Horne, who was then alive. This suit was accordingly instituted, in which the plaintiffs prayed for a partition of that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 taken by them under the aforesaid deed on the death of their father from that-part in which George R. Horne had a life estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\u201cGeorge R. Horne and all of the heirs of R. R. Horne, the grantor in aforesaid deed, other than the plaintiff were made parties defendant. George R. Horne, who was living at the time the suit was instituted, died, without issue, on August 19, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">\u201cThereafter on September 29, 1941, and on .October 29, 1941, certain of the heirs of R. R. Horne filed answers, by leave of court, in which they asserted that on the death of George R. Home, without issue, that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 which he had received under the aforesaid deed reverted back to the estate of R. R. Horne and\u201d passed to his devisees under the residuary clause of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">\u201cBy decree of December 4, 1941, this cause was referred to a Commissioner to ascertain who were the heirs of R. R. Horne, who were the necessary parties to this suit, and what were the boundaries fixed by the life tenants as between themselves in \u2018The Grove.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">\u201cOn December 24, 1941, the Commissioner filed his report in which he set forth the names of all of the heirs of R. R. Home, deceased (the same parties to whom the property would pass under the residuary clause in the will of R. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Horne), and reported that they were all properly before the court. He also reported that George R. Horne and C. R. Home had in their lifetime established a line of partition between the house tract given George R. Horne for his life and the balance of said farm given by said deed to C. R. Horne for his life, and returned a survey showing said line of partition thus established.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cBy a decree of December 26, 1941, the two tracts as thus divided by the life tenants were approved and partitioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThis left for determination the issue raised by the answers of the defendants, which contention is denied by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\u201cThe controversy before the court involves the construction of the following provision in the aforesaid deed of May 2, 1903, from R. R. Horne and wife to Annie C. Starke <em>et al.: </em>\u2018To George R. Horne and C. R. Horne, the remainder, after the life estate of the said parties of the first part (which fife estate is hereby expressly reserved) of the farm which the said parties of the first part now reside, called \u201cThe Grove,\u201d containing two hundred and sixty acres, more or less, adjoining the lands of C. R. Horne and the Mechanics-ville farm, bounded partly by the county road which leads from Mechanicsville to Ellerson, and partly by the Chickahominy Swamp, for their lives then to their lawful children. I wish my son Geo. R. Home to be given my dwelling house and seventy-five acres of land and no more, running from the main road towards Chickahominy Swamp.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\u201cIt appears from the evidence that shortly after the taking effect of the life estates given to George R. Home and C. R. Horne, they adopted a hedge row and fence as the partition fine between their respective estates, which fine was thereafter accepted as the fine between the places given them for fife by the aforesaid deed. By this line of division George R. Horne received 76.25 acres and C. R. Horne 194.6 acres. This line of partition was later adopted and approved as the line of partition between the respective parts of \u2018The Grove,\u2019 divided in accordance with the directions contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>in said deed, by decree entered in this cause December 26, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\u201cOn behalf of the children of C. R. Home, it is contended that the proper construction of the language of the deed creating the remainders in fee in \u2018The Grove\u2019 is that the remainders were given to a class composed of the children of both, if both have children, or if only one has children of the children of such one; and George R. Horne having died without issue the whole estate has passed to the children of his brother C. R. Horne, also deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, the heirs of R. R. Horne, the grantor in the deed, excepting the children of C. R. Horne, contend that the deed created life estates in separate and distinct parts of \u2018The Grove,\u2019 or, at the least, life interests in common, and that the remainders after their deaths must be construed to be distributive so as to give the share of each to his children if he has any; and, George R. Horne having died without issue, that part of the estate given him for his life reverted to the estate of the original grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\u201cIt is apparent that the remainders were given to a class. But the question to be decided is were they given to one class or to two classes. If they were given to one class, then the children of C. R. Horne would be entitled riot only to the remainder in that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 given their Father, but to the remainder in the estate given George R. Horne. If, on the other hand, two classes in remainder were intended by the words used in the deed, the children of C. R. Home cannot take as purchasers the remainder in the estate given by the deed to George R. Horne.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> \u201cThe law is settled that where a gift is to a class and it fails as to one of the class because of death, revocation, or any other cause, the survivors of the class will take. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>109 Va. 191, 195 (1909), and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\u201cIt is equally as well settled that where a legacy, devise or grant is to several, whatever may be their relations to each other, or however the statute of distributions or of descents might operate upon such relations, equality is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the rule, unless the testator or grantor has established a different one. <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Crow, </em>1 Leigh 74, 77 (18).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\u201cAs was said in the recent case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>171 Va. 153, 155-6 (1938): \u2018This rule of construction has been recognized and applied many. times by this court. See <em>Hoxton </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>18 Gratt. 574, 577; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>95 Va. 377, 381, 28 S. E. 570; <em>Whittle </em>v. <em>Whittle\u2019s Ex\u2019ors, </em>108 Va. 22, 25, 60 S. E. 748; <em>Driskill </em>v. <em>Carwile, </em>145 Va. 116, 123, 133 S. E. 773; <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>156 Va. 728, 739, 159 S. E. 106; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Ottley, </em>166 Va. 639, 641, 186 S. E. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> \u201c \u2018But it is equally well settled that the presumption of a <em>per capita </em>distribution is not a strong one and is easily overborne. It will yield to a very faint glimpse of a contrary intention in the context <em>(Hoxton </em>v. <em>Griffith, supra), </em>or a contrary intention deduced from a study of the will as a whole <em>(Murchison </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra; Ward </em>v. <em>Ottley, supra).\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> \u201cThe same rules applicable to the construction of wills are equally applicable to the construction of deeds. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Eckles, </em>99 Va. 668, 671, 40 S. E. 23 (1901). As was there said: \u2018Whether construing a deed or a will, the object is to discover <em>the intention, </em>which is to be gathered in every case from the general purpose and scope of the instrument, in the light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Stace </em>v. <em>Bumgardner, </em>89 Va. 418; Pom. Eq. Jur. (2nd ed.) sec. 1012.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">\u201c \u2018Technical rules of construction are not to be invoked to defeat the intention of the maker of the instrument, when his or her intention clearly appears by giving to the words used their natural and ordinary import.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">\u201cThe inquiry is, therefore, what did the grantor intend by the language he employed in the creation of the remainders in \u2018The Grove,\u2019 after the expiration of the life estate reserved and created by the clause which disposed of that farm? \u2018The intention of the grantor must be gathered from the language he has seen fit to employ.\u2019 <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Langhorne, </em>102 Va. 631, 637 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\u201cThe language used by the grantor here is: \u2018To George R. Horne and C. R. Horne <em>* * * </em>for their lives then to their lawful children.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cThe grant in remainder is to \u2018their children\u2019 meaning the children of the two life tenants. The grant is not made to the children of C. R. Horne nor to the children of George R. Home, but to the two brothers for their lives and \u2018then to their lawful children.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\u201cThese words necessarily mean their respective children because no children could be the children of both brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\"><em>\u201cIn re Hutchinson's Trust, </em>21 Ch. Div. 811, 816 (1882), is strikingly applicable to the case at bar. There a testatrix bequeathed personal property in trust for E. S. for life, and after his death for his issue, and on failure of his issue to F. H. S. and R. S. share and share alike and after the decease of F. H. S. and R. S. to their children share and share alike, and to their heirs forever. E. S. died without issue. F. H. S. also died without issue. R. S. died leaving issue. The children of R. S. claimed the whole fund, it being contended that the bequest after the death of F. H. S. and R. S., who were brothers, was a gift to a class composed of the children of both, if both left children, or, if only one left children, to the children of that brother, and F. H. S. having died without issue that the whole fund belonged to the children of R. S.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">\u201cThis contention was rejected by the court, which said: \u2018Now, what is the disposition? It is to their children. Well, following the decisions, and considerably assisted, I must say, by an argument which Mr. Hastings used, and which I adopt, that in that place this must mean their respective children, because there could not possibly be any child who could say I am the child of both, I am bound to read \u201cafter the death\u201d as meaning \u201cafter the death of each\u201d and \u201cto their children\u201d as \u201cto their respective children\u201d I admit the force of Mr. Hastings\u2019 argument on that part of the gift, and I think these authorities have laid down a rule of construction, which I am bound to follow; therefore, I so decide.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cIt was therefore held that the children of Robert Synge took only one moiety of the estate to be divided equally between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cTo the same effect see also, <em>Arrow </em>v. <em>Mellish, </em>1 De G. &amp; Sm. 355 (1847); and <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>4 L. Rep. 20, Eq. 342 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201cIn <em>Willes </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>10 Bevan 47 (1847), the testator gave his property in trust to be equally divided between M. J., C. L. and L. A., the interest arising therefrom to be equally divided share and share alike, between the said M. J., C. L. and L. A., separate from and distinct from their husbands, and for their sole use; and at their decease to be divided amongst their daughters. It was held that M. J., C. L. and L. A. each took one-third for life with remainder as to her one-third to her daughters, that is, the shares of the life tenants passed <em>per stirpes </em>to their respective daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\u201cIn <em>Tarriere </em>v. <em>Peakes, </em>2 Simon &amp; Stuarts Rep. 383 (1825), the testator provided a legacy of 600 pounds to F. for life and at her death to her two daughters in equal shares and at their death to their children. One of the daughters died without children. It was held that the children of the other daughter did not take the whole 600 pounds, but only their mother\u2019s share. Sir John Leach, V. C., said: \u2018Here the children of each daughter must plainly take their mother\u2019s share upon her death; and there are no words which can carry one daughter\u2019s share to the surviving daughter or her children.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">\u201cThe English cases uniformly hold that the words \u2018their children,\u2019 when employed in gifts of future estates after life estates given to two or more brothers or sisters with remainder \u2018to their children,\u2019 invariably means to \u2018their respective children\u2019 for the all sufficient reason that no child can possibly be the child of both brothers or sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">\u201cThe grantor in making the deed in question was,- of course, aware of the fact that George R. Horne could not be the father of C. R. Home\u2019s lawful children and likewise that C. R. Home could not be the father of George R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Horne\u2019s lawful children. It must, therefore, be concluded that in using the words \u2018to George R. Horne and C. R. Horne * # * for their lives, then to their lawful children,\u2019 he meant \u2018their respective lawful children,\u2019 and it is so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\u201cThis conclusion is fully supported by what was said by the Court of Appeals in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>171 Va. 153, 157 (1938). In that case the testator devised one-fifth part of his estate to each of two sons for their lives \u2018and at the death of my said sons Jefferson D. Kelly and William H. Kelly their shares to pass to their children or their descendants.\u2019 In construing another provision of the will it became necessary for the Court to consider and construe the quoted provision. In doing so, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Eggleston, said: \u2018Moreover, in another portion of the paragraph under review, the testator has dealt with the children of Jefferson D. Kelly and the children of William H. Kelly as separate classes. He provides that upon the death of his sons, Jefferson and William, their shares of the property which he had devised to them for their respective lives should \u201cpass to their children or their descendants,\u201d <em>which, of course, means that Jefferson\u2019s share should pass to his children, and that Williams share should pass to the latter\u2019s children </em>* * * .\u2019 (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\u201cAlthough the reason heretofore assigned is conclusive of the issue here, there is another well established reason why the children of C. R. Horne are not entitled as purchasers under the above mentioned deed to the remainder in that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 given to George R. Horne. That reason is that the two life estates of Geo. R. Horne and C. R. Horne in \u2018The Grove\u2019 were not a joint estate in that plantation, but estates in separate and distinct parts of \u2018The Grove\u2019 certainly not less than life estates in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">\u201cIn <em>Carneal </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>91 Va. 114, 117 (1895), it is said: \u2018Mr. Minor says: \u201cA tenancy in common is where two or more hold the same land with interests accruing under the same title, but at different periods; or conferred by words of limitation importing that the grantees are to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>in distinct shares.\u201d 2 Minor\u2019s Insts. 494, citing 1 Stephen Com. 323.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\u201cIt is evident from the terms of the deed that George R. Horne and C. R. Horne were given distinct shares in \u2018The Grove\u2019 and they so construed the deed by promptly establishing a line of partition between their respective parcels in accordance with the directions contained in the deed granting their life estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\u201cIt has been generally held that the fact that the will or deed creates life tenancies in common indicates an intent on the part of the testator or grantor that the remainders shall pass <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\u201cThus, in 2 Jarman on Wills (6th Am. Ed.), pp. 207-8, it is said: \u2018 # * * The conclusion then depends in a great measure upon whether the tenants for life take jointly or as tenants in common. If the latter, then as the share of anyone will on his decease, go over immediately, without waiting for the other shares, it is probable that the testator intended it to continue separate and distinct from the other shares, and consequently, to devolve on the children <em>per stirpes. </em>If otherwise, then it would follow that the different shares would go to different classes of children; for after the death of the tenant for life who first died, another might have more children, who would be entitled to participate in a share of any tenant for life who died afterwards.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">\u201cSee also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>42 N. J. Eq. 559, 561-2 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">\u201cIn <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Fauver, </em>2 Va. Dec. 555, 556 28 S. E. 317 (1897), the will provided: \u2018The balance I will and bequeath to my sisters or their heirs equal to all.\u2019 The testator had several sisters who survived him and one sister who predeceased him leaving a number of children. The court held that the division should be <em>per stirpes, </em>and that the children of the deceased sister were entitled to the share which their mother would have taken had she been alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">\u201cSee also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>171 Va. 153, 157 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">\u201cGeorge R. Horne having died without issue the estates created by the above mentioned deed in his part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 have terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201cThe contingency on the happening of which an estate in fee simple was granted therein never occurred and is now impossible of happening. Therefore, that part of \u2018The Grove\u2019 granted to George R. Horne for his life has reverted by operation of law\u201d to the estate of the original grantor and has become vested under the residuary clause in the will of R. R. Horne.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
