In substance, the notice of motion alleged that the defendant was the owner and operator of a coal mine in Lee county, Virginia, in which the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was, at the time of his death, employed; that the defendant owed its employees the duty of furnishing them a reasonably safe place in which to work, and to that end should have installed in the mine the necessary devices or equipment to ventilate it properly, and to prevent the accumulation therein of noxious gases and poisonous fumes known to it to be dangerous; that the defendant negligently failed and refused to perform its said duty, as the proximate result of which noxious gases and poisonous fumes accumulated in the mine \u201cwhere plaintiff\u2019s intestate was required to go and where he was assigned to work, and that through the process of inhaling (,) said fumes and gases entered the alveoli and air sacs of the lungs of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, producing no traumatic effect, but gradually suffocating and poisoning plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which after a lapse of time and continued exposure to said gases and fumes resulted in a weakening of <em>plaintiffs </em>body to such an extent that when he realized the danger he was in on account of the presence of said gases and fumes in the air and the absence of a sufficient amount of oxygen, that he was unable to remove himself from his said working place, whereupon his condition gradually grew worse and after a time he was asphyxiated and suffocated and did then and there die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">It was further alleged that the defendant, with full knowledge of the unsafe and dangerous condition in the mine, and of the place where the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was required to work, negligently and carelessly sent him into the mine' \u201cwithout sufficient air circulated therein as aforesaid, and without any check on plaintiff\u2019s intestate with reference to his going in and out of said mine, and without notifying plaintiff\u2019s intestate that his safety and life <em>ovas </em>menaced by the condition of the air in said working place\u201d, and as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>proximate result of the negligence of the defendant and its officers and agents the plaintiff\u2019s decedent \u201cwas caused to inhale said * * # noxious gases and poisonous fumes\u201d, \u201cand as a direct result thereof * # * was then and there, while in his working place in said mine, gradually, but not accidentally, asphyxiated and suffocated, and which effected and was the proximate cause of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The defendant filed a demurrer to the notice of motion for judgment, and to each count thereof, alleging in substance that by virtue of the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act the lower court was deprived of jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit. To a judgment sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action the plaintiff has obtained this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention before us is that the notice of motion shows on its face that her cause of action is not compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Acts 1918, ch. 400, p. 637, as amended; Michie\u2019s Code of 1942, section 1887(1), et seq.), and that hence she has the right to pursue her action at law against the decedent\u2019s employer under our holding in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Co., </em>179 Va. 790, 20 S. E. (2d) 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the notice of motion shows on its face that the death of the employee was not due to an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the meaning of subsection (d) of section 2 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Michie\u2019s Code of 1942, section 1887(2)'^).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The plaintiff admits that her allegation that the employee\u2019s death happened \u201cnot accidental\u201d is \u201ca mere conclusion of the pleader\u201d and is not determinative of the question before us. This position is correct, and the same may be said- of the allegation that the inhalation of the poisonous gases produced \u201cno traumatic effect\u201d on decedent\u2019s body. But, aside from this, the plaintiff insists that her other allegations show that the deceased did not suffer an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">First, it is argued that asphyxiation or suffocation by the natural and physiological process of inhaling poisonous gases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>which results in no \u201ctearing, bruising, mashing, or changing of the tissues\u201d of the body, is not an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"> We can not agree with this contention. We have frequently said that the words \u201cinjury by accident\u201d must be liberally construed in favor of the workman to carry out the humane and beneficent purposes of the Act. <em>Lynchburg Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>178 Va. 265, 269, 270, 16 S. E. (2d) 646, 648, and cases there cited. This liberal interpretation was applied in <em>Burlington Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Hagood, </em>177 Va. 204, 13 S. E. (2d) 291, where we affirmed an award for a severe nervous shock resulting in disability, even though there was no objective damage to the tissues of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Practically all of the authorities now agree that disability or death of an employee from inhaling poisonous gases is compensable provided the other circumstances are such as to bring the matter within the scope of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. See annotations in 6 A. L. R. 1466, 23 A. L. R. 335, and 90 A. L. R. 619, for a collection of such cases. For an exhaustive discussion of the subject see <em>Industrial Commission </em>v. <em>Tolson, </em>37 Ohio App. 282, 174 N. E. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">It is argued in the plaintiff\u2019s brief that such exposure is peculiar to employees in mines, and that an injury therefrom is in the nature of an occupational disease which is not compensable under the holdings in <em>Clinchfield Carbocoal Corp. </em>v. <em>Kiser, </em>139 Va. 451, 124 S. E. 271. However, there is no such allegation in the notice of motion for judgment, and hence, on a consideration of the demurrer, we are not called upon to decide that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The plaintiff next argues that her allegation, that the decedent was \u201cgradually suffocated\u201d \u201cafer a lapse of time and continued exposure\u201d to the noxious gases, negatives the idea that there was a \u201csudden event\u201d such as is contemplated by the word \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In 25 Harvard Law Review 328, 342, the author deduces this rule from the decisions of the courts in England wherein our workmen\u2019s compensation laws had their origin: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cThe injury, to be regarded as \u2018by accident,\u2019 must be received * * * at a particular time and in a particular place and by a particular accident. And the accident must be something the date of which can be fixed. It is not enough that the injury shall make its appearance suddenly at a particular time and upon a particular occasion.\u201d In other words, the \u201cincident,\u201d the act done or condition encountered, \u201cmust be shown to have occurred at some reasonably definite time\u201d (id., pp. 342-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On the other hand, as the author says (id., p. 343), \u201c * # * injury of gradual growth, * * * not the result of some particular piece of work done or condition encountered on a definite occasion, but caused by the cumulative effect of many acts done or many exposures to conditions prevalent in the work, no one of which can be identified as the cause of the harm, is definitely excluded from compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The author further points out (id., pp. 346-8) that there are two practical reasons for this rule. First, if the event can not be fixed with reasonable certainty the employer can not be given the notice required by the Act, and hence it will be difficult for him to verify the claim and protect himself against fraud and imposition. Second, allowing compensation for injuries gradually received would impose upon the last employer the burden of pensioning every workman worn out or invalided by unhealthful exposure on the part of former employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">This view has been adopted by the great weight of authority in this country. See, Schneider, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, 2d. Ed., sec. 135, pp. 512, 513; 71 C. J., sec. 329, p. 572. See also, <em>Peru Plow, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>311 Ill. 216, 142 N. E. 546, 549; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>International High Speed Steel Co., </em>98 N. J. L. 574, 120 A. 188; <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Renegar, </em>167 Okla. 496, 30 P. (2d) 922, 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">This principle was applied in <em>General Printing Corp. </em>v. <em>Umback, </em>100 Ind. App. 285, 195 N. E. 281. That was an action at law for wrongful death due to the alleged negligence of the employer in having exposed an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to lead poisoning over a considerable period of time. It was there held (195 N. E., at page 284) that \u201cWhether the employee died as the result of a disease from injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, or whether his death was the result of the negligent ventilation of the workroom in which he performed his labors, unattended by any injury because of accident, was a question of fact\u201d for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co., </em>162 Tenn. 523, 39 S. W. (2d) 272, a recovery in an action at law for damages for injuries sustained from the gradual inhalation of dust, fumes and gases while working in a coal mine, because of the employer\u2019s negligence in failing to furnish proper ventilation, equipment and air courses, was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Similarly, a common-law action for damages for injuries to, or death of, an employee due to the gradual inhalation of poisonous gases over a considerable period was held to be the appropriate remedy in <em>Knaup </em>v. <em>Western Coal, etc., Co., </em>342 Mo. 210, 114 S. W. (2d) 969; <em>Echord </em>v. <em>Rush, </em>124 Kan. 521, 261 P. 820; <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Swann Chemical Co., </em>234 Ala. 313, 174 So. 530; <em>Mauchline </em>v. <em>State Insurance Fund, </em>279 Pa. 524, 124 A. 168; <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Mowry, 167 </em>Okla. 644, 31 P. (2d) 562; <em>Liondale Bleach Dye, etc., Works </em>v. <em>Riker, </em>85 N. J. L. 426, 89 A. 929; 4 N. C. C. A. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">But it is equally well settled that where the disability or death of the employee is due to the inhalation of poisonous gases at a particular time and on a particular occasion which can be fixed with reasonable certainty, the event is an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the meaning of the compensation acts and is compensable thereunder. <em>Industrial Commission </em>v. <em>Tolson, supra; New Marissa Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>326 Ill. 116, 157 N. E. 32; <em>Mauchline </em>v. <em>State Insurance Fund, supra; New River Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Files, </em>215 Ala. 64, 109 So. 360; <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>63 Ga. App. 530, 11 S. E. (2d) 699; <em>Gurski </em>v. <em>Susquehanna Coal Co., 262 </em>Pa. 1, 104 A. 801. Other similar cases are collected in 90 A. L. R. 620-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The Industrial Commission of Virginia has applied the same principles and has allowed compensation for death Or disability due to inhaling poisonous fumes or gases on a particular occasion and at a particular time. See, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Crowell Auto Co., </em>9 O. I. C. 156; <em>Embrey </em>v. <em>Southern Chemical Co., </em>13 O. I. C. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Tested by these principles we think the notice of motion does not necessarily allege that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was due to the sudden inhalation of gas on a particular occasion and at a particular time which can be fixed with reasonable certainty so as to exclude the common-law remedy for the alleged wrongful death and show that the matter is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The allegation is, \u201cthat through the process of inhaling (,) said fumes and gases entered the alveoli and air sacs of the lungs of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, * # <em>* </em>gradually suffocating and poisoning plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which after a lapse of time and continued exposure to said gases and fumes resulted in a weakening of <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>body to such an extent <em>* </em>* * that he was unable to remove himself from his said working place, whereupon his condition gradually grew worse and after a time he was asphyxiated and suffocated and did then and there die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">There is no allegation as to the length of the \u201clapse of time\u201d or the duration of the \u201ccontinued exposure\u201d to which the decedent was subjected. Nor does the notice of motion for judgment allege the duration of the period during which the decedent was being \u201cgradually\u201d suffocated and poisoned. Under the allegation the continued exposure and gradual suffocation could have taken place on a single day, or it may have extended over a considerable period of time. In other words, the allegation is broad enough to cover an event which may be actionable at law or one which may be compensable under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Since the notice of motion does not affirmatively show on its face that the lower court has been deprived of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of the subject-matter of the suit by the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as alleged in the demurrer, the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">But there is a further reason why the demurrer should have been overruled. Section 15 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (as amended by Acts 1932, ch. 19, p. 17; Acts 1938, ch. 249, p. 386; Michie\u2019s Code of 1936, section 1887(15) ), as it stood at the time of this occurrence, in August, 1941, expressly excludes from its provisions, among others, the situation where less than eleven<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> employees are regularly in service, \u201cunless such employees and their employers voluntarily elect to be bound by this act.\u201d In the absence of an allegation that the defendant had in its employ the requisite number of employees, or that it and its employees had voluntarily elected to be bound by the Act, as required by this section, it does not necessarily appear from the notice of motion for judgment that the Industrial Commission has jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">From what we have said it does not follow that the plaintiff necessarily has a good cause of action at law. Whether that is so or whether the matter is governed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act will depend upon the application of the principles which we have here stated to the facts and circumstances to be developed at the hearing. All we have decided is that the plaintiff\u2019s notice of motion for judgment does not show on its face that her remedy is under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and is not in the present common-law action.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">For these reasons the judgment complained of is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\">For subsequent amendment reducing the required number of employees to seven, see Acts 1942, ch. <em>162, </em>p. 205; Michie\u2019s Code of 1942, section 1887(15).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
