J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkM\">Alicia and Greg Remsen, brother and sister and beneficiaries under the trust of their great-grandparents, appeal from the order of the probate court reconsidering its previous ruling that they were entitled to interest on their cash bequests and entering a new ruling that no interest was due. The trustees appeal from the probate court\u2019s order that the Remsens\u2019 petitions did not violate the trust\u2019s no contest clause. The Remsens moved to dismiss the trustees\u2019 appeal for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">We affirm the order denying interest and grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">In 1983 Willard and Ruth Cain created a revocable inter vivos trust. At the time, they owned 3.7 acres of beachfront property in Laguna Beach, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>they believed was worth over $10 million. The Cains decided to leave $1 million to their daughter; $300,000 to a friend; $200,000 to a cousin; $100,000 to each of their seven great-grandchildren; and the remainder to the principal beneficiaries, their four grandchildren. The terms of the trust provided distribution of the trust assets was not to be made until after all debts, taxes and administration expenses were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Willard and Ruth passed away in August 1987 and January 1988, respectively. The Cains\u2019 granddaughter, Carol E. Lavacot, and her husband, Robert Lavacot, served as cotrustees. The trustees gave the beneficiaries copies of the trust and said the trust money would not be available until the Laguna property was sold and all the taxes were paid. After approximately a year had passed, the trustees held a meeting with the beneficiaries to update them on the status of the trust and advised them that the Laguna property had not yet been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In November 1990, the Cains\u2019 great-granddaughter, Alicia Remsen, filed a petition demanding the trustees distribute her $100,000 inheritance. The trustees explained to the court that the trust funds could not be distributed because they were having difficulty selling the Laguna property. All offers to purchase had been contingent on the estate securing a city-approved tract map, which could not be obtained until the estate received: (1) approval from the Laguna Beach Planning Commission, which currently had concerns about the size and number of lots to be created; (2) approval from the city counsel; (3) resolution of claims made by State Lands Commission seeking lateral public access across the public trust tidelands located within the property; (4) an agreement with the Coastal Commission, which wanted vertical access for the public from Pacific Coast Highway to the coastal portions of the property; (5) an agreement with the County of Orange, which demanded access to the beach for its emergency and trash vehicles; and (6) resolution of a lawsuit filed by an adjacent owner to quiet title to a claimed easement. The court denied Alicia\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Six years later, the trustees sent Alicia a letter stating escrow had \u201cfinally open[ed] on the trust property. The sale price is $5,200,000. At the close of escrow, there will be $3,200,000 paid with the remainder financed by us at a rate of 8%. fl[] Unfortunately, the IRS will take its cut which amounts to almost $2,000,000 and the State of California their cut, the amount not determined as yet. There are also administration costs that must be paid which also are, as yet, undetermined. As you can see, it will take some time to figure this all out. [H] [When escrow closes, our] plan is to get everyone together for a meeting . . . and hopefully, distribute a percentage of your inheritance at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Alicia received another letter from the trustees in January 1997 stating escrow had closed on the Laguna property but the trust received very little cash from the sale due to death taxes owed and closing costs. The trustees said they had applied for \u201can overpayment reimbursement from the IRS\u201d and expected to be able to make a distribution when it arrived in a few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Alicia replied with a letter requesting documentation of the trust\u2019s assets and liabilities and a complete accounting. In April 1997, the trustees informed her she could have any information she wanted regarding the trust, but they did not want to deplete trust resources to have the volumes of documents photocopied. They invited Alicia to make an appointment and view the documents at their accountant\u2019s office. The trustees said they were planning to give Alicia her inheritance, \u201cminus the expenses incurred to fight her lawsuit,\u201d as soon as the money became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Apparently Alicia and her brother Greg decided they could not wait any longer. On November 4, 1997, they filed a petition to direct the trustees to give them $100,000 each, plus interest from July 1, 1989, and attorney fees. They asked for an accounting and requested that Alicia\u2019s distribution not be reduced by costs incurred by the trust in defending against her 1990 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In an effort to settle the case, the trustees sent Alicia a check for $85,000 and a letter stating the remainder would be delivered in proportioned amounts as soon as the trustees received payments from the buyer of the Laguna property. They also included a $85,000 check for her to give to Greg. Four months later, counsel for the Remsens informed the trustees that they were not interested in settling the lawsuit and wanted to be paid the rest of their inheritance plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In June 1998 the trustees filed an application seeking a determination that Alicia\u2019s petition in 1990 and the current petition qualified as \u201ccontests.\u201d The trustees\u2019 application and the Remsens\u2019 1997 petition were heard together on July 31, 1998. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the court issued two minute orders. The first granted the Remsens\u2019 petition, stating, \u201cCourt finds $100,000 cash bequests to be \u2018general pecuniary devise[sj\u2019 entitled to earn interest after [one] year, if not yet distributed; payment of earned interest depends on estate ability, [f] Court finds no authority for trustee to deduct atty. fees for cost of past trust litigation.\u201d The minute order also provided: \u201cCsl Samuelson to prepare order.\u201d The second minute order denied the trustees\u2019 application, stating, \u201c[The] court finds no violation of [the trust\u2019s] in terrorem clause . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">On August 6, 1998, the trustees filed motions to reconsider both rulings. Four days later, they filed a petition for instructions, informing the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>if interest was due on the cash bequests, no money would be left for the remainder primary beneficiaries (the grandchildren). The Remsens filed opposition to the motions for reconsideration and a response to the petition for instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On September 4, 1998, the court heard the motions and petition and issued three minute orders. The first, relating to the no contest petition, stated, \u201cMotion denied, [f] No new ruling or new facts; no change in 7-31-98 ruling.\u201d The second order, relating to the characterization of the cash bequests as general pecuniary devises, stated, \u201cCourt announced a tentative ruling, heard argument re court\u2019s jurisdiction to reconsider its ruling, and took issue and motion under submission.\u201d In the third order, apparently made later that same day, the court stated, \u201cMotion to reconsider ruling made on 7/31/98 that devise to Alicia and Greg Remsen is general pecuniary rather than specific. Having taken the issue of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to reconsider its 7/31/98 ruling for the above motion [under submission], the court now rules as follows: The court has determined it has the authority to reconsider its ruling on interest. [The Remsens\u2019 counsel] is given ten days to file a brief on whether the court should remove the interest payment on the distribution .... The above motion for reconsideration will be deemed submitted on 9/18/98; the petition for instructions will continue to trail the motion ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Remsens filed a brief arguing the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the matter because the trustees\u2019 motion for reconsideration failed to state new or different facts, circumstances or law, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The trustees filed a response, arguing the requirements of section 1008 did not apply to interim orders, which was the case here. The trial court agreed and on November 5, 1998, determined it had jurisdiction to modify its prior findings. It issued a minute order stating, \u201c[The] court hereby modifies its previous order to the extent that it ordered interest on the various bequests and instead, orders that principal only be paid. . . . The Court [has] jurisdiction to do so in light of the fact that a final (appealable) order was never made. . . . The Petition for instructions ... is granted consistent with the above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On January 15, 1999, the court signed an order prepared by the Remsens\u2019 counsel and reflecting a hearing date of November 4, 1998, which stated: \u201cOn September 18, 1998, the Court took the matter under submission .... [f] Having reconsidered its previous order granting interest on the bequest to the various beneficiaries herein and good cause appearing therefor, the Court hereby modifies its previous order to the extent that it ordered interest on the various bequests and instead, orders that principal only be paid.\u201d It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>signed a separate order prepared by the trustees\u2019 counsel, reflecting a hearing date of September 4, 1998, which stated: \u201cThe motion to reconsider the ruling made on July 31, 1998, that the petition filed by Alicia Remsen dated November 11, 1990, did not constitute a contest nullifying standing to file the pending petition under Case number A156574, was heard and denied, [f] Respondents\u2019 and Co-trustees\u2019 application for determination that the pending petition filed under case number A-156574 is a contest within the meaning of the trust at issue, is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The Remsens filed a notice of appeal on March 16, .1999, from \u201cthe order of January 15, 1999 . . . denying interest on the bequests to the petitioners herein, . . . and from the order that the court had jurisdiction to modify its previous order.\u201d The trustees filed a notice of appeal on the same date \u201cfrom the final judgement filed January 15, 1999, finding that the petition filed by [the Remsens] did not constitute a contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>The Remsens\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Remsens claim the trial court had no jurisdiction to reconsider its order of July 31, 1998, finding their undistributed cash bequests were general pecuniary devises and entitled to earn interest. They claim Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 prescribes the exclusive method for a court to change one of its rulings, and here the statutory procedures were not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Remsens are correct that Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 was not followed. Whether a motion for reconsideration (\u00a7 1008, subd. (a)) or renewal (\u00a7 1008, subd. (b)), the statute requires it to be based on new or different facts, circumstances or law. The motion to reconsider here was not. Notwithstanding section 1008, however, the court retained its inherent jurisdiction to modify interim orders. Although subdivision (e) provides section 1008 applies to interim as well as final orders, and subdivision (c) limits the court\u2019s sua sponte power to cases where there has been a change in the law, the court\u2019s inherent power to correct its own rulings is based on the California Constitution and cannot be impaired by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u201cWe find [the] line of cases holding Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 is jurisdictional [see, e.g., <em>Garcia v. Hejmadi </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 228]] to be inapplicable because section 1008 does not govern the court\u2019s ability, on its own motion, to reevaluate its own interim rulings. . . . Section 1008 is designed to conserve the court\u2019s resources by constraining litigants who would attempt to bring the same motion over and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>over. On the other hand, these same judicial resources would be wasted if the court could not, on its own motion, review and change its interim rulings.\u201d <em>(Darling, Hall &amp; Rae </em>v. <em>Kritt </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1156-1157 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 676]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castello </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1242 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 314]; <em>Gailing v. Rose, Klein &amp; Marias </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1570 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 381].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Remsens claimed at oral argument that the <em>Darling </em>case does not control here because the judge was not acting sua sponte but reconsidered in response to a litigant\u2019s motion. We find this to be a distinction without a difference. Whether the trial judge has an unprovoked flash of understanding in the middle of the night or is prompted to rethink an issue by the stimulus of a motion is \u201cconstitutionally immaterial\u201d to the limitation on the power of the Legislature to regulate the judiciary. (Miller &amp; Horton, <em>About Face </em>(Mar. 2000) 23 L.A. Law. 43, 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Remsens argue the order directing the trustees to pay them interest was an appealable order under Probate Code section 17200, subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(6). Thus, they argue, it was a final order and the court\u2019s entry of its minute order stripped it of the power to change its mind other than via Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. But a close reading of the order reveals it was not final. While the court found the undistributed cash bequests were entitled to earn interest, it also stated, \u201cpayment of earned interest depends on estate ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>Northern Trust Bank v. Pineda </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 603 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 357], the probate court made factual findings that the actions of objectors in litigation against the trust were unreasonable and in bad faith \u201c \u2018such that the costs of this ex parte application are chargeable against their interests in the Trust . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 605.) But the probate court crossed out that portion of the proposed order actually ordering the costs and fees to be charged against the objectors\u2019 interests. On appeal, the court found that no order had been entered and furthermore, any order was not final because \u201c[t]he trial judge in the present case has not ordered that any sum of money be paid by the objectors. That issue, the amount to be charged, remains to be litigated. The trustee has no authority to execute on any property or interest at present.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 607.) The order here similarly leaves the trustees\u2019 duty to pay interest unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The Remsens claim even if the court had jurisdiction to reconsider its ruling, the order was untimely. They argue the court was required to enter its order within 60 days of the date of the motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 660) but did not do so until November 5, 91 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure section 660 restricts the power of the trial court to grant a motion for a new trial to \u201c60 days from and after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk ... or 60 days from and after service on the moving party ... of written notice of the entry of the judgment, whichever is earlier, or if such notice has not theretofore been given, then 60 days after filing of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Although the statute on its face applies only to a motion for new trial, it has been extended to apply to motions for reconsideration of a final order under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. <em>(Miller v. United Services Automobile Assn. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 222, 226-228 [261 Cal.Rptr. 515], but see dis. opn. of Crosby, J., at p. 228.) But the limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 660 do not apply here because, as we have discussed <em>ante, </em>the underlying order of July 31 was not final, so the motion to reconsider it was not governed by section 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Remsens next argue the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of its order was erroneous on the merits; they claim they are entitled to interest on their cash bequests as a matter of law, citing Probate Code section 12003. That section states: \u201cIf a general pecuniary devise, including a general pecuniary devise in trust, is not distributed within one year after the testator\u2019s death, the devise bears interest thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Probate Code section 12003 does not resolve the Remsens\u2019 complaint for two reasons. First, the section applies only to decedent\u2019s estates, not to the administration of trusts. The reference in the statute to \u201ca general pecuniary devise in trust\u201d is to a fixed sum of money given <em>from </em>a decedent\u2019s estate <em>to </em>a trust, i.e., to be held on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf by a trustee, rather than an outright gift. Second, the section does not apply \u201cin cases where the decedent died before July 1, 1989.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 12007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The trustees assert there was no provision in trust law for the payment of interest on a general pecuniary gift from a revocable living trust before July 1, 1989. We agree. The revocable living trust has become a popular alternative to the traditional method of leaving property by will. One of the reasons for its popularity is that because it is an inter vivos transfer of property, it. allows a person to direct the disposition of property after his death without subjecting his heirs to a probate proceeding and to many of the supervisory requirements imposed by state law trusts created by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In California, the law of trust administration has only recently caught up with the law of decedent\u2019s estates in regulating interest payable by a trustee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>In 1986, the California Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act was enacted as part of the trust law. (Prob. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 16300-16313.) This was a \u201cwell-developed scheme for allocating to the income and remainder beneficiaries of the trust interest and income that accrue during trust administration,\u201d but it did not address distributions <em>from </em>the trust. (Resommendation Relating to Interest and Income During Administration (Dec. 1987) 19 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1988) p. 1024.) In 1988, Probate Code former sections 16314 and 16315 were added, \u201c[to] parallel[ ] the law applicable to probate estate administration: if distribution of a general pecuniary gift from a trust is not made when due, the amount of the distribution accrues interest from the date it is due, except in the case of a distribution due on the death of the settlor, in which case interest begins to run one year after death.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Probate Code former section 16314 provided that a general pecuniary gift distributable under a trust \u201cbears interest from the date of the settlor\u2019s death or other event upon which the distributee\u2019s right to receive the gift occurs, in the same manner as a . . . general pecuniary devise . . . under a will . . . .\u201d But as to trusts created before July 1, 1989 (as this one was), former section 16314 \u201cdo[es] not affect any aspect of the trust administration that occurred, or rights of beneficiaries that existed, before that date.\u201d (Prob. Code, former \u00a7 16315.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As in many other states, before 1989 there was no requirement that a trustee of a revocable living trust pay interest on a cash gift. (See Tax Law and Estate Planning Course Handbook Series; Estate Planning and Administration, <em>Planning and Administration of a Large Estate </em>(May 1985) 159 PLI Real Estate 9 [\u201cState Law frequently requires that interest be paid on unpaid bequests; these laws usually do not apply to bequests made by revocable living trusts\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\n<em>Remsens\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the Trustees\u2019 </em>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>The Trustees\u2019 Appeal*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The order denying interest is affirmed; the motion to dismiss the trustees\u2019 appeal is granted.
