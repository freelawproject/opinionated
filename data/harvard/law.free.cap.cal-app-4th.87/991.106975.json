(Pen. Code, \u00a7 290.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the court found Cluff had suffered three prior \u201cstrikes\u201d under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law and had served a prior prison term. Cluff\u2019s motion to strike the prior conviction allegations was denied, and \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d the court sentenced him to 25 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">This case involves the most technical violation of the section 290 registration requirement we have seen. Cluff registered with the chief of police in the jurisdiction where he was living, and continuously resided at the same address until his arrest on the current charge. Thus, he did not violate the requirement that he register after moving to a city or changing his \u201cresidence or location\u201d within the city. (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Instead, Cluff failed to comply with the separate requirement that he annually \u201cupdate\u201d his registration within five days of his birthday. (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1)(D).) The Legislature added an annual registration requirement in 1995, five years after Cluff was released from prison. It was Cluff\u2019s failure to annually confirm that his address had not changed that triggered his liability under section 290 and led to his 25-year-to-life prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Cluff raises a total of 10 issues in this appeal and a consolidated petition for writ of habeas corpus. We reject the bulk of his arguments and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">However, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Cluff\u2019s motion to strike one or more of his priors. <em>{People v. Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] <em>(Romero).) </em>Therefore, we vacate the sentence and remand for a new <em>Romero </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">The registration requirement in this case stemmed from Cluff\u2019s convictions on nine counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 14. Cluff was sentenced to a total term of nine years for those offenses. He was released from prison in 1990. At that time, prison officials informed him of his lifetime obligation to register as a sex offender. Cluff registered a number of times after changing his residence over the next five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>years. In October 1995, Cluff moved to the City of San Mateo. On October 18, 1995, he went to the San Mateo Police Department and registered as section 290 requires. The registering officers (Jacobson and Pierucci) interviewed Cluff, took his photograph and fingerprints, and listed his address, occupation, and other identifying information on the registration documents. Cluff gave his address as 1408 South Norfolk Street in San Mateo.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">When Cluff registered in October 1995, Officer Jacobson gave him a form explaining the requirements for registration. Cluff signed the form, which specifically advised him that he was required to update his registration annually within (at that time) 10 days of his birthday. This was a new requirement that came into effect on January 1, 1995. It was not highlighted on the form, and Cluff did not receive a copy of the form. However, it was Officer Jacobson\u2019s habit to orally summarize the registration requirements, including the requirement that the offender update his registration annually.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Officer Jacobson gave Cluff a temporary \u201ccompliance receipt\u201d that had a summary of the section 290 registration law printed on the back. However, the summary did <em>not </em>include the new requirement that the offender update his registration annually. Similarly, Cluff s fingerprint card prepared at the time of the October 1995 registration had a summary of the registration requirements printed on the back that did not mention the annual updating requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Except for a four-month period in 1996 when Cluff was helping his sister relocate to Utah after her husband died, he continued to live as a renter at 1408 South Norfolk Street in San Mateo. While he was in Utah, Cluff made rent payments to keep his room in his landlord\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In October 1997, Sergeant Callagy of the San Mateo Police Department learned that Cluff had not updated his registration during the period around his birthday (July 29) in 1996 and 1997. On October 23, 1997, Callagy went to 1408 South Norfolk Street and met with Cluff s landlord. The landlord confirmed that Cluff still lived at that address, and said he would have Cluff call Callagy when he returned. Cluff called Callagy the next day, and offered to come in immediately. Callagy told Cluff he needed to come to the police station to register, but that he need not come in that day. Cluff asked whether he would be arrested. Callagy said no. They made an appointment for October 27th.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>When Cluff arrived at the police station for his appointment on October 27, Sergeant Callagy immediately arrested him for violating section 290. After Callagy advised Cluff of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he asked Cluff if he knew he had to register annually with the police department. Cluff said he \u201cunderstood his requirements to register.\u201d When Callagy asked him why he did not register, Cluff had no answer. When Cluff asked if he could register that day (Oct. 27), Callagy said he could not, and would have to make a separate appointment to come back to update his registration. To Callagy\u2019s knowledge, Cluff had not done so by the time of trial in December 1998, although he had registered when he moved to Patterson, California sometime in the first part of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The district attorney charged Cluff in a one-count information as follows: \u201cOn or about 10/23/1997, Alan Ross Cluff being a person required to register as a sex offender having been previously convicted, of PC section 288A . . . , did fail to register within the time limits provided, in violation of Penal Code section 290(a)(1), a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The prosecution argued that Cluff violated section 290 by failing to comply with the annual \u201cbirthday\u201d registration requirement. As the prosecutor put it, \u201c[t]he issue is whether he knew that he had to register within the time limits annually on his birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The defense argued that Cluff s \u201cfailure to re-register on his birthday was a negligent violation of the statute due to mistake of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The court rendered its verdict in December 1998, observing that the evidence was insufficient to determine whether Cluff\u2019s failure to register was \u201cnegligent as opposed to intentional.\u201d However, the court ruled that Cluff received sufficient notice of the annual registration requirement to satisfy any due process concerns. The court found him guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">At the sentencing hearing in February 1999, the court considered the probation officer\u2019s report, the report of a court-appointed psychotherapist, and the arguments of counsel, before denying Cluff\u2019s <em>Romero </em>motion and sentencing him to a term of 25 years to life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Cluff raises seven issues in this appeal and three additional issues in a consolidated habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>A.-F.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">G. <em>Denial of the Motion to Strike.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Although Cluff casts his argument as a challenge to the constitutionality of his punishment, he actually argues two related points: (1) his sentence is unconstitutional because it is so disproportionate to his conduct that it \u201cshocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity\u201d <em>(In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 424 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921]); and (2) the court abused its discretion by not recognizing this, and failing to strike one or more of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">We note Cluff received his 25-year-to-life term not for the current offense alone, but because he had committed prior serious or violent felonies. <em>(People v. Kinsey </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1621, 1630 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 769].) He is being punished for his recidivism, not merely for the current offense.  Other courts have determined that, as a general matter, the punishment imposed by California\u2019s Three Strikes law is not so disproportionate that it violates the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment. <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1512-1517 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 638] [citing cases].) Thus, we need not revisit that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">However, we conclude the court abused its discretion at the <em>Romero </em>hearing, because substantial evidence does not support the critical inference the court relied on in denying the motion to strike. Since we will vacate the sentence, we need not consider Cluff\u2019s arguments that the punishment is cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">1. <em>Governing Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The Supreme Court has set out guidelines for lower courts to apply in deciding whether to strike a prior Three Strikes conviction under <em>Romero. </em>The touchstone for that determination is whether \u201cin light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the [Three Strikes] scheme\u2019s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 490, 498 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 280, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>976 P.2d 831]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 707, 717 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Our Supreme Court has also made it clear that appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a <em>Romero </em>motion is not de novo. \u201c \u2018[T]he superior court\u2019s order [i]s subject to review <em>for abuse of discretion. </em>This standard is <em>deferential. </em>[Citations.] But it is not empty. Although variously phrased in various decisions [citation], it asks in substance whether the ruling in question <em>\u201cfalls outside the bounds of </em>reason\u201d under the applicable law and the relevant facts [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 503, italics in original, quoting <em>People v. Williams, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Generally, sound discretion \u201cis compatible only with decisions \u2018controlled by sound principles of law, . . . free from partiality, not swayed by sympathy or warped by prejudice . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 216 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].) \u201c \u2018[A]ll exercises of legal discretion must be grounded in reasoned judgment and guided by legal principles and policies appropriate to the particular matter at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Alvarez) </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 977 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th 707, 716; <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 305, 309 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 564].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">A trial court abuses its discretion when the factual findings critical to its decision find no support in the evidence. As the court noted in <em>Stack v. Stack </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 357, 368 [11 Cal.Rptr. 177], \u201c[i]t would seem obvious that, if there were no evidence to support the decision, there would be an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Italics omitted.) In <em>Johns </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 983 [144 Cal.Rptr. 629], the Second District found the trial court had abused its discretion in ordering a new trial because substantial evidence did not support the stated basis for the decision (juror bias). <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 990, 991-998; see also <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1065-1066 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654] [discussing relationship between substantial evidence and abuse of discretion standards]; <em>People v. Benevides </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 728, 735, fn. 7 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 388] [court may not decline to exercise its authority to strike prior convictions under <em>Romero </em>for \u201cimproper reasons\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">2. <em>Facts Relevant to the Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Cluff was bom in 1951 and was 48 years old at the time of sentencing. His early criminal history consists of a petty theft in 1970, two convictions for indecent exposure in 1972, and a third conviction for indecent exposure in 1973. In all three indecent exposure offenses Cluff exposed his penis to children in public areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>In June 1984, a jury convicted Cluff of the felony counts of child molestation that underlie the Three Strikes enhancement in this case. With respect to those offenses, the probation report states that while Cluff was residing with his fianc\u00e9e and two boys (aged five and eight), he frequently molested the boys by fondling their penises and orally copulating the younger boy. In a separate incident in the summer of 1983, Cluff molested the six-year-old son of a visiting friend by asking him to play \u201cmilk the cow.\u201d When the boy refused, Cluff pulled the boy\u2019s pants down and fondled the boy\u2019s penis. Cluff also molested a seven-year-old boy in a similar manner. Cluff received a nine-year prison sentence for these offenses. He was paroled in April 1990. He was not arrested or accused of any further offense until October 1997, when the police arrested him for the registration violation at issue in this case. The court found Cluff guilty in December 1998, and sentenced him in February 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">With respect to Cluff\u2019s \u201cprospects,\u201d he regularly worked as an electrician from 1995 to 1998 and, immediately before he was sent to prison, worked as a warehouse and maintenance person with a firm in Patterson, California. The court-appointed psychologist who examined Cluff in July and August 1998, Dr. Bruce Bess, concluded that Cluff had hot reoffended since his release from prison, and would probably not reoffend \u201c[wjith probation supervision and participation in a treatment program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">With respect to the circumstances of the current offense, Dr. Bess stated in recommending probation that \u201c[i]t is not clear why [Cluff] failed to renew his registration, but, to my knowledge, there is no indication that he was attempting to conceal his whereabouts.\u201d The probation officer took a dimmer view of the matter, noting that Cluff continued to maintain he was never notified of his duty to register, despite the documents he received informing him of that duty. The probation officer also noted: \u201cOn July 31, 1998, the defendant completed an application for enrollment through the OICW Program. He furnished a San Mateo address. This was after [he] registered] in Patterson, California. In his application, he reported no prior criminal convictions.\u201d The probation officer further observed that Cluff \u201cdid not mention having worked for a carnival as reported by his living companions. When confronted during the interview, [Cluff] reported that he did that type of work on a seasonal basis and was employed as an electrician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Both Dr. Bess\u2019s report and the probation report were considered by the court on August 20, 1998, at a hearing on the prosecution\u2019s motion to increase Cluff\u2019s bail. The doctor\u2019s report was dated August 19; the probation report was dated August 20. The probation report stated that Cluff had been working for a firm in Patterson for \u201capproximately five months.\u201d Anthony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Costa, Cluff\u2019s landlord, testified at trial in December 1998 that from the previous May through August, Cluff (and Costa) had lived part of the time with Costa\u2019s daughter in Patterson. Costa and Cluff travelled back and forth between San Mateo and Patterson, where Cluff worked for a business owned by Costa\u2019s daughter. At the bail hearing in August, Cluff s bail was increased and he was taken into custody, where he remained until sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The probation report was resubmitted to the court without change for the sentencing hearing in February 1999. At the hearing, the prosecutor contended Cluff was a pedophile who took work at a carnival and left the state without notifying anyone. Arguing beyond the evidence, the prosecutor asserted that Cluff lived with a family with three young boys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The prosecutor suggested that Cluff may have reoffended but simply not been caught. The trial court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s insinuations, stating that it would be \u201cimproper for the court to speculate about crimes that may have occurred.\u201d However, the court also took a jaundiced view of Cluff\u2019s current offense. In denying Cluff\u2019s motion to strike his priors, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201cWell, I think from the court\u2019s p[er]spective, the circumstances underlying the offense at hand are important. [IQ And, in fact, it\u2019s very important as far as the consideration of the <em>Romero </em>motion. My read of Dr. Bess\u2019 report is that he makes a recommendation, there were some important factors he was aware about from [the] People\u2019s brief and some of the evidence that was introduced during the course of the trial regarding the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case, and he puts a very rosy p[er]spective on his alleged innocence in failing to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">\u201cAnd I don\u2019t buy that based on what I have heard about the conduct. It is not as simple as an innocent mistake. It\u2019s not as simple as he didn\u2019t know about his requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">\u201cThere are disturbing factors underlying this case that I find alarming, in the court\u2019s view, which bear on the <em>Romero </em>issue that [defense counsel] has raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">\u201cThe registration in 1998 in Patterson when there is documentation in the record that suggests misrepresentation as [to] his criminal background, his representation as to his place of residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>\u201cYes, there is a contorted set of facts by which there can be some explanation of that, but frankly it\u2019s not compelling to me, not convincing me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">\u201cAnd for those reasons, I disagree that this is a simple technical 290 violation. It\u2019s a violation that the defendant was advised of; that the defendant knew about, and his background is what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">\u201cYou are quite right, [defense counsel], there is no indication or evidence of reoffense. . . . That\u2019s not what\u2019s involved. He hasn\u2019t fled the jurisdiction of the court. Nevertheless, he has certainly, in the court\u2019s view, [clouded] the waters in terms of his residence and where he lives and where he can be found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">\u201cThe final and most significant portion of which was his failing to register as required by the code. Given the totality of factors, and I have given this a great deal of thought, Dr. Bess\u2019 report is important as well, I do not think that there [is] sufficient justification presented to me to strike the priors contained in the information regardless of Dr. Bess\u2019 [recommendation]. I am satisfied that based on what I have heard about this case, that there has been obfuscation on the part of Mr. Cluff that goes beyond the technical 290 violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">\u201cAnd given that circumstance, and the totality of the circumstances in the case, which cannot be ignored in the <em>Romero </em>motion, I am going to deny your request to strike the prior convictions under <em>Romero </em>for the reasons that I stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">This record strongly suggests that Cluff committed a \u201ctechnical\u201d violation of section 290, without intent to deceive or evade law enforcement. Though he failed to annually update his registration in San Mateo, Cluff consistently registered in the jurisdictions where he resided.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The annual updating requirement was added to the Penal Code five years after Cluff left prison, the new requirement was omitted from the only document he was allowed to keep in 1995 when he registered in San Mateo, and the updating requirement was itself amended in 1996. When the police looked for Cluff, he was living at his registered address. After the police contacted Cluff, he immediately telephoned them and promptly came to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>Thus, Cluff\u2019s <em>Romero </em>motion did not lack substantial grounds on which the trial court might have exercised its discretion to strike one or more strikes. Cluff\u2019s failure to confirm his address, by itself, posed no danger to society. Cluff was exactly where he said he would be when he registered in 1995, and the police were able to quickly find him. The purpose of the registration statute was not undermined by his failure to annually update his registration. There was no indication he had reoffended since he left prison in 1990, and Dr. Bess believed that \u201cwith probation supervision and participation in a treatment program\u201d Cluff would not reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">However, the court viewed Cluff with suspicion, believing he had \u201c[clouded] the waters in terms of his residence and where he lives and where he can be found.\u201d Apparently, the court was referring to the fact that. Cluff had left the state for four months to stay with his recently widowed sister in Utah, without reporting this to the authorities. Similarly, the court seemed to give considerable weight to Cluff\u2019s misstatements in July 1998 regarding his residence and criminal record on his application for a job training program. Viewing the evidence as a whole, the court concluded \u201cthere has been obfuscation on the part of Mr. Cluff that goes beyond the technical 290 violation.\u201d The evidence in the record does not support this critical finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">To be sufficient, evidence must be \u201csubstantial.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People v. Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 19 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843], disapproved on an unrelated point in <em>In re Sassounian </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 543, fn. 5 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 446, 887 P.2d 527].) Evidence is substantial only if it \u201c \u2018reasonably inspires confidence and is of \u201csolid value.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Morris, supra, </em>at p. 19.) By definition, \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requires <em>evidence </em>and not mere speculation. In any given case, one \u201cmay <em>speculate </em>about any number of scenarios that may have occurred .... A reasonable inference, however, \u2018may not be based on suspicion alone, or on imagination, speculation, supposition, surmise, conjecture, or guess work. ft[] . . .A finding of fact must be an inference drawn from evidence rather than ... a mere speculation as to probabilities without evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 21, italics in original; see also <em>People v. Tran </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 759, 772 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s analysis became disconnected from the evidence and entered the realm of imagination, speculation, supposition, and guesswork. At trial, the court had refrained from determining whether Cluff\u2019s registration violation was negligent or intentional. At the sentencing hearing, however, the court resolved its earlier doubts and concluded that Cluff had not inadvertently failed to annually update his registration, but had done so with knowledge of the requirement in order to \u201cobfuscate\u201d his true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>residence. We accept the trial court\u2019s finding that the violation was intentional (as we would have if the court had made that finding at trial); the evidence that Cluff had notice of the new requirement supports that determination. However, none of the facts before the court\u2014whether considered separately or together\u2014support the inference that Cluff failed to update his registration in order to obfuscate his residence or escape the reach of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Cluff s four-month visit with his sister in Utah does not indicate he was obfuscating his true residence in California. The term \u201cresidence\u201d in section 290 connotes \u201c \u2018more than passing through or presence for a limited visit[].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCleod </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1218 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 545].) The People have not contended that the Utah interlude amounted to a change of residence. Had they believed so, they could have charged Cluff under section 290, subdivision (f) with failing to inform the police of a change of residence. The fact that no such charge was made is an implicit concession that Cluff did not change his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Cluff s misrepresentations on a job training application seven months after his arrest also provide no grounds to infer that he intended to obfuscate his true residence. There is no evidence that Cluff ever changed his residence without reregistering. When the police looked for him, they found him at his registered address: 1408 South Norfolk Street in San Mateo. When Cluff gave a San Mateo address on his job training application in July 1998, he had already registered pursuant to section 290 in Patterson (therefore, the police could also have found him in that location). (See \u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1)(B) [person with more than one residence must register at each].) Cluff omitted his criminal record, and apparently his current employment, on the application. However, the deceptive statements on the application prove only that he was willing to bend the truth to get into a job training program. Willingness to lie for a chance of employment may be an unfortunate trait possessed by many people in substantially less challenging circumstances than Cluff, but it does not support an inference that the applicant purposefully failed to update his sex offender registration in order to conceal his true residence. Cluff\u2019s address was on record with the appropriate authorities everywhere he resided. Under these circumstances, his statements on the job training application simply do not support the inference drawn by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Similarly, Cluff\u2019s failure to report his employment with a carnival on a seasonal\" basis does not suggest obfuscation of his true residence. There is no evidence in the record indicating that Cluff traveled with the carnival, or, if he did, how long or how often he was gone. Thus, any inference of wrongdoing based on this evidence was unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>Finally, the trial court found it \u201cmost significant\u201d that Cluff had failed to annually update his registration as required by section 290. This is no more than a finding that he was guilty of the crime for which he was convicted. We do not see how the mere fact of Cluff\u2019s guilt indicates he failed to annually update his registration in order to obfuscate his true residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We conclude that the evidence in the record does not support the inference of obfuscation that was central to the trial court\u2019s ruling. Therefore, the court abused its discretion when it denied Cluff\u2019s <em>Romero </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In light of our conclusion, we need not and do not resolve the claim that application of the Three Strikes law in this case would be cruel and unusual punishment. However, for the guidance of the trial court on remand, we note that the severe penalty imposed on Cluff appears disproportionate by any measure. The nature of Cluff\u2019s current offense did not demonstrate recidivist tendencies toward child molestation. While there is no requirement that a third strike be a serious or violent felony, neither the Legislature nor the voters intended the Three Strikes law to be used as a nuisance statute to rid society forever of persons who fail to meet technical requirements to confirm an accurate registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On remand, the trial court should keep in mind that \u201ca decision to strike a prior is to be an individualized one based on the particular aspects of the current offenses for which the defendant has been convicted and on the defendant\u2019s own history and personal circumstances. This approach allows the court to perform its obligation to tailor a given sentence to suit the individual defendant. But the court must also be mindful of the sentencing scheme within which it exercises its authority. In deciding to strike a prior, a sentencing court is concluding that an exception to the scheme should be made because, for articulable reasons which can withstand scrutiny for abuse, this defendant should be treated as though he actually fell outside the Three Strikes scheme.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGlothin </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 468, 474 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 83].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">On this record, there are strong arguments that Cluff should be treated as though he fell outside the Three Strikes scheme.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition to the factors discussed above, we note that none of the circumstances in aggravation listed in the California Rules of Court appear to apply here (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421), while some circumstances in mitigation may apply (see, e.g., Cal Rules of Court, rule 4.423(a)(1), (6), (7), (b)(6)). The court should consider all of these factors in exercising its discretion to strike one or more of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>H. <em>Habeas Corpus </em>Issues.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.
