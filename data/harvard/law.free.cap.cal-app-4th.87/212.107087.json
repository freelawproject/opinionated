However, this appeal focuses on postjudgment orders regarding attorney fees and costs, and does not concern the merits of the parties\u2019 underlying claims against one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Gilbert filed a complaint against Master Washer, Los Angeles Superior Court case No. BC141326, on December 22, 1995, seeking damages for breach of lease, and attorney fees pursuant to the lease between the parties. Master Washer later filed a complaint in a separate action, Los Angeles Superior Court case No. BC142051, seeking damages for breach of contract and conversion of its property by Gilbert. Master Washer\u2019s complaint also named Gilbert\u2019s attorney, appellant David Gernsbacher, as a defendant based on his alleged role in preventing Master Washer from recovering its property from the leased premises. The cases were consolidated and assigned to Judge Ralph W. Dau.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Gemsbacher demurred to Master Washer\u2019s first cause of action for breach of lease, and the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on April 4, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">On February 10, 1998, Gilbert obtained summary adjudication in his favor on Master Washer\u2019s breach of lease claim. This ruling also disposed of Master Washer\u2019s defenses to Gilbert\u2019s claim for breach of lease. The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>day, Gemsbacher obtained summary judgment as to all remaining causes of action in Master Washer\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Trial of the consolidated actions commenced on January 7, 1999. On January 14, 1999, Gilbert and Master Washer entered into a stipulation for judgment (hereinafter the Stipulation) whereby Master Washer admitted liability in Gilbert\u2019s breach of lease action.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">[]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On February 24, 1999, Gilbert filed a proposed judgment pursuant to the Stipulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">[]*</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">On or about March 1, 1999, Gilbert and Gemsbacher filed a second proposed judgment providing in pertinent part as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cOn April 4, 1996, in Case No. BC 142051 (hereinafter the \u2018Master Washer Action\u2019) the Court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of Defendant David Gemsbacher ... to the First Cause of Action for Breach of Lease of Plaintiff Master Washer &amp; Stamping Co., Inc. . . . and, on February 10, 1998, the Court granted Defendant Gemsbacher\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication as to the remainder of Plaintiff Master Washer\u2019s Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201cOn January 7, 1999, these consolidated causes came on regularly for trial before Judge Ralph W.

Katz</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the California Supreme Court held an attorney who litigates in propria persona may not recover attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Gilbert and Gemsbacher both appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their separate motions to fix attorney fees as <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Discussion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">I. <em>Master Washer\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment Did Not Conform with the Requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 663a, Therefore the Trial Court Erred in Amending the Judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-13\">[]*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-14\">II. An <em>Attorney Who Is Represented by Other Members of His or Her Law Firm May Be Entitled to Recover Attorney Fees Under Civil Code Section 1717; Therefore the Trial Court Erred in Denying Gemsbacher\u2019s Motion to Fix Attorney Fees As Costs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">California follows the so-called American rule, whereby each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his or her own attorney fees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, this rule does not apply where, as in this case, the parties have agreed to allocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>attorney fees by contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such agreements are governed by Civil Code section 1717, which provides in pertinent part \u201c(a) In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to other costs, [ft] . . . [ft] Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The trial court found Gemsbacher was not entitled to attorney fees because he was represented by his own law firm, Gemsbacher &amp; McGarrigle, ARC, and did not present evidence he was \u201cobligated to pay\u201d the legal fees incurred on his behalf by the attorneys representing him in this matter. Gemsbacher argues he is entitled to his attorney fees because he was sued personally and was represented by other counsel within the law firm of which he is a member. Thus he did not represent himself in propria persona. We agree with Gemsbacher and therefore we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion to fix attorney fees as costs and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">A. <em>An Attorney Representing Himself or Herself In Propria Persona May Not Recover Contractual Attorney Fees Pursuant to Civil Code Section 1717. However, a Corporation May Recover Fees Incurred by Its In-house Counsel.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the law firm Trope and Trope, representing itself in propria persona, sued a former client for fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The former client filed a cross-complaint for malpractice, and a trial of the entire matter resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>net verdict in favor of Trope and Trope.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Trope and Trope moved for an award of attorney fees under the attorney fee provision in the parties\u2019 retainer agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court found \u201calthough Trope &amp; Trope would have been entitled to attorney fees under the 1985 agreement if it had retained an attorney, it was barred from recovering such fees because it had represented itself.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The California Supreme Court affirmed the trial.court\u2019s action, holding \u201can attorney who chooses to litigate in propria persona rather than retain another attorney to represent him in an action to enforce a contract . . . cannot recover [attorney] fees under [Civil Code] section 1717.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The high court explained Civil Code section 1717 authorizes an award of \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and the plain meaning of the term \u201cboth in legal and in general usage, is the consideration that a litigant actually pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation. An attorney litigating in propria persona pays no such compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Trope </em>rejected Trope and Trope\u2019s argument they were entitled to an award of attorney fees \u201csimply because the time [an attorney] devotes to litigating a matter on his own behalf has value.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Noting the time of any litigant is valuable, the Supreme Court concluded \u201cthe issue is whether in enacting section 1717 the Legislature intended to allow attorneys who represent themselves to recover \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 for the time and effort they have expended and the professional opportunities they have lost as a result of their decision to litigate a contract dispute in propria persona, even though they have not actually paid or become liable to pay any consideration in exchange for legal representation. . . . [W]e believe the Legislature did not so intend.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Supreme Court in Trope also rejected Trope and Trope\u2019s suggestion the Legislature may have wished to encourage attorneys to represent themselves in litigation. Citing to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kay v. Ehrler,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court observed \u201ca lawmaking body may instead prefer to discourage attorneys from electing to appear in propria persona because such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>self-representation may often conflict with the general public and legislative policy favoring the effective and successful prosecution of meritorious claims\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus <em>Trope </em>stands for the proposition an attorney who represents him or herself in propria persona may not recover the value of his or her time as attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">More recently, in <em>PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the California Supreme Court revisited the attorney fees issue and held a corporate litigant was entitled to recover attorney fees for work performed by in-house counsel, even though such counsel were employees of the corporate litigant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In <em>PLCM, </em>the Supreme Court explained its holding in <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was based largely on the lack of any attorney-client relationship in the case of an attorney litigating his or her own contract dispute: \u201c[in <em>Trope, </em>w]e explained that, by definition, the term \u2018attorney fees\u2019 implies the existence of an attorney-client relationship, i.e., a party receiving professional services from a lawyer. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court in <em>PLCM Group </em>found such a relationship <em>does </em>exist where a corporation is represented by its in-house counsel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>PLCM Group </em>emphasized none of the problems relating to the pro se attorney litigants in <em>Trope </em>applied in the case of in-house counsel: \u201cThere is no problem of disparate treatment; in-house attorneys, like private counsel but unlike pro se litigants, do not represent their own personal interests and are not seeking remuneration simply for lost opportunity costs that could not be recouped by a nonlawyer. A corporation represented by in-house counsel is in an agency relationship, i.e., it has hired an attorney to provide professional legal services on its behalf. Nor is there any impediment to the effective and successful prosecution of meritorious claims because of possible ethical conflict or emotional investment in the outcome. The fact that [the corporation employs in-house counsel] does not alter the fact of representation by an independent third party. Instead, the payment of a salary to in-house attorneys is analogous to hiring a private firm on a retainer.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, it held \u201cWe discern no basis for discriminating between counsel working for a corporation in-house and private counsel engaged with respect to a specific matter or on retainer. Both are bound by the same fiduciary and ethical duties to their clients. [Citations.] Both are qualified to provide, and do provide, equivalent legal services. And both incur attorney fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717 in enforcing the contract on behalf of their client.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">B. <em>The Policy Considerations in Trope v. Katz Do Not Preclude Gemsbacher\u2019s Recovery of Attorney Fees Because He Is Not a Litigant In Propria Persona.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Having examined the policy considerations leading to the <em>Trope </em>and <em>PLCM Group </em>decisions, we apply those considerations to the case before us. We hold Gemsbacher, as an attorney litigant represented by other attorneys in his firm, is not a litigant in propria persona and thus <em>Trope </em>does not bar his recovery of reasonable attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">1. <em>An Attorney Represented by Members of His or Her Own Law Firm \u201cIncurs\u201d Attorney Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">While <em>Trope </em>defines \u201cincurring\u201d an attorney fee as \u201cbecoming obligated to pay for it,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> such an \u201cobligation\u201d is broadly defined as necessary to fulfill the purpose of Civil Code section 1717. In <em>International Billing Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emigh,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for example, the Court of Appeal held prevailing litigants were entitled to an award of attorney fees, even though the fees had been paid by their employer.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Noting the litigants had agreed to reimburse the employer in the event they obtained a fee award pursuant to Civil Code section 1717, the court held they \u201cbecame liable to pay the fee even if they were not the source of payment the attorney agreed to look to first.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Hoefke,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court concluded a defendant was entitled to recover attorney fees despite the fact his fees had been paid by his insurer.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Moreover, under <em>PLCM Group, </em>the trial court has wide discretion to fix a reasonable amount of attorney fees, and is not limited to the amount actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>paid by the prevailing party.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In <em>PLCM Group, </em>the Supreme Court held a fee award for in-house counsel was properly based on the number of hours expended by counsel multiplied by the prevailing market rate for comparable legal services where counsel is located. The Supreme Court held the trial court was not, as the losing party argued, limited to the \u201ccost-plus approach, based on a precise calculation of the actual salary, costs, and overhead of in-house counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Thus, a member of a law firm who is represented by other attorneys in the firm \u201cincurs\u201d fees within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717. Either the represented attorney will experience a reduced draw from the partnership (or a reduced salary from the professional corporation) to account for the amount of time his or her partners or colleagues have specifically devoted to his or her representation, or absorb a share of the reduction in other income the firm experiences because of the time spent on the case. This is different from the \u201copportunity costs\u201d the attorney loses while he or she is personally involved in the same case, because the economic detriment is caused not by the expenditure of his or her own time, but by other attorneys working on his or her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Nevertheless, in this case the trial court denied Gemsbacher\u2019s motion to fix attorney fees as costs in part because it believed the declaration of McGarrigle, Gemsbacher\u2019s attorney, did not adequately establish Gernsbacher had \u201cincurred\u201d attorney fees. Although the trial court stated \u201cnowhere does the declaration state that attorney Gernsbacher is obligated to pay this or any other amount to his firm for his representation in this matter,\u201d this conclusion is factually inaccurate. Mr. McGarrigle\u2019s declaration does indeed state \u201cthe total amount of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees <em>incurred </em>by Defendant [Gernsbacher].\u201d Master Washer did not present any evidence to rebut this statement, and in the absence of any reason to think otherwise, the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cincurred\u201d in Mr. McGarrigle\u2019s declaration should be interpreted as it is used in Civil Code section 1717.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">2. <em>An Attorney Represented by Members of His or Her Own Law Firm Is Party to an Attorney-client Relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Trope v. Katz,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>denied fees to an attorney litigant acting in propria persona based in large part on the absence of an attorney-client relationship, because a pro se attorney litigant does not become liable to pay fees \u201cin exchange for legal representation.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> By contrast, <em>PLCM Group </em>approved a fee award fdr the representation of in-house counsel because unlike an individual attorney acting in propria persona, \u201c \u2018an organization is always represented by counsel. . . . and thus, there is always an attorney-client relationship.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">There can be no question an attorney-client relationship is also present where an attorney litigant is represented by other attorneys in his or her own firm. In this case, Messrs. Beach and McGarrigle of Gemsbacher &amp; McGarrigle, like the in-house counsel in <em>PLCM Group </em>but unlike Messrs. Trope and Trope in <em>Trope, </em>represented not their personal interests or even those of their law firm, but the separate and distinct interests of Gemsbacher himself.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Beach and McGarrigle were Gemsbacher\u2019s agents, and he was the recipient of legal services performed by them on his behalf.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">As our Supreme Court recognized in <em>PLCM Group, </em>the introduction of an objective third party as counsel for an attorney litigant promotes \u201cthe general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>public and legislative policy favoring the effective and successful prosecution of meritorious claims [or defense of non-meritorious claims].\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> It recognized \u201c \u2018 \u201cEven a skilled lawyer who represents himself is at a disadvantage in contested litigation. Ethical considerations may make it inappropriate for him to appear as a witness. He is deprived of the judgment of an independent third party in framing the theory of the case, evaluating alternative methods of presenting the evidence, cross-examining hostile witnesses, formulating legal arguments, and in making sure that reason, rather than emotion, dictates the proper tactical response to unforeseen developments in the courtroom. The adage that \u2018a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client\u2019 is the product of years of experience by seasoned litigators.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> An attorney who asks his partners or associates to represent him, by contrast, is no fool.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">3. <em>Permitting an Attorney Represented by Members of His or Her Own Law Firm to Recover Fees Under Civil Code Section 1717 Does Not Lead to Inequitable Application of the Statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held it would be inequitable to permit attorneys, but not other litigants, to recover fees when they litigate in propria persona <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> It held such an outcome \u201cwould conflict with the legislative purpose of section 1717 . . .to establish mutuality of remedy when a contractual provision makes recovery of attorney fees available to only one party, and to prevent the oppressive use of one-sided attorney fee provisions. [Citations.] If an attorney who is the prevailing party in an action to enforce a contract with an attorney fee provision can recover compensation for the time he expends litigating his case in propria persona, but a nonattomey pro se litigant cannot do so regardless of the personal and economic value of such time simply because he has chosen to pursue a different occupation, every such contract would be oppressive and one-sided.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">As we have seen, this consideration is absent where an attorney litigant is represented by members of his or her firm, because like a corporation represented by in-house counsel, the represented attorney seeks to recover fees for work done by others on his behalf. Indeed, it would be inequitable in the extreme to permit Gemsbacher to recover fees incurred by outside counsel, but deny him such recovery merely because his counsel are members of the same law firm as he.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>C. <em>The Matter Must Be Remanded for Ruling on the Remaining Issues Presented in Gemsbacher\u2019s Motion to Fix Attorney Fees.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Because the trial court erroneously ruled <em>Trope v. </em>Katz<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> precluded Gemsbacher from recovering his attorney fees, it did not reach the other issues raised in his motion to fix attorney fees as costs, namely whether Gemsbacher is the prevailing party against Master Washer, and the amount of attorney fees, if any, he is entitled to recover. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s June 15,1999 order denying Gemsbacher\u2019s motion to fix his attorney fees as costs is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The trial court\u2019s June 15, 1999 order denying Gemsbacher\u2019s motion to fix attorney fees as costs is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to make a new ruling on Gemsbacher\u2019s motion to fix attorney fees as costs, including whether Gemsbacher is a prevailing party entitled to contractual attorney fees, and the amount, if any, of reasonable attorney fees to which he is entitled.

Trope, who were, according to the Court of Appeal opinion in <em>Trope v. Katz, </em>No. B073244, \u201cengaged in the practice of law as the firm of Trope and Trope.\" The law firm Trope and Trope was not a party to the action and there is no indication it had any independent legal existence. Indeed, the Supreme Court treated the firm and the attorneys as interchangeable, framing the issue in the case as \u201cwhether an attorney who successfully represents himself in litigation may recover attorney fees when such fees are provided for by contract or statute.\u201d <em>(Trope </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 274, 278.) Therefore the Supreme Court\u2019s references to \u201cTrope &amp; Trope\" or \u201cthe firm\u201d are best understood as shorthand references to party litigants Sorrell Trope and Eugene L. Trope, the two attorneys who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>represented themselves in propria persona.
