Criminal statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the accused. An act which is not specifically prohibited by the language of a statute cannot be <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>construed \u2019 \u2019 into a crime. It is the Legislature, not the court, which defines crimes. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. [U. S.] 76; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phyfe, </em>136 N. Y. 554; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>153 N. Y. 90; <em>People </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>193 N. Y. 457; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weinstock, </em>193 N.

II. The possession, distribution or sale of the pamphlet mentioned in count 3 of the information, or of the other pamphlet and the dream books, introduced into evidence although not specificaEy named in any count of the information, is not a crime within the contemplation of the statute. <em>(Matter of Schinasi, </em>277 N.

III. Section 974 of the Penal Law of the State of New York, as applied in this case, is constitutional. <em>(Jordan </em>v. <em>De George, </em>341 U. S. 223.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b574-6\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acv\">The defendants, magazine distributors in the City of Mt. Vernon, had for many years been selling so-called <em>\u201c </em>dream books \u201d and \u201c tip-sheets \u201d to which devotees of the game known as policy had recourse in their search for the elusive winning number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a police raid and the seizure of those items, an information containing six counts was filed against the defendants. They were found guilty, after trial, upon two counts, of violating section 974 of the Penal Law in that they possessed articles commonly used in promoting \u201d policy and the convictions were affirmed by the Westchester County Court. The appeal is here by permission of the Chief Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Although the Legislature could, of course, choose to legislate with respect to these dream hooks and tip-sheets, we find nothing in section 974, as it now reads, which renders criminal their possession or sale. The portion of the statute relied upon by the People provides that \u201c A person * * * who shall have in his possession, knowingly * * * any paper, print, writing, number, device, policy slip, or article of any kind such as is commonly used in carrying on, promoting or playing the game commonly called \u2018 policy \u2019 * * * is a common gambler, and guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Concededly, the defendants did not <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 carry on \u201d or \u201c play \u2019 \u2019 policy, nor were the books and pamphlets which they sold used in <em>\u201c </em>carrying on \u201d or <em>\u201c </em>playing \u201d this game. Accordingly, since the term \u201c promote \u201d necessarily takes its sense and meaning from the terms \u201c carry on \u201d and \u201c play,\u201d it follows that those articles were not used to <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>promote \u2019 \u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In point of fact, the statute is aimed only at the players \u2014 that is, at those who possess policy slips \u2014 and the entrepreneurs and managers of policy and those <em>in pari delicto </em>with them. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>284 N. Y. 93, 104-105; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolosky, </em>296 N. Y. 236, 238; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>176 N. Y. 351, 360, affd. 192 U. S. 585; <em>People </em>v. <em>Engeman, </em>129 App. Div. 462, 465-467, affd. 195 N. Y. 591.) \u201c Section 974\u201d, this court wrote in the <em>Hines </em>case, \u201c prohibits one from keeping an establishment <em>for </em>policy playing', from delivering or receiving money by playing policy, or possessing policy slips, or other articles used in carrying on policy, or owning or being the agent or janitor of any establishment where lottery policies are sold \u201d (284 N. Y. 93, 104-105). And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolosky, </em>after adverting to the <em>Hines </em>case, we stated (296 N. Y., at p. 238): \u201c Thus, four kinds of activities having to do with policy are forbidden: maintaining a place wherein to play it, having ownership or control of such a place, handling the money involved, or possessing papers, writings or articles commonly used in carrying on this form of gambling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The only activities forbidden by section 974, therefore, are those of the operators of games of policy, the entrepreneurs and their henchmen, and the players. Since the defendants, in distributing the reading material before us were neither entrepreneurs of the game (or their accomplices) nor players, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>since they had nothing whatsoever to do with running or operating those games, they may not be brought within the compass of the statute. This conclusion is confirmed by the circumstance that the articles whose possession is forbidden are the essential <em>\u201c </em>tools \u201d of the game, the items actually required to carry it on. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>176 N. Y. 351, 360, affd. 192 U. S. 585, <em>supra.) </em>A tip-sheet, while it may <em>\u201c </em>guide \u201d one to a particular number, cannot be considered a tool, essential or otherwise, in playing the game. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Engeman, </em>129 App. Div. 462, affd. 195 N. Y. 591, <em>supra.) </em>In the <em>Engeman </em>case\u2014involving book-making under old section 344 of the Penal Code (present Penal Law, \u00a7 970)\u2014distributors of a race-horse tip-sheet, at a time when betting on horse races even at the track was illegal, were charged with owning a \u201c device and apparatus for gambling\u201d. Both the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the indictment and, in the course of its opinion, the Appellate Division stated (p. 466): \u201c A \u2018 device or apparatus for gambling \u2019 is a device or apparatus designed for carrying on the actual gambling * * * This is the test, whether the implement or device is used in determining who shall win or lose, whether it is an integral part of the actual gambling.\u201d And, added the court (p. 467), \u201c the mere fact that [the tip-sheet] might afford facts which would be useful to the man of sporting proclivities in making up his mind how he desired to place his wager does not constitute it a device for gambling under any of the definitions which we have been able to find.\u201d By the same token, the possession of articles, having no integral connection with the playing of policy and not used in the actual policy operation, does not fall within the prohibition of section 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The Legislature, by denominating as \u201c a common gambler \u201d one who violates the statutory proscription, made it exceedingly plain that the activities forbidden are those relating to the gambling operation itself, to the carrying on or the playing of policy. Baleful and wrongful though the sale of dream books and tip-sheets may be, by no reasonable construction can it be said to constitute gambling or to render the vendor a gambler. The situation would, of course, be different if the defendants had allied or associated themselves with the persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>actually running or carrying on the games, but there is no evidence of any such connection in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The judgments of conviction should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Froessel and Burke concur with Judge Fuld; Judge Van Voorhis dissents and votes to affirm <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hartmann, </em>274 App. Div. 752).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Judgments reversed, the information dismissed and the fines remitted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">. These various booklets and pamphlets are designed to furnish information and hints which the prospective player will find \u201c helpful \u201d in selecting the number to be played. A tip-sheet, such as the defendants\u2019 Weekly Piekem Rajah Rabo, consists of records of past winning' numbers, while a dream book, such as the defendants\u2019 Black Cat Dream Book, professes to \u201cinterpret * \" ** dreams through the science of numerology \u201d; listing key words of dreams in almost infinite variety, it assigns a number to each dream subject and counsels the dreamer to play the number with which his dream is coupled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
