The direction of the hearing commissioner to petitioner to proceed forthwith to trial was not at bar an order of a superior officer nor was it a violation of any of the rules and regulations of the Police Department for petitioner to heed the advice of his counsel and not participate in the hearing proposed to be held on June 27, 1956. The refusal of an adjournment under the disclosed circumstances was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. <em>(Matter of Bush </em>v. <em>Beckmann, </em>283 App. Div. 1070; <em>Matter of Friedel </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>296 N. Y. 347; <em>Matter of Greenehaum </em>v. <em>Bingham, </em>201 N. Y. 343.) II. The charge is untenable on its face; the Trial Commissioner was acting as a judge when he ordered petitioner to trial and was not acting as a Police Commissioner or as petitioner\u2019s superior officer. <em>(People ex rel. Bchauwecker </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>96 App. Div. 249; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>195 App. Div. 814.) III. Respondent has failed to carry the burden imposed on him by law of proving the charges he filed accusing petitioner of conduct prejudicial to good order, effi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ciency, etc., by reason of the <em>lt </em>escort service \u201d charges. The competent evidence adduced established no violation by petitioner of \u201c the lawful orders of his superior officers.\u201d <em>(Matter of Shea </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>249 App. Div. 556; <em>Matter of Tate </em>v. <em>Beckmann, </em>273 App. Div. 906; <em>Matter of Greenebaum </em>v. <em>Bingham, </em>201 N. Y. 343; <em>Matter of Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mulrooney, </em>242 App. Div. 48; <em>Matter of Wood </em>v. <em>Village of Port Chester, </em>284 App. Div. 900.) IV. The determination here made and the dismissal order which followed are the result of a hearing held in the absence of petitioner who was ordered to trial under circumstances constituting a grave abuse of discretion to the serious prejudice of petitioner. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>195 App. Div. 814; <em>Matter of Klinkenberg </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>256 App. Div. 638; <em>Matter of Delehanty [Sullivan], </em>202 Misc. 33.) V. The final order of dismissal, being based as it is at bar on a finding of guilt on <em>both </em>the \u201c escort service \u201d charges <em>and </em>the \u201c insubordination \u201d charges, may not here be sustained unless it appears to the satisfaction of this court that <em>all </em>the relevant specifications contained in <em>both </em>charges have been' proved by the weight and sufficiency of substantial and competent evidence. <em>(Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>285 App. Div. 965; <em>Matter of Jones </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>1 A D 2d 889; <em>People ex rel. Gilson </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>231 N. Y. 171.) VI. The Police Department Rules and Regulations (\u00a7 296) and the Administrative Code of the City of New York (\u00a7 434a-14.0) are illegal and unconstitutional in that they fail to provide fair and reasonable standards and guides for punishment and are vague in their provisions and allow and make for autocratic, unrestricted, irresponsible and absolute power in depriving a person of vested, constitutional and property rights without due process of law and in violation of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of New York. VTI. This court is <em>empowered </em>to review the penalty, punishment or measure of discipline imposed by the Police Commissioner. The final order of dismissal at bar was and is excessive and severe; it results from an abuse of discretion and is entirely disproportionate to the seriousness of the charges, if any are regarded as proved. <em>(Matter of Stole </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>4 A D 2d 361; <em>Matter of Bancroft </em>v. <em>Usher, </em>4 A D 2d 808.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Charles H. Tenney, Corporation Counsel (Henry J. Shields </em>and <em>Seymour B. Quel </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ2\">I. The pendency of the criminal prosecutions against the men who held up the payrolls was valid reason for deferring the trial of the criminal charges against petitioner; his refusal to proceed with the trial of the escort charges constituted valid ground for a charge of insubordination. II. The insubordination charge was a valid charge against petitioner, since he could not divest the hearing officer of jurisdiction to try the charges then pending before him. Petitioner\u2019s obligation was to proceed with the hearing under appropriate objection and exception. <em>(Boone </em>v. <em>Lightner, </em>319 U. S. 561; <em>People ex rel. Schauwecker </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>96 App. Div. 249; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>195 App. Div. 814; <em>People ex rel. Weston </em>v. <em>McClave, </em>123 N. Y. 512; <em>People ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Police Comrs., </em>67 N. Y. 475; <em>People ex rel. Clapp </em>v. <em>Board of Police, </em>5 Hun 457, 72 N.

There is substantial evidence in support of the escort charges in the testimony of the persons who accompanied petitioner to and from banks with payroll moneys. <em>(Barnett </em>v. <em>Kugel, </em>247 App. Div. 757; <em>Rathfelder </em>v. <em>Flag, </em>257 App. Div. 71; <em>Detzker </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>267 App. Div. 912; <em>Dallas </em>v. <em>Lahl, </em>270 App. Div. 819, 270 App. Div. 852; <em>Matter of Clark [Smith], </em>271 App. Div. 804; <em>People ex rel. Weston </em>v. <em>McClave, </em>123 N. Y. 512; <em>Matter of Evans </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>306 N. Y. 312; <em>Twogood </em>v. <em>Mayor of City of N. Y., </em>102 N. Y. 216; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>214 N. Y. 259; <em>People ex rel. Quiney </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>274 N. Y. 331; <em>Matter of Miller </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>291 N. Y. 65; <em>Matter of Donahue </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>299 N. Y. 227; <em>Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327; <em>Matter of Burke </em>v. <em>Bromberger, </em>300 N. Y. 248; <em>Matter of Avon Bar &amp; Grill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>301 N. Y. 150.) IV. The insubordination charge alone was sufficient cause for petitioner\u2019s dismissal. So, too, the specifications of the escort charges are full warrant for dismissal. <em>(Matter of Stolz </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>4 A D 2d 361.) V. There is no constitutional question in this case. There is no right of property in public office and petitioner does not plead nor prove that he was denied any rights incident to due process in the conduct of the proceedings leading to his removal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>(Demarest </em>v. <em>Mayor of City of N.

Several of the victims of the gang had used petitioner in the past to guard their payrolls. On May 1 and 3, 1956, two sets of charges were filed against petitioner. The first set \u2014 referred to as the escort charges (No. 28644)\u2014contained 13 specifications. Four violations of Department Rules and Regulations were aEeged with respect to the escort of each of three named persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">1. Failure to obey lawful order of superior (to discontinue escort service after April 1, 1952) in violation of rule 201 (Specs. 1, 5, 9).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">2. Acceptance of gratuities for such service without consent of the Commissioner in violation of rule 232 (Specs. 2, 6, 10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">3. Failure' to obtain permission to leave post and (in two cases) precinct confines or to make entry thereof in memo book, in violation of rule 114 (Specs. 3, 7, 11).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">4. Riding in auto other than Police Department vehicle in violation of rule 125 (Specs. 4, 8, 12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">The 13th specification charged petitioner with failure to preserve his completed memorandum pads for future reference, in violation of rule 185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">The second set of charges \u2014 referred to as the criminal charges (No. 28645)\u2014contained 8 specifications alleging various acts of supplying information to the holdup gang and receipt of a share of the proceeds of certain of the robberies. Petitioner pleaded not guilty to both sets of charges, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>hearing was set down for June 4th. On that date the Corporation Counsel requested an adjournment of three weeks so that he could have a week to serve a requested bill of particulars and defendant\u2019s counsel could have two additional weeks to prepare his defense. Petitioner\u2019s attorney acquiesced, stating that \u201cthe time would be contingent upon when we received\u201d the bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Corporation Counsel did not serve the ME of particulars on the escort charges until the adjourned date of June 27th. Petitioner\u2019s attorney then stated to Commissioner Martin that he and opposing counsel had tentatively agreed upon a two-week adjournment pursuant to an understanding at the prior hearing that petitioner should have a reasonable time to study the ME. When the Commissioner denied an adjournment, petitioner\u2019s attorney stated he was totaEy unprepared to go to trial at that time, and that to do so would prejudice his cHent. He indicated his intention to walk out of the hearing if the Commissioner insisted on proceeding, and advised his cHent to do Hkewise, stating: \u201cyou may, as you see fit, try him in absentia.\u201d The Commissioner ordered petitioner to proceed to trial but the latter, on advice of counsel, left the hearing in the company of his attorney. Thereupon Commissioner Martin adjourned the hearing without date.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Petitioner\u2019s refusal to participate in the trial on June 27th was made the subject of a third set of charges, referred to as the insubordination charge (No. 28793). The specification aEeged that \u201c Ptl. Grottano did knowingly and wilfuEy disobey an order by the Trial Commissioner Joseph P. Martin \u201d, and then referred to the circumstances above recited. At the end of the specification appears the notation: \u201c (R&amp;R 201-297-435).\u201d Rule 201, already aEuded to with respect to the escort charges, required obedience to \u201c aE lawful orders of his superior officers rule 297 provided for punishment of \u201c disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order, efficiency or discipline and rule 435 provided, among other things, that \u2018 \u2018 prompt obedience to orders * * * wiU be exacted and rigidly enforced \u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">On July 6th, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the new charge, and it and the escort charges were set down for trial by Deputy Commissioner Melia for July 10th and later for July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>11th. Although petitioner\u2019s attorney conceded receipt of the bill of particulars on the escort charges on June 27th, together with a copy of the minutes of the investigation, he stated he had not yet inspected the department records with respect thereto, and twice protested to the Commissioner: \u201cI don\u2019t see what the hurry is.\u201d Three days previously, on or about July 3d, petitioner had applied for retirement to take effect on <em>August 2d </em>(see Administrative Code of City of New York, \u00a7 B18-4.0, subd. c).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The Commissioner indicated that the criminal charges would be tried not more than one week after completion of the trials on the other two charges, and the Corporation Counsel stated that he was then in a position to comply with petitioner\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars on the criminal charges. The prior objection that divulging of certain confidential information might embarrass or impede the prosecution of the robbery cases was no longer pressed. Upon hearing this, petitioner\u2019s attorney declared his refusal to proceed with the trial of <em>any </em>charges unless the criminal charges were tried first or dismissed, although at the June 4th hearing he merely stated that he <em>preferred </em>that \u201cthe quasi criminal charges\u201d be moved first.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">He made a \u201cspecial appearance\u201d on July 11th, the day finally set for trial, to repeat his objection, and upon denial of his application he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201c Under these circumstances may I in all due respect to you, Mr. Commissioner, advise my client not to participate in these proceedings, and we will take leave and you may do as you see fit provided you conduct this entire proceeding within his legal and constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Shortly thereafter, petitioner and his attorney walked out of the hearing room, and the Commissioner proceeded to take testimony on the insubordination and escort charges. The witnesses included Commissioner Martin, Inspector Siegert and the three persons for whom petitioner was charged with providing escort service.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">One week after the hearing, on July 18th, Commissioner Melia found petitioner guilty as charged, and recommended his dismissal. On July 27th respondent determined that petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was guilty as charged, except for specification 6 and part of specification 2 of the escort charges\u2014both concerning receipt of gratuities \u2014 and ordered that he be dismissed. It is conceded that no hearing was ever had on the criminal charges \u2014 despite promises to that effect by the Corporation Counsel and the Trial Commissioner\u2014nor were the charges dismissed. It is also undisputed that no criminal prosecution was evei instituted against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Several issues are presented by this appeal. Petitioner challenges his dismissal on the ground that it was based upon a hearing \u2018 \u2018 held in the absence of the petitioner who was ordered to trial under circumstances constituting a grave abuse of discretion\u201d. We do not see how Commissioner Helia\u2019s refusal to grant an adjournment beyond July 11th could be considered an abuse of discretion. As set out above, petitioner had been served with a bill of particulars on the escort charges, as well as a copy of the minutes of investigation, on June 27th\u2014and his attorney offered no valid reason why he had been unable to conduct the necessary investigation preparatory to trial, nor why such investigation could not have been completed prior to the trial date of July 11th, by which time he would have had the bill two weeks plus one day. Departmental regulations required that a trial be conducted \u201cwithout unnecessary or unreasonable delay\u201d (art. 5, \u00a7 13). In view of the fact that petitioner\u2019s retirement would take effect August 2d, the Trial Commissioner could take into account petitioner\u2019s apparent attempt to \u201c render the trial futile insofar as [his pension was] concerned\u201d <em>(Matter of Evans </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>306 N. Y. 312, 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We also think that the Commissioner had power to try petitioner in his absence, after his refusal to participate in the trial and under the circumstances here presented. Petitioner\u2019s attorney seems to have been under the impression throughout the proceeding that the department had the power to hold a disciplinary trial in the absence of the defendant. Upon walking out the first time, he told Commissioner Martin, as already noted: \u201c you may, as you see fit, try him in absentia.\u201d He probably took this attitude because he assumed the escort charges were not serious. On walking out the second time, he said to Commissioner Helia: \u201c you may do as you see fit pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>vided you conduct this entire proceeding within his legal and constitutional rights.\u201d While it would no doubt have been better if the department could have tried the so-called criminal charges prior to or with the less serious offenses, its failure so to do did not justify petitioner\u2019s refusal to participate in the trial, particularly in view of what had previously transpired. A policeman may not walk out of a disciplinary hearing to avoid a trial on the eve of his retirement, and then claim that an otherwise lawful trial is invalid because he was tried <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In <em>People ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Police Comrs. </em>(67 N. Y. 475, 477), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201c The accused did not appear in person or by counsel, and the board were therefore authorized to proceed and publicly examine into the charges and inquire into their truth in his absence and <em>ex parte.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">(See, also, <em>People ex rel. Clapp </em>v. <em>Board of Police, </em>5 Hun 457, revd. on another ground, 72 N. Y. 415.) Although sanctioning generally a trial <em>in absentia </em>in the <em>Miller </em>case, we reversed the dismissal since the Commissioners had not conducted a trial or examination but had \u201c adjudged him guilty upon a paper not legitimately before them \u201d. The trial of the escort charges in the instant case, on the other hand, was conducted with due regard for petitioner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">A further question presented is whether petitioner\u2019s refusal, on the advice of counsel, to obey the order to proceed to trial on <em>June 27th </em>could be made the basis of an insubordination charge. We conclude that it may not. Insubordination presupposes a \u201c lawful \u201d order of a superior (rule 201). Here the order to proceed to trial under the circumstances involved constituted an abuse of discretion on the part of the Trial Commissioner (see <em>Matter of Bush </em>v. <em>Beckmann, </em>283 App. Div. 1070). At <em>that </em>stage of the proceedings \u2014 the June 27th hearing\u2014 in contrast with the later stage heretofore discussed, petitioner was clearly entitled to an adjournment for a reasonable time in order to prepare his case, in light of the fact that the bill of particulars was not served until the <em>morning </em>of June 27th.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">We think the insubordination charge should be dismissed for an additional reason. When the Trial Commissioner ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>petitioner to proceed to trial, he was not acting in the capacity of his \u201c superior officer \u201d within the meaning and intent of the department rules. In <em>People ex rel. Schauwecker </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(96 App. Div. 249, 254), the police officer was tiharged with insubordination for refusing at a trial, on the advice of counsel, to be sworn on behalf of the prosecution. In reversing and ordering the officer\u2019s reinstatement, the unanimous court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cWe think a distinction is to be made between the position occupied by a commissioner generally and when he is presiding as a judge at a trial. At such times the accused has been suspended from the force, and the commissioner is acting not as his superior officer but as his judge upon the charges preferred. The rules governing judicial tribunals, therefore, and not the rules of the police department would seemingly apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">See, also, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>(195 App. Div. 814, 821) where the court additionally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\"><em>11 </em>If the right to counsel secured to the accused by the statute means anything, the action of the suspended police officer in foEowing that advice cannot be made the basis of a charge of insubordination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The policy behind these decisions is a wise one. To hold otherwise and subject defendants in these quasi-judicial trials to discipEnary charges for every refusal to obey an order of the Trial Commissioner pertaining to the conduct of the trial would unduly stultify such trials, and hamper the actions of attorneys in defending their cEents against what are often serious charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the findings of guilt on the various specifications that make up the escort charges. Since, however, the insubordination charge may not be sustained, we must remit the matter to the respondent to redetermine punishment in the light of the charges that have been sustained <em>(Matter of Flo Inn </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>305 N. Y. 602; <em>Matter of Wood </em>v. <em>Village of Port Chester, </em>284 App. Div. 900; <em>People ex rel. Long </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>143 App. Div. 17, 21). If, upon the remission, the new punishment imposed is whoEy disproportionate to the remaining offense or offenses, the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tioner will have an opportunity for further judicial review (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1296, suhd. 5-a).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The order appealed from should he modified by annulling so much of the determination of respondent as finds petitioner guilty of the charge contained in case No. 28793 (the so-called insubordination charge) and as dismisses him from the police force, Police Department, City of New York, and the matter remitted to respondent for a redetermination of the measure of punishment with respect to the charges which have not been annulled, and, as so modified, the order appealed from should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fund, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Order modified and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to appellant, and the matter remitted to the Police Commissioner for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
