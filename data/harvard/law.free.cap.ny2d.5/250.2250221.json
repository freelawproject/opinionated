Y. 230.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY3\">In October of 1954 defendant Rosa G-iarraputo gave the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Wilhnott, an option for a period of six months to purchase a piece of property which she owned. The option agreement, although containing various terms of sale, including the description of the property, the price to be paid and the amount of the purchase-money mortgage, provided, with respect to that mortgage, that 11 the payment of interest and amortization of principal shall be mutually agreed upon at the time of entering into a more formal contract.\u201d The plaintiffs elected to exercise the option and a formal contract was submitted to them by the defendant\u2019s attorney on June 1, 1955. It contained a provision that the mortgage was to be paid in installments and that the entire balance was to become due in 11 years. The plaintiffs declined to sign, it being their claim that an open mortgage had been agreed upon. They consulted a lawyer who modified the contract by inserting a provision which recited that \u201c Said mortgage [was] to include a privilege of pre-payment and a clause permitting the mortgagor to obtain releases of part of the mortgaged premises upon payment of 125% of the mortgage burden as apportioned to the part to be released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">After some delay\u2014nothing turns upon it since time has been found not of the essence \u2014 the plaintiffs signed the contract as thus changed and returned it to the defendant for her signature. She rejected it and this action to compel specific performance followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The defendant pleaded the Statute of Frauds and asserted a counterclaim for damages. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim\u2014with which we are not here concerned\u2014held the statute no bar and directed specific performance. In reaching this conclusion, the court said in part that the Statute of Frauds was \u201c satisfied by the signing of the option agreement by defendant and the preparation of the formal contract by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>her attorney \u201d. The Appellate Division modified the judgment insofar as it mandated specific performance and dismissed the complaint upon the ground that \u201c The written option was unenforcible because agreement upon terms of the purchase-money mortgage was left to the future \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Few principles are better settled in the law of contract than the proposition that, \u201c If a material element of a contemplated contract is left for future negotiations, there is no contract enforcible under the Statute of Frauds or otherwise.\u201d <em>(Ansorge </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>244 N. Y. 395, 398; see, also, <em>Keystone Hardware Corp. </em>v. <em>Tagne, </em>246 N. Y. 79, 82, 84; <em>Pollak </em>v. <em>Dapper, </em>245 N. Y. 628, affg. 219 App. Div. 455.) While the price was the \u201cmaterial element\u201d omitted in the <em>Ansorge </em>case, <em>Pollak </em>v. <em>Dapper </em>presents a situation almost identical with that now before us in that the memorandum explicitly provided that the terms of the purchase-money mortgage were to await the signing of a formal contract. Here, too, the option agreement expressly recites that the \u201cpayment of interest and amortization of principal\u201d provided for in the mortgage were to be 1 <em>\u2018 </em>mutually agreed upon at the time of entering into a more formal contract.\u201d And, as one of the plaintiffs actually testified, the parties never agreed upon that matter. Not only were the plaintiffs dissatisfied with the contract drafted by the defendant\u2019s lawyer, but their own attorney made a still further amendment to the contract, with respect to prepayment, which the parties had, so far as appears, never even discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">That is the end of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">However, in view of the reliance placed upon <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp. </em>(305 N. Y. 48), we add these few words. The plaintiff in that case sued the Elizabeth Arden company for breach of a contract of employment, relying upon an unsigned memorandum of the essential terms of the contract and a signed \u2018 \u2018 pay-roll change card \u2019 \u2019 which contained all of the terms except the duration of the contract. Together, these two writings were deemed sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, and oral testimony was admitted \u201c to show the connection between the documents and to establish the acquiescence, of the party to be charged, to the contents of the one unsigned \u201d (p. 55). With respect to such parol evidence, we declared, \u201c If that testimony does not convincingly connect the papers, or <em>does not show </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>assent to the unsigned paper, </em>it is within the province of the judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that the statute has not been satisfied \u201d (p. 56). And, of course, if no assent is shown, not only is the statute not satisfied, but there is no contract whatsoever. In the case before us, as already noted, it is clear beyond question \u2014 and from Mr. Willmott\u2019s own say-so, even though the defendant\u2019s son told a different story \u2014 that the parties never reached an agreement with respect to the terms of the purchase-money mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
