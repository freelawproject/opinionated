The position of District Administrator is a subordinate position, is not an independent office, and, as a matter of law, is not a \u201cdeputy\u201d. <em>(Heath </em>v. <em>Creagh, </em>197 Misc. 537, 276 App. Div. 948; <em>Matter of Erikson </em>v. <em>Helfand, </em>1 A D 2d 59, 1 N Y 2d 775; <em>Matter of Byrnes </em>v. <em>Windels, </em>265 N.

On March 22, 1957 respondent-appellant (hereinafter called respondent) summarily removed petitioner from this position. Thereupon petitioner commenced this article 78 proceeding for an order of reinstatement on the ground that subdivision 1 of section 22 of the Civil Service Law prohibited his removal without a hearing on \"written charges of incompetency or misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The petition for reinstatement was opposed on the ground that petitioner was a \u201cdeputy\u201d within the meaning of the <em>legislative </em>exception contained in the proviso of subdivision 1 of section 22, and thus not entitled to its protection. It is conceded that the position of District Administrator is not an 1 \u2018 independent office \u2019 \u2019, a <em>judicially </em>created exception to the protective coverage of subdivision 1 of section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Petitioner\u2019s principal contention, in brief, is that to be a \u201c deputy \u201d within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 22 it is necessary (1) that the <em>position </em>be named or specifically prescribed in a statute, and (2) that the <em>duties </em>of the position be prescribed by statute. Since the position of District Administrator is not specifically named in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, or any other 'statute, and inasmuch as there is no statutory delineation of' the duties of such position, he argues that, as a matter of law, he cannot be a \u201cdeputy\u201d. He further contends that even if a District Administrator is legally capable of being a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>deputy \u2019 \u2019, the nature of his duties is such that he cannot be said to be a \u201c deputy \u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the language of section 152 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, which authorizes her as Chairman of the board to delegate her administrative powers and duties to \u201cthe head of any bureau or section of the board\u201d, is sufficient authority for the creation of \u201cdeputies\u201d, and that by delegating certain powers and duties, enumerated in paragraphs fifteenth to thirty-third of her answer, to petitioner as one of her District Administrators, she constituted him a \u201cdeputy\u201d within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Special Term ruled in favor of petitioner, concluding that \u201cneither by legislative title nor by lawful authority, vested in his position by statute or otherwise, is [petitioner] a deputy or independent officer\u201d. In affirming, the majority of the Appellate Division emphasized that District Administrators were <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 subordinate employees \u2019 \u2019 and relied, among other things, on the fact that the language of section 152 was merely permissive and the delegation of duties revocable. Although the majority felt that there were some \u201c\u2018fringe issues of fact involved \u2019 \u201d, it did not \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 regard them as of decisive significance \u2019 \u201d, since the detailed description of the duties and responsibilities of the office of District Administrator, contained in the pleadings and exhibits attached thereto, showed conclusively \u2018 \u2018 that the position from which the petitioner was removed was a <em>subordinate one </em>whose duties were not prescribed by statute and petitioner could not be termed a \u2018 deputy \u2019 within the meaning of section 22 of the Civil Service Law\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">For a position to be deemed that of \u201cdeputy\u201d, it is not required that it be specifically <em>named </em>in a statute or that its duties be prescribed by statute. It is sufficient if a statute <em>authorises </em>the delegation of such type of duties as ordinarily would be exercised by one occupying a position of \u201c deputy \u201d. It is conceded in this case that petitioner was the \u201c head \u201d of the Albany office of the board and as such was the \u201c head \u201d of several \u201cbureaus\u201d. Although the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law does not name the position of District Administrator, such a position was clearly contemplated when, in section 152, the Chairman was authorized to delegate any of her administrative powers to \u201c the head of any bureau or section of the board\u201d. In our opinion this is sufficient statutory language <em>authorising </em>the position of District Administrator, and said section 152 is also sufficient statutory authority, under the decisions of this court, for the creation of \u201c deputies \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As early as 1907, in interpreting the same proviso as is presently contained in subdivision 1 of section 22, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cWe think that when the statute excepted from limitations upon the power to remove certain persons like relator <em>the office of deputy, cashier or private secretary, </em>it contemplates only positions brought within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>these excepted classes by the terms of the laws which created or authorized and defined them, or at the most <em>positions ivhich under some sufficient authority at the discretion of the appointing or superior power have been invested with the ditties and character of one of the excepted positions.\u201d (People ex rel. Hoefle </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>188 N. Y. 489, 497-498; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">This language was quoted with approval in <em>Matter of Byrnes </em>v. <em>Windels (265 N. </em>Y. 403, 407). In <em>Matter of Rohr </em>v. <em>Kenngott </em>(288 N. Y. 97, 105), we held that the <em>\u201c </em>Legislature did not intend that rights of tenure to a position should be determined by the name given to the position \u201d. And in <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Creagh </em>(197 Misc. 537, 547, affd. 276 App. Div. 948), the court correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u2018 \u2018 It is clear from the cases cited that in order to bring the petitioner\u2019s position within the statutory concept of a deputy, the respondents must show that there was some statute making the petitioner a deputy with authority to take over and perform the duties vested in the principal officer <em>or that there was a statute authorizing the principal officer to delegate his duties and thus to create a deputy ship.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The crux of the holding in that case\u2014that the Deputy Director of Public Works for the City of Niagara Falls was not a 11 deputy \u2019 \u2019 within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 22 \u2014 was that the statute did not <em>authorize </em>the Director of Public Works to <em>delegate any </em>of <em>his </em>statutory powers to his <em>deputies; \u2018 \u2018 </em>there was no statutory basis for this assignment of duties \u2019 \u2019 (p. 541).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The requirement that a statute create the position and delineate its duties is applicable, not to the category of \u201c deputy \u201d, but to the category of <em>\u201c </em>independent office \u201d, a judicially created exception to the operation of section 22. This was pointed out by our opinion in <em>Matter of O\u2019Day </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(308 N. Y. 580, 586) where, in attempting to formulate a general guide to aid in the determination of what persons were independent officers, we said: \u201c he is an independent officer whose position is created, and whose powers and duties are prescribed by statute and who exercises a high degree of initiative and independent judgment \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>There is a distinct difference between the nature of the duties required to constitute a position one of <em>1 \u2018 </em>independent office \u201d and those requisite to a position of \u201c deputy\u201d, and the failure to recognize that deputies, as opposed to independent officers, are <em>subordinate </em>employees is responsible, in large measure, for the determination of the majority in the Appellate Division. The very reason for the judicial creation of the exception of \u201c independent office \u201d, as stated in <em>Matter of Mylod, </em>v. <em>Graves </em>(274 N. Y. 381, 384), was that \u201c Section 22 of the Civil Service Law was intended to apply only to those holding positions of a <em>subordinate nature\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). It is the independent officer and not the \u201c deputy \u201d who <em>\u201c </em>exercises a high degree of initiative and independent judgment \u201d, and whose position and duties need be prescribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Section 141 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law constitutes the Chairman the <em>\u201c </em>administrative head of the workmen\u2019s compensation board \u201d and invests him with all the duties and powers of administration, formerly held by the Industrial Commissioner (L. 1921, ch. 50), as well as the duties specified elsewhere in the law. If we accept petitioner\u2019s contention that a position, in order to be filled by a \u201c deputy \u201d, must be specifically named in the statute and defined as to duties, then the Chairman, charged with administering the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law throughout the entire State, involving, among other things, the processing of countless thousands of claims each year, is incapable of having deputies. We conclude that the statute, by authorizing the Chairman to delegate her powers of administration to the heads of bureaus and sections, provided for the creation of deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Thus the only remaining question involved in this case is whether the Chairman invested petitioner, as one of her District Administrators, with enough of her administrative powers so as to constitute him a deputy in the exercise of the Chairman\u2019s administrative functions. Prior to considering this question, however, it is necessary to ascribe some content to the term \u201c deputy \u201d as used in subdivision 1 of section 22. In this connection, in <em>Matter of Byrnes </em>v. <em>Windels (supra, </em>p. 407), where we held an Assistant Corporation Counsel was a deputy within the purview of subdivision 1 of section 22, we noted that the term \u201c deputy\u201d was defined as \u201c one who is appointed, desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>nated or deputed to act for another \u2019 \u2019 and that a deputy may he general or special. We further pointed out that the term \u2018 \u2018 deputy \u2019 \u2019 had different meanings within the Civil Service Law itself. Section 13 of the law, which states what positions are included in the exempt class, provides (stibd. 1): \u201c The deputies of principal executive officers authorized by law to act generally for and in place of their principals \u201d. We then commented as follows (p. 409):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">1 \u2018 That the classification of 1 deputy \u2019 in section 13, subdivision 1, is not intended to be a definition or limitation upon the use of the word throughout the entire act, is quite evident, when we see that the position of cashier or private secretary, if there be more than one, is not included in section 13, but is included in the exception to section 22. In other words, <em>\u2018 </em>deputy,\u2019 <em>in this exception, may be broader in meaning than when used in subdivision 1 of section 13.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">It is quite clear, then, that a 11 deputy \u2019 \u2019, within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 22, like a cashier or private secretary, holds a position of a <em>subordinate nature, </em>and we recognized this in <em>Matter of Mylod </em>v. <em>Graves (supra). </em>To conclude that petitioner, as District Administrator, is a \u201c subordinate employee \u2019 \u2019 does not determine that he is not a \u201c deputy \u201d, as the opinions below seem to indicate, nor does it even aid in resolving the question. Rather, we must draw the line, as stated in <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Creagh (supra, </em>p. 543), \u201c between subordinates who are deputies within the meaning of the provision of section 22 here referred to and those who are not such deputies \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The inquiry as to whether a position is one of a subordinate nature is relevant only in distinguishing such positions from \u201cindependent offices \u201d (see <em>Matter of O\u2019Day </em>v. <em>Yeager, supra, </em>p. 586). An indication that the majority of the Appellate Division failed to distinguish the category of \u2018 \u2018 independent office \u2019 \u2019 from that of \u201c deputy \u201d is their reliance on the fact that section 152 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is permissive in that \u201c the chairman, at her pleasure, may delegate certain duties and likewise may revoke them at any time \u201d. This fact would be significant only in determining whether petitioner was an \u201c independent officer \u201d, and has nothing at all to do with whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>he is a \u201c deputy \u2019 It would seem that the duties of \u2018 \u2018 one who is appointed, designated or deputed to act for another \u2019 \u2019 would, by the very nature of the position, be subject to the pleasure of the principal for whom that \u2018 \u2018 one \u2019 \u2019 is acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">We return now to the question of whether petitioner, as District Administrator, was invested with sufficient of respondent\u2019s administrative powers to constitute him a \u201cdeputy\u201d. Paragraph fourteenth of respondent\u2019s answer, which is expressly admitted in petitioner\u2019s reply, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201c <em>That the source of the District Administrator\u2019s powers is the Chairman of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, </em>who by virtue of Section 141 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law possesses the <em>administrative </em>powers in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In paragraphs fifteenth to thirty-third of her answer, accompanied by exhibits, respondent enumerates several illustrative powers delegated to petitioner and describes various other duties exercised by a District Administrator. Two of the powers listed, however, namely, the powers to reopen and restore certain types of cases to the calendar, were allegedly delegated to petitioner by the board and not by the Chairman and appear to be in the nature of quasi-judicial rather than administrative powers. Furthermore, in an affidavit submitted in support of his reply, pursuant to section 1292 of the Civil Practice Act, petitioner alleges that the powers and duties he exercised were not only shared by others but were restricted and narrowed and subject to policy determinations of other officials of the board, thereby precluding his position from being that of \u201c deputy \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Inasmuch as the powers and duties alleged to have been delegated by the <em>Chairman </em>to petitioner as <em>District Administrator </em>are said to be illustrative and not complete, and since there is an issue as to the actual exercise by petitioner of said powers and duties, this proceeding may not be summarily disposed of on the present record. We thus agree with Justice Bergan that triable issues are presented and that there should be a hearing at Special Term, pursuant to section 1295 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Civil Practice Act, so that these matters may be sufficiently developed and definite findings made thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted to Special Term for further proceeding\u2019s not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Chief Judg\u2019e Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> The Civil Service Law was completely revised, but the revision will not be effective until April 1, 1959. Former section 22 has been substantially retained, and the proviso involved in this case may be found in section 75 (subd. 1, par. [b]) of the new law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
