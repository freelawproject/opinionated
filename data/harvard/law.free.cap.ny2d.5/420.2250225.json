Under the State Constitution \u201cthe New York State Thruway Authority\u201d is so far an immediate operating instrumentality of the State itself that, for the bonds therein authorized, the Legislature may make \u2018 \u2018 the State liable \u2019 \u2019 and the consequent debts are \u201c those created on behalf of the State \u201d and constitute \u201c the liability of the State.\u201d Hence, its design and specifications for the police barracks, by the Superintendent of Public Works as its agent, on land acquired and held in the name of the State for the Thruway, is by a \u201c board \u2019 \u2019 and by an \u20181 officer \u2019 \u2019 within the meaning of section 135 of the State Finance Law. <em>(Easley </em>v. <em>New York State Thruway Auth., </em>1 N Y 2d 374; <em>Pantess </em>v. <em>Saratoga Springs Auth., </em>255 App. Div. 426; <em>Meriwether </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>102 U.

Other sections of the Public Authorities Law and of the statutes made applicable thereby also manifest the intent of the constitutional and statutory program (contemporaneously adopted by the Legislature in 1950 and since maintained) that the Thruway Authority is \u201c a board \u201d constituting a State enterprise, State operation and State use of land owned by the State, and hence is subject to section 135 of the State Finance Law in the erection on such land of servicing buildings for the State. For the effectuation of this State enterprise, the Thruway Act and the Finance Law constitute an integrated program. III. Important public issues are involved which require determination. <em>(Matter of Lyon Co. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>261 N. Y. 497; <em>Delavan </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>N. H. &amp; H. R. R.

The specifications for the work provided for the construction, plumbing, heating and ventilating, electrical and site development work to be performed under a single contract for each of the six projects. A contractors association brought this proceeding to compel the Thruway Authority and the respondent Superintendent of Public Works (1) to withdraw the notice to bidders which had been published and (2) to publish a new one containing separate specifications so as to permit separate bidding on each of the three subdivisions of work specified in section 135 of the State Finance Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Insofar as pertinent, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Every officer, board, department, commission or commissions charged with the duty of preparing specifications or awarding or entering into contracts for the erection [or] construction * * * of buildings, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the state, when the entire cost of snch work shall exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, must have prepared separate specifications for each of the following three subdivisions of the work to be performed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">1. Plumbing and gas fitting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">2. Steam heating, hot water heating, ventilating and air conditioning apparatus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">3. Electric wiring and standard illuminating fixtures. Such specifications must be so drawn as to permit separate and independent bidding upon each of the above three subdivisions of work. All contracts hereafter awarded by the state or a department, board, commissioner or officer thereof, for the erection, construction or alteration of buildings, or any part thereof, shall award the three subdivisions of the above specified work separately to responsible and reliable persons, firms or corporations engaged in these classes of work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Asserting that the statute does not apply to the Thruway Authority, the respondents moved to dismiss the proceeding. The court at Special Term granted the motion, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the resulting order and we granted leave to appeal to afford us an opportunity to decide whether the Authority is to be deemed a \u201c board \u201d or \u201c department \u2019 \u2019 of the State within the meaning of section 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The Thruway Authority was created by a special act of the Legislature (L. 1950, ch. 143) as a <em>\u201c </em>public corporation \u201d to construct and maintain a thruway system (Public Authorities Law, \u00a7\u00a7 352, 353). Although created by the State and subject to dissolution by the State, these public corporations are independent and autonomous, deliberately designed to be able to function with a freedom and flexibility not permitted to an ordinary State board, department or commission. (See State and Local Q-overnment in New York, New York State Constitutional Convention Committee Report [1938], Yol. 4, p. 189 <em>et seq.; </em>N. Y. Co-ordination Comm. Staff Report on Public Authorities under New York State, N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1956, No. 46, p. 54 <em>et seq., </em>p. 554 <em>et seq.) </em>The corporate entity is interposed, it has been said (1951 Atty.-G-en. 130, 132), both to <em>\u201c </em>protect the State from liability and enable public projects to be carried on free from restrictions otherwise applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Indeed, the statute creating the Thruway Authority is replete with provisions which emphasize its separate and independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>existence and serve to distinguish it sharply from the type of State board or department which would be subject to the requirements of the State Finance Law with respect to bidding. We note, simply for purposes of illustration \u2014 for it by no means exhausts the list\u2014that the Authority is expressly empowered to <em>11 </em>make contracts, \u201d \u2018 \u2018 acquire * * * real property \u201d, \u201cborrow money and issue [its own] negotiable * * * obligations \u201d without public referendum and, significantly, \u20181 accept any gifts or * * * grant of funds or property * * * from the state of New York\u201d (\u00a7 354) and become \u201c indebted to the state \u201d (\u00a7 357). The notes and bonds issued by the Authority are its primary obligation, the State\u2019s obligation being merely that of a guarantor (\u00a7 366), and only to the maximum amount of $500,000,000 (N. Y. Const., art X, \u00a7 6). If, as asserted, there was an identity between Authority and State it is difficult to perceive how the Authority could receive gifts from, or become indebted to, the State and, quite obviously, the latter\u2019s guaranty of the Authority\u2019s obligations would be superfluous and unnecessary. Finally, we would add that traffic control upon the Thruway is exercised by the Authority and not by the State through its Traffic Commission (Public Authorities Law, \u00a7 361).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">As would, of course, be expected, the cases confirm the conclusion that a public authority enjoys an existence separate and apart from the State, even though it exercises a governmental function (see, e.g., <em>Malone </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>1 N Y 2d 837; <em>Pantess </em>v. <em>Saratoga Springs Auth., </em>255 App. Div. 426), and nothing decided or said in <em>Easley </em>v. <em>New York State Thruway Auth. </em>(1 N Y 2d 374) detracts from the force of what we have written. The court did, in the course of its opinion in <em>Easley, </em>note that \u201c this Authority is an arm or agency of the State \u201d (1 N Y 2d, at p. 376), but, as the Appellate Division observed herein, 1 \u2018 that is far different from saying it <em>is </em>the State.\u201d Certainly, there is a close relationship between the Thruway Authority and the State, and we simply remarked that fact in upholding the Legislature\u2019s power to confer upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine all claims against the Authority (Public Authorities Law, \u00a7 361-b). However close such relationship may be, though, it is abundantly clear that the Authority stands on its own feet, transacts its business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>affairs through its own personnel and on its own initiative and is not subject to the strict requirements imposed upon a board or department of the State by a provision such as section 135 of the State Finance Law. (Cf. Public Housing Law, \u00a7 151-a; General Municipal Law, \u00a7 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fboessel, Van Voobhis and Bubke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. Although the projects to which the bids related have been completed, the importance of the question presented\u2014the applicability of section <em>135 </em>to public authorities such as the Thruway Authority \u2014 and the likelihood of its recurrence again and again dissuade us from dismissing the appeal as moot. (See <em>Matter of Rosenbluth </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>300 N. Y. 402, 404; <em>Matter of United Press Assns. </em>v. <em>Valente, </em>308 N. Y. 71, 76; see, also, Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, p. 421.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
