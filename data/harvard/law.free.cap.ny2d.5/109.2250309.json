Pro., \u00a7 699; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Marincic, </em>2 N Y 2d 181). And, to render the applicable statutory provisions meaningful and effective, this court recently declared in the <em>Marincic </em>case (2 N Y 2d, at p. 184), the judge presiding \u201c must make it clear \u201d that such are the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In the cases before us, 17 in number, although the city court judge may have exhibited solicitude for the several defendants and may have told them that they had a right to be represented by counsel, he failed to make it sufficiently clear that they also had the right to a postponement of the proceedings to permit them to obtain and consult with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The judgments should be reversed and a new trial ordered as to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
