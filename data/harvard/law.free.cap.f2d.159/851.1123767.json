Representatives of defendant Department of Health of the State of New Jersey (hereinafter called \u201cDepartment\u201d) inspected plaintiff\u2019s plant, as a result of which it was ascertained that a certain dairy from which plaintiff received milk and cream had not been approved by the Department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, on April 9, 1941, defendant J. Lynn Mahaffey (hereinafter called \u201cMahaffey\u201d), Director of Health of the State of New Jersey, wrote plaintiff a letter in which he rejected plaintiff\u2019s application for a permit to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>under the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Six days later, Mahaf-fey, in a letter to Newark-Aerated, withheld approval of its application for a permit for the same reason, and added the following remark: \u201c* * * furthermore, you are advised to immediately discontinue the distribution of milk products in this State, which said products are obtained from or prepared for distribution in any milk plant or creamery which fails to meet the requirements of the statute aforementioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Conversations between plaintiff and a representative of the Department, both before and alter the letters quoted above, revealed that plaintiff would be granted a permit only if all the milk and cream used in plaintiffs plant came from sources approved by the Department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff thereupon brought this suit, seeking an injunction to prevent the Department and Mahaffey from interfering with the sale of Instantwhip in New Jersey and from enforcing the statute, which was alleged to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-21\">At the conclusion of the testimony in the court below, the district judge granted a motion to dismiss as to the Department, on the ground that the Department is the State, which the Eleventh Amendment renders immune to suit; and entered judgment for Mahaffey on the merits, finding that he had neither taken nor threatened action giving plaintiff a cause for complaint. The court took the view that the permit negotiations between plaintiff and the representatives of Mahaffey were of no legal effect, because \u201cthe statute specifically limits its operation to the production, distribution and sale of milk, cream and milk products within the State of New Jersey,\u201d and \u201cthe provisions of this statute do not apply to nonresidents of New Jersey.\u201d D.C.1945, 59 F.Supp. 652, 657.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">The Eleventh Amendment of the Federal Constitution denies to federal courts the jurisdiction over suits against a State by citizens of another State. The Department is a part of the executive branch of the New Jersey government. Revised Statutes of New Jersey of 1937, 26:-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>2-1 et seq., N.J.S.A.; Board of Health v. Mundet Cork Corporation, 1939, 126 N.J.Eq. 100, 8 A.2d 105, affirmed 1940, 127 N.J.Eq. 61, 11 A.2d 260. Consequently, we agree with the court below that plaintiff\u2019s suit against the Department is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendinent. Ford Co. v. Department of Treasury, 1945, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As to Mahaffey, the rule is equally clear that his function as a public official brings him within the protection of the Eleventh Amendment only if the statutes authorizing his actions are constitutional, and if his actions do not exceed the authority granted him. Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, 1935, 294 U.S. 511, 55 S.Ct. 497, 79 L.Ed. 1032, 101 A.L.R. 55. If the activities of Mahaffey are in violation of a right guaranteed by the federal Constitution, this court has jurisdiction to enjoin such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal, therefore, raises two questions which we have jurisdiction to decide: (1) Does New Jersey have the power to limit the distribution and sale in New Jersey of Instantwhip manufactured in Pennsylvania? (2) Is plaintiff entitled to an injunction preventing Mahaffey from interfering with shipments of Instantwhip into New Jersey?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">As to the first question: The testimony reveals that all distributing and selling of Instantwhip in New Jersey is performed by Newark-Aerated. Newark-Aerated is not acting as an agent of plaintiff, and is not a party to this suit. Adjudication of this issue, therefore, would affect the rights of Newark-Aerated without giving it the opportunity to be heard. See Mallow v. Hinde, 1827, 25 U.S. 193, 198, 12 Wheat. 193, 198, 6 L.Ed. 599; quoted in Buss v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 8 Cir. 1942, 126 F.2d 960, 967. Consequently, we are not called upon to decide, and do not decide, what effect the statute and the activities of Mahaffey would have upon the rights of Newark-Aerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">As to the second question: Our examination of the record in this case indicates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that no action had been taken or threatened by Mahaffey which would jeopardize plaintiff\u2019s right to ship. Indeed, defendant concedes the right, and points out further that that right was exercised without hindrance for nine months, while the statute was in effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">At best, therefore, it would appear that an injunction is sought prematurely by plaintiff. \u201cIt is elementary that a court of equity will not grant an injunction to restrain one from doing what he is not attempting and does not intend to do.\u201d Blease v. Safety Transit Co., 4 Cir. 1931, 50 F.2d 852, 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-9\"> The ingredients of the product are butterfat, cream or milk, sugar, and vanilla.

Lynn Ma-haffey, that it discontinue sending its product into the State.\u201d This statement also appears in the opinion, with the word \u201cadvised\u201d italicized. The transcript of the trial testimony submitted to this court, however, indicates that Mahaffey himself dealt directly with the plaintiff only when he wrote the letter set forth in footnote 3, supra; and the opinion of the lower court includes the statement that \u201c* * * the only evidence appearing in the ease of any action on the part of this defendant [Mahaffey] directed towards this plaintiff is the following letter written by him: [text of letter quoted in footnote 3, supra].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-27\">Plaintiff did introduce testimony concerning the interviews with one of Ma-haffey\u2019s assistants. One of the two witnesses testified that Mahaffey\u2019s assistant said that Instantwhip could not be <em>shipped, </em>the other witness that the assistant said Instantwhip could not be <em>sold, </em>unless cream approved by New Jersey was used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\"> Since no attempt has been made, or is contemplated, to apply the statute to shipments by plaintiff, the contention that Instantwhip is a \u201cfood product\u201d and not a \u201cmilk product\u201d becomes academic. It is sufficient to note that the definition of \u201cmilk products\u201d in the statute (paragraph 24:10-1 j, set forth in footnote 2, supra), as conceded by plaintiff, is sufficiently broad to include Instantwhip. Such classification we deem to be neither capricious nor ill-advised. Cf. Leaman v. District of Columbia, 1932, 60 App.D.C. 395, 55 F.2d 1020.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
