Robb, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Harry C. Robb, of Washington, D. C. (John W. Robb, of Cleveland, Ohio, of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b949-22\">Before GARRETT, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, HATFIELD, JACKSON, and O\u2019CONNELL, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b949-23\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">This is an appeal in a trade-mark opposition proceeding from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, 65 U.S.P.Q. 437, affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining appellee\u2019s opposition to the registration of appellant\u2019s mark under section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-25\">Appellant\u2019s trade-mark comprises the terms \u201cAluminoid\u201d and \u201cColloidal Alumina,\u201d the term \u201cColloidal Alumina\u201d being disclaimed apart from the mark as shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-26\">There are other features in appellant\u2019s mark which need not be described here because the dominant feature of appellant\u2019s mark is the term \u201cAluminoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-27\">Appellant\u2019s mark has been used in interstate commerce since May 14, 1940, on \u201ccolloidal aluminum hydroxide in powder form\u201d and is sold in gelatin capsules for the treatment of gastric ulcers and hyper-acidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-28\">Appellee\u2019s mark consists of the term \u201cAloloid\u201d which was registered August 19, 1941, No. 389,778, upon an application filed April 5, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-29\">Appellee\u2019s product is a medicinal preparation and comprises an emulsion of aluminum hydroxide with mineral oil and is used for the treatment of gastric hyper-acidity and peptic ulcers.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-30\">The evidence in the case was stipulated by the parties. It appears therefrom that appellee commenced the use of its trademark on its product on January <em>2, </em>1940, and it is conceded by counsel for appellant that appellee was the first to use its mark on its goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>It appears from the record that the goods of each of the parties is used medicinally for the same purpose and each is composed essentially of aluminum hydroxide. The only difference between the goods of the respective parties is that appellant\u2019s is in the form of a powder and is sold in capsules, whereas appellee\u2019s goods is an emulsion composed of mineral oil and aluminum hydroxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Although it is not stated in the agreed statement of facts that the goods of the parties are sold by drug stores to the purchasing public; it is obvious that they are. That they are competitive products and sold for treatment of the same ailments is not disputed. Although not identical, the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties and the sole question in the case is whether the trade-mark of appellant \u2014 Aluminoid\u2014is confusingly similar to appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u2014 Aloloid.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the marks were confusingly similar and, therefore, appellant was not entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that appellant\u2019s trade-mark Alu-minoid is \u201csubstantially different in sound, appearance and significance\u201d from the trade-mark of appellee and that as the goods are not identical \u2014 appellant\u2019s being put up in capsules in the form of powder, whereas appellee\u2019s is in the form of an emulsion \u2014 it is unlikely that the concurrent use by the parties of their trade-marks on their goods would result in confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Several cases are cited by counsel for appellant which, it is alleged, support their theory, that there is no likelihood of confusion in the concurrent use of the involved trade-marks. The case most strongly relied upon by counsel for appellant is that of Ciba Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., v. Abbott Laboratories, 121 F.2d 551, 553, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1315, in which it was held that the trade-marks \u201cDical-D,\u201d the final letter \u201cD\u201d being disclaimed apart from the mark as shown, used on \u201cmedicinal wafers containing dicalcium phosphate and viosterol,\u201d recommended and used for dietary deficiencies, was not confusingly similar with the trade-marks \u201cDial-Ciba\u201d and \u201cDial\u201d used on a pharmaceutical product \u2014 a dormitive and a sedative. Counsel for appellant particularly emphasizes a statement in that decision where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-9\">\u201cIt is clear that there is a per se difference between the goods of the respective parties as to their inherent characteristics and, of course, as to their uses. We regard both as being medicinal in character, but the product of appellants, in its essential substance, differs from the product of appellee in its essential substance, and the difference in use is obvious. The fact that both are medicinal in character and have a therapeutic effect upon users of necessity makes carefulness in selection imperative on the part of prudent purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">The court in that case also observed that there was considerable difference in the marks of the parties. For the reasons stated, the court was of opinion that the marks there involved were not confusingly similar and affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The difference between that case and the instant case is so obvious as to require little comment. In the Ciba Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., case, supra, the Abbott Laboratories\u2019 mark \u201cDical-D\u201d was used on a vitamin D product which could be purchased in any drug store without a physician\u2019s prescription, whereas the Ciba Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., trademarks \u2014 \u201cDial-Ciba\u201d . and \u201cDial\u201d \u2014 were used on a dormitive and a sedative which produced sleep and which could be purchased only upon the prescription of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">In the instant case, the product of each of the parties is used for exactly the same purpose and can be purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription. Moreover, the involved goods are competitive, whereas in the case cited, the products were not competitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">Other cases are relied upon by counsel for appellant, which we need not here discuss, as we have frequently held that the citation of authorities, except upon questions of law, is not helpful in the decision of cases of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>It is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that there is some difference in the marks of the parties and that although the goods are used for precisely the same purpose, they are not identical. We are of opinion, however, as were the tribunals of the Patent Office, that the marks are confusingly similar and that appellant is not entitled to the registration of its mark. In so holding, we have considered, as <em>we </em>should, the marks as a whole, although we have analyzed for the purpose of this decision, the differences in the respective marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
