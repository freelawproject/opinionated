Alberty, * * * ' doing business * * * at Hollywood, Los Angeles, State of California, did * * * on or about April 18, 1944 <em>then and there, </em>in violation of the Act of Congress * * * 21 U.S.C. 331(a) [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331(a)],<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unlawfully introduce and deliver for introduction into interstate commerce, from Hollywood, Los Angeles, State of California, to Kansas City, State of Missouri, consigned to Natural Food Store, a certain consignment, to wit, a number of bottles containing a drug within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g) (2) [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(g) (2)] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">\u201cThat displayed upon -written, printed, and graphic matter, <em>accompanying said drug when introduced and delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, </em>as aforesaid, namely upon a number of leaflets entitled \u2018So it\u2019s You again, is it?\u2019 relating to said drug which said leaflets were shipped by the said Ada J. Alberty trading and doing business as \u2018Alberty Food Products\u2019 to said Natural Food Store <em>prior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>to the date of the shipment of said drug as </em>aforesaid, to wit, <em>on or about February </em>7, 1944, were among other things the following statements: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u201cThat said drug, when introduced and delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, as aforesaid, was <em>then and there </em>misbranded within the meaning of the said act of Congress [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 352(a)], in that the statements aforesaid appearing in the leaflets entitled \u2018So it\u2019s You again, is it?,\u2019 <em>accompanying </em>said drug, as aforesaid were false and misleading in this, that said statements represented and suggested that said drug would be efficacious to restore color to gray hair and would be efficacious to prevent hair from turning gray; whereas in fact and in truth said drug would not be efficacious to restore color to gray hair and would not be efficacious to prevent hair from turning gray.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Appellant demurred to the information on the ground that it does not charge an offense within the sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, contending to the court below, as follows: \u201cThe Act in question (Secs. 343(a) and 352(a) of Title 21, U.S.C. [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 343(a), 352(a)]) provides that a food or drug shall be deemed to be misbranded \u2018if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u2019 Another section of the Act (Sec. 321 (m) of Title 21 U.S.C. [21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (m)]) defines the term \u2018labeling\u2019 to mean \u2018all labels and other written, printed or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.\u2019 * * and that the labels did not accompany the drug within Section 321 (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The district court overruled the demurrer, thus ruling against appellant\u2019s contention that the literature did not accompany the drug when it was introduced into interstate commerce. Appellant assigns this ruling as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Section 331(a) provides</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u201cProhibited acts</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u201c(a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that <em>is </em>adulterated or misbranded.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">It will be noted that the verb \u201cis\u201d is in the present tense. Section 331(a) confines the offense to a misbranding at the \u201cintroduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce\u201d as recognized in the information by the use of the words \u201cthen and there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">A drug is misbranded \u201cIf its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 352(a). \u201cLabeling\u201d of an article is defined to mean \u201call labels * * * accompanying such article.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 (m), 21 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">The information charges that the false labels were shipped by appellant to the Natural Food Store at Kansas City, Missouri, on February 7, 1944, that is, two months and 11 days before April 18, 1944, when the drug was \u201cthen and there\u201d introduced into interstate commerce. It does not allege that the labels were to be placed with the drug or used together with it by the consignee. For all the information alleges, the labels may not have arrived in Missouri. Or they may have been destroyed. Or they may have been distributed to the prospective customers a month before the arrival of the drug in Missouri and hence never accompanied it there. Or they may have been used in connection with other drugs shipped and sold long prior to April 18, 1944, when the charged offense is alleged \u201cthen and there\u201d to have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">We do not think that the bald statement that the labels were shipped to the Missouri consignee 71 days before the drug was shipped charges the offense of causing them to be \u201caccompanying\u201d the drug\u2019s introduction <em>into </em>interstate commerce on or about April 18, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">Appellee cites our decision United States v. Research Laboratories, Inc., 9 Cir., 126 F.2d 42. In that case, a condemnation proceeding, the libel charged that the false circulars accompanied the drug into interstate commerce and all arrived at their common destination simultaneously. The information in the instant appeal alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>no such facts and, on the contrary, cannot be construed as charging that the drug and labels were in interstate commerce at the same time, much less introduced therein at the same time. United States v. 7 Jugs of Dr. Salsbury\u2019s Rakos, D. C., 53 F.Supp. 746, has similar facts and follows the Research Laboratories case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Appellee also cites United States v. Lee, 7 Cir., 131 F.2d 464, 143 A.L.R. 1451. The complaint there sought an injunction because of an entirely different offense \u2014 the placing of the drug and false printed matter together <em>after </em>the interstate shipment in violation of 331(k), referred to in our fobtnote above. It in no way supports the information purported to be based upon the claimed violation of 321 (m) at the time of shipment, to, which appellant demurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">These three cases were civil proceedings and -not criminal prosecutions. They construe the Act liberally. The question was raised at the hearing here whether in construing the Act as the basis of a criminal prosecution there should be a similar construction against the accused. Cf. the recent case of M. Kraus &amp; Bros., Inc., v. United States, 327 U.S. 614, 621, 66 S.Ct. 705, 707, construing in a criminal proceeding the Emergency Price Control Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq., which, like the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, also afforded civil relief. There the Supreme Court states \u201cThis delegation to the Price Administrator of the power to provide in detail against circumvention and evasion, as to which Congress has imposed criminal sanctions, creates a grave responsibility. In a very literal sense the liberties and fortunes of others may depend upon his definitions and specifications regarding . evasion. Hence to these provisions must be applied the same strict rule of construction that is applied to statutes defining criminal action * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">However, we think that, whatever the criterion of construction, the ordinary use of the word \u201caccompanying\u201d which we have here accepted is that applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">After overruling the demurrer, the case was tried on a stipulation of facts which stated that the shipment of labels was received by the consignee on February 11, 1944, and the drug on April 25, 1944, clearly establishing that the two did not accompany each other when introduced into interstate commerce nor at any time in that interstate transit. It was also stipulated that they were exhibited together in the consignee\u2019s store. Here there might be said to be accompaniment <em>after </em>the interstate commerce was completed, but nothing is .stipulated as to appellant\u2019s then ownership or control of the drug and labels or her participancy in these later acts to bring her within 331 (k), a section not involved in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The judgment is reversed, -the case is remanded, and the information ordered to be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-15\"> There is another provision of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331 (k), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 (k), forbidding misbranding after the drag has passed through interstate commerce, as follows: \u201c(k) The alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal of the whole or any part of the labeling of, or the doing of any other act with respect to, a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if such act is done while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being misbranded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-25\">This section has no application to a charge that at the moment of introducing the drug into interstate commerce the misbranding \u201cthen and there\u201d occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
