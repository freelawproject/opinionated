But more was essential: The defendant could not be convicted absent evidence that he knew the contents of the package. In that respect the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">True, Epstein testified that he asked Allen \u201cwhere he got these stamps,\u201d and that Allen \u201csaid they were left there by a friend.\u201d True, too, Dalton testified that, after the package was opened, \u201cEpstein showed [Alien] the stamps\u201d and that Allen then said \u201che got those stamps\u201d from Frank. But neither Epstein nor Dalton purported to be reporting Allen\u2019s statements verbatim nor in their entirety. And, in the light of (1) Epstein\u2019s testimony that Allen \u201cnever claimed to know what was in that package\u201d and (2) Dalton\u2019s testimony that Allen did not \u201csay anything which would indicate that he knew what was in the package before Epstein opened it,\u201d we think their testimony concerning Allen\u2019s statement cannot reasonably be taken to mean more than that the package, with contents unknown to him, had been given to him by Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">It is suggested that, had defendant been unaware that the package contained stamps, he would surely have shown surprise when Epstein opened it. But the government did not ask these witnesses to\u2014 and, to repeat, they did not \u2014 testify as to all the defendant said and did at the time. For all we know, he may have manifested such surprise. Absent any evidence on the subject, there was nothing from which the jury could reasonably infer that he did not. The burden was on the government to offer evidence of that fact, not on the defendant to disprove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">As, then, there was no evidence that Allen knew that he had stamps in his possession, the judge should have granted Allen\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b677-12\">SWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">I think the judgment should be affirmed. The judge charged that \u201cIf the jury is uncertain as to whether the defendant knowingly had in his possession the ration stamps in question, their verdict must he not guilty.\u201d Their verdict shows that they resolved that issue against him. And rightly so, for the jury could properly infer from the testimony that Allen knew the contents of the package in his brief case before it was unwrapped by Detective Epstein. If he had then first learned that the package contained thousands of ration stamps, it is incredible that when asked \u201cwhere he got these stamps\u201d he would have replied merely that \u201cthey were left there by a friend.\u201d If ignorant of what the packages contained he would naturally have denied his knowledge of their contents or at least have said something to indicate that the disclosure of the stamps caused him surprise. Nothing of the sort appears from his conversation as reported by the detectives. Although Epstein testified that Allen \u201cnever claimed to know wliat was in that package,\u201d his failure to disclaim such knowledge is enough, in my opinion, to justify the inference that he did know.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">On Reargument.</p>\n<author id=\"b677-15\">FRANK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b677-16\">On our own motion we directed reargument, as a result of which a majority of the court has concluded that our original decision was wrong for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">Had the defendant remained silent when questioned by the detectives, there would have been nothing for the jury on the issue of his knowledge of the contents of the package. But the detectives testified that defendant gave an explanation of a kind which the jury may reasonably have believed to be so fishy as to show, by the mere telling of it, a guilty knowledge of what was inside the paper parcel found in defendant\u2019s brief-case. We think it clear that if defendant had testified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that explanation the verdict would have stood. Andrews v. United States, 5 Cir., 157 F.2d 723, 724.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider it a distinction without a difference that the jury-learned of this tale through the testimony of the detectives, since it was within the jury\u2019s province to believe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Of course, we disregard the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand; we may, indeed, as Judge Hand suggests,<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> consider the case as if the ancient rule still prevailed under which he would have been denied the right to do so. Thus considered, we have here a case of a verdict which, as to a crucial element of the crime, rests on indirect evidence of the sort called \u201ccircumstantial.\u201d To sustain verdicts thus grounded may, we recognize, lead at times to the conviction of innocent persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s story may have been true; for it is not inconceivable that a man might accept custody of a package, contents unknown from a casual acquaintance. But the undoubtedly grave problem of providing adequate safeguards against convictions of the innocent must be solved in some way other than that of refusing to allow reasonable inferences to be made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We see nothing improper in the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\"> See also, e.g., Wilson v.

HAND, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AKe\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">I have little doubt in fact that Allen knew that the contents of his brief case was ration stamps; but my chief reasons for thinking, so are that the police were after him \u2014 though on another matter \u2014 and that he did not take the stand. These two- circumstances are cogent evidences of guilt, but we should not rely upon either; we must decide the case as though someone, who was not engaged in searching for evidences of crime, had turned up the ration stamps in Allen\u2019s brief case by accident, or while looking for something lost; and as though the law still forbad an accused to testify in his own behalf, as it used to do. After we have stripped away these telling details, we have left nothing except that the stamps were found secreted, and that Allen said that a man named \u201cFrank\u201d asked leave of him to secrete them with him. I quite agree that this was basis enough for an inference that Allen knew that what \u201cFrank\u201d wished to conceal was contraband of some sort; but that is not enough, unless it was sufficient basis for further inference that he knew that the contraband was ration stamps. I do not think that it will serve for this second inference. If Allen\u2019s explanation was so absurd on its face as to be an obvious fabrication, then it would be enough, for it is always permissible to infer guilt from the concoction of an evasion. But the <em>story does not </em>appear to me to be a sham on its face; I do not think it preposterous to suppose that a man might consent, without inquiry as to just what the contraband was, to let an acquaintance use his closet and his brief case to hide it away. Innocent people often to that extent indulge those who are not their intimates, and who are scarcely more than acquaintances: it is enough that in so doing they may help another in a hard spot; to inquire about just what that spot is is \u201cto consider too curiously.\u201d As for not knowing \u201cFrank\u2019s\u201d surname, half the population of the United States at least under the age of forty appear to know each other only by their given name. United States v. Picarelli<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> need not trouble us. Ward, the accused, there took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>t\u00edie stand, and the jury could judge the truth of his story by more than its words. Not so here, where they had nothing to go by but its inherent plausibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-20\"> 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
