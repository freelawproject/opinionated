In the event the trial court sustained the Administrator\u2019s interpretation, judgment should be entered for him in the sum of $27,426.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The trial court entered judgment for the Administrator in the sum of $18,329.20, which compels the conclusion that said court construed the regulation as permitting appellee to include as an item of his costs all disputed items.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">The Administrator contends, despite the plain definition of \u201creplacement cost\u201d in \u00a7 1499.3 as the \u201cnet price paid by the seller <em>after May 18, 1942, </em>or the net price which the seller would have to pay to replace such commodity <em>after such date\u201d, </em>that Maximum Price Regulation No. 259 permits a seller to pay his supplier only the charges imposed by the supplier during the base period (March 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">His argument is that the term \u201cnet price\u201d in the definition of \u201creplacement cost\u201d in \u00a7 1499.3 means \u201clegal net price\u201d; that is, that although said regulation provides that \u201cthe net price which the seller would have to pay to replace such commodity after such date [i.e. May 18, 1942]\u201d it should be construed to mean that the seller could pay such charges only as were lawfully imposed on him, under Maximum Price Regulation No. 259, by his supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Under the stipulation \u00a7 1499.3 is the controlling regulation. That section uses the words \u201ccost to him [seller]\u201d without qualification, and defines \u201creplacement cost\u201d as including net cost after May 18, 1942. The interpretation placed upon the section by appellee, namely, that he was permitted to include the two disputed charges since they were part of the cost of the beer to him, and part of the net price paid by him after May 18, 1942, is reasonable. It seems the normal interpretation to be placed on such language; in fact it is the interpretation which the Administrator\u2019s Regional Office adopted and so notified appellee. Later, a contrary ruling was received from Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">If there is ambiguity or conflict between the stipulated regulation \u00a7 1499.3, and other regulations, \u00a7 1499.3 must control under the stipulation submitted to the trial court. Said regulation permits appellee to include return freight charges which he paid his supplier, and other elements of the net price which he would have to pay after May 18, 1942 \u201cto replace such commodity\u201d. There is nothing in said section which forbids the payment of brokerage fees, if those are part of the net cost of the beer to appellee. It was not until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>December 18, 1944, long after the last sale involved here, that the addition of \u00a7 5.3 to Regulation 259 specifically forbade the addition of brokerage fees to the seller\u2019s maximum price. We are unable to agree with the argument that the practice of paying such fees to secure beer was forbidden by implication prior to the adoption of the specific regulation on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">It was contended by the Administrator, at the oral argument, that by the stipulation appellee has accepted the burden of proving that he did not violate the regulations and that because, as it is said, there is no evidence \u201cin the record showing that appellee actually paid the two disputed charges, or that his supplier lawfully imposed such charges, judgment must be entered for the Administrator in the larger sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The stipulation clearly, provides in paragraph 11 that: \u201cIn the event the court should find that return freight is a proper and legitimate element of net unit cost for the purpose of computing maximum prices of the commodities * * * the actual amount of the overcharges are to be reduced by the sum of $4,223.30; that in the event the court should find that both return freight and commissions, brokerage charges, and finder\u2019s fees paid by said defendant [appellee] in connection with the purchase of the aforesaid commodities constitute proper elements of net unit cost, the said actual overcharges <em>on accom%t thereof </em>shall be reduced by the total sum of $9,086.14 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Under the stipulation the facts are agreed upon and no further proof is necessary. The reasonable interpretation to be placed upon the provision of the stipulation that, in the event the court found the return freight charge to be legal that the judgment be reduced $4,223.30, is that the amount of such freight charges was $4,-<em>223.30. It is not </em>reasonable to assume that the Administrator would agree to the reduction of his judgment in said amount, in any event, unless he conceded the amount to have been paid. The same may be said relative to the agreed reduction of $9,086.-14 in the event of a ruling adverse to the Administrator on other legal questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The facts have been agreed upon. The burden of proof has not been shifted but 'has been lifted. Perhaps we can make our meaning more clear by the statement that had proof been adduced, independent of the stipulation, that not one of the charges had been paid, the Administrator, having had the legal questions decided adversely to his contentions, would be compelled to accept the stipulated reductions in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-27\"> 7 F.R. 8950.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-28\"> 7 F.R. 3153-4, 3156.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
