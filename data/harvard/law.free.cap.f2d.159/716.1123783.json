To be eligible for the special subsidy, a non-processing slaughterer, as defined, must be an \u201cunaffiliated slaughterer,\" that is, it must not \u201cown or control,\u201d or be \u201cowned or controlled by,\u201d a \u201cprocessor or purveyor, of meat.\u201d The phrase \u201cown or control\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cto own or control directly or indirectly a partnership equity or in excess of ten percent of any class of outstanding stock or have made loans or advances in excess of five per cent of the other person\u2019s monthly sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">Somerville Dressed Meat Company, a Massachusetts corporation, was organized in April, 1941. It then issued 300 shares of common stock without par value and <em>200 </em>shares of non-voting preferred stock. From the outset, and at all times thereafter, one Frank Brezniak has held 100 shares of the common stock and 150 shares of the preferred. In July, 1943, Brezniak together with one Henry A. Waddell, opened a retail meat stand in Faneuil Hall market, in Boston, Mass., as co-partners, under the name of H. A. Waddell Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">By letter to complainant dated January 17, 1944, Defense Supplies Corporation ruled that, under the affiliation provisions of Amendment No. 2 to the subsidy regulation, complainant was ineligible to receive the special subsidy for the reason that Brez-niak, a partner in H. A. Waddell Company, retail meat dealers,' was a \u201cpurveyor of meat\u201d owning in excess of 10 per cent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the outstanding capital stock of complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">On December 13, 1945, complainant filed with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation its protest against the validity of Amendment No. 2 and also against the ruling of the Defense Supplies Corporation in its letter of January 17, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Reconstruction Finance Corporation, by letter dated April 12, 1946, denied the protest; and thereafter Somerville Dressed Meat Company duly filed its complaint in this court. - In its answer to the complaint, respondent \u201cadmits that except for the part ownership by Frank Brezniak of Complainant and H. A. Waddell Co., that Complainant is a wholly independent business entity not otherwise affiliated or integrated with or deriving financial benefit from H. A. Waddell Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The affiliation provisions of the subsidy regulation here under attack were upheld by us after full and careful consideration, in Earl C. Gibbs, Inc., v. Defense Supplies Corp., Em.App.1946, 155 F.2d 525, certiorari denied 67 S.Ct. 51; Atlantic Meat Co., Inc., v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., Em.App.1946, 155 F.2d 533, certiorari denied 67 S.Ct. 52; Illinois Packing Co. v. Henderson, Em.App.1946, 156 F.2d 1000, certiorari denied 67 S.Ct. 202. Complainant asks us to reconsider and overrule these cases; but we think they were rightly decided, and we adhere to the rulings therein made. They are controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Complainant makes a subordinate contention that, even assuming the validity of the affiliation provisions of the subsidy regulation, the determination by Defense Supplies Corporation of complainant\u2019s ineligibility for the special subsidy, as contained in its letter of January 17, 1944, was erroneous as being not within the disqualifying language of the subsidy regulation. The argument is that the \u201cpurveyor of meat\u201d in this case is the business entity H. A. Waddell Company, a partnership; and that this partnership entity does not \u201cown or control\u201d any of the stock in the complainant corporation, the non-processing slaughterer. Thus, complainant seeks to distinguish Illinois Packing Co. v. Henderson, supra, where the disqualifying percentage of stock in the non-processing slaughterer was owned by the partnership of Pfaelzer Brothers, a processor or purveyor of meat. We think this suggested distinction is founded upon too narrow a reading of the affiliation provisions of the subsidy regulation. For some purposes of the law of partnership, legal consequences follow as though the partnership were recognized as a separate legal entity. But bearing in mind the purpose of the affiliation provisions of the subsidy regulation, we think that each of the twQi partners in H. A. Waddell Company must be regarded as a \u201cpurveyor of meat\u201d within the meaning of the regulation. Hence, under the regulation, complainant is ineligible to receive the special subsidy, because one of such partners, Brezniak, a \u201cpurveyor of meat,\u201d owned, during the period in question, considerably more than 10 per cent of the outstanding stock of complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-17\"> Defense Supplies Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reconstruction Finance Corporation (6.
