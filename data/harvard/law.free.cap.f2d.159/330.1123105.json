They claim that by their intervention in the proceedings they aided in preserving, protecting, and benefiting the receivership aud foreclosure estate to the advantage of all public bondholders. Inter-veners held $885,000 in amount of the total of $7,635,000 bonds held by the public. As benefits to the receivership and foreclosure estates, appellants claim that they caused (1) a subordination of $1,318,500 of Treasury Bonds held by the Seaboard Receivers; and (2) an adjustment for earnings of $1,704,000 in computing and fixing the upset price.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">In opposition to the expense and legal fee claims of appellants, the mortgage trustees say that interveners made no substantial contribution which resulted in benefit to the public bondholders. They further insist that they were at all times representing the public bondholders as a class, and that the interveners, rather than benefiting the public bondholders, have in fact delayed distribution of assets at the expense of all bondholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in a case of this kind should be made only if it is clear that those seeking fees aud expenses have by their efforts ' actually benefited the estate involved. Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527, 26 L.Ed. 1157. Cf. Cannon v. Parker, 5 Cir., 152 F.2d 706. Where it appears that there is no one in the field to protect the class as a whole, and an individual or small group acts and benefits the whole group, a court may properly, and should, award compensation and expense allowances for such services out of the fund in court. \u201cThe right to charge attorneys\u2019 fees on a fund arises where one, at his own expense, has maintained a successful suit for the preservation, protection or increase of a common fund or common property.\u201d Standard Lumber Co. v. Interstate Trust Co., 5 Cir., 82 F.2d 346, 350; In re Paramount Publix Corporation, 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Allowances of fees and expenses must rest on facts showing actual benefits, and the findings of the trial court in such cases should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is clearly an abuse of discretion. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell v. Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co., 10 Cir., 96 F.2d 219; Gochenour v. Cleveland Terminals Bldg Co., 6 Cir., 142 F.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">The trial judge was intimately familiar with the problems peculiar to this litigation. He was in position to know just what the efforts of interveners and their counsel had contributed to the litigation. With firsthand knowledge of the background and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>continuing progress of the proceedings, and after a full hearing on appellants\u2019 claims for legal fees and expenses, the trial judge determined that \u201cNeither the services rendered nor the expenses incurred by Inter-veners or any of the constituent members thereof, or their Solicitors, or any of them, redounded to the benefit of the mortgaged estate or the Bondholders as a class.\u201d He not only found that interveners\u2019 efforts had not been helpful or fruitful, but also that their efforts had, in fact, been detrimental, causing delay and expense. He further found that the mortgage trustees, acting on behalf of all the bondholders, had \u201cacquitted themselves properly and efficiently\u201d and had enforced their security; and that the trustees and not the interveners had&gt; applied for and obtained the decree fixing the upset prices and that such \u201cupset prices fixed by this Court did not include any increase which was the result of any action taken by Interveners or which would not have been included if Interveners had not participated in the proceedings. * * * All necessary or proper action has been taken by the Mortgage Trustees, and they have not omitted to take any action which was either necessary or proper for that purpose. Accordingly, the expense claims of Interveners and the compensation\u2019 claims of their Solicitors, and each such claim, should be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The record in this case, and the records in the previous appeals, lend support to the finding of the trial judge that appellants were actually representing their own individual interests, and that they did not secure' any benefit for the public bondholders who were being adequately represented by the mortgage trustees. Certainly, it cannot be correctly held from the records before us that the findings of the trial judge are clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or that his disallowance of fees and expenses was \u201ca clear abuse of discretion\u201d amounting to a manifest disregard of right and reason.
