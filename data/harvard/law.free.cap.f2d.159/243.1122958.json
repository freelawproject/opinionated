The trial judge filed a written opinion (D.C., 63 F.Supp. 386) with which we in general agree. We are in addition of the opinion that appellee recognized the difference in value of muscats and other varieties of grapes and fully compensated for such difference by paying to muscat growers $7.00 per ton more for their grapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">For the reasons stated in the opinion of the trial judge and the additional reason advanced by us the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
