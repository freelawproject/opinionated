The District Court dismissed the complaint because the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq., applicable in the District of Columbia as a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, D.C. Code 1940 \u00a7\u00a7 36\u2014501, 36\u2014502, 45 Stat. 600, c. 612, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 note, provides that in respect to such an injury compensation under the Act shall be \u201cexclusive and in place of all other liability * * *, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required * * *, an injured employee * * * may elect to claim compensation under this chapter, or to maintain an action at law * * * \u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905. Appellant does not contend that his case is within the stated exception. His contention is in effect that the court should add an exception covering cases in which the injured employee is employed, as appellant was, in violation of the child labor law. We agree with the District Court that no such distortion of the Compensation Act is permissible. There is nt&gt; reason to suppose that Congress did not mean what it plainly said. Moreover, as the District Court pointed out, the \u201cexclusive\u201d provision with its single exception was copied from the New York statute when the New York courts had already held that violation of the child labor law did not create a second exception. Noreen v. William Vogel &amp; Bros., Inc., 231 N.Y. 317, 132 N.E. 102. Cf. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Hoage, 66 App.D.C. 154, 156, 85 F.2d 411, 413. Appellant\u2019s other contentions are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
