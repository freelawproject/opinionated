Etheridge, and an order made on September 21, 1944,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by all of the judges, were null and void; and that it was their duty to expunge and remove these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-21\">The claim was that appellant had, on July 10, 1944, been duly admitted to practice law by order of the Supreme Court of Fulton County, Georgia, and had received a license issued out of said court, and that the orders complained of had illegally and unlawfully attempted to cancel and revoke the order signed and license issued on July 10, 1944.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">Defendants moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction on the face of the complaint and further moved for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The district judge was of the opinion that the declaration sought was one which would require an inquiry into and determination by him, of the propriety, validity and effect of orders of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia with reference to a matter solely within the jurisdiction of that court, that is licensing -of attorneys to practice at its bar, and as to whether such orders should be set aside. He, therefore, concluded, that the suit was not one of which jurisdiction was given the court by the U.S.C.A., Title 28, Sec. 41, or by any other act of Congress, and sustained the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">. Appellant, here insisting that the court erred in dismissing his complaint for want of jurisdiction, urges upon us that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to inquire into, determine, and declare the invalidity of the orders complained of, and that they should be held to be null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Appellees moved in limine to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the questions presented by it had become moot by reason of the decision of the Court of Appeals of Georgia in Shotkin v. State, 35 S.E.2d 556, 560,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> holding that the order and license of July 10, 1944, on which appellant relies, as admitting him to the practice of law in Georgia, did not and do not have that effect, but are void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On whether the judgment of dismissal was right, they insist: That the suit is one against the State of Georgia; that it is one to set aside or review orders of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia; that it is a suit to adjudicate title to a state office ; that it is settled law that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia is without jurisdiction in a suit against the judges who entered them to set aside or review orders of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia; and that the judgment of dismissal was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">We do not determine whether the district judge was right in dismissing the complaint for want of jurisdiction, for we agree with appellees that the matters tendered by plaintiff in his complaint and the relief he seeks therein have been rendered moot by the decision in Shotkin v. State, supra. The record in that case shows that he moved in the State court to set aside the order of September 21, 1944, complained of here, and that motion denied, appealed from its dismissal. It shows, too, that the Court of Appeals of Georgia, in affirming the order appealed from, has determined and declared that the order and license of July 10, 1944, on which appellant relies, were entered and issued without authority of law, and that he is not, and never was, authorized to practice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">This determination, that appellant has no valid license and is not authorized to practice law, renders moot the issue tendered and the relief sought in this suit, that the orders assailed were invalidly entered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that they should be found invalid and void. The judgment is, therefore, reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to vacate the order and dismiss the cause as moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> As pleaded fry plaintiff, the order of August 14; revoked the license to practice law issued to plaintiff on July 10, and cancelled, annulled and set aside the order of admission; the order of August 81, annulled, set aside and vacated the order of August 14; while the order of September 1, passed and referred the entire matter of right to practice law to the entire body of judges in conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\"><em> </em>As set out in plaintiff\u2019s petition, this was the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">\u201cState of Georgia,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">\u201cCounty of Pulton,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">\u201cIn the Superior Court of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">\u201cIn Re: Application for admission to the bar and to practice law by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">\u201cPursuant to the order of Judge Paul S.
