It further appeared by affidavit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and was undisputed, that eighteen of the tugs owned by the appellee had been chartered to private operators, and that the ap-pellee had no control over their management or navigation. The remaining three tugs were accounted for at the time in question, and each was shown to be not the vessel that did the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It is contended that the defendant, under Admiralty Rule 56, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, should have impleaded the charterers of its vessels, which were operating on the river at the time, but this is a civil action and the Admiralty Rules have no application. Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, gave the defendant the right to implead its charterers, but did not require it to do so. The right to bring in third parties is permissive, not obligatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
