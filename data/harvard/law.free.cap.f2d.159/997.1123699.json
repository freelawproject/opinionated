Forming part of the appellants\u2019 pleading was a section captioned \u201caffirmative defense and claim,\u201d the first paragraph of which is important :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-8\">\u201cEver since the year 1867, and from time immemorial prior thereto, said claimants, being Tlingit Indians of Alaska, and their predecessors and successors in lineal consanguinity, under the laws, customs and usages of the Tlingit Indians of Alaska and in conformity with the laws of the United States, during all the times herein mentioned, have been, and now are the aboriginal users and occupants of, and in the exclusive possession of, and entitled to the exclusive possession of the land, submerged land and water described as follows, namely. * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">The appellants further alleged that their \"said use and occupancy, possession and right of possession\u201d had \u201cnot been condemned, expropriated, extinguished, modified, impaired or encumbered by any person, corporation or body politic\u201d until the appellee filed its first petition for condemnation \u201cto a limited portion of said area.\u201d They claimed damages totaling $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">The appellee demurred to the answer and claim on the ground that it appeared from the pleading that the appellants had no such interest in the property sought to be condemned as would entitle them to compensation. The court below filed an opinion indicating that the demurrer would be sustained because aboriginal title created no compensable interest against the United States. Later, an order was entered sustaining the demurrer. Since the appellants elected to stand on the allegations of their pleading, the court filed its final judgment, in which it was decreed that none of the appellants should receive any compensation for the taking of the lands, and that the \u201cunencumbered and absolute title in fee simple\u201d to the area \u201cis vested in the United States of America, free and discharged of any and all charges, interests, claims, liens and encumbrances of any kind and character whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">From that judgment the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">1. <em>The General Character of Indian Title.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">From the earliest reaches of American jurisprudence, the title of the Indians to the lands of their fathers has been regarded at best as one of occupancy only. In the leading case of Johnson v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 574, 21 U.S. 543, 574, 5 L.Ed. 681, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, referring to the aborigines, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-15\">\u201cThey were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion; but their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil, at their own will, to whomsoever they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it. While the different nations of Europe respected the rights of the natives, as occupants, they asserted the ultimate dominion to be in themselves; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil, while yet in the possession of the natives. These grants have been understood by all, to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>\u201cThe history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Half a century later, another Chief Justice \u2014 Waite\u2014restated the doctrine in even more emphatic language. In United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 592, 593, 86 U.S. 591, 592, 22 L.Ed. 210, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">\u201cTlie right of the Indians in the land from which the logs were taken was that of occupancy alone. They had no power of alienation except to the United States. The fee was in the United States, subject only to this right of occupancy. <em>This is the title by which other Indians hold their lands.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">And another half century later, a third Chief Justice \u2014 the one who at this writing presides over the Supreme Court \u2014 once again reaffirmed the time-honored principle. In United States v. Alcea Band of Tilla-mooks, 67 S.Ct. 167, 170, the following language was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-7\">\u201cIt has long been held that by virtue of discovery the title to lands occupied by Indian tribes vested in the sovereign. This title was deemed subject to a right of occupancy in favor of Indian tribes, because of their original and previous possession. It is with the content of this right of occupancy, this original Indian title, that we are concerned here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-8\">\u201cAs against any but the sovereign, original Indian title was accorded the protection of complete ownership; but it was vulnerable to affirmative action by the sovereign, which possessed exclusive power to extinguish the right of occupancy at will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">See also Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17, 48, 30 U.S. 1, 17, 48, 8 L.Ed. 5; Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U.S. 517, 525, 24 L.Ed. 440; Buttz v. Northern Pacific R., 119 U.S. 55, 66, 7 S.Ct. 100, 30 L.Ed. 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">2. <em>The Indian Right of Occupancy is \u201cSacred.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">While consistently careful to point out that the right of the red man to the lands of his ancestors was \u201conly\u201d that of occupancy, the Supreme Court has with corresponding uniformity insisted that this right, so far as it goes, is \u201csacred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">We find this transcendental adjective first used in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Baldwin in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, supra, 5 Pet. 1, at page 48, 30 U.S. 1 at page 48, 8 L.Ed. 5 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-13\">\u201cIndians have rights of occupancy to their lands, as sacred as the fee-simple, absolute title of the whites. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">In United States v. Cook, supra, 19 Wall. 591, at page 593, 86 U.S. 591 at page 593, 22 L.Ed. 210, Mr. Chief Justice Waite went even a step farther. He held that \u201cthe right of the Indians to their occupancy\u201d is not only as sacred as the right of private white landowners to their fee, but that it is \u201cas sacred as that of the United States to the fee,\u201d i. e., as sacred as the fee title of the sovereign itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\">See also Mitchel v. United States, 9 Pet. 711, 746, 34 U.S. 711, 746, 9 L.Ed. 283; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U.S. 373, 389, 22 S.Ct. 650, 46 L.Ed. 954; Shoshone Tribe v. United States, 299 U.S. 476, 497, 57 S.Ct. 244, 81 L.Ed. 360; United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">In Johnson v. McIntosh, supra, 8 Wheat 543, 574, 585, 588, 592, 603, 21 U.S. 543 at pages 574, 585, 588, 592, 603, 5 L.Ed. 681, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall stressed the point that, wherever the fee simple title might reside, it could be held in Indian land \u201csubject only to the Indian right [or title] of occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">Like a leitmotif, this quoted phrase runs through the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion and through subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court. European grants could \u201cconvey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.\u201d Either the United States, or the several states, had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty [ending the Revolutionary War], \u201csubject only to the Indian right of occupancy.\u201d The title of the crown was absolute, \u201csubject only to the Indian right of occupancy.\u201d The absolute ultimate title has been considered as acquired by discovery, \u201csubject only to the Indian title of occupancy.\u201d The claim of government extends to the complete ultimate title, \u201ccharged with this right of possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>See also United States v. Cook, supra, 19 Wall. 591, 592, 593, 86 U.S. 591 at pages 592, 593, 22 L.Ed. 210; Buttz v. Northern Pacific R., supra, 119 U.S. 55 at page 67, 7 S.Ct. 100, 30 L.Ed. 330; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra, 185 U.S. 373 at page 389, 22 S.Ct. 650, 46 L.Ed. 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">3. <em>The Indian Right of Occupancy is Compensable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">It would be indulgence in pious and high-sounding but empty generalizations to say that the Indian right to occupancy is \u201csacred,\u201d and at the same time to refuse to grant compensation to Indian possessors when their land is taken away from them under condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Hie Supreme Court has countenanced no such inconsistency. In Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra, 185 U.S. 373 at page 389, 22 S.Ct. 650, 656, 46 L.Ed. 954, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">\u201cAt the same time, the Indians\u2019 [sic] right of occupancy has always been held to be sacred; something not to be taken from him except by his consent, and then upon such consideration as should be agreed upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">In the Tillamook case, supra, the Court, quoting with approval the foregoing language from the Hitchcock case, held that it was applicable equally to \u201coriginal Indian title\u201d and the so-called \u201crecognized\u201d title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-10\">\u201cAdmitting the undoubted power of Congress to extinguish original Indian title compels no conclusion that compensation need not be paid. * * * In our opinion, taking original Indian title without compensation and without consent does not satisfy the \u2018high standards for fair dealing\u2019 xeqttired of the United States in controlling Indian Affairs. United States v. Santa Fe R. Co., 1941, 314 U.S. 339, 356, 62 S.Ct. 248, 86 L.Ed. 260. The Indians have more than merely a moral claim for compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-11\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-12\">\u201cFurthermore, some cases speak of the unlimited power of Congress to deal with those Indian lands which are held by what petitioner would call \u2018recognized\u2019 title; yet it cannot be doubted that, given the consent of the United States to be sued, recovery may be had for an involuntary, uncompensated taking of \u2018recognized\u2019 title. We think the same rule applicable to a taking of original Indian title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">At this point, it might be well to observe that, in its brief before this court in the instant case, the appellee in two footnotes criticizes the decision of the Court of Claims in the Tillamook case, 59 F.Supp. 934. After the appellee\u2019s brief herein was filed, however, the Supreme Court affirmed the Tillamook decision of the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">In United States v. Klamath Indians, 304 U.S. 119, 123, 58 S.Ct. 799, 801, 82 L.Ed. 1219, the court used language that is apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-16\">\u201cThe established rule is that the taking of property by the United States in the exertion of its power of eminent domain implies a promise to pay just compensation, i. e., value at the time of the taking plus an amount sufficient to produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-17\">\u2022'/. <em>The Sources of the Appellants\u2019 Right of Occupancy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-18\">As we have seen, the appellants base their right of possession to the lands in question upon the claim that \u201cever since the year 1867, and from time immemorial prior thereto\u201d they \u201cand their predecessors and successors in lineal consanguinity * * * have been, and now are the aboriginal users and occupants,\u201d etc., of the land. In other words, they are claiming under \u201coriginal Indian title,\u201d on which the decision in the Tillamook case, supra, rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-20\">The reference to the year 1867 is an allusion, of course, to the Treaty with Russia, proclaimed by the United States on June 20, 1867. 15 Stat. 539. An examination of that document, however, convinces us that whatever \u201coriginal Indian title\u201d the Tlingit Indians may have had under Russian rule was extinguished by the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-21\">The opening sentence of Article II of the treaty is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-22\">\u201cIn the cession of territory and dominion made by the preceding article are included the right of property in all public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>lots and squares, vacant lands, and all public buildings, fortifications, barracks, and other edifices <em>which are not privaste individual </em>property(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The closing sentence of Article VI reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">\u201cThe cession of territory and dominion herein made is hereby declared to be free and unencumbered by any reservations, privileges, franchises, grants, or <em>possessions, </em>by any associated companies, whether corporate or incorporate, Russian or any other, or by any parties, <em>except merely private individual property holders; </em>and the cession hereby made, conveys all the rights, franchises, and privileges now belonging to Russia in the said territory or dominion, and appurtenances thereto.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">There is no possibility of errors in translation here, between the official English and French versions of the Alaska treaty. The expression \u201cprivate individual property\u201d is an exact equivalent of the French \u201cpropri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e individuelle\u201d, and the phrase \u201cexcept merely private individual property holders\u201d is the correct rendering of \u201csauf simplement les propri\u00e9taires poss\u00e9-dant des biens priv\u00e9s individu\u00e9is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The United States Government paid an additional $200,000 for the inclusion of these reservations in the treaty. In Kin-kead v. United States, 150 U.S. 483, 486, 14 S.Ct. 172, 173, 37 L.Ed. 1152, the following interesting sidelight on American history appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-8\">\u201cIt should be added in this connection, and as explanatory of the sixth article of the treaty, that on March 23, 1867, Mr. Seward, then secretary of state of the United States, addressed a letter to the Russian minister, in which he stated: T must insist upon that clause in the sixth article of the draft which declares the cession to be free and unincumbered by any reservations, privileges, franchises, grants, or possessions by any associated companies, whether corporate or incorporate, Russian or any other, etc., and must regard it as an ultimatum. With the president\u2019s approval, however, I will add two hundred\u00bb thousand dollars to the consideration money on that account.\u2019 To this letter the Russian minister made reply that he believed himself \u2018authorized to accede literally to this request on the conditions indicated\u2019, in the note of the secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">We agree with the appellee that \u201cby no stretch of the imagination can [original] Indian title be considered the equivalent of private individual property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">In Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 294, 307, 23 S.Ct. 115, 120, 47 L.Ed. 183, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-13\">\u201cWhatever title the Indians have is in the tribe, and not in the individuals, although held by the tribe for the common use and equal benefit of all the members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">See also Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 667, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">It seems quite clear, therefore, that whatever \u201cpossession\u201d the Tlingit Indians had \u201cfrom time immemorial prior to\u201d the year 1867 was a tribal and not an individual right, and did not come within the classification of the excepted \u201cprivate individual property\u201d specified in the Russian treaty. Consequently, the Tlingits\u2019 \u201coriginal Indian title\u201d to the tidelands in question was extinguished by that state paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">Nevertheless, the appellants are not without a right of possession in the tidelands that the appellee has sought to have condemned. This right has been repeatedly accorded the Congressional \u201crecognition\u201d on which the Government was vainly insisting in the Tillamook case, supra, as a sine qua non of Indian title. That insistence has been reaffirmed by the appellee in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-17\">On May 17, 1884, there was approved \u201cAn act providing a civil government for Alaska,\u201d 23 Stat. 24. A proviso in \u00a7 8 of that act sets forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-18\"><em>\u201cProvided, </em>That the Indians or other persons in said district [territory] shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them but the terms under which such persons may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-19\">No such future legislation has been enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-20\">On June 6, 1900, in an \u201cAct making further provision for a civil government for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>Alaska,\u201d we find that \u00a7 27 contains the following opening language:</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">\u201cThe Indians or persons conducting schools or missions in the district shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation, * * * \u201d 31 Stat. 330, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">On May 1, 1936, there was enacted a statute authorizing the Secretary of the Interior \u201cto designate as an Indian reservation any area of land which has been reserved for the use and occupancy of Indians or Eskimos by section 8 of the Act of May 17, 1884 [supra],\u201d etc. There again we find a saving proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-7\"><em>\u201cProvided further, </em>That nothing herein contained shall affect any valid existing claim, location, or entry under the laws of the United States, whether for homestead, mineral, right-of-way, <em>or other purpose whatsoever, </em>or shall affect the rights of any such owner, claimant, locator, or entryman to the full use and enjoyment of the land so occupied.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] 49 Stat. 1250, 1251, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 358a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">On May 31, 1938 \u2014 only four years before the original petition in this suit was filed \u2014Congress enacted the following brief statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-9\">\u201cThat the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is hereby, authorized, in his discretion, to withdraw and permanently reserve small tracts of not to exceed six hundred and forty acres each of the public domain in Alaska for schools, hospitals, and such other purposes as may be necessary in administering the affairs of the Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts of Alaska: Provided, <em>That such withdrawals shall be subject to any valid existing </em>rights[Emphasis supplied.] 52 Stat. 593, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 353a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">See also \u00a7 14 of 26 Stat. 1095, 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">The Act of 1884 has been construed to constitute a Congressional \u201cguarantee\u201d to all persons in possession of lands in Alaska on the date of its enactment, that they were not to be disturbed in their occupancy. The rationale for this guarantee is lucidly expounded in Young v. Goldsteen, D.C. Alaska, 97 F. 303, 307, 308:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-12\">\u201cThe title to all these lands, mineral and nonmineral, remained in the federal government. Those making the improvements had a possessory right or title only to the premises occupied and improved by them. The mineral claimant had no greater or different right or title to the premises occupied by him than had the nonmineral claimant. This was the condition of land titles in Alaska when a form of civil government was extended to the territory in 1884. Realizing, apparently, the possibility that those who had risked so much in establishing their homes in this then well-nigh unknown country might not reap the fruits of their labor, and for the purpose of protecting them in their property rights, the congress passed the following law: [Here the court quoted the provision in the Act of 1884 that we have already set out.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-14\">\u201c <em>* </em>* * In our opinion, the language used is susceptible of but one construction; i. e. that congress <em>guarantied </em>to all persons in possession of lands in Alaska at that date the right ultimately to acquire a perfect title to the same. If anything less was intended, then the act is wholly meaningless. If congress meant only to guaranty to them undisturbed possession <em>for the time being, </em>reserving the right to ultimately pass such laws as would confiscate the property to the government, or give it to another, then the act is worse than a mockery. If the expression, \u2018the terms under which such persons may acquire title/ means anything, it means that at some future date the congress will pass the needful legislation whereby their possession will ripen into perfect ownership. And until such legislation is enacted the \u2018future legislation\u2019 is yet to be achieved.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-15\">See also Haltern v. Emmons, D.C., 46 F. 452, 456, affirmed, 159 U.S. 252, 15 S.Ct. 1039, 40 L.Ed. 142; Carroll v. Price, D.C., 81 F. 137, 139, 140; United States v. Cadzow, 5 Alaska 125, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-16\">From the foregoing statutes and decisions, it is clear that Congress, since 1884, has intended to protect, recognize and even \u201cguarantee\u201d the possessory rights of these Tlingit Indians. Such rights are compen-sable; for their holders are neither squatters nor outlaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-17\">5. <em>The Tlingits\u2019 Right of Occupancy Extends to the Tidelands.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>The appellee insists that the fact that the area in question consists in tidelands further militates against the appellants\u2019 compensable right of occupancy therein. This Court, in the oft-quoted Heckman v. Sutter cases, 119 F. 83, 88, and 128 F. 393, 395, has held otherwise. In the first of these decisions, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-5\">\u201cThe prohibition contained in the act of . 1884 against the disturbance of the use or possession of any Indian or other person of any land in Alaska claimed by them is sufficiently general and comprehensive to include tide lands as well as lands above high-water mark. Nor is it surprising that congress, in first dealing with the then sparsely settled country, was disposed to protect its few inhabitants in the possession of lands, of whatever character, by means of which they eked out their hard and precarious existence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">In his second opinion, Judge <em>Ross </em>elaborated the point further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-7\">\u201cIt is true that it has never been the policy of the United States to dispose of its tide lands, but, on the contrary, that its policy has always been to retain them for the benefit of the future state in, which they might lie. But it is thoroughly settled that the United States has all the power of national and municipal government over its territories, and may, if it sees fit to do so, grant rights in or titles to the tide lands of its territories as well as the public lands therein situated above high-water mark. Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 14 S.Ct. 548, 38 L.Ed. 331, and the numerous cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">6. <em>The Tlingittf Right of Occupancy is Heritable and Otherwise Transmissible.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">It will be remembered that the appellants\u2019 \u201caffirmative defense and claim\u201d alleges that they and \u201ctheir predecessors * * * in lineal consanguinity * * * during all the times herein mentioned, have been, and now are * * * in the exclusive possession of * * * the land.\u201d etc. For the purposes of the appellee\u2019s demurrer, this allegation is to be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">This court has repeatedly held that the right of occupancy and possession en- | joyed by the Tlingit Indians who were on I the lands in question when the act of 1884 was passed, was capable of being transmitted to their successors in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">In Arness v. Petersburg Packing Co., 9 Cir., 260 F. 710, 712, the following language was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-15\">\u201cBy the Act of May 17, 1884, c. 53, \u00a7 8, 23 Stat. 26, Congress enacted that persons in Alaska \u2018shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them.\u2019 That statute conferred upon persons in possession more than a mere pedis possessio. It conferred the right to convey the possessory right to another. [Cases cited]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">Again, in Worthen Lumber Mills v. Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Co., 9 Cir., 229 F. 966, 969, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-17\">\u201cWe do not think that it was the purpose of this act [of 1884] merely to protect the possession of the Indians of lands which they then occupied in Alaska, and to deny them the power to convey to others their right of occupation. It was an act, not only for the benefit of the Indians, but also for the white settlers. It was enacted with a view to conditions which then existed in Alaska. Since the time of its acquisition, settlers and miners had been entering the territory. They had located mining claims and town sites, and had transferred lands in tracts and in lots and blocks. They had erected buildings for mercantile purposes and dwelling purposes. The mining claims and lands so occupied by Indians and settlers were held under a claim of possession only, and such possessory rights had been freely conveyed and transferred. Those possessory rights as they then existed were recognized and protected by the act. The act made no distinction between the rights of the white settlers and the rights of the Indians, and it is not to be presumed that Congress intended thereby to deprive either of the power to exercise rights which they had theretofore possessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-18\">One of the reasons why this court affirmed the decree of the trial judge in Whelpley v. Grosvold, 9 Cir., 249 F. 812, 815, was because it did \u201cnot appear that the appellant <em>or any of his predecessors in interest </em>was in possession of the island or claimed it in the year 1884.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Sec also two cases, already referred to, decided by the District Court of Alaska\u2014Haltern v. Emmons, <em>46 </em>F. 452 at page 456, and Carroll v. Price, 81 F. 137 at page 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">7. <em>The Appellants Have the Right to Sue Individually.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">The appellee maintains that the appellants, as individuals, \u201chave no standing to prosecute a claim based on Indian title,\u201d but that the Indian right, if any, is tribal. Since the appellee is here referring to original Indian title, its statement may be correct, although we are not expressing an opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">As we have already pointed out, however, the only sound basis for relief that the appellants have is not based upon original Indian title. The true foundation of their right is the repeated Congressional <em>recognition </em>of the occupancy or possession of the land by the \u201cIndians\u201d who were on the land at the time the act of 1884 was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Not once in the various Congressional \u201crecognitions\u201d that we have referred to, does the word \u201ctribe\u201d occur. The occupancy or possession sought to be protected or recognized by those statutes is always that of \u201cIndians\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cclaimants\u201d or \u201cthe natives of Alaska\u201d; i. e., the individual Indians or other persons who happened to be occupying the lands in 1884 and in the other years when the succeeding statutes were enacted. See Cramer v. United States, 261 U.S. 219, 227, 228, 229, 43 S.Ct. 342, 67 L.Ed. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">8. <em>Appellants\u2019 Misconceived Legal Theory Should Not Bar Their Recovery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">The fact that the appellants have misconceived the tesis of their right, and have pleaded what seems to be \u201coriginal Indian title\u201d, should not prevent their recovery on the merits, under the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">It will be remembered that they and their \u201cpredecessors\u201d have had \u201cexclusive possession\u201d \u201cever since the year 1867, and from time immemorial prior thereto.\u201d .Since the greater includes the less, their pleading can be understood to cover adequately the period on which their true right is based; namely, possession and occupancy since the year 1884. They have simply alleged more than was necessary: the excess can be disregarded as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">Similarly, their designation of themselves as \u201caboriginal\u201d users and occupants is not a fatal error. It is merely a conclusion of law, with vyhich this court does not agree, and can be likewise dismissed as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">Section 3461 of the Compiled Laws of Alaska (1933) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-14\">\u201cThe court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not affect the substantial rights of the adverse paily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-15\">In Royal Palm Soap Co. v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., 5 Cir., 296 F. 448, 449, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-16\">\u201cLegal conclusions expressed in the above set out plea are not to be considered in determining the legal effect of the state of facts it alleges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-17\">See also, In re Marron Mfg. Co., 7 Cir., 1 F.2d 903 ; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-18\">9. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-19\">It is the appellee\u2019s main contention that, \u201cunless formally recognized or acknowledged by the ruling sovereign in such manner as to amount to a guarantee of a permanent right of occupancy, aboriginal Indian title or temporary right of occupancy may be extinguished by the United States without any liability to compensate the Indians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-20\">As far as it relates to \u201caboriginal Indian title,\u201d the Supreme Court, as we have seen, already has rejected this theory. See the Tillamook case, supra. By a parity of reasoning, we believe that the same conclusion should be reached with regard to what the appellee chooses to term the Indians\u2019 \u201ctemporary right of occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-21\">As may be seen from the many Supreme Court decisions dealing with the nature of Indian title, all such title is, in a strict sense, \u201ctemporary\u201d unless, of course, an allotment in fee simple is granted by the Government to an individual Indian. Even original Indian title is, in Mr. Chief Justice Vinson\u2019s language, \u201cvulnerable to affirmative action by the sovereign.\u201d The Tilla-mook case, supra. Yet that type of Indian title is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>It may freely be conceded that the so-called \u201ctemporary right of occupancy\u201d of these appellants is similarly \u201cvulnerable to affirmative action by the sovereign.\u201d But this second type of Indian title, we think, is likewise compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Nor is it pertinent to balance the appellants\u2019 \u201ctemporary right of occupancy\u201d in an apothecary\u2019s scales against the Tilla-mooks\u2019 \u201coriginal Indian title\u201d \u2014 although the repeated Congressional recognition, so much insisted upon by the appellee, might well turn the balance in the Tlingits\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">We are not concerned here, however, with the <em>qtumtum </em>of compensation, but with the <em>right </em>of compensation. We believe that the appellants have that right, and that the learned judge below erred in sustaining the demurrer against their \u201caffirmative defense and claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
