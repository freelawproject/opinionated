A sufficient answer to this is, that the act of December 19th, 1878, does-not purport to be an amendment of the code, and, therefore, that provision of the code cannot be regarded as affecting the provisions of the act now under consideration. In addition to this, however, we may say that the provision of the code by which the time is doubled in case of service by mail, is intended for the benefit of the party <em>upon </em>whom the service is made, and not for the benefit 'of the party <em>mahing </em>the service. For while there is good reason for extending the time within which any act is to be done by a party who has been, served by mail after such service, there is no reason for such extension in favor of one who adopts that mode of serving another, inasmuch as the service is complete from the time the paper to be served is deposited in the post-office, addressed to the person upon whom it is to be served,, at the place of his residence, with the postage paid. <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
