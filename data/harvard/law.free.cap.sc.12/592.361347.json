The provisions of tire General Statutes that the husband shall not be liable for the debts contracted by the wife, except in a particular case of her necessary support, places the husband in the position of a formal and not a substantial party to suits against the wife on her individual contracts other than her necessary support, which is the nature of the present action, and failure to take such objection by demurrer or answer is a waiver of such objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The judgment must be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">New trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-8\">McTver, A.
