Defendants moved for a non-suit, upon the ground that the action should have been trespass or trover, and not <em>assumpsit. </em>The motion was refused and defendants excepted. The defendants offered in evidence the papers set forth in their answer together with statement of Capt. Metcalf; his Honor ruled them inadmissible, and defendants excepted. The defendants introduced testimony to show that the cotton belonged to Jacob Lagrone at the time he sold it.

Because his Honor erred in overruling the motion of defendants\u2019 counsel for a non-suit, made upon the grounds that the testimony in behalf of plaintiff showed that the action was improperly <em>brought; </em>that the action should have been trespass or trover, and not <em>assumpsit; </em>and in allowing the plaintiff to go to the jury upon the pleadings as presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">2. Because it is respectfully submitted his Honor the presiding judge erred in not allowing full force and effect to the act of the general assembly of this state, entitled an \u201cAct to quiet rights vested under military orders.\u201d approved and ratified on the 22d day of September, A. D. 1868 <em>\u2022 </em>the defendants\u2019 testator, Jacob Lagrone, having under and by virtue of the military orders of Capt. L. W. Metcalf, 33d U. S. colored troops, then stationed at Edgefield C. H., and the orders of Major-General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>James B. Steadman, stationed at Augusta, Ga., against rights which were intended to be, and were, as defendants submit, quieted and determined by said orders; and in not allowing full force and effect to said orders issued in August, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">3. Because bis Honor erred, as it is respectfully submitted, in not instructing the jury upon the evidence that the said testator having acted in the alleged conversion and sale of the cotton in question, under and by virtue of the said military orders, he should not have been held accountable either for the cotton, its value, or for interest from the date of the alleged conversion and sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">4. Because his Honor erred in his instructions to the jury that they should allow interest from the date of the alleged conversion, whereas interest, if allowed at all, should have been allowed only from the date of the demand by plaintiff, and no demand was proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">5. Because the jury, in arriving at their verdict, regarded the alleged contract for the purchase of the cotton as having been made with reference to confederate currency as a basis of value, whereas there was no proof to justify such a conclusion, but on the contrary there was positive and direct proof, uncontradicted and unimpeached, that said contract was made with reference to gold and silver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\">6. Because the testimony showed that the value of the cotton \u2022alleged to have been converted, at the date of the alleged conversion, was twenty-one and one-half cents per pound; and the jury erred in estimating said cotton at said time at thirty-five cents per pound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">7. 'Because, it is respectfully submitted, the jury erred in disregarding the testimony that established the fact that the contract between plaintiff and defendants\u2019 testator was rescinded previously to said alleged conversion, inasmuch as the cotton was not to be delivered until paid for, and no tender of payment was ever made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">8.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADt\">The first ground of appeal is that the Circuit judge erred in overruling a motion on the part of the defendants for a non-suit, made upon the ground that the testimony in behalf of the plaintiff showed that the action should have been trespass or trover, and not <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">The action was commenced in 1866, under the form of practice which existed prior to the adoption of the code of proced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ure. The pleading, as presented in the \u201c case,\u201d contains the writ and an \u201c amended complaint,\u201d upon which is the following endorsement: \u201cWe accept service of the amended complaint, and waive all irregularities as to the additional cause of action,\u201d dated March 16th, 1870, and signed by the attorneys for the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The complaint seems to have been again amended under an order of court, bearing date June 8th, 1874, and the cause was tried in 1876. This court is unable to perceive that the motion would have been sustained even under the former rules of pleading. It was optional with the plaintiff to sue for the proceeds of the sale of cotton, or for damages for the conversion thereof. The first would be an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received to the use of the plaintiffs, the second would be trover. The difference would have been in the rule by which the damages should be measured. But the fact is that the greater part of the proceedings and the trial took place after the adoption of the code, \u201c q,nd the rules by which the sufficiency of the pleadings is to be determined are those prescribed by this code of procedure.\u201d <em>Gen. Stat. </em>604, \u00a7 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The amended complaint which is before us contains beyond question the requisites prescribed by Section 165. The motion for a non-suit was, therefore, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">For a second ground of appeal it is alleged that the judge erred \u201cin not allowing full force and effect to the act of the general assembly of this state, entitled \u2018An act to grant rights vested under military orders,\u201d approved September 22d, 1868. <em>Gen. Stat. </em>506.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">It is enough on this point to say that the military orders to which reference is made, do not purport to adjudicate any rights as to the ownership of the cotton, nor are they in other respects within the provisions of the act. One is an order from a subordinate officer forbidding Warren from interfering with cotton in possession .of Lagrone, \u201c except in due and proper form,\u201d while the other is an order issued by the officer commanding in the department-of Georgia, and relates to transactions in that state. Neither corues within the terms or contemplation of the act, and, therefore, no question as to the force and effect of the act is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The third, fourth and eighth grounds of appeal charge the judge with error of law in his instructions to the jury. The case, as made out by the appellants, shows no exceptions to the charge.of the judge, and such exceptions cannot be taken after a verdict has been had. The third, fourth and eighth points are, therefore, not properly before this court, and need not be considered, though, perhaps, it may be as well to say that so far as is disclosed by the case, such exceptions, if they had been properly taken, would not have been of any avail to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The fifth, sixth and seventh grounds are based solely .upon surmise and conjecture as to what were the motives and reasons by which the jurors may have been influenced in arriving at their conclusion. Such suggestions may properly have been presented to the mind of the Circuit judge when he was considering the motion for a new trial, but they cannot come up on appeal, and, therefore, as to them the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The only remaining question in the case is raised by appeal from the order which determined that the damages were excessive, and granted a new trial, <em>unless </em>the plaintiff, within thirty days from the date hereof, remit on the record the sum of $2975.82 of the verdict, as of the date thereof, in which case said motion (for new trial) \u201c is dismissed, without costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The appeal is from that part of the order which allows the plaintiff to remit the amount in excess, and thereby prevent a new trial being had.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">It is well settled that this court has no power to review or correct the findings of fact in a trial by jury. <em>Const., Art. IV, </em>\u00a7 4. But it is provided that \u201cthe judge who tries the cause may, in his discretion, entertain a motion to be made on his minutes to set aside a verdict and grant a new trial upon exceptions, or for <em>insufficient evidence, </em>or for <em>excessive damages.\u201d Gen. Stat. </em>636, \u00a7 288; <em>vide, </em>also, act of 1868, <em>Gen. Stat. </em>497, \u00a7 4. From the decision of the Circuit judge on such motion, based upon error in fact, as for insufficient evidence or for excessive damages, there is no appeal. The Circuit Court, therefore, in such respect, is a court of final resort, and, except where specially directed by constitutional or statutory provisions, is to be governed in its proceedings by the principles of law and the rules of practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>which were of force and applicable to courts in the exercise of similar power prior to the adoption of the constitution in 1868. The practice of the Court of Appeals prior to 1868, before which court such motions were then heard, is too well settled to require more than a mere reference to the volumes of the reports of the adjudicated cases. In the case of <em>Laney </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>4 <em>Rich. L. </em>2, the court, per Wardlaw, J., says: <em>\u201c </em>These considerations induce the court to impose, upon the grant of a new trial in this case, extraordinary terms required by an extraordinary conjuncture of circumstances. The discretion of the court in imposing conditions upon the grant of a new trial may always be exercised according to the exigency of the case.\u201d A new trial was thereupon granted <em>nisi. </em>In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>12 <em>Rich. </em>138, the court, per O\u2019Neall, J., says: \u201c Having thus the means of correcting the verdict and doing justice between the parties, we will pursue that course. A new trial is therefore granted, unless the plaintiff shall, within sixty days after notice of this order, enter upon the record a <em>remittitur </em>of so much of the verdict as shall exceed twenty-nine dollars and seventy-five cents.\u201d See, also, <em>Walters et al. </em>v. <em>McGirt et al., </em>8 <em>Rich. 287; Dotterer </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>5 <em>Rich. </em>295; <em>Guerry </em>v. <em>Kerton, </em>2 <em>Rich. </em>507; <em>Farrand </em>v. <em>Bouchell, Harper </em>83. In fact, it requires but a glance at the authorities to show that where the proper limit of the damages was legally ascertainable, it was the common practice to grant the order <em>nisi. </em>3 <em>Graham &amp; Waterman on New Trials </em>1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">If the Circuit judge is empowered to grant a new trial because he considers the damages excessive, it i\u00e1 absolutely necessary to presume that he is able to fix damages which would not be excessive. If the plaintiff sees proper to reduce the verdict to that amount, no one can complain \u2014 most assuredly not the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">If the plaintiff had obtained leave to remit before the defendant moved for new trial, the motion would rest, not upon the verdict as it had been, but as it was when (he motion was made. The court certainly can grant leave to (he plaintiff to do that which he could have done as of course on his own motion. The moment the reduction is made, the reason for a new trial has ceased to exist. The plaintiff in this case has remitted the amount, and the order of the Circuit judge stands, dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the motion. We have no doubt of the power on the part of the Circuit judge to attach conditions to an order granting a new trial, and base such conclusion upon the reasons already given. From this decision there is no right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The law is well expressed by Gray, J., in the following language : \u201cSuch a motion, so far as it depends upon the weight of evidence or other matter of fact, is exclusively addressed to the discretion of the presiding judge. When the damages awarded by the jury appear to the judge to be excessive, he may either grant a new trial absolutely or give the plaintiff the option to remit the excess or a portion thereof, and order the verdict to stand for the residue. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>12 <em>Pick. </em>199; <em>Hurry </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>659, <em>note; Blunt </em>v. <em>Little, </em>3 <em>Mason </em>102; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>97 <em>Mass. </em>208.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Motion refused.</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-8\">Willard, C.
