Feemster against Margaret L. Good, the widow of John H. Good, and their children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-13\">John H. Good died leaving a will, which directed his funeral expenses and all of his just debts to be paid. Then followed paragraph two, which reads: <em>\u201c </em>I give and bequeath to my wife, Margaret L. Good, all the balance of my estate, both real and personal, to dispose of as she may think best for her and our children, by the consent of my executor.\u201d B. E. Feemster was appointed and qualified as executor. Feemster paid all the debts of the estate, except one to <em>W. </em>J. Good, whose note was surrendered in exchange for another of like amount, signed by Feemster and M. L. Good. The executor then turned over to the widow, for herself and five minor children, all the remainder of the estate, consisting of a tract of land, negroes and other personal property necessary for farming operations. The personalty thus turned over, exclusive of land and negroes, was more than sufficient to pay the W. J. Good note. W. J. Good was a brother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of J. H. Good, and Feemster was a brother of M. L. Good. The arrangement was made and the extended credit given, because it was believed that it was for the best interests of the widow and children that the property should be held together and this debt paid off out of future crops; all the personalty turned over being needed to run the farm. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">The personal property was exhausted and the slaves were emancipated, leaving W. J. Good unpaid. He brought his action against Feemster and obtained judgment for the amount of .his debt, which Feemster paid. Plaintiff then brought this action to have the land of his testator sold and the proceeds applied to repaying the amount paid by him to <em>W. </em>J. Good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">C. E. Spencer, Esq., special referee, took the testimony and reported his conclusions of fact and of law. Upon exceptions thereto the case was heard on Circuit. In delivering his decree, the presiding judge said: \u201c I concur in the report of the referee, as to the fact that this arrangement was in good faith, and then seemed best for the objects of testator\u2019s bounty, but afterwards the slaves were set. free and nothing was left, except the land of testator for the payment of the said debt. The holder thereof sued plaintiff and compelled him to pay it. He now seeks repayment out of testator\u2019s land yet in possession of his legatees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\"><em>\u201c </em>I cannot doubt that the departure by the plaintiff from the directions of the will was made in kindness, and that it would have been best for the estate, if the war had never been. But if executors use their own judgment, even in best faith, against the express directions of the will, minor legatees will, in case of mishap, have the right to make such executors bear the loss which ensues. In this case all the defendants are minors except M. L. Good. She united with the plaintiff in the substituted note, and assented that the directions of the will be departed from, and the plaintiff is entitled to enforce his claim against one-sixth of the land, which is her share in it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">The decree concluded with an order for sale of M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAB\">In this ease we concur with the Circuit judge in the conclusions which he has reached. If an executor deliberately undertakes to depart from the instructions contained in the will which he has undertaken to execute, no matter what may be the motives which prompted him, he cannot -impose the loss which may ensue from such departure from his testator\u2019s instructions upon innocent devisees or legatees. It is very clear from the report of the referee that the executor had in his hands at one time ample means for the payment of all the debts, and if he chose voluntarily to place those means beyond his reach, where they most probably would be. (and have been) appropriated to other uses, he has no equity to call upon the devisees and legatees, to replace those means and repair the loss which has been occasioned by his own misconduct, whether willful or not, in which they have in no wise participated. The defendant, M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>L. Good, having, however, not only acquiesced in such departure from the instructions contained in the will, but actually enjoyed the use of the property thus illegally diverted by the executor from its proper channel, is not in a position to resist the claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The question as to what was the share of Mrs. M. L. Good in the estate was probably not raised or but little attention bestowed upon it in the court below, as it does not appear to be discussed in the decree of the Circuit judge. We, however, see no error in the Circuit decision in this respect. The case does not belong to that class of cases in which the gift is to a class of persons, such as heirs, relations or next of kin, and it is necessary, in order to ascertain who' are the individuals embraced in such class, to resort to the statute of distributions. Here the gift is to wife and children, and in such a case no resort to the statute is necessary. It is the same thing, so far as this question is concerned, as if the testator had made the gift directly to his wife and children <em>by name, </em>iu which case it is clear that they would all take in equal shares, and not in the proportions prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-8\">Willard, C.
