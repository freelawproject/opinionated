Because we determine that 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8, A-5 does not apply to the employer-provided insurance plan in which Harris was participating, his late payment of his insurance premium will not be excused under that regulation. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint to reinstate insurance benefits for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-21\">United Automobile Insurance Group, Inc. (\u201cUAIG\u201d) employed Harris as in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>house counsel. After UAIG terminated his employment on May 11, 2007, Harris elected to maintain continuing health insurance coverage through COBRA. According to Harris\u2019s Second Amended Complaint (\u201cthe complaint\u201d), UAIG is a \u201csponsor and administrator for a self-insured, self-funded health benefit plan for medical claims.\u201d Ceridian, the other named defendant, \u201cis a COBRA plan administrator employed by UAIG to processes [sic] COBRA premium payments for UAIG\u2019s former employees, who opt to enroll in COBRA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">Sometime in late May 2007, Harris received a letter from Ceridian notifying him of his right to COBRA coverage, but he never received the Summary Plan Description as required under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022 and 1024(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">According to the benefits plan,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-7\">Although subsequent payments are due by the first day of the month, you will be given a grace period of 30 days after the first day of the coverage period to make each monthly payment. Your COBRA continuation coverage will be provided ... as long as payment is made before the end of the grace period for that payment ... If you fail to make a payment before the end of the grace period for that coverage period, you will lose all rights to COBRA continuation coverage under the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">The notice and information sheet attached to the election for COBRA benefits explained, \u201c[t]o be considered a timely payment, your premium payment must be ... postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the grace period expiration date and received by Ceredian.\u201d The notice further provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-9\">[l]ate payments cannot be accepted and will be returned, resulting in cancellation of your coverage with no possibility for reinstatement. Note 3: ... If you wait until the end of the grace period to pay, you risk not having sufficient time to correct errors, which may or may not be within your control (such as ... late/ missed pickups by the U.S. Postal Service). In such cases, your coverage will be cancelled with no possibility of reinstatement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Harris made each monthly premium payment in a timely manner until January 2008. Harris received the monthly invoice for that period, stating that the payment was due January 11, with a thirty-day grace period; thus, payment had to made by February 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">Harris asserts that his wife placed the payment in the mailbox on February 11, 2008, but the envelope containing the payment was not post-marked until February 12. According to the complaint, Harris\u2019s wife</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-13\">either inadvertently [placed the check in the mailbox] after the mail carrier had made his rounds. Or the envelope was picked up that day and post-marked a day later \u2014 February 12, 2008 \u2014 a real possibility in some areas of South Carolina \u2014 like where Mrs. HARRIS lives\u2014 because the postal service often employs part-time mail carriers, who use their own vehicles to deliver the mail, and the mail could have gotten delayed, misplaced or even left in the carrier\u2019s car overnight, before making its way to the post office the next day to be postmarked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">Because the envelope was not received within the time period for payment and was postmarked one day after the end of the grace period, Ceridian terminated Harris\u2019s COBRA coverage. Harris attempted to resolve this with UAIG and Ceridian, but they refused to reinstate his coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-15\">Harris filed the instant complaint, alleging three counts: In count I, Harris alleged that he was entitled to recover bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>fits from UAIG under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and requested reinstatement of benefits, as well as damages, fees, and expenses. According to Harris, UAIG had the discretion to consider his entitlement to benefits, but refused to do so. In count II, Harris claimed breach of contract against both defendants for the failure to supply the Summary Plan Description as required and for terminating his benefits. In count III, Harris alleged violations of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8, A-5. This regulation provides that a payment is considered timely if submitted within 30 days after the first day of the period of coverage or any longer period of time provided under the terms of the plan. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8, A-5. Additionally, if the employer and an insurance company have an arrangement whereby the employer has a longer period of time to pay for coverage for non-COBRA beneficiaries, then the employee \u2014 or former employee, rather\u2014 shall be allowed the same period of time to make his premium payments. <em>Id. </em>According to Harris, UAIG, as a self-funded plan sponsor and administrator, pays claims when they come due or funds a claims\u2019 account at intervals that exceed the time limit for payment imposed on Harris, and thus violates the above regulation. Because UAIG has more time than 30 days \u2014 in fact no set time at all \u2014 to pay claims or fund the account, Harris should be entitled to the same time period in which to pay his premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motion to dismiss. Addressing Harris\u2019s claim for recovery of benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) in count I, the court found that Harris had no right to recover benefits under the plan because UAIG was within its rights to cancel his insurance after failing to receive a timely premium payment. The court also found that Harris\u2019s allegation that UAIG committed a procedural violation by not providing the Summary Plan Description did not entitle Harris to relief because Harris was not prejudiced by this alleged violation. With respect to the state law breach of contract claim in count II, the court found Harris\u2019s claim against Ceridian could not proceed because Ceridian did not owe any fiduciary obligations to Harris. Harris had already conceded that his state-law claims against UAIG were preempted by ERISA law. Finally, the court found that there was no merit to the allegations in count III, seeking damages for violations of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8, because the regulation did not create substantive rights. Accordingly, the court dismissed Harris\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">The court then informed Harris that any third amended complaint must be filed by September 10, 2008 and could not re-raise issues already dismissed. The court warned that the failure to comply would result in dismissal with prejudice. Harris did not file a third amended complaint, and the court granted the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss with prejudice. Harris timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">We review a grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">On appeal, Harris asserts only that the regulations at 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8 give rise to a claim for benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) and that under these regulations he should have been allowed the same period of time to pay his COBRA premium as UAIG is given to fund the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He thus argues that his benefits were wrongly terminated in violation of \u00a7 54.4980B-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Treasury regulation \u00a7 54.4980B-8 presents a series of questions and answers applicable to COBRA coverage. Question and answer 5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-6\">Q-5: What is timely payment for COBRA continuation coverage? A-5: (a) Except as provided [here] ... timely payment for a period of COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan means payment that is made to the plan by the date that is 30 days after the first day of that period. Payment that is made to the plan by a later date is also considered timely payment if ... (2) Under the terms of an arrangement between the employer or employee organization and an insurance company ... or other entity that provides plan benefits on the employer\u2019s or employee organization\u2019s behalf, the employer or employee organization is allowed until that later date to pay for coverage of similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries for the period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.4980B-8, A-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">We conclude that this regulation does not entitle Harris to additional time beyond that provided by UAIG\u2019s plan. The parties agree that UAIG was self-funding, meaning that medical claims were paid from the employer\u2019s assets rather than being paid through an insurance policy. In other words, UAIG did not have a relationship such as the one described in the above regulation; it did not have an \u201carrangement\u201d under the terms of which it was given a certain period of time to pay for the coverage of non-COBRA beneficiaries. The additional time frame provided in the regulation applies only to those plans that are fully-funded, <em>ie. </em>that involve an agreement with an insurance company to provide benefits. Thus, \u00a7 54.4980B-8, A-5 does not apply to the plan funded and sponsored by UAIG. Because the regulation does not apply to Harris\u2019s COBRA plan, Harris\u2019s time to submit his premium payment was not extended beyond February 11, 2008 and UAIG was within its rights in terminating Harris\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">Harris also argues that his payment should have been considered \u201cmade\u201d on the day his wife deposited it into the mailbox, February 11. Using this date, his payment would have been timely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notice that Harris received, however, clearly stated that a payment would be considered made as of the date that it is postmarked, if sent through the U.S. mail. Additionally, the notice warned Harris of the dangers of mailing payments at the end of the grace period as this would \u201crisk not having sufficient time to correct [any] errors ... (such as ... late/missed pickups by the U.S. Postal Service).\u201d Harris disregarded this warning, assumed the risk that the post office would not postmark his payment envelope on the same day that his wife deposited .it into the mailbox, and accordingly failed to timely submit payment for his COBRA premium. Under the facts as alleged in the complaint, UAIG did not act improperly in terminating his coverage. We,. therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Harris\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Although the above reasons are not the same grounds upon which the district court dismissed Harris\u2019s complaint, these are questions of law and \u201c[w]e may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">We turn now to the motions filed by the defendants before this court. The defendants have requested fees and costs pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. The defendants argue that Harris acted in bad faith by filing this appeal, which they assert lacks any factual, contractual, or statutory basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Section 1132 provides, \u201c[i]n any action under this subchapter (other than an action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). In determining whether fees should be awarded under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), this court considers the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-7\">(1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees; (3) whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorney\u2019s fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; (5) [and] the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APrp\"><em>Freeman v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1116, 1121 (11th Cir.1993). \u201c[N]o one of these factors is necessarily decisive, and some may not be apropos in a given case, but together they are the nuclei of concerns that a court should address ... In particular types of cases, or in any individual case, however, other considerations may be relevant as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">Considering these factors, an award of fees is not warranted in this case. First, the district court made no finding that any party acted in bad faith, and the record on appeal does not establish any bad faith. Although the regulation at issue does not apply to Harris\u2019s COBRA benefits, the district court failed to consider Harris\u2019s argument on this point and there is little case law interpreting the regulation. Thus, it cannot be said that Harris\u2019s appeal was wholly frivolous. Moreover, UAIG does not seek fees to benefit other plan participants. On these facts, UAIG is not entitled to fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides, \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 38. For the reasons discussed above, we do not believe sanctions are warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">The defendants also request that this court strike certain attachments to Harris\u2019s response to the motion for fees and references Harris made to UAIG\u2019s bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>faith. Because we find in favor of the defendants without regard to the allegedly offensive response, we deny this motion as moot. The defendants further moved for attorney\u2019s fees under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 for having to file the motion to strike. We decline to award these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Harris\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">. Because he limits his arguments on appeal to this issue, the remainder of his claims raised in the complaint are deemed abandoned. <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). We will not, therefore, address his state law claims for breach \u2022of contract or whether the failure to supply him with the Summary Plan Description entitles him to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AAx\">. Although Harris did not clearly make this argument in his opening brief to this court, the defendants interpreted his brief as making this point. Furthermore, we construe Harris\u2019s brief liberally, as he is proceeding <em>pro se. Tannenbaum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir 1998)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">. The defendants also discuss whether the district court properly dismissed Harris\u2019s complaint with prejudice after he chose not to file a third amended complaint. Harris, however, does not appeal that ruling by the district court and so we do not address that issue. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
