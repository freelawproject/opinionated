That the trial court had no power to conform the pleadings to the proof, where this variance was pointed out by motion to.dismiss at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and that an earlier objection to the proof was unnecessary to protect the defendant\u2019s rights in this precise situation, are propositions directly established by recent authority.
