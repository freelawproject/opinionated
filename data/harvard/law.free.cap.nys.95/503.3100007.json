The action is upon a promissory note, and the defense is forgery. Obviously there is flat perjury on one side or the other. The authenticity of the note is upheld by a single witness, in whose testimony is to be found much inconsistency and improbability. \u25a0 Witnesses whose evidence might throw light upon the question are not produced, and some of the exhibits used on the trial are not attached to the return. Particularly do we miss samples of the handwriting of the two defendants. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witness is that the note was signed by one of the defendants in the witness\u2019 presence. Upon the trial both of the defendants were required to write their own names and that of their firm, and did so. The samples thus written were examined, as the record shows, by both counsel, but were apparently not put.in evidence and are not attached to the return. In short, in the face of the flat contradiction as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>signature upon the note, the most ordinary tests commonly applied in such cases were not resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
