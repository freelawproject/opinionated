It appeared upon the trial that the defendant was not personally present at the time of the acts complained of, and that the exclusion of the plaintiff, if any, was the act of some employ\u00e9. The statute being penal in its character, the question of the defendant\u2019s actual intent and of his personal delictum was involved; and, while evidence that the violations of the statute had been contrary to his express orders would not be necessarily conclusive, it was still material evidence to be considered by the jury, in connection with whatever proof was in the case, to support a finding upon the issue as to whether the defendant, by his conduct or his manner of conducting the business of his theater, was in fact responsible for this violation of the act, where he had not personally and individually brought himself within the penal provisions.
