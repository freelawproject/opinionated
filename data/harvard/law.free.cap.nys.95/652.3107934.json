The undisputed evidence shows that Boxer called at the plaintiff\u2019s rooms to collect an alleged balance due the defendant upon a bedstead which the latter had sold to her and for which she claimed to have completed the payments. Boxer forced his way into her room, seized her, threw her down, and kicked her. He then called in the defendant\u2019s driver and removed the bedstead. Altogether he inflicted upon the plaintiff injuries for which the amount of the verdict is no more than adequate, and the judgment should be sustained if Boxer committed the assault in the course of his employment by the defendant. Mott v. Consumers\u2019 Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543. Any lack of proof in the plaintiff\u2019s case on this, the only important point, is amply supplied by the testimony of the defendant who was his only witness. As to the authority of his collector, he merely testified that he had never given him instructions to go to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cto get a bedstead or any other thing.\u201d On his cross-examination, however, he admitted that his driver and Boxer were the two men referred to in his verified answer (paragraph 4) reading in part, \u201cwhile defendant, by his servants and employ\u00e9s, was removing said property,\u201d etc. And on the redirect examination, he said: \u201cThe bookkeeper informed me that they (Boxer and the driver) were there. That is all the information I had.\u201d Obviously the fair inference from his testimony and the pleading is that his servants were authorized to go to the plaintiff\u2019s rooms \u25a0 and take the furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">It follows that the assault was committed in the course of the employment, and, no reversible error appearing, the judgment and orders should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
