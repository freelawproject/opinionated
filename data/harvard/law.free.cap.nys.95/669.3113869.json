There was no agreement, however, as to when the property should be sold, or at what price. The defendant purchased the property under the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s contract for $1,850, and the plaintiff thereafter procured a person who was willing to purchase the premises for $2,400, but defendant refused to sell at that figure. This action was thereupon begun to recover the amount the plaintiff would have been entitled to receive providing the sale had been made, and he has recovered a judgment for that amount, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Upon the trial the plaintiff gave evidence tending to establish these facts; but the trouble is that he has mistaken his remedy, if he has any at this time. The four persons were to share in the profits of this venture, and to this extent there was a community of interest, and they became partners in respect to the profits. The relation could only be terminated by consent of the parties, or, in case of their being unable to agree, either could maintain an action in equity to terminate the relation and for an accounting; and this would have been the proper remedy. Marston v. Gould, 69 N. Y. 220; Wilcox v. Pratt, 125 N. Y. 690, 25 N. E. 1091. A common-law action will not lie until after a full accounting, balance struck, and express promise to pay. Belanger v. Dana, 52 Hun, 43, 4 N. Y. Supp. 776. The title to the property still remains in the defendant. There is no evidence justifying the inference that his refusal to sell for $2,400 was unreasonable, and until this is made to appear a court of equity will not interfere. Lord v. Hull, 178 N. Y. 9, 70 N. E. 69, 102 Am. St. Rep. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">For these reasons, and without considering the other questions involved, the judgment must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
