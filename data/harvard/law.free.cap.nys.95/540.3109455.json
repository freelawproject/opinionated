The merits of the dispute with regard to this later sale, as between the parties to it, could not well be determined upon the present motion. It sufficed that there was an apparently bona fide controversy, and this gave the judgment debtor an actual interest in the subject-matter of the earlier sale; for, with the sacrifice of his interest then, if permitted, he would have lost the benefits to accrue to him, should he establish his asserted, equities as against the sale under the Kenyon mortgage. The new matter upon which the motion to vacate the order setting aside the receiver\u2019s sale was based did not, therefore, call for the granting of the application, since the standing of the judgment debtor to invoke the court\u2019s action, depending, as it did, simply upon his possession of some interest to be protected, was not rendered infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
