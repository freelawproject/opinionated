On the 5th day of December, 1904, the committee reported to the common council that they had adopted specifications providing for collecting and disposing of garbage separately and together by private contractors and that they had advertised for bids therefor, but that no bids were received, and that they then adopted specifications for the construction of a garbage plant to be owned by the city and that they had advertised for bids therefor, and that they had received bids, which they reported to the common council, and they recommended that a contract be awarded to the Clinton Foundry &amp; Machine Company for the construction of a garbage disposal plant. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>report of the committee was accepted and further consideration thereof was deferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-5\">On February 1, 1905, the mayor presented to the common council an estimate in writing of the amounts necessary to be raised for defraying the expenses of the city for the current year, as provided by said section 31 of the charter, and the amount so reported by him for the different funds mentioned in subdivisions \u201ca\u201d to \u201ch,\u201d inclusive, of said section, aggregated $169,900. No estimate was made and nothing was said therein about the erection of a garbage plant or a proposed expenditure therefor. The estimate also included amounts for interest and principal falling due on city bonds and for paving, school, and library purposes. At the same meeting of the common council a resolution was passed authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with the Clinton Foundry &amp; Machine Company for the erection of a garbage plant for $16,277. At a meeting of the common council February 6, 1905, said estimates by the mayor were considered, and corrections and alterations were made, which changed the aggregate amount of the eight items mentioned in subdivisions \u201ca\u201d to \u201ch,\u201d inclusive, of said section 31, to $170,900, and also changed somewhat the amounts for principal falling due on city bonds and for school purposes, and then added to said estimate an item of $10,000 \u201cto apply on the contract authorized and directed by a resolution of the common council February 1, 1905, for the construction of a garbage crematory,\u201d and they proceeded to levy and assess the total amount of said estimates as so corrected and altered upon the taxable inhabitants and property of said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-6\">At the meeting of the common council February 1, 1905, a committee of five, including the mayor, were appointed to negotiate for a site for the garbage crematory. Subsequently others were added to such, committee, and they were given full power to secure a site for the garbage crematory, either by purchase or contract. On the 7th day of April, 1905, such committee procured a deed for a lot on Baldwin street as a site for the crematory. The agreed purchase price of said lot was $1,500, but it has not been paid, and the committee subsequently determined that such lot was unsuitable for its purpose, and on May 19, 1905, they purchased a further site for such crematory on Tuttle avenue; the consideration therefor being $1,500, but no part thereof has been paid. The boundary of the city of Elmira passes through the lot last mentioned, but substantially all of said lot is outside of the boundaries of the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-7\">The Clinton Foundry &amp; Machine Company sublet its contract for the erection of the crematory, and the subcontractor at the time of the commencement of this action was actually engaged on the lot last mentioned in the erection thereof. This action is brought, among other things, to restrain the collection of the taxes, other than the school tax, levied by the common council February 6, 1905; also to restrain the payment by the city of the purchase price \u2022of said lots of land, or on account of said contract for the erection of said plant; also to restrain the contractor and subcontractor from proceeding with such construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-8\">The plaintiff insists: \u201c(1) That the placing in the budget or tax levy of the sum of $10,000 to apply on said contract for the erection of a garbage plant increased said budget or tax levy beyond the amount authorized by the charter of said city; to be raised by taxation. (2) That the purchase or attempted purchase of lands for a site for said garbage plant was illegal, because no appropriation had been made for the payment therefor. (3) That the common council of said city had no power to delegate to a committee of its body the authority to select and purchase a site for said garbage plant. (4) That the common council had no power to purchase lands outside of the city of Elmira for a site for said garbage plant without express legislative authority, and that by the deeds of said lands to the city said city took no title. (5) That the purchase of lands for a site and the erection of a garbage plant thereon involved an extraordinary expenditure, which could only be made after a submission of the question whether such expenditure should or should not be made to the taxpayers of said city at a special election, as provided by section 71 of the charter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>An Injunction substantially In accordance with the demand of th\u00a7 complaint was obtained, to continue during the pendency of the action.

Such restriction upon the expenditures is exclusive of interest and principal falling due within the current year on bonds issued by the city and of all other liabilities of the city for which other provision is not made (sudivision \u201ci,\u201d \u00a7 31, of the charter [Laws 1894, p. 1402, c. 615, as amended by Laws 1904, p. 930, c. 367]), an amount not exceeding $25,000 for paving (section 148 of the charter [Laws 1894, p. 1451, c. 615, as amended by chapter 371, p. 532 of the Laws of 1895]), an amount necessary for the maintenance of the public schools (section 223 of the charter), and an amount for library purposes. The common council is limited in its expenditures to the several amounts fixed and determined by it to be raised for the current year and to expenditures for the purposes in its estimate specified, except as prescribed in section 71 of the charter (see section 51 of the charter), and also except that certain transfers of funds are authorized from the general fund of the city for specified purposes not affecting the questions now considered (sections 173, 181, of the charter). The expenditure of money for any extraordinary or special purpose which in the opinion of the common council cannot be paid from the sums authorized by the charter to be raised after appropriating the same and defraying the ordinary expenses, or raising a sum over and above said $175,000 for the ordinary current and contingent expenses of any year, is wholly dependent upon a favorable vote of the qualified voters of the city. The item of $10,000 to apply on the contract for a garbage crematory clearly cannot be considered as a part of the fund specified in subdivisions \u201cb\u201d to \u201ch,\u201d inclusive, of said section 31. It is not an expense to be paid from the contingent or general fund. If it is conceded that the contract or contracts towards which it is proposed to pay the $10,000 constitute expenses of the city, they are fixed and determined expenses, and not such expenses as come within the term \u201ccontingent.\u201d Contingent expenses are such as are possible or liable, but not certain to occur. Webster\u2019s Dictionary. If the $10,000 is treated as a part of the contingent expenses provided for by subdivision \u201ca\u201d of said section 31, it would make the amount to be raised' under said subdivisions \u201ca\u201d to \u201ch,\u201d inclusive, of said section 31, exceed the limit of $175,000, which is prohibited by that section. The respondents are therefore forced to insist, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>at all, that the consideration named in said deeds and the^ amount of the contract for the erection of said crematory are liabilities of said city within the meaning of subdivison \u201ci\u201d of said section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">If the common council can make the amount to be paid, under any agreement that it may authorize a liability against the city, so that it can be placed in the amount to be raised by tax under said subdivision \"i\u201d of said section 31, it necessarily follows that the provisions of the charter requiring that all questions as to extraordinary and special expenditures be submitted to the qualified voters of the city, and also the limitation on the amount to be raised for current expenses, are wholly useless as protective measures. The purpose of the limitation on the power of the common council would by such construction be subverted and overcome by a part of the very section in which the limitation is stated. Such a construction would leave the common council entirely unrestricted in their authority to expend money for any city purpose. The liabilities of the city mentioned in said subdivision \u201ci\u201d of said section 31 are fixed and adjudged liabilities, and not claims for current and extraordinary expenditures, created, if at all, only by contract of the common council or of some city officer. It is only liabilities by statute, by judgment, or of the class and solemnity of bonded indebtedness, that can be intended by said subdivision of said section. In carrying out the plain purpose and intention of the charter we must hold that there is no power in the common council to expend money or enter into contracts so as to bind the municipality for any extraordinary or special purposes which cannot be paid out of the sums' authorized to be raised for current or special expenses as stated until there is a favorable vote upon the proposition to make such extraordinary and special expenditures by the qualified voters of the city in the manner provided by the charter. The building of a garbage crematory was an extraordinary and special purpose which requires a vote of the qualified voters of the city of Elmira, and a favorable vote in the manner prescribed by the charter for such expenditure is the first and preliminary step in relation thereto, and any contract relating to the erection of such garbage crematory without the money to pay therefor in advance of such favorable vote by the qualified voters was premature and unauthorized, and cannot be enforced, unless ratified after a vote in favor of such expenditure has been taken. If we are correct in the views expressed, it is unnecessary and unwise to discuss the other questions presented on this appeal, as they may not arise in the same way again.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and, the parties to the action assenting thereto, without prejudice to the right of the city to review this decision or hereafter to contend that said contracts are in all respects legal. The preliminary injunction, as modified, is further modified, so as to' enjoin only the making of payments under said contracts, or either of them, and the doing of any act in further performance thereof. All concur, except HOUGHTON, J., not voting, not being a member of the court at the time this decision was handed down.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
