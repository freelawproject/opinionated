This answering defendant is a surety upon a bond given to the Elmira National Bank b.y John J. Bush, who was its cashier. The portions of the answer stricken out substantially determine the validity of a separate defense, and the validity of such a defense should be determined by demurrer or upon the trial, and not by a motion to strike out as irrelevant. Smith v. American Co., 77 Hun, 192, 28 N. Y. Supp. 329. I think the defendant should be allowed to set forth these facts and have the court determine, upon the trial of either an issue of law or an issue of fact, the question as to whether any defense is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
