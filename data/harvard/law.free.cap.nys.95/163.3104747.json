The contract also provided that the usual certificate of the engineer of the owner should be obtained before any payment should become due, and that .\u201cthe contract- or shall also bear and repair all loss or damage to the structure, which may have been caused by accident or otherwise, and on which payments have been made by the owner,\u201d and that \u201cno certificate given or payment made under this contract shall be conclusive evidence of the performance of this contract, either wholly or in part, against any claim of the owner to the contrary in any suits or proceedings whatever; nor shall any certificate or payment in any way release the contractor from the complete fulfillment of any portion of his work in the manner prescribed by the drawings, specifications, and contracts.\u201d The specifications, which were attached to and made a part of the contract, contained the following provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-3\">\"On completion i of the tank, satisfactory test having been made, the company will do all necessary grading. * * * The tank will not be accepted until it has been proven water-tight after being filled with water to its full height and has so remained for thirty days. * * * The holder shall be properly tested, and a trial made by raising each section to its full height by air pressure ; the whole to be delivered to the Consolidated Gas Company in complete working order, perfectly gas-tight. * * * The contractors * * * shall repair and make good any damage to the property of the company * * * which may occur during the prosecution of the same, and deliver to the Consolidated G^as,Company of the city of New York a gas holder, guide frame, and tank complete in all details, in accordance with the spirit and intent of these specifications and the drawings hereunto annexed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Thereafter the plaintiffs entered upon the performance of the contract. As the work progressed payments were made upon certificates of the engineer, and bills of sale of the materials used were given by the plaintiffs to the defendant, and on the 3d day of December, 1898, the work had reached such a stage of completion that, pursuant to an arrangement previously made, the plaintiffs notified an employ\u00e9 of the defendant that the tank was ready to be filled with water, whereupon the defendant began pumping water into the tank from the river, and continued until the morning of the 13th of December, when the process of filling the tank was completed. The only work called for by the contract that remained to be done on said 3d day of December consisted of certain tarring in the pit and painting of the holder, the remedying of any defects that <em>might </em>be discovered during the test, and the adjustment of such parts of the apparatus as its operation should demonstrate needed further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>adjusting. Between the said 3d and 13th of December several of the plaintiffs\u2019 employ\u00e9s were at work finishing the work, calking whatever small \u201csweats\u201d appeared on the tank, and taking out, shortening, and replacing braces between the posts and girders of the guide frame, which was required by the defendant\u2019s engineer. The plaintiffs\u2019 foreman and construction engineer were upon the work daily up to and including said 13th, and, when the men quit work for the day at 5 o\u2019clock on said day, the plaintiffs\u2019 watchmen were left as usual to guard the entrances to the inclosure within which said structure was being erected. For several days prior to said 13th, the defendant had men employed laying pipe and doing what was necessary to connect the tank and holder with its works when ready for operation; but it does not appear that such connections had been completed. Shortly after 5 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of said 13th of December, the entire structure was reduced to a scrap heap, either because of a collapse caused by the pressure of the 1,000,000 cubic feet of water stored in the tank, or because of an explosion produced by some cause not clearly explained. It is not claimed that the plans and specifications, for which, of course, the defendant was responsible, were inadequate; but, on the contrary, it appears to have been conceded that they were sufficient to have produced a structure able to withstand any pressure which its operation would produce, and afford a factor of safety of three. After the destruction of the structure, the defendant formally demanded of the plaintiffs that they furnish the tank and holder contracted for, while the plaintiffs, insisting that the contract had been performed, demanded of the engineer a certificate to that effect, which was refused, whereupon this action was brought by the plaintiffs, alleging a substantial performance, to recover the balance due upon the contract, and from the judgment in their favor the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Upon the trial the.respective parties sought to account for the destruction of the tank and holder upon two different theories, and each introduced evidence tending to support the theory advanced, to wit: On the part of the plaintiffs, that the collapse resulted from an explosion caused by an electric spark igniting gas collected from the foul water pumped into the tank by the defendant from the river; and on the part of the defendant, that the collapse was due to the weakness of the structure itself, produced by the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the plans and specifications, which required all punched rivet holes to be reamed. The trial court submitted two questions to the jury: First, whether the plaintiffs had performed their contract according to the plans and specifications; and, second, whether the defendant had taken possession on December 3d, and on December 13th had possession and control of the structure, and was then applying it to the use for which it was intended as a gas holder, and not merely submitting it to a test\u2014and charged that, if the jury found in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor on both of said propositions, they were entitled to a verdict; otherwise, that the defendant was entitled to a verdict on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Testing the verdict by this charge, it is manifest that it cannot stand, because there is no evidence whatever that the defendant had either possession or control of the structure for the purpose of applying it to the use for which it was intended as a gas holder, or for any purpose whatever, except to make the test prescribed by the contract. It is not claimed that it had been put to any use whatever. The court distinctly charged the jury that there was no. evidence that the defendant had introduced any gas into the holder from its exhauster house, and the mere fact that the defendant was getting ready to use it in case it met the test and worked satisfactorily is no evidence whatever that it then had it in its possession and control for the purpose of applying it to the use for which it was intended. The contract is entirely silent respecting who should make the test; but, giving it the practical construction put upon it by the acts of the parties themselves, it would appear that the defendant was to make the test, the plaintiffs meanwhile to remedy any defects discovered, and to make any readjustments found.necessary. It is clear that the plaintiffs contracted, not merely to perform work and furnish materials to the defendant, but to produce and deliver to the defendant a tank and holder in complete working order, perfectly gas-tight. The 30-day water test of the tank had just begun; but it does not appear that any test of the holder had been made, that each section had been raised to its full height by air pressure, or that it was in complete working order, or was perfectly gas-tight. As the parties contemplated all of these tests before delivery, the defendant cannot be held to have waived them, in the absence of proof that it did something more than to make preparations to make the tests prescribed by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">The defendant excepted to the submission of the question whether it had control, possession, and custody of the structure, and was applying it to the uses for which it was intended, and to the refusal of the court to charge \u201cthat there is no sufficient evidence to justify a finding by the jury that the defendant did intend to accept the structure as a completed structure,\u201d and that \u201cthe proof does not justify a finding that the plaintiffs delivered the tank, holder, and guide frame to the defendant at any time prior to the accident,\u201d and these exceptions require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The respondents earnestly insist that the evidence clearly establishes as the cause of the destruction of the tank and holder an explosion produced by the act of the defendant in filling the tank with foul water; but this contention will not avail, in the face of the distinct charge of the court that there was no evidence of any neglect of the defendant causing an explosive to exist inside the tank, or that in fact the holder had become filled with marsh gas, or that the defendant had introduced any gas into the holder. In the condition of the record before us, it seems clear that the rule applicable to the case is, as stated in Harmony v. Bingham, 12 N. Y. 99, 62 Am. Dec. 142, Tompkins v. Dudley, 25 N. Y. 272, 82 Am. Dec. 349, Wheeler v. Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 82 N. Y. 543, 37 Am. Rep. 594, and Dermott v. Jones, 2 Wall. (U. S.) 1, 17 L. Ed. 762, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201cWhen, a person by express contract engages absolutely to do an act not impossible or unlawful at the time, neither inevitable accident nor other unforeseen contingency not within his control will excuse him, for the reason that he might have provided against them by his contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In the contract before us the plaintiffs not only failed to guard against the contingency, but expressly contracted \u201cto bear and repair all loss or damage to the structure caused by accident,\u201d and we must assume, for the purpose of this decision, that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to perform was due to a casualty not produced by the act or fault of either party. The argument that the provisions of the contract relating to tests and delivery and acceptance operated to suspend the time of payment, but not the defendant\u2019s liability, and that, these conditions having been rendered impossible, plaintiffs may nevertheless recover, would have more force if the contract was merely to perform certain work and furnish certain materials. The plaintiffs contracted to deliver a completed structure, and can only recover by showing performance, acceptance, or waiver by the defendant, or that complete performance was prevented by some act or fault of the defendant. It is immaterial where the title to the property was during the performance of the contract, and the fact that bills of sale were delivered as the work progressed does not alter the situation or amount to a modification of the\" contract or an acceptance \"of the work done, in the absence of proof of any act evincing an intention to accept the work or waive or modify any of the provisions of the contract. As the work progressed, the materials attached to the land became the property of the defendant, and, if the structure had not been destroyed, for \u00e1 failure to substantially perform the contract the defendant could have retained it without making compensation. Smith v. Brady, 17 N. Y. 173, 72 Am. Dec. 442. This rule of substantial performance cannot be invoked in this case simply because there has been a total failure to perform. Concededly the plaintiffs had not done all of the work called for by the contract, and though the work undone was relatively trivial, had the plaintiffs abandoned the work' at 5 o\u2019clock on said 13th day of December, and intentionally refused to complete the contract, without being prevented from completing by any act of the defendant, they could' not recover on the contract on the theory of substantial performance; and the destruction of the structure, not produced by the act or fault of the defendant, does not excuse performance, because it was one of the- hazards assumed by the plaintiffs, until the contract was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The rule that \u201cwhere the performance of a contract depends upon the continued existence of a person or thing, which is assumed as the basis of the agreement, the death of the person or the destruc- \u2022 tion of the thing terminates the obligation,\u201d relied upon by the respondents, has no application to a case where the thing destroyed is the thing which one of the parties has expressly contracted to produce and deliver. If upon a new trial the plaintiffs can show that impossibility of performance was caused by the act or fault of the defendant, a different situation will be presented.
