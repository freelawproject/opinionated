On the trial the plaintiff had a verdict, which was set aside by the learned trial justice, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to show the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the intestate, and that there was no evidence from which the jury could properly infer such absence. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel urges here, as he did in the trial court, that there was sufficient in the complaint and in the proof to support the verdict, on the theory that the defendant had created a nuisance by wrongfully obstructing the highway at the place of the accident with piles of snow, upon one of which the decedent was overturned upon the defendant\u2019s tracks while he was riding in a sleigh drawn by a single horse, and killed. It is insisted that in such a case it is not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the decedent in the first instance, but that the burden to show that was upon the defendant, if it claimed that there was such negligence. But the sufficient answer to this theory is that, while there were allegations iii the complaint that snow had been carelessly and negligently piled <em>~by </em>the employ\u00e9s of the defendant in the highway at the railroad \u25a0crossing, \u201cmaking said crossing very dangerous, unsafe, and extraEazardous when dark, and being the immediate cause of the death of \u25a0said Jesse York, caused by the gross negligence of the defendant,\u201d and while there was proof in support of these allegations, the case was tried wholly and simply as one for negligence, and not as one for \u2022damages for maintaining a nuisance in the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">The complaint contains but a single cause of action. It alleges many acts of negligence on the part of the defendant other than piling snow in the highway, and is essentially and wholly one for damages for the alleged negligent killing of the decedent. The trial justice submitted the case to the jury as' one solely for negligence.. In his charge he said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-13\">\u201cBefore this plaintiff can recover, she must establish affirmatively to your satisfaction,' by a preponderance of evidence, two things: that there was no negligence upon the part of her husband that contributed to the- hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>pening of this accident; and, second, that it happened solely and entirely through the negligence of the defendant Both these propositions must concur. No matter how negligent the defendant was, she cannot recover if her husband was also negligent, and that negligence contributed to this unfortunate accident. I said she must establish it affirmatively. That means practically this: that the railroad company is not bound to prove anything. It is not bound to prove that it was not negligent; she must prove that it was. The railroad company is not bound to prove that York was negligent; she must prove that he was not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The court also stated the same principles in other language in other places in its charge. The learned counsel for the plaintiff did not in any way except to this charge, or request the court to charge on the theory that the action was one for damages for maintaining a nuisance, \u2022or to charge that it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove the absence of contributory negligence. The charge as made, therefore, became under the implied consent of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, by his not excepting thereto, the law of the case, and he cannot now be heard to say that the jury might have decided the case on the theory now insisted upon by him, for no such question was submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">It is also urged on behalf of the plaintiff that there was sufficient \u2022evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the decedent was free from contributory negligence. There was proof that he was driving his horse'slowly when he was approaching the crossing, but there was no evidence that he looked or listened as he approached the crossing, .and the court so charged. This being so, we think the learned trial justice properly set aside the verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and no reason \"has been shown why we should interfere with his discretion in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
