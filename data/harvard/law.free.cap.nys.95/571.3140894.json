The record of this prior recovery did not distinctly set forth the manner in which the plaintiff\u2019s claim to commissions was computed, but it was made to appear by extrinsic evidence that this same sale was involved, and that the commissions sued for necessarily depended upon some agreed percentage upon the selling value of the property. It was also shown that upon the trial of this former action the defendant conceded that the commissions due were $104.58, and the sole question then litigated was as to whether the plaintiff alone was entitled to these commissions or whether they had accrued to him jointly with another party. This prior action having been brought for commissions, the rate, under the agreement with the defendant, was directly involved as a necessary fact, upon which the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was to depend for its proper measure, and a judgment which fixed the amount of the commissions, and so the rate, became conclusive as an adjudication upon this term of the contract. The defendant\u2019s admission upon the trial of the earlier action that the commissions were in a stated sum simply took the place of proof as to what the agreed rate was, and, since the matter was in issue for the purposes of the recovery and was directly and necessarily involved in any judgment then rendered, the defendant is concluded by the judgment, whether based upon proof of the essential propositions of fact or upon the admission of these propositions which took the place of the proof..</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">This is not a case where the matter sought to be concluded by an \u25a0 adjudication was withdrawn from the earlier trial, or where the adjudication related to matter not involved in the pleadings but facts litigated by consent. A common matter of fact was involved in the pleadings as the basis of the earlier action and of the litigation now before the court, to wit, the rate of commissions upon the sale of this very property; and, the subject-matter having .been clearly identified, the earlier judgment was necessarily conclusive. Having thus determined the fact of the conclusive effect of this judgment upon the evidence before him, the justice committed no error in concluding any issue as to-the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s agency against the defendant, since whatever meaning there might be in the term \u201cgeneral agent,\u201d as distinguished' from \"special agent,\u201d in accordance with the proof offered by the defendant, the sole matter of cogency was the rate of commissions to which the plaintiff was entitled, and as to this the defendant was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
