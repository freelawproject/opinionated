Oppenheimer &amp; Co. and transferred to it for value. Complaint was dismissed upon the grounds that it was not shown that plaintiff had an office for the transaction of business in the city of New York, nor that the certificate required by section 31 of the banldng law (Laws 1892, p. 1861, c. 689) had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">In Citizens\u2019 Bank v. Cowles, 89 App. Div. 281, 86 N. Y. Supp. 38, it was directly held \u201cthat the mere bringing of an action to recover a sum of money upon a negotiable instrument is not doing business within this state\u201d; and, although this case was reversed upon another point in the Court of Appeals, the court did not disapprove the proposition above cited. 180 N. Y. 346, 73 N. E. 33. Section 1779, Code Civ. Proc., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-21\">\u201cAn action may be maintained by a foreign corporation in like manner and subject to the same regulations as where the action is brought by a domestic corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">The extension of jurisdiction to actions against foreign corporations having an-office in the city of New York, conferred by section 1 of subdivision 18 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1489, c. 580), cannot well be twisted into a limitation of former rights, but confers additional power. It does not limit, alter, or affect former jurisdiction, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>cept to the extent expressly enacted. Parmele v. Haas, 67 App. Div. 457, 73 N. Y. Supp. 986, was reversed by the Court of Appeals (171 N. Y. 579, 64 N. E. 440) upon the very point upon which it is cited to sustain the judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
