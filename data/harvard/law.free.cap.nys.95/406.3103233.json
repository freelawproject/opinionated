It is true, of course, fhat the issues of fact were formally submitted to the jury for determination, but the trial is so full of matter which could not fail to prejudice the defendant\u2019s case that within well-known authorities the verdict should be set aside and the defendant be granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">The defendant is a corporation, and, after advertising for bids for the construction of a stable, its board of directors at a meeting adopted a resolution directing its executive committee to enter into a contract at its discretion with the plaintiff for the construction of the building. There is no evidence that the executive committee ever met, or that all of the members acted in the <em>premises; </em>but there is evidence from which the jury might find that some of the members of the executive committee, who constituted the officers of the defendant, conveyed to the plaintiff the information that his bid had been accepted and directed him to commence the work. After the plaintiff had been at work for some days, one of the officers of the defendant urged him to hurry up the work, and an increased force of men was engaged; and these facts, in connection with others that appear in the case, might justify the jury in reaching the conclusion that there was a verbal contract for the construction of this stable. But the difficulty is that the learned court, in the course of a running discussion with counsel for the defense, insisted on assuming that there was a verbal contract and in treating the case as though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>it had no merit. The following is a sample of the various colloquies which took place during the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cThe Court: The recovery is to be had, if at all, upon an oral contract. Do you understand that? Why are you troubling yourself about a written contract? There was not any written contract. There was never any signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: If your honor will let me state why\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cThe Court: You have said it again and again, and I do not see anything in it. I do not think you have any reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: We except to your honor\u2019s remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, except to that. You are doing nothing else. You are going outside. You have wasted an hour in rambling about outside of what I have told you distinctly that I limit the case to. What has this to do with the case anyway; can you tell me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">\u201cThe Court: Well, tell me now, and once for all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: By the by-laws and resolution of the board of directors they restricted the authority. In the first place, the president had no right to bind the brewery by a contract of this kind, by the by-laws and by the resolution. In the second place, the directors, recognizing that, have restricted these particular officers to the making of a certain contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that contract was verbally made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-15\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: Well, we say it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">\u201cThe Court: Well, but tell me why you are disturbing yourself about the written contract, when I tell\u2014 You know that I .am going to direct the jury to find that there never was a written contract at all. You have not given me any reason that is sufficient for a rational mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-17\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I can\u2019t prove my case until I get to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-18\">\u201cThe Court: You are not proving your case. You are not proving anything that has anything to do with the case. You have not proved the case. You came in to try the case without ever having read the pleadings. You came in and made a point at the outset that the issues were definitely made upon the existence of a written contract, and the moment I read the papers I find it is no such thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-19\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I except to your honor\u2019s remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-20\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you may except.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-21\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I read the pleadings, and I consulted with my clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-22\">\u201cThe Court: You have not prepared the case. You came in here without knowing what you were to try. That is perfectly apparent. Now, you are wasting my time and the time of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">What chance has counsel of getting respectful attention from the jury, when the court in effect tells them that he is there without preparation, and that he is deliberately seeking to deceive? Generally speaking, counsel has a right to present his theory of the case, or at least to offer to present it, without being accused of duplicity, ignorance, or bad faith; and where the trial court transgresses this right of counsel, invading as it does the rights of litigants, it is the duty of appellate courts, in the interests of the orderly administration of justice, to reverse the verdict and send the case back for a new trial; and this should be the disposition of the case now before us. See Swan v. Keough, 35 App. Div. 80, 54 N. Y. Supp. 474; Beers v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 88 App. Div. 9, 84 N. Y. Supp. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-24\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
