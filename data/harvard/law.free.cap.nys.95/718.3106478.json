Assuming that the respondent is correct in his contention that this alleged act of the directors of the Elmira Bank was ultra vires, the mere fact that the directors joined with the defendant Bush as wrongdoers, and thus assumed liability with him for the wrongful act in misappropriating the funds of the bank, could not in any way make the transaction a valid one or affect the bank. Still the defendants have pleaded these facts as a defense. Striking them out on motion is in substance determining the validity of such a defense, and that I do not think was proper upon motion. If the defense as a whole is not sufficient, the plaintiff can raise that question by demurrer or upon the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">Section 545 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorizing the court to strike out irrelevant and redundant matter, applies to allegations which are irrelevant or redundant to the cause of action, or to a defense pleaded. Without expressing any opinion upon the .validity of this defense as pleaded, I think the proper way to present the question as to its sufficiency is either by demurrer or upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
