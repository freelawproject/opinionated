If mutilated when it was given him, this ticket would have sufficed, and the defendant could not properly have refused it; but there was evidence to the contrary, and we cannot say that the justice should have given the better credit to the interested testimony of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
