The defendant agreed to convey the absolute fee, subject, however, to'that mortgage. When the time came to close the sale, the plaintiff, refused to perform because of a certain restriction upon building which was found to exist in the conveyances to the defendant. At the solicitation of the defendant, however, he agreed to t\u00e1ke title and pay the purchase price, on the defendant\u2019s promise to obtain an extension in the time of. payment of the mortgage. That promise was reduced to writing in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-19\">\u201cAs part of the consideration for closing title to premises 847 Gates Ave., \u25a0Bor. of Bklyn, I agree to obtain; for' Simon Hoch an extension of' the first mortgage of $3.000 on said premises for three years and to forward such extension to said Hoch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-20\">\u201cDated March 1st, 1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-21\">C.' G. Braxmar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The complaint is for damages because of the defendant\u2019s breach of the contract. Proof of the facts just recited was offered, and it was established that because of defendant\u2019s failure to obtain the extension the plaintiff was compelled to and did obtain another mortgage, with whose proceeds he paid off and discharged the mortgage of $3,000 mentioned in the agreement, and that the reasonable cost and expense thereof was $53.87. At the conclusion of this proof, the complaint was dismissed, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The judgment must be reversed. The agreement to obtain an extension of the $3,000 mortgage was valid,' and supported by abundant consideration. The measure of damages the plaintiff contended for was proper. It must have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of making the contract that if the defendant failed to procure the extension of the mortgage, and the plaintiff could not then pay it without obtaining another loan in its place, he would be put to the expense incident to obtaining the money on another mortgage. The expense of searching and passing upon the title, of drawing the bond and mortgage and satisfaction, and of recording instruments incident to the transaction, flowed directly from and were made necessary by the breach of defendant\u2019s, contract. .</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All.concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
