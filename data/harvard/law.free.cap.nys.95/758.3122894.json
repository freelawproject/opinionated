The venue was laid in the county of New York. Before answering, the defendant Randall demanded, in compliance with section 986 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the place of trial be changed from the county of New York to the county of Suffolk, the proper county. The demand not being complied with, he thereupon made a motion that the place of trial be changed in accordance with his demand. The mortgagor, one Warden, was a codefendant; but he had not at that time appeared in the action, nor had his time to do so expired. The motion was denied, on the ground that Warden should have had notice, and Randall has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">I think the motion should have been granted. An action affecting an estate, right, title, lien, or other interest in real property must be tried in the county where the real property is situate. Section 982, Code Civ. Proc. The mortgage sought to be annulled was a lien on real property situate in the county of Suffolk. The defendant appearing and contesting had the right, under the law, to have the place of trial changed to that county. Such change of venue being a matter of absolute right in Randall, whose mortgage was sought to be annulled, it was the duty of the court to have granted the motion, notwithstanding there was another defendant who had had no notice of the application. The other defendant had not appeared in the action, so as to be entitled, in strict right, to notice of the motion. If he had been served with notice, appeared, and opposed the. motion, he could have done nothing to have prevented the order changing the place of trial, because the court had no discretion, and should have granted it as. a matter of course upon the demand of any defendant whose rights were sought to be affected. Such seems to be the effect of section 986 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the defendant\u2019s attorney may serve, before answer, a demand that the venue be changed to the proper county, giving the plaintiff\u2019s attorney o days to comply therewith, and, if such consent be not given within that time, the defendant may, within 10 days thereafter, make his motion to change the place of trial. Manifestly all this may be done within the 20 days allowed for answer and before all codefendants have appeared, or even been served with process. Hence it seems plain that service of a notice upon a codefendant is not contemplated, nor a necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">PATTERSON, INGRAHAM, and RAUGHRIN, JJ., concur. O\u2019BRIEN, P. J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
