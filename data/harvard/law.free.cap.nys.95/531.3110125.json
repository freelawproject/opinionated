If there was, technically, a condition of living apart, the proof discloses the wife\u2019s continued right to support, and justifies the plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon her agency, since the circumstances were such as to permit the finding that she did not so act as to forfeit her claim to maintenance. If the parties were still to be viewed as living together, then the - wife\u2019s agency to procure, upon her husband\u2019s credit, necessaries which he had omitted to provide, was not open to question. Wanamaker v. Weaver, 176 N. Y. 75, 68 N. E. 135, 65 L. R. A. 529, 98 Am. St. Rep. 621; Grandy v. Hadcock, 85 App. Div. 173, 83 N. Y. Supp. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">The plaintiff was not shown to have had any actual notice of the defendant\u2019s unwillingness to extend his credit (Ogle v. Dershem, 67 App. Div. 221, 73 N. Y. Supp. 592), and his liability could not be- affected by the publishing of a general notice, not brought to plaintiff\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
