Plaintiff is the widow of Charles T. Polhemus, a brother of the defendant, who died October 10, 1900, leaving plaintiff 469% shares of the stock of the company, which she held at the time the action was brought. The defendants on April 28, 1898, were all the stockholders and directors of the company, and on that day at a regular meeting of the board of directors it was resolved that the John Polhemus Printing Company should purchase from Horace G. Polhemus the pressroom plant known as the \u201cExcelsior Press\u201d for the sum of \u00a716,000, as per the inventory annexed to the resolution, and that the purchase price should be covered by the issuance of interest-bearing notes covering a period of 16 months. This resolution was adopted, and later plaintiff sued to compel the vacation of such contract and to recover amounts paid thereunder for the benefit of the corporation; but the complaint did not allege that plaintiff before bringing the action in her own name made demand of the directors that they bring the suit in the name of the company for a rescission of the purchase, and that the directors had refused or unreasonably delayed to bring such suit.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b362-5\">See 88 N.

Brooklyn City Railway Co., 9 App. Div. 269, 41 N. Y. Supp. 566, affirmed 158 N. Y. 493, 53 N. E. 520; Fitchett v. Murphy, 46 App. Div. 181, 61 N. Y. Supp. 182, and Greaves v. Gouge, 69 N. Y. 154, this action was prematurely brought. There is no allegation in the complaint, and no proof was made upon the trial, that the plaintiff applied to the corporation to commence the action, or that it had refused to prosecute or unreasonably delayed the commencement of the action. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
