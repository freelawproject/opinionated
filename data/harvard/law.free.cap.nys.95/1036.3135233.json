The issues were tried at Special Term, and upon the decision made an interlocutory judgment was entered, first, reforming the contract; second, directing a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendant Rossiter for the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>$13,000, together with interest; third, directing the defendants to forthwith transfer to the plaintiffs $25,000 of the stock of the defendant 'company and a like amount of bonds of said company; fourth, directing the defendant Rossiter to account to the plaintiffs for two-thirds of the profits of the construction work referred to in the contract, on which the action is based, and directing how certain items shall be charged on the accounting, and appointing a referee to take and state the account, and reserving all questions as to interest and extra allowance until final judgment, with leave to either party to apply for. such further order or judgment as they may be advised. Section 1200 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that judgments are either interlocutory or final, and defines a final judgment as the final determination of the rights of the parties in the action. This judgment expressly recites that it is interlocutory, provides for an accounting and for a final judgment thereafter. There can be no doubt, therefore, but that it is an interlocutory judgment. Cambridge Valley Nat. Bank v. Lynch, 76 N. Y. 514; King v. Barnes, 107 N. Y. 645, 13 N. E. 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The learned counsel for the respondent proceeded upon the theory that since the interlocutory judgment, in so far as it determines that the appellant is liable to the plaintiff in a specified amount, is not enforceable by execution, not being a final judgment, it must be enforceable by contempt proceedings. This would be a startling proposition in any case, but becomes astounding when presented in a case where the recovery is for money due under a contract. The liability, of course, is not enforceable at present by execution, but the terms of the interlocutory judgment should be inserted in the final judgment, and then this liability may be docketed, and will become a lien, and may be enforced by execution. Myers v. Becker, 95 N. Y. 486. This is unlike a case where money is directed to be paid into court\u2014a provision which could not be enforced by execution\u2014or where restitution to the court is ordered of money paid out of court; and it is the ordinary case of a judgment directing the payment of money to a party which can only be enforced by execution. See General Elec. Co. v. Sire, 88 App. Div. 502, 85 N. Y. Supp. 141; subdivision 3, \u00a7 14, and subdivisions 3, 4, \u00a7 1241, Code Civ. Proc.; Kittle v. Steuve, 11 Misc. Rep. 280, 32 N. Y. Supp. 272; Geery v. Geery, 63 N. Y. 252; Devlin v. Hinman, 41 App. Div. 632, 59 N. Y. Supp. 1102, affirmed 161 N. Y. 115, 55 N. E. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
