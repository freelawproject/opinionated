Evidence to this effect was stricken out \u201cas a conclusion.\u201d There was no suggestion that the matter was not one as to which the witness spoke from knowledge, and certainly the evidence was directed to a simple fact, as distinguished from a conclusion. The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, upon the facts, was by no means obvious, and the exclusion of this evidence may well have prejudiced the defendant upon a very material issue, since the evidence unquestionably supported the defendant\u2019s claim that the agreement included a condition that the guests should be satisfied with the plaintiff\u2019s cooking.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
