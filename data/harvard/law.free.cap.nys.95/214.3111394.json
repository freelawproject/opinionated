Y., to and over the lands of the defendant Allen Bros. Company (hereinafter called the defendant), and to and over the lands of the plaintiff; and the plaintiff seeks to enjoin the defendant from taking any water from said raoeway or flume, in excess of an amount that can be taken through orifices in said raceway or flume, aggregating 270 and 350 square inches, respectively. The judgment provides that the defendant \u201chas \u2022 the right, prior to any right of the plaintiff, to draw from the said flume, at its present width and depth and use, as hereinabove declared, 620/i8i6, or nearly one-third, of the flow of water in said flume at a depth of water therein of nine feet at least, before lowering by discharge or use, but at such less depth as such discharge or use may cause, except that the plaintiff has concurrent right to draw and use therefrom 120/i9ib of the entire flow under the like head of nine feet before lowering by discharge or use, but next after the defendant Allen Bros. Company\u2019s right to use 2T0/e20 of its portion.\u201d The judgment also provides in substance that the plaintiff is entitled to the balance of the water from said flume.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b251-6\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Y. They extend a distance of about 1,000 feet, and in such distance the fall is about 60 feet. The Hudson river at that point is the line between the counties of Washington and Saratoga, and the lands and flume in question are in Washington county. In 1843 Perry &amp; Harvey were the owners of the real property adjoining said river at Baker\u2019s Falls in Washington county, and for a short distance north and south of the same, together with such water rights as were appurtenant to the ownership of such real property. The lands so owned by Perry &amp; Harvey included all of the lands now owned by the defendant and all of the lands owned by the plaintiff which are shown in the diagram herewith. At that time there was an old mill on lot 5, and a flume extended from a wing dam a little north of the crest of the falls to such old mill; but the mill and flume were not in use, and were in a dilapidated condition. There is now a dam across said river, commencing on the east side where said old wing dam was formerly situated, and it extends in a northwesterly direction to the Saratoga county side of the river. The plaintiff is the owner of the flume and the land on which the same is built, from said dam southerly about 130 feet. Over the river side of that part of said flume is a spillway. From the southerly end of said spillway the defendant owns the lands along the river southerly about 287 feet, and adjoining the defendant\u2019s lands on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>south the plaintiff owns the lands along the river southerly to a point below the southerly end\"of the flume as now erected. The following diagram shows, generally, the dam and flume. Defendant\u2019s lands along the river are divided into four parts, designated 3, 4, 5, and 6. The defendant also owns lot 1. The plaintiff, among other lots, owns lot 2 (flume with spillway), and lots 7 to 15, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The lands adjoining said flume below the spillway are now practically covered with expensive mills, and substantial rights by both the plaintiff and the defendant in said flume and the water therein are not only important for them, but absolutely essential to the value and maintenance of their plants, respectively. The title by grant of the parties, respectively, to said lands and water rights, came from Perry &amp; Harvey, and it is assumed that whatever rights in said flume and in the water therein that are

It is further mutually agreed that said Miller shall have the benefit of the expense of building said raceway in accounting with other parties in interest in the same manner and to the same extent as though he had built the same himself and at his own expense. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">This deed is also made subject to the conditions and limitations contained in certain previous deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">One other deed conveys said lot 6 as shown oti the diagram, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ject to rights of other persons named in said deed, and it includes certain further rights, and is made subject to certain liabilities, which are stated therein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cAnd also excepting and reserving to the parties of the first part, their heirs and assigns, the right to draw water through and to use the raceway across the premises hereby conveyed, together with the right to enter upon and through said raceway for the purpose of repairing same and of removing any obstructions to the free and natural flow of the water through said raceway, and the right to widen said raceway, if necessary, on the easterly side only; provided, however, that if it be widened to a width of more than 30 feet all damages incurred by the parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns, by reason .of said widening to a greater width than 30 feet, shall be paid by the party or parties so widening same. * * * In consideration of the foregoing the said Hiram Allen and Loren Allen, the parties of the second part hereto, hereby on their part covenant and agree to and with the parties of the first part: * * * Second. That they will use no water from the raceway by virtue of their present rights upon the premises hereinbefore conveyed under a greater head than thirty-one feet for its first use, and that they will not use said water upon the premises heretofore owned by them under a greater head than thirty-two feet for the first use of the 270 inches of water first acquired by them and thirty-one feet for the first use of the 350 inches of water purchased by them of S. A. Parks, all measurements of head to be made from the level of water in the raceway when said raceway is full. And in consideration of the foregoing it is hereby mutually covenanted and agreed by and between the parties hereto that, while the first use of the 270 inches of water first acquired by the parties of the second part is herein limited to thirty-two feet, said limitation shall not be construed as a permission to use the same under any greater head than the said parties of the second part have heretofore had the right to use the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Lots 7 to 15, inclusive, now owned by the plaintiff, were sold by Perry &amp; Harvey and their successors in interest many years ago. In the conveyance of each of said lots are specific covenants in regard to said flume. With the conveyance of one of said lots of land there was conveyed \u201cone-eighth part of one-half of the waters of said river naturally flowing in the channel thereof, and over and across the land so to be divided as aforesaid, being one-eighth part of the waters of said river formerly owned by said Perry &amp; Harvey.\u201d With the conveyance of another of said lots of land there was conveyed the right to take 350 inches of water at 18-foot head, with another lot of land 300 inches of water at 30-foot head, with other lots of land 500 inches of water at 32-foot head, and with another lot of land 25 inches of water at 32-foot head; and each grantor assumed a proportion of the expense of repairing and enlarging the raceway, bulkhead, and dam. When lot 15 was sold no right was reserved in the conveyance to continue the flume over that lot for the benefit of the lands adjoining it on the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">It appears from the record that the flume over the lands of the defendant and over the lands of the plaintiff south of the defendant\u2019s land is east of the waters of the river and wholly within the boundaries of the lots through which it is erected. The rights of the owners of the several lots of land to have the flume maintained so as to convey the water to their lots of land, respectively, and the rights of said owners in and to said flume and the waters thereof, is dependent upon the conveyances and agreements relating thereto. The rights of the owners of the several lots of land in said flume and the water therein ate easements. Such rights reserved by Perry &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Harvey and their successors in interest were not untransferable personal agreements or rights merely, but easements and rights inseparably connected with the ownership of the fee of the land. 14 Cyc. 1140-1184. When the fee of all of the lots of land was sold, there were no rights remaining in Perry &amp; Harvey and their successors in interest in any way subject to conveyance. The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the conveyance of a specific number of inches of water from time to time always left a residue of water unsold for the benefit of the remaining lots of land has nothing on which to stand, when it appears that all of the lots of land over which the flume is built were sold without conveying any such claimed residue of water. The right to take water from said flume is dependent upon the ownership of a dominant estate. Although the amount of water in such flume is several times more than is represented by the flow from orifices aggregating the number of square inches specifically conveyed, yet the trial court has found in substance that it was the intention of the grantors by the several conveyances to sell to the persons to whom a specific number of inches of water was conveyed all of the water flowing or which might thereafter flow through such flume. The number of inches of water conveyed by the several conveyances of lots of land south of the lands of the defendant is 1,175 inches. Adding to such amount the number of inches of water conveyed with the lots of land now owned by the defendant, being 620 inches, the aggregate amount is 1,795 inches. There is a specific conveyance of one-half of one-eighth of the water in one of said deeds to the plaintiff\u2019s grantors. Treating the 1,795.inches as fifteen-sixteenths of the whole amount of water in said flume, said one-half of one-eighth of the water of said flume is represented by 120 inches, making the total of the specific grants of water represented by 1,915 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">The trial court has found in substance that on November 2, 1882, the grantors of the defendant had for more than 20 years been openly drawing and using under the grant to them of said lot 5 a quantity of water largely in excess of 270 square inches, supposing such quantity to. be approximately 270 square inches, being the same quantity which was in use upon said lot February 12, 1862, when they took title thereto; and it is adjudged that the water used was equivalent to 27%oib of the present flow of water in the raceway at nine feet depth of water without lowering by discharge; and it is also adjudged that such use of water is approximately within the true measure of 270 inches, and that its use was never challenged by the parties interested therein. The trial court has also found that said grantors, on November 2, 1882, and since about April 1, 1865, had been using, under the deed to them of said lot 6, a quantity of water largely in excess of 350 square inches, supposing such quantity to be approximately 350 square inches; and it is adjudged that the water used was equivalent to SB0/i9is of the present flow in said raceway at nine feet depth of water therein without lowering by discharge. And the trial court further finds that for more than 20 years before the commencement of this action the defendant and its grantors have openly and under a claim of right, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>without challenge of the right so to do until about the time of the commencement of this action, used 62%9i6, or nearly one-third of the flow of water in said flume, measured as in said findings stated; and it further finds and adjudges that the defendant, relying upon such measure of the 620 inches as so* practically adopted and long acquiesced in by the plaintiff and its grantors, has expended a large amount of money on its said property. If a right to flow water through said flume can be said to be an easement appurtenant to-lot 2 or the dam, and that such easement has been conveyed to the plaintiff by conveyances other than those conveying lots 7 to 15,. inclusive, it should not affect the result in this case if the trial court was right in its said findings as to the practical construction of the deeds to the grantors of the parties, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">As between the parties to' this action, through whose lands the flume is erected, and who seem to hold their rights in the water therein by grant of a specific number of inches (except as to such one-half of one-eighth), a division of the water in the proportion which each holds such specific grants of water is equitable. And as the use by the defendant and its predecessors in title for a long period of years of approximately 820/i9is of the water in said flume, and the payment by it and its predecessors in title during said years of 62\u00b0/191 s and more of the expense of maintaining said flume, bulkhead, and dam is substantially undisputed, we cannot say that the trial court was in error in holding that the defendant is entitled to continue the use of 820/i9i5 of the water of said flume as stated in the judgment. And the court could have further found that the defendant, by its use of such proportion of the water of the flume for so long a period of time under the conditions and claims shown by the record, acquired by prescription a right so to- use the same. The practice in equity is to give relief adapted to the situation at the time of the decree. Peck v. Goodberlett, 109 N. Y. 180, 16 N. E. 350; Van Allen v. New York E. R. R. Co., 144 N. Y. 174, 38 N. E. 997; 16 Cyc. 479. The order which refused to modify the judgment so as to make it speak as of the time of the commencement of the action is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, and the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur, except SMITH and HOUGHTON, JJ., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
