If the rule applied in McMann v. Brown, 92 App. Div. 249, 87 N. Y. Supp. 38, is to have any effect, the papers before us require its application. No better excuse for the neglect to proceed is furnished here than was present there, since the assertion of \u201cinadvertence\u201d is not given any added value through the averment of one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys that he did not know of the fact that the case was not on the calendar. At best this simply suggests that there was more than one inadvertent mind, but nothing is alleged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>excuse the omission in either instance. The rule which calls for some reasonable excuse to avoid a dismissal for neglect to proceed is a salutary one, and there was no error in its application by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Orders severally affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
