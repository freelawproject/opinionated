At the commencement of this action the plaintiff filed a notice of the pendency of action, which described the defendants\u2019 property as being the premises affected by the action, whereupon the defendants moved to vacate that notice of pendency of action upon the ground that the judgment asked for did not and could not affect the defendants\u2019 property. This motion was denied, and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The notice of pendency of action was filed under section 1670 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">\u201cIn an action brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to, or the possession, use or enjoyment o\u00a3, real property, the plaintiff may, when he filed his complaint, or at any time afterwards before final judgment, file in the clerk\u2019s office of each county where the property is situated, a notice of the pendency of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">If this action was not to recover a judgment affecting the title to, or possession, use, or enjoyment of, the real property described in the notice of the pendency of the action, the plaintiff was not authorized by the section of the Code to file the notice, and the court should have ordered it canceled. The judgment that the complaint demands is in the nature of a mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to remove a brick wall that encroaches upon the plaintiff\u2019s property. The judgment, if one is obtained as prayed for in the complaint, could be enforced by proceedings for a contempt. The title of the defendants to the property described in the notice is not questioned. The plaintiff makes no claim to said property, nor does he claim to be entitled to its possession, use, or enjoyment. What he objects to is that the defendants are using plaintiff\u2019s property, which they have no right to use, and which he asks that the defendants be restrained from doing. There is, therefore, nothing in any judgment that can be entered in this action which could in any way affect the title of the defendants to the property, or their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>right to its possession, use, or enjoyment. The plaintiff was not, therefore, entitled to file a notice that the action affected the defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">These views are in accordance with the decision of this court in Moeller v. Wolkenberg, 67 App. Div. 487, 73 N. Y. Supp. 890; for it was held in that case that the interest which the plaintiff asserted in the defendant\u2019s property was of a nature which would limit the use and prevent the enjoyment thereof in the manner in which the defendant has used or is attempting to use and enjoy it, and that the court had no power to cancel the notice. In Ackerman v. True, 44 App. Div. 106, 60 N. Y. Supp. 608, which was an action brought for an injunction and to recover damages claimed to be caused by the defendant\u2019s encroachment upon the street adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s property, we held that the defendant\u2019s land was in no wise affected by the suit, and that the motion to cancel the notice of pendency of action should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">I think the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">O\u2019BRIEN, P. J., and PATTERSON and McEAUGHEIN, JJ., concur. LAUGHEIN, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
