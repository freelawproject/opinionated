Yellow Pine Co. v. Barker, 23 App. Div. 524, 48 N. Y. Supp. 553, affirmed 155 N. Y. 665, 49 N. E. 1103, are authority for the proposition that the credits or bills receivable of the relator are taxable as capital invested in business in this state, within the meaning of section 7 of the tax law (Laws 1896, p. 800, c. 908). I fail to see how' these credits become less taxable because they are the proceeds of sales made of imported goods in original packages. This is not a tax on imports, and thus does not contravene article 1, \u00a7 10, of the federal Constitution. It is not a tax on the sales as such, or on the right to sell goods in the importer\u2019s hands while in their original packages; but when these packages have been sold, and the proceeds have become part of the assets of a person doing business in this state, as in the case of this relator (People ex rel. Philip Carey Co. v. Feitner, 39 Mise. Rep. 282, 79 N. Y. Supp. 485; People ex rel. Durand-Ruel v. Wells, 41 Mise. Rep. 144, 83 N. Y. Supp. 936, affirmed 87 N. Y. Supp. 1144; People ex rel. Armstrong Cork Co. v. Barker, 157 N. Y. 159, 51 N. E. 1043), I think the property must be regarded as having lost its distinctive character as an import, and mixed with the mass of relator\u2019s property. See Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat 419, 6 L.
