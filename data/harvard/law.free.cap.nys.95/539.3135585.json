The husband and wife in this case had not lived together for some 11 years, and the fact of this actual separation cast the burden upon the plaintiff of showing that the wife\u2019s act in living apart was justified; for the fact negatived a presumption of the wife\u2019s agency. Bloomingdale v. Brinkerhoff, 20 N. Y. Supp. 858; Constable v. Rosener, 82 App. Div. 155, 81 N. Y. Supp. 376; Id. 178 N. Y. 587, 70 N. E. 1097. The case of Hatch v. Leonard, 165 N. Y. 435, 59 N. E. 370, cited for the respondent, states no different rule. There the question was, not what the plaintiff was bound to prove, but whether, under the pleadings, he should not have been allowed to give his proof, and nothing else was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">The record before us contains no evidence in explanation of the circumstances under which the separation occurred, and there is, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>no support for the judgment. Again, the assumed wife had concededly obtained a decree of divorce in an action brought by her against this defendant in the year 1897. This decree fixed her status, and she could not assert the contrary, notwithstanding that the defendant might have been in a position to assail the decree for lack of jurisdiction as to him. Starbuck v. Starbuck, 173 N. Y. 503, 66 N. E. 193, 93 Am. St. Rep. 631 ; In re Swales, 60 App. Div. 599, 70 N. Y. Supp. 220. To meet this difficulty, the plaintiff offered in evidence a decree of the same court (the district court of the territory of Oklahoma), made seven years later, setting aside the decree of divorce upon the wife\u2019s application and upon the defendant\u2019s default. The record of this degree contains no recital tending to show that the court ever obtained jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, through service of process, within the rules settled by authority (In re Swales, supra, and cases cited at page 601 of 60 App. Div., page 221 of 70 N. Y. Supp.); and the proceedings were of no effect, as against him, nor was the decree available as an adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">At best, the papers thus offered established the fact that the one-time wife had asserted elsewhere that which she would not be permitted to assert for her own benefit before a court of this state\u2014that the decree of divorce which she had obtained was invalid; but the foreign court\u2019s ex parte acquiescence in her assertion did not alter the fact that her status had been fixed by the decree of divorce, as far as this defendant was concerned, and she could not re-establish herself as his wife, except upon proof of some adjudication binding upon him. If admissible for any purpose, the later decree referred to did not afford any evidence that the one-time marital relations of these persons still existed, where, concededly, the wife had once caused them to be severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
