The recital in the order is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-18\">\u201cAnd it also appearing that said judgment debtor is a resident of the state of Massachusetts, and that she is at this time within the said state of Massachusetts, notice for the application of this order is dispensed with pursuant to the provisions of the Code of Oivil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">It is unnecessary to consider whether the proof was sufficient to establish the fact required, because it is clear that the recital in this order is not a substantial compliance with the requirements of the statute. It does not necessarily follow, from the mere fact that the judgment debtor resided in the state of Massachusetts and was then within said state, that she could not with reasonable diligence be served within the state of New York. Kennedy v. Lamb, 182 N. Y. 228, 74 N. E. 834. It may have been possible to find her within the state of New York within 24 hours after the making of the order, and there is no statement contained in this order to indicate that the judge granting it was satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tied that the judgment debtor could not with reasonable diligence be found within the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">For this reason the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
