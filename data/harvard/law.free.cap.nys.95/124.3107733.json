Matter of Rutledge, 162 N. Y. 31, 56 N. E. 511, 47 L. R. A. 721. The exercise of this discretion is reviewable by the Appellate Division. In the case at bar the administratrix has been guilty of long-continued misconduct, as has been explicitly declared, not only by the Appellate Division, but by the Court of Appeals. Matter of Gall, 47 App. Div. 490, 62 N. Y. Supp. 420; Id., 182 N. Y. 270, 74 N. E. 875. It is not necessary again to rehearse the circumstances of her maladministration, but it is enough to say that we think her action has been such as ought to deprive her of all commissions and costs in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should therefore be reversed, so far as the commissions and costs are concerned, and the amounts awarded on account of these items should be stricken therefrom, with the costs and disbursements of this appeal to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
