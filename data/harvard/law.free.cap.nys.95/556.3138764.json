Proc. \u00a7 338, subd. 4), and thus an order which may be served in any part of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>state, when made by a justice of the City Court. In view of the unqualified statement in the statute that supplementary proceedings are special proceedings (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3433), taken in connection with the expressed statutory distinction between special proceedings and actions (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 3333, 3334), it would seem difficult to escape the conclusion that, within the meaning and intent of the Code, an order in supplementary proceedings is not an order in an action, and that there cannot be a \u201cspecial proceeding in an action\u201d\u2014a term sometimes applied to supplementary proceedings. In the case of Graves v. Scoville, 12 Civ. Proc. R. 165, however, the meaning of the words \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d as applied to supplementary proceedings by section .3433 of the Code, was directly involved; and the conclusion there reached that these were not special proceedings, within the statute, has received the sanction of the Court of Appeals, this being the necessary result of the affirmance of the order in that case. Graves v. Scovil, 103 N. Y. 676. Therefore we cannot view the question as one open to independent discussion, and must hold that the court below had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">It results that the order denying the motion to punish for contempt, on the ground of lack of power, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the matter remitted to the court below for further proceedings. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
