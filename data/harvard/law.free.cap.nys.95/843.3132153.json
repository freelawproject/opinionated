To adopt the contention of the appellant would be to hold that a large body of independent voters, entertaining the same political views, appearing by this record to be acting in harmony, and desiring to nominate a complete ticket of candidates favorable to those views, to be voted for at the approaching election, must have their candidate for Supreme Court Justice under one title and \u2022emblem on the official ballot, their candidates for mayor, comptroller, and president of the board of aldermen under another title and a different emblem, and each of their candidates for the assembly under a title and emblem of his own. We do not think that the language of the statute justifies or requires an interpretation which would lead to such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">It follows that the order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
