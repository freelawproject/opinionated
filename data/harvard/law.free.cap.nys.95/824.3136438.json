S. Hess &amp; Co. for labor furnished as per a certain contract existing between said D. S. Hess &amp; Co. and Samuel Walsh for work and material to be furnished in the building cor. of 63rd street and Central Park West, known as the Ethical Culture Building, and that your indebtedness per said contract will be payable to the said Acme Security Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">\u201c[Signed] Acme Security Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">\u201cPer K. G. Nevin, Secty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">\u201cAbove O. K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">\u201c[Signed] Sam Walsh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">It also appears that the claim in suit was subsequently, but not until after the commencement of this action, reassigned to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"AqM5\">We are not called upon to consider the relations existing between the plaintiff and the Acme Security Company. The claim in suit was properly assigned to the company, and notice thereof was given to the defendants, and their failure to pay any one other than the assignee of the claim was excusable, and yet, because of. their refusal to do so, they are charged with the costs of this action. The judgment must be reversed, upon the ground that at the time of the commencement of the suit no cause of action existed in favor of the plaintiff, and the reassignment did not have the retroactive effect of creating one. Ervin v. Oregon Railway &amp; Nav. Co., 28 Hun, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">The judgment of the County Court of Queens county must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
