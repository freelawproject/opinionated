Fellows, late of the city of New York, deceased.\u201d The purpose of the amendment is to change the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>from one against the defendants representatively to one against them individually. The power of the court to grant such an amendment is fully sustained by Tighe v. Pope, 16 Hun, 180, and Boyd v. U. S. Mortg. &amp; Trust Co., 84 App. Div. 466, 82 N. Y. Supp. 1001, and 94 App. Div. 413, 88 N. Y. Supp. 289, the latter case being in this court. We held there that the fact that the statute of limitations might run as a defense to the defendants individually was not to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">It is admitted by the appellants that this case is analogous to the Boyd Case; but it is said that a distinction exists, which goes to the question of laches. In the Boyd Case the motion was made to amend by striking out the words \u201cas substituted trustees under the will,\u201d and such motion was made just before the case was reached for trial on the calendar of the court. In the present case, the plaintiff did nothing, the case was never put upon the calendar, and it was not until a year and a half after the defendants\u2019 answer was interposed that the plaintiff made the motion. The question of laches is not involved here. Neither party moved the case apparently, and the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney is in effect similar to that presented in the Bc^d Case. It had been held in Schwab v. Cleveland, 28 Hun, 458, that persons in charge of real estate in their representative capacity were liable in actions of negligence; but afterwards, in Keating v. Stevenson, 21 App. Div. 604, 47 N. Y. Supp. 847, it was held that trustees of an express' trust in real estate, charged with the duty of keeping premises in repair, are, by virtue of the legal title vested in them, liable personally, and not in their representative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The order, however, permitting the amendment, was made without costs. That was wrong, and costs should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The order should be modified by allowing the amendment, with costs of the action accrued to the time of the amendment, and requiring service of the complaint as amended on the defendants\u2019 attorney, and, as modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
