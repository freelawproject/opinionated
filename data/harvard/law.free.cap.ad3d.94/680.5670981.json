The plaintiff did not show good cause for failing to properly effect service of the summons and complaint on the defendants in the first place <em>(see </em>CPLR 306-b; <em>Khodeeva v Chi Chung Yip, </em>84 AD3d 1030, 1030-1031 [2011]; <em>Matter of Palmieri v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, </em>31 AD3d 647, 647-648 [2006], <em>cert denied </em>550 US 903 [2007]; <em>cf. McSorley v Spear, </em>50 AD3d 652 [2008]). In addition, the plaintiff did not establish that the interest of justice would be served by extending the time to effect proper service. \u201cThe interest of justice standard requires a careful judicial analysis of the factual setting of the case and a balancing of the competing interests presented by the parties\u201d <em>(Leader v Maroney, Ponzini &amp; Spencer, </em>97 NY2d 95, 105 [2001]; <em>see Colon v Bailey, </em>26 AD3d 454, 455-456 [2006]). Here, the plaintiffs failure, in particular, to make any attempt to demonstrate that her claim was meritorious warranted denial of her cross motion <em>(see Colon v Bailey, </em>26 AD3d at 456). Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Belen and Austin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
