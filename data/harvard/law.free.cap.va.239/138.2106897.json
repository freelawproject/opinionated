Specifically, we decide whether a worker injured in Virginia, covered by both acts but compensated under the federal act, can maintain a common-law negligence action against a party who is immune from such actions under the state act but not the federal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Joseph F. McBride, II, a painter employed by Caliper Support Services, Inc. (Caliper), was loaned to Virginia Coatings, Inc., which had subcontracted to paint pipes in a mechanical tunnel being constructed by Metric Constructors, Inc. (the general contractor). The general contractor had contracted with the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. (the owner) to construct the tunnel in the owner\u2019s shipyard adjacent to the James River. On July 16, 1985, while McBride was painting in the tunnel, he was struck and injured by a falling pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">McBride was compensated by Caliper under the federal act and later brought this common-law negligence action against the general contractor and the owner to recover damages for his personal injuries. Both defendants filed pleas asserting that the trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over them because McBride\u2019s coverage under the state act precluded his assertion of common-law remedies against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The parties stipulated that McBride was injured while working in an area subject to the concurrent application of both acts, and that his injury was compensable under either act. After considering the stipulations and hearing evidence, the trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional pleas and dismissed McBride\u2019s action. We granted this appeal to McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The parties agree that if the state act controls, the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-29, -31 and -40 preclude McBride from maintaining this action against the owner and the general contractor because they are considered McBride\u2019s statutory employers under the provisions of the state act. They also agree that if the federal act controls, its provisions permit this action against the owner and the general contractor because, under the circumstances of this case, they are not considered McBride\u2019s \u201cemployers\u201d under the federal act. Also, McBride recognizes the concurrent application of the federal and state acts to his compensation claim; however, he contends that the state act does not affect his common-law action for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">First, he asserts that neither defendant can claim the benefit of the state act\u2019s immunity provisions because he made no claim for compensation under the state act. McBride, however, overlooks the fact that state tort law governs negligence actions arising out of industrial accidents which occur in an area within the concurrent application of the federal act and a state compensation statute. <em>Victory Carriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Law, </em>404 U.S. 202, 211-12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(1971). Under Virginia tort law, it makes no difference that McBride made no claim under the state act. Code \u00a7 65.1-23 binds McBride to all provisions of the state act, regardless of whether he files a claim thereunder. Therefore, our consideration of the issues is governed by the same principles that apply in a case where compensation coverage is sought under the state act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cinnamon </em>v. <em>International Business Machines, Inc., </em>238 Va. 471, 474, 384 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1989); <em>Carmody </em>v. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>234 Va. 198, 203, 361 S.E.2d 128, 131 (1987); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Central Telephone Co., </em>233 Va. 377, 382, 355 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Second, McBride contends that two 1984 amendments to the federal act created a federal cause of action against the defendants which could not be affected by the immunity provisions of the state act. McBride bases his argument on the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 904(a) and 905(a) of the federal act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a) (1982), <em>amended by </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a) (Supp. V 1988); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1982), <em>amended by </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (Supp. V 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Prior to the 1984 amendments, these provisions were interpreted to permit injured employees of subcontractors, who had received compensation benefits from their employers, to bring common-law actions against general contractors involved in the same project. <em>See Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, </em>398 U.S. 375, 394-95 n.11 (1970). But if the subcontractor failed to secure compensation insurance or qualify as a self-insurer, and the general contractor provided such coverage to the worker, the general contractor, rather than the subcontractor, was entitled to statutory immunity under the federal act. <em>Clanagan </em>v. <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>558 F. Supp. 209, 211-12 (D.D.C. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Washington Metro. Transit Auth. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 925, 934 (1984), based on what was described as a \u201cslightly strained reading of the word \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 904(a) and 904(b), the Court extended the \u201cemployer\u2019s\u201d immunity to a general contractor which had provided compensation coverage to its subcontractors\u2019 employees. <em>Id. </em>at 936. In <em>Johnson, </em>the general contractor provided this coverage as a policy decision to ensure that all employees on the job were covered, even though there was no evidence that the subcontractors had \u201caffirmatively\u201d defaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>on their obligation to provide such coverage. Additionally, the Court in <em>Johnson </em>suggested that the subcontractors also qualified for immunity because they reduced their bids to reflect that the general contractor had purchased a \u201cwrap-up\u201d compensation insurance policy protecting the subcontractor, as well as the general contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41 n.14. Within three months of that decision, Congress amended \u00a7 904(a) to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">Every employer shall be liable for and shall secure the payment to his employees of the compensation payable under sections 907, 908, and 909. In the case of an employer who is a subcontractor, <em>only if such subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation shall the contractor be liable for and be required to secure the payment of compensation. </em>A subcontractor shall not be deemed to have failed to secure the payment of compensation if the contractor has provided insurance for such compensation for the benefit of the subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a) (Supp. V 1988) (amending 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a) (1982)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">As pertinent here, \u00a7 905(a), which provides for \u201cemployer\u201d immunity from common-law actions, was amended by the addition of the following sentence: \u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor\u2019s employees only if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by section 904 of this title.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (Supp. V 1988) (amending 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">To find that these amendments <em>create </em>a federal cause of action, independent of the immunity provisions of the state act, we must conclude that their language clearly expresses a Congressional intent to expand federal maritime jurisdiction into an area traditionally controlled by state law. In <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Old Dominion Stev. Corp., </em>225 Va. 599, 303 S.E.2d 914 (1983), we quoted <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>655 F.2d 556, 559 (4th Cir. 1981), which stated that the federal courts \u201cscrupulously confine federal admiralty jurisdiction to the precise limits defined by Congress.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>225 Va. at 603, 303 S.E.2d at 916 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Our review of these amendments discloses neither an express nor an implied intent\u2019 to expand federal admiralty jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion as McBride contends.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the contrary, we read them solely as a congressional modification of Johnson's expansive interpretation of the \u201cemployer\u201d immunity provisions of the federal act in areas already subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Only two federal cases have been cited, and we have found no others, which deal with this issue. The courts in both cases expressly rejected the argument that these amendments to the federal act created a federal cause of action in areas of concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Griffis </em>v. <em>Gulf Coast Pre-Stress Co., Inc., </em>850 F.2d 1090, 1092 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>Garvin </em>v. <em>Alumax of South Carolina, Inc., </em>787 F.2d 910, 912 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 914 (1986). Moreover, <em>Garvin </em>explicitly recognized that a tort claim by an injured worker was a state cause of action and, therefore, such a worker was subject to a general contractor\u2019s immunity defense provided by a state compensation statute. <em>Garvin, </em>787 F.2d at 917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Finding no merit in either of McBride\u2019s contentions, we conclude that the state act controls in this case. Therefore, the trial court correctly sustained the defendants\u2019 pleas in bar. Accordingly, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> Indeed, in oral argument, McBride contended that the immunity provisions of the state act could not be applied even if he had received compensation under the state act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> McBride quotes from the \u201cJoint Explanatory Statement of the Committee Conference.\u201d The following portions of McBride\u2019s quotation belie his claim that the amendment not only negated <em>Johnson </em>but also created a new federal cause of action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">The Conference substitute, in disapproving <em>WMATA </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>achieves the following: First, the obligation of the contractor to secure compensation for the employee of the subcontractor is a contingent one, which is triggered only upon the failure of the subcontractor to secure compensation for its own employees. Second, the contractor <em>remains amenable </em>to suit by its subcontractors\u2019 employees in those instances where the subcontractor-employer has fulfilled its statutory obligation to secure compensation for its employees. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Cong. Rec. H9598 (daily ed. Sept. 14, 1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">If Congress had intended to create a federal cause of action in tort, in circumstances traditionally governed by state tort law, the committee report surely would have discussed it. We cannot assume that it was unmindful of <em>Victory Carriers.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
