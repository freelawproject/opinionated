On March 10, 1988, Thomas H. Tullidge, an attorney and registered voter in the county, brought a declaratory judgment action against the Board of Supervisors of Augusta County (the board), seeking an adjudication that the board\u2019s power to move the \u201ccounty seat\u201d from the City of Staunton was circumscribed by Code \u00a7 15.1-559. On March 29, 1988, the board filed a demurrer and a motion for sanctions under Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">On May 23, 1988, Tullidge filed a memorandum in support of his declaratory judgment action in which he claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>county\u2019s administrative offices were a part of the \u201ccounty seat\u201d or \u201ccourthouse,\u201d and thus that Code \u00a7 15.1-559 was implicated. As pertinent, that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">Whenever one third of the registered voters of any county shall petition the circuit court of such county ... for an election in such county on the question of the removal of the <em>courthouse </em>to one or more places specified in the petition . . . such court shall issue a writ of election. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Code \u00a7 15.1-559 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In support of his argument, Tullidge cites <em>Couk </em>v. <em>Skeen, </em>109 Va. 6, 63 S.E. 11 (1908), and <em>Ingles </em>v. <em>Straus, </em>91 Va. 209, 21 S.E. 490 (1895), in which we construed statutes closely analogous to Code \u00a7 15.1-559. There, the statutes at issue spoke of the removal of courthouses in their titles but described <em>courthouses </em>as <em>\u201ccounty </em>seats\u201d in their texts. Both statutes were attacked as violative of the Virginia constitutional prohibition against a statute embracing an object which was not expressed in its title. <em>See </em>Va. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 12. We held, however, that the terms \u201ccourthouse\u201d and \u201ccounty seat\u201d are synonymous and, consequently, that the statutes at issue were not unconstitutional. <em>Couk, </em>109 Va. at 11-12, 63 S.E. at 13-14; <em>Ingles, </em>91 Va. at 222, 21 S.E. at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The trial court sustained the board\u2019s demurrer, but delayed ruling on the sanctions issue until we disposed of Tullidge\u2019s appeal. We denied Tullidge\u2019s appeal on January 25, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">On May 24, 1989, after argument, the court concluded that Tullidge had violated Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 because \u201cthe allegations of law by the plaintiff did not meet the statutorily required standard of \u2018objective reasonableness. . . .\u2019 \u201d The court then imposed the sanction of a private reprimand upon Tullidge. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AG0\">Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his pleading, motion, or other paper and state his address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">The signature of . . . [a] party constitutes a certificate by him that (i) he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, (ii) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Because the issue is one of law, and not fact, we do not accord the trial court\u2019s ruling the same weight it would be accorded if reached upon conflicting factual evidence. <em>Madbeth, Inc. </em>v. <em>Weade, </em>204 Va. 199, 202, 129 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s application of an objective standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d in determining whether the \u201cwarranted by existing law\u201d portion of Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 has been violated. Because Tullidge is an attorney, it must be shown that a competent attorney, after reasonable inquiry, could not have formed a reasonable belief that Tullidge\u2019s contention was warranted by existing law. In addition, any doubts should be resolved in favor of Tullidge\u2019s contention. However, if it is clear that Tullidge\u2019s claim had no chance of success under existing law, his conduct was appropriately punished. <em>See Eastway Const. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New </em>York, 762 F.2d 243, 253-54 (2d Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In resolving such an issue, the wisdom of hindsight should be avoided. Thus, even though we refused to grant Tullidge an appeal from the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the county\u2019s demurrer, it need not follow that Tullidge, at the trial court level, had no chance of persuading a court to accept his premise. We must gauge the reasonableness of Tullidge\u2019s claim by the precedents existing at the time he presented his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">For a number of reasons, we conclude that a competent attorney reasonably could have believed that the decisions of <em>Couk </em>and <em>Ingles </em>controlled in the construction of Code \u00a7 15.1-559. First, <em>Couk </em>and <em>Ingles </em>dealt specifically with the removal of courthouses or county seats. Second, we made no mention of <em>Couk </em>or <em>Ingles </em>in the two later cases relied upon by the board in its demurrer;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> this might reasonably be taken by an attorney as an indication that the earlier cases were distinguishable. Third, a \u201ccourthouse\u201d is defined in part as \u201cthe principal building in which county offices are housed and in which county administrative affairs are conducted. . . .\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>523 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Thus, we hold as a matter of law that Tullidge\u2019s contention was reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court insofar as it imposed the sanction and remand the case with direction to expunge the private reprimand from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> The board relies principally upon <em>Bd. of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Com. of Accounts, </em>215 Va. 722, 214 S.E.2d 137 (1975), and <em>Egerton </em>v. <em>Hopewell, </em>193 Va. 493, 69 S.E.2d 326 (1952), decided after <em>Couk and Ingles. </em>In dealing with the extent of a circuit judge\u2019s control over other portions of the courthouse not devoted to the judicial function, Bd. <em>of Supervisors </em>and <em>Egerton </em>limited the meaning of \u201ccourthouse\u201d to the area of the court building devoted to the judicial function. <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>215 Va. at 723-24, 214 S.E.2d at 138; <em>Egerton, </em>193 Va. at 501, 69 S.E.2d at 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
