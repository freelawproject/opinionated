At that time, Savino also pled guilty to an indictment charging him with committing the underlying robbery. Upon entry of the pleas, the trial court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">Based upon the pleas of guilty, the statement of constitutional rights form [executed by the accused] and the questions which the Court has addressed to the accused and his answers to [the Court], this Court makes a finding of fact for the record that the accused has pled guilty to each of the indictments as charged and that the accused\u2019s pleas were freely and voluntarily made with full understanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>consequences of the pleas and full understanding of the procedures to follow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Thereupon, the trial court heard the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence in support of the charges. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found Savino guilty of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to the bifurcated-trial procedure for capital murder cases, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, the trial court conducted the penalty phase of the trial. During this phase, the Commonwealth presented evidence of aggravating factors, and Savino presented evidence in mitigation. <em>Id. </em>At the conclusion of all evidence, the court fixed Savino\u2019s punishment at death on the capital murder conviction. Prior to sentencing, however, the court ordered a post-sentence report, as provided by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5. After a post-sentencing hearing, the court, by order entered July 20, 1989, affirmed imposition of the death penalty and sentenced Savino accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Savino\u2019s death sentence with his appeal of right of his capital murder conviction, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1(A) and -110.1(F). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.2, we have given them priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>The Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Savino and McWaters became acquainted in 1980 while Savino was on parole from a New York prison. For two years while on parole, Savino worked for McWaters\u2019 New York construction firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In 1982, Savino was returned to prison in New York after being convicted of two counts of robbery. He spent the next six years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">While Savino was in prison, McWaters visited him frequently, communicated with him by telephone, and gave him money. During his incarceration, Savino sent letters to McWaters suggesting a homosexual relationship between them upon Savino\u2019s release from prison. No such relationship, however, had existed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In February 1988, when Savino was paroled from prison, he came to Bedford County where he lived with and worked for Mc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Waters on McWaters\u2019 farm. Savino and McWaters lived together as lovers.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Later that year, Savino began using cocaine. In order to purchase cocaine, he began writing checks on McWaters\u2019 checking account. Consequently, in November 1988, Savino was charged with 26 forging and uttering offenses in Bedford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On November 22, 1988, Savino was arrested in the City of Roanoke for possessing cocaine and drug paraphernalia. On November 29, he was released on a bail bond, and he returned to McWaters\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On the night of November 29, Savino spoke by telephone with his friend, Billy Sabilia, who lived in New York. The two talked about killing McWaters. On previous occasions, Savino and Sabilia discussed killing McWaters.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">That night, according to Savino, after McWaters had gone to bed, Savino used cocaine. Later, when Savino went to bed, Mc-Watefs demanded sex, and Savino refused. Savino claimed that, upon being rejected, McWaters told Savino that he was through with him. Thereupon, Savino decided to \u201celiminate the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Consequently, Savino obtained a hammer from a downstairs room and returned to the upstairs bedroom where McWaters was asleep. Savino struck McWaters with the hammer numerous times on the head with such force that brain tissue exuded from McWaters\u2019 skull. While McWaters still was alive and suffering, Savino stabbed McWaters numerous times with two knives. Savino left both knives in McWaters\u2019 back.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Savino then took about $100 in cash from McWaters\u2019 wallet and went to Roanoke where he purchased cocaine. Later in the night, he returned to McWaters\u2019 house, loaded a car with substantial personal property belonging to McWaters, and returned to Roanoke. He was arrested in Roanoke on November 30, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">\n<em>Effect of Guilty Plea on Certain Assignments of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">When an accused enters a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to an offense, he waives all defenses except those jurisdictional. <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>King, </em>210 Va. 194, 169 S.E.2d 569 (1969). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>[A] voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty by an accused is, in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law. It is a waiver of all defenses other than those jurisdictional, effective as such not only in the lower court but as well in this court. Where a conviction is rendered upon such a plea and the punishment fixed by law is in fact imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there is nothing to appeal. To take any other view would give recognition to an empty right and permit frivolous appeals for the mere sake of delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 196-97, 169 S.E.2d at 571. <em>Accord Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 126, 131-32, 376 S.E.2d 288, 291, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 3263 (1989) (when accused knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty, assignments of error challenging constitutionality of death penalty not cognizable on appeal); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 527, 352 S.E.2d 342, 345, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987) (accused appealing death sentence may not complain of non-jurisdictional defects that occurred prior to guilty plea); <em>see also Tollett, Warden </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973) (when defendant has admitted in open court that he is guilty of offense charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims regarding deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to entry of guilty plea); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919 (1979) (capital murder case in which accused pled guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Savino\u2019s assignments of error 3, 4, 5, 9, and 11 seek to raise issues that he waived by the entry of his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These issues, therefore, are not cognizable in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\n<em>Penalty Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>Evidence in Aggravation and Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">During the penalty phase of the trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence of aggravating factors. This evidence revealed that, prior to the incidents involved in the present case, Savino had a substantial criminal record. A portion of this record is summarized in the following table.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Date Jurisdiction Convicted Offense(s) Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">2/4/76 Bronx Criminal Court, New York City criminal trespass conditional discharge</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">12/2/77 Yonkers City Court, Yonkers, New York assault, 3rd degree 3 years\u2019 probation</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">11/2/78 Supreme Court, New York City robbery, 2nd degree 4 years in penitentiary</p>\n<p id=\"AVA\">8/24/82 Bronx Supreme Court, New York City two counts of robbery, 3rd degree 2 and <em>Vi </em>to 5 years in penitentiary</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>7/27/83 Supreme Court, Westchester County, New York grand larceny, 3rd degree 1 to 4 years in penitentiary</p>\n<p id=\"ARV\">7/27/83 Supreme Court, Westchester County, New York two counts, robbery, 1st degree 4 to 12 years in penitentiary</p>\n<p id=\"AL-\">4/26/89 Circuit Court, City of Roanoke (1) possession of cocaine (2) possession of drug paraphernalia in jail (1) 1 year in penitentiary (2) 12 months</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Savino was on parole when he committed the three robberies and grand larceny in 1982. He also was on parole when he committed the present offenses of capital murder and robbery. Additionally, Savino told his parole officer that, during the period of a year prior to his incarceration in 1982, he committed two to three robberies a week to support his drug habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-20\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of aggravating factors also consisted of the testimony of Dr. Arthur Centor, a clinical psychologist. Dr. Centor had interviewed Savino for three hours and 20 minutes. Dr. Centor also had performed 30 minutes of psychological testing upon Savino.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-21\">Dr. Centor testified that Savino did not suffer from any past or current mental illness, and \u201che was not operating under any serious mental or emotional disturbance\u201d at the time of the present offense. Dr. Centor also testified that Savino was not suffering from any degree of impairment which would limit his appreciation of the wrongfulness of his actions or which would prevent him from controlling his behavior. Dr. Centor opined, however, that Savino \u201cshow[ed] signs of future dangerousness in view of his past criminal history so that he would have a high probability of committing criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-22\">Also during this phase of the trial, Savino presented evidence in mitigation. This evidence revealed that Savino was born on June 17, 1959, to a family of Italian heritage in suburban New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>City. When he was two and one-half years old, his parents separated, and Savino continued to live with his mother and his younger sister. Savino\u2019s mother died in 1980 of leukemia, and his sister died in 1985 of a drug overdose. Savino\u2019s father remarried and, generally, Savino experienced a good relationship with his father and stepmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Savino attended private elementary schools. Savino first was exposed to homosexuality as a result of advances by teachers at the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Savino first experimented with drugs when he was a young teenager. He began by using marijuana and later used many types of drugs. After being released from prison on parole in 1980, Savino became involved in a homosexual relationship and used heroin heavily. Between 1980 and 1982, Savino became addicted to heroin. In order to obtain money to support his drug habits, Savino became engaged in further criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">During his second incarceration (1982-1988), Savino participated in a drug rehabilitation program. He successfully completed the program before his release from prison in February 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\n<em>Dr. Centor\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Upon an indigent defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court is required to appoint a qualified mental health expert \u201cto evaluate the defendant and to assist the defense in the preparation and presentation of information concerning the defendant\u2019s history, character, or mental condition.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1(A). The evaluation must include a determination whether, at the time of the offense, (i) the defendant acted under extreme mental or emotional disturbance; (ii) the defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired; and (iii) any other factors exist in mitigation relating to the history or character of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s mental condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">In the event an accused, convicted of capital murder, intends \u201cto present testimony of an expert witness to support a claim in mitigation relating to [his] history, character or mental condition,\u201d the accused must give notice to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney of his intention. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1(E). Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1(F) provides that if such notice is given and the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>wealth thereafter seeks an expert\u2019s evaluation, the trial court shall appoint a qualified expert and the defendant shall be ordered to submit to \u201can evaluation concerning the existence or absence of mitigating circumstances relating to the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In response to Savino\u2019s motion, the trial court appointed Dr. Lisa Hovermale to evaluate Savino. Savino gave the notice provided for in subsection E, and thereafter, the court, pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s request, appointed Dr. Centor to evaluate Savino.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">As previously noted, Dr. Centor opined that Savino \u201cshowfed] signs of future dangerousness in view of his past criminal history so that he would have a high probability of committing criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society in the future.\u201d At trial, Savino objected to this testimony and also to Dr. Centor\u2019s references to evaluations he had made in other capital murder cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Respecting the testimony of \u201cfuture dangerousness,\u201d Savino contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1 is unconstitutional because it is violative of the fifth and sixth amendments of the United States Constitution. In support of these contentions, Savino relies upon <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In <em>Estelle, </em>the defendant had been compelled by the state to submit to a mental examination that produced testimony of his future dangerousness even though he neither initiated a psychiatric evaluation nor introduced any psychiatric evidence. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right was violated by the admission of the psychiatric evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 468. The Supreme Court also has held, however, that when a defendant requests a psychiatric examination in order to prove a mental-status defense, he is deemed to have waived the right to raise a fifth amendment challenge to the prosecution\u2019s use of evidence obtained through that examination to rebut the defense. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>483 U.S. 402, 422-23 (1987). <em>Accord Powell </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>___ U.S. ___, ___, 109 S.Ct. 3146, 3149 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1 allows use of a defendant\u2019s interview with the Commonwealth\u2019s expert <em>only after </em>the defendant has given notice that he intends to present evidence of his mental con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>dition in the penalty phase of the trial. Thus, when a defendant gives such notice, he waives his fifth amendment privilege against the introduction of psychiatric testimony by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In the present case, it was Savino who first requested the mental examination and gave notice of his intention to use the expert\u2019s evaluation as mitigating evidence. We hold, therefore, that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1 does not violate Savino\u2019s fifth amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Under <em>Estelle </em>and <em>Powell, </em>a defendant has a sixth amendment right to have his attorney notified of the purpose of any psychiatric examination. <em>Estelle, </em>451 U.S. at 470-71; Powell, ___ U.S. at ___, 109 S.Ct. at 3150. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1 requires such a notice. Subsection F of the statute requires the Commonwealth to obtain a court order for an evaluation \u201cconcerning the existence or absence of mitigating circumstances relating to the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense.\u201d Clearly, upon the entry of such order, Savino was notified of the purpose of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Savino asserts, nonetheless, that his sixth amendment right to counsel was violated because he never was advised that his evaluation could result in testimony of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d In <em>Woomer </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>856 F.2d 677, 681 (4th Cir. 1988), <em>cert. denied, ___ </em>U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 1560 (1989), the defendant made the same argument that Savino makes in the present case. The Fourth Circuit concluded, however, that \u201calthough Woomer argues that the notice was inadequate because neither he nor his counsel were specifically advised that the evaluations might produce a basis for comment on potential future dangerousness, such specific notice was not required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">In the present case, Savino was on notice that, by virtue of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1, an examination would be conducted by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert in an effort to produce evidence against Savino\u2019s interests. Thus, we hold that Savino\u2019s sixth amendment right was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Savino further contends that the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Centor to express an opinion regarding \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d because such an opinion is \u201cunreliable.\u201d The same contention was made in <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 311, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In <em>Edmonds, </em>we followed the holding in <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 901 (1983), and upheld the admissibility of expert testimony of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d We adhere to our previous holding and reject Savino\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Finally, Savino contends that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Centor to testify about evaluations he had made in other capital murder cases. He asserts that this evidence was \u201ctotally irrelevant . . . and should not [have been] allowed to bolster [Dr. Centor\u2019s] testimony\u201d of Savino\u2019s future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On cross-examination, Savino\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Centor how many times he had testified in a sentencing hearing in a capital murder case. Dr. Centor responded that he had testified in eight cases \u2014 three times for the defense and five times for the Commonwealth. Defense counsel, in an effort to establish that the witness was biased in favor of the Commonwealth, then asked Dr. Centor if he had sent notices only to Commonwealth\u2019s attorneys that he had gone into private practice. The witness responded in the affirmative. On re-direct examination, over Savino\u2019s objection, Dr. Centor was permitted to testify about two cases in which he had examined the accused at the request of the Commonwealth and had found a low probability of future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Clearly, Savino\u2019s counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to the challenged testimony by the manner in which he attacked Dr. Centor\u2019s credibility on cross-examination. Once a party has \u201copened the door\u201d to inquiry into a subject, the permissible scope of examination on the subject by the opposing party is \u201ca matter for the exercise of discretion by the trial court,\u201d and we will not disturb the court\u2019s action on appeal unless it plainly appears that the court abused its discretion. <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 438, 304 S.E.2d 271, 279-80, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983). Under the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">\n<em>Statutory Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In addition to considering all errors assigned on appeal, we must consider and determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">2. Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\n<em>Passion, Prejudice, or Arbitrariness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">After considering the evidence in aggravation and in mitigation, the trial court imposed the death penalty upon a finding that \u201cthere is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Savino does not allege any specific prejudice or passion that influenced the court\u2019s sentence. Instead, he simply argues that the judge \u201cmust have been impassioned or prejudiced\u201d because Savino and the victim \u201chad been friends for more than ten years\u201d and for ten months prior to the murder had been involved in \u201can intimate homosexual relationship.\u201d Thus, Savino asserts, he should not be sentenced to death for \u201cwhat can only be described as a crime of passion comparable to a domestic killing arising out of an extremely intense personal relationship between [McWaters] and [Savino].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court acted out of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in imposing the death sentence. To the contrary, the record amply supports the court\u2019s finding of the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate. Savino\u2019s criminal record and history reveals violent and dangerous conduct over a protracted period of time. Moreover, the manner in which McWaters was murdered may be considered in assessing \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 317, 377 S.E.2d 595, 603, <em>cert. denied, </em>491 U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 3201 (1989). Undeniably, the manner of the murder was excessive and brutal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\n<em>Excessiveness and Disproportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have compiled and considered the records of all capital murder cases that have been appealed to this Court. Based upon our review of those cases, we conclude that Savino\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate.

(a) That the imposition of the death penalty based upon \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d as found in Va. Code Sec. 19.2-264.2 through Sec. 19.2-264.5 is unconstitutional because the use of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct evidenced to establish this aggravating factor is permitted without any requirement that the conduct be established by any standard of proof.
