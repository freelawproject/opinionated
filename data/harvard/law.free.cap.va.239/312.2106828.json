Mazur, Comptroller (collectively, the Commonwealth), sued Burl M. Compton for the sum of $11,076 for services rendered to Steven B. Compton, Burl\u2019s incapacitated adult son, by Southwestern State Hospital. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment for the Commonwealth in the amount of $11,076, with interest and costs. Burl appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Steven is totally disabled and incapacitated and is unable to earn a living. On February 27, 1984, he was admitted to Southwestern State Hospital for treatment of a mental disability that has existed since his birth. On June 14, 1984, he was discharged from the hospital. The total amount due for Steven\u2019s care, treatment, and maintenance at the hospital is $11,076.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Since May 1980, Steven has received benefits under the federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program (OASDI), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433 (1982). OASDI is a form of insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>designed to protect workers and their families against the economic hazards of involuntary, premature retirement. Under OASDI, entitlement payments are made to persons (or their dependents) who have worked a specified period and have paid social security taxes. Steven is entitled to these benefits because his mother, an eligible worker who paid social security taxes, died before Steven became 18 years of age and his disability has continued. These benefits, in the approximate amount of $376 per month, are Steven\u2019s only source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Burl contends that these benefits constitute aid to the permanently and totally disabled under a federal program. Thus, Burl asserts, Code \u00a7 20-61 exempts him from liability under Code \u00a7 37.1-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The Commonwealth asserts that OASDI benefits do not constitute \u201caid\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 20-61. The Commonwealth contends that the term \u201caid,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 20-61, is limited to Supplemental Security Income for Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385 (1982), a welfare assistance program based upon need of the recipient. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">When a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning must be accepted without resort to extrinsic evidence or the rules of construction. <em>Va. Dept. of Labor </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 99, 353 S.E.2d 758, 760-61 (1987); <em>Ambrogi </em>v. <em>Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 386, 297 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1982). We think Code \u00a7 20-61 is clear and unambiguous. Giving the section its plain meaning, we conclude that the OASDI benefits that Steven receives constitute \u201caid under a federal . . . program for aid to the permanently and totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter a final judgment in favor of Burl Compton.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
