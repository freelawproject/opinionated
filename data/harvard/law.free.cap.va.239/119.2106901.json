The hospital also obtained a judgment against the patient. When the patient reached a settlement with the alleged tort-feasor, the court reduced the hospital\u2019s lien pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, and apportioned the balance of the settlement between the patient, his attorney, and the hospital. The hospital thereafter sued out a summons in garnishment under its judgment, seeking to acquire that portion of the settlement which had been allocated to the patient. In this appeal, we must determine whether the action of the court in reducing the lien and apportioning the settlement under Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, affected the hospital\u2019s right to enforce its judgment against the patient\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In 1981, Virgil Thomas Harris (the plaintiff) was injured in a motorcycle accident in Albemarle County. He alleged that his injuries resulted from the negligence of Gary Michael Campbell (the defendant). The plaintiff received treatment for his injuries at the University of Virginia Hospital, in Charlottesville, incurring a bill of $74,682.49. He made no payments on the bill and the hospital, in 1985, acquired a judgment against him for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In 1982, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment against the defendant, claiming $500,000 compensatory damages and $150,000 punitive damages. The case remained essentially dormant on the docket until 1988, but during its pendency, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia asserted a statutory lien, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, in the amount of the hospital bill, upon the plaintiffs claim against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The trial date set for the personal injury case was February 10, 1988. The defendant\u2019s applicable insurance policy limit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>$50,000. Within 72 hours of the scheduled trial date, defense counsel offered $41,500 in settlement. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed to settle the case for that amount if the court would reduce the hospital\u2019s lien and apportion the settlement. The court, after notice to the hospital and a hearing, entered an order on March 7, 1988, reducing the hospital\u2019s lien to $5,000, fixing the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fee at $16,600, and apportioning the $19,900 balance to the plaintiff. None of the parties noted an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The plaintiff deposited his share of the settlement proceeds in two accounts at the Jefferson National Bank. On March 18, 1988, the Rector and Visitors sued out a summons in garnishment under the hospital\u2019s 1985 judgment, and obtained service on the bank. The bank thereupon paid the amount on deposit into court. On March 24, the court vacated the final judgment in the personal injury case and thereafter consolidated the personal injury case and the garnishment proceeding. The plaintiff moved the court to quash the garnishment. By letter opinion, the court ruled that the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 gave the court the authority to \u201ccompromise and discharge\u201d debts due the Commonwealth, even where a debt had been reduced to judgment, and that the apportionment of the settlement made by the court\u2019s order of March 7 was binding on the Rector and Visitors. The court entered a final order on September 7, 1988, reinstating the apportionment made on March 7, and quashing the garnishment. We granted the Rector and Visitors an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Rector and Visitors argue that the effect of the court\u2019s ruling was to impair the hospital\u2019s 1985 judgment, which was final and subject to modification only on the grounds set forth in Code \u00a7 8.01-428 (fraud, clerical mistakes, accord and satisfaction, and other grounds). They contend that, even though the court had the statutory authority to reduce their lien acquired under Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, their 1985 judgment was still valid and enforceable against any of the plaintiffs assets, including his share of the apportioned settlement, subject to a credit for the. $5,000 apportioned to the hospital by the court. The Rector and Visitors argue that they have the same right to collect their judgment by garnishment proceedings as any other judgment creditor would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The plaintiff argues that the position taken by the Rector and Visitors would, if adopted by this Court, render the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 useless and ineffectual. He points out that there would be no reason to seek judicial reduction of a lien and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>apportionment of a settlement if the lien creditor could, immediately following settlement, seize the plaintiffs share to satisfy the remaining balance of the debt. In those circumstances, the plaintiff argues, a plaintiff would have no incentive to settle, but would, instead, be well-advised to go to trial in the hope of a larger recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">At the time of the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case, the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 provided that the court in which a suit by an injured person has been filed, after notice to the Commonwealth or the appropriate institution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">may reduce the amount of the lien, and apportion the recovery between the plaintiff, the plaintiffs attorney, and the Commonwealth or such . . . institution as the equities of the case may appear, where the first offer acceptable to the plaintiffs attorney is not made until seventy-two hours prior to the date for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>239 Va. 108, 387 S.E.2d 767 (this day decided), we discussed the purpose and effect of this provision. We concluded that its purpose was to \u201creduce expense and delay, to avoid litigation, and to promote settlements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 387 S.E.2d at 769. We held that where the provision is applicable, it vests in the trial judge the authority, otherwise vested by Code \u00a7 2.1-127 in the Attorney General, the Governor, and the appropriate department head, \u201cto compromise and reduce the Commonwealth\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 387 S.E.2d at 769. The question of the trial court\u2019s authority over the Commonwealth\u2019s underlying debt was not before us in <em>Smith, </em>and it comes to us now as a matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Code \u00a7 2.1-127 has, for many years, given authority to the Attorney General, with the approval of the head of the appropriate institution and, in the case of claims over a stated amount, with the approval of the Governor, to compromise, settle, and \u201cdischarge\u201d disputes and claims involving the interests of the Commonwealth and its institutions. <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) That section was in effect when the statutory predecessor of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 was originally enacted and it was clearly within the legislature\u2019s contemplation during many amendments of \u00a7 8.01-66.9, which contain cross-references to \u00a7 2.1-127. It is, therefore, significant that the General Assembly, when adding the final sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tence to \u00a7 8.01-66.9 in 1981 (Acts 1981, c. 562), chose not to use language parallel to that in \u00a7 2.1-127. The 1981 amendment to \u00a7 8.01-66.9 authorized the trial judge, in specified circumstances, to \u201creduce the amount of the lien.\u201d It did not take the further step of authorizing the judge to \u201cdischarge\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s claim, although \u00a7 2.1-127 vested that authority in the Attorney General, subject to the appropriate approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 does not give the court authority to discharge the lien-holder\u2019s underlying debt, except to subject it to a credit for the amount apportioned to it in the settlement. It follows that the court\u2019s action in the present case had no effect upon the judgment to which the claim of the Rector and Visitors had been reduced, except to subject the claim to a $5,000 credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">That holding does not, however, end our inquiry. Granted that the hospital\u2019s judgment remains enforceable against other property belonging to the plaintiff, does it follow, then, that the judgment creditor may enforce it against the plaintiff\u2019s share of the settlement after the court has, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, \u201capportioned the recovery ... as the equities of the case may appear?\u201d If so, the court\u2019s action was an exercise in futility, because the same result would have been reached without any judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In <em>Board of Sup. </em>v. <em>King Land Corp., </em>238 Va. 97, 102-103, 380 S.E.2d 895, 897-98 (1989), we reiterated and reaffirmed the 400-year-old \u201cmischief rule\u201d of statutory construction. Every statute should be read so as to \u201cpromote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u201d Remedial statutes are to be \u201cconstrued liberally, so as to <em>suppress the mischief </em>and advance the remedy\u201d in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intended purpose. All other rules of construction are subservient to that intent. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>referring to the statutory provision under consideration here, we said: \u201cThe legislative purpose of the 1981 amendment is met only if the statute is construed to promote, not to frustrate, settlements.\u201d 239 Va. at 112, 387 S.E.2d at 770. It is apparent that the construction advocated by the Rector and Visitors would, in the circumstances of this case, remove any incentive the plaintiff might have to settle. Having no immediate prospect of gain in a settlement, the stronger incentive would be to risk the hazards of trial in the hope of a recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>large enough to discharge the debt, pay his attorney, and leave a substantial balance to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Further, an examination of the statutory language fails to support the construction advocated by the Rector and Visitors. Although the 1981 amendment did not give the court authority to discharge the lien-holder\u2019s underlying claim, it went further than merely granting the court the power to \u201creduce the amount of the lien.\u201d The amendment also authorized the court to \u201capportion the recovery between the plaintiff, the plaintiffs attorney, and the Commonwealth or such institution as the equities of the case may appear . . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201cApportion\u201d is defined: \u201cTo divide and assign in just proportion ... to allot.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 132 (2nd ed. 1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The General Assembly, therefore, not only intended that the court would have authority to reduce the lien asserted by the Commonwealth or one of its institutions, but also intended that the court would have the power to determine what portion of the recovery each of the contending parties would ultimately receive, and to divide and distribute the recovery accordingly. If the lien-holder may thereafter seize the share allotted to the plaintiff by the court through garnishment, attachment, levy, or other process, the legislative purpose is subverted, and the \u201cmischief\u2019 at which the 1981 amendment was directed remains without redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Accordingly, we hold that when the court, acting pursuant to the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, apportions a recovery between a plaintiff, the plaintiffs attorney, and the Commonwealth or its institutions, that apportionment is binding upon the parties whose claims were adjudicated in the apportionment proceeding, provided such parties had proper notice. The shares of the recovery thus apportioned are thereafter immune from the claims of the other parties to the apportionment, although such claims, subject to credits resulting from the apportionment, may be enforced against other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Although we do not adopt the trial court\u2019s ruling that it had authority to \u201cdischarge\u201d the hospital\u2019s 1985 judgment, we conclude that the court committed no error in quashing the garnish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ment sued out by the Rector and Visitors. Accordingly, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\"> Although the final sentence of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 was re-written in 1989, effective July 1, 1990, the above-quoted language remains unchanged. Acts 1989, c. 624.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b150-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO,</author>\n<p id=\"AA_\">with whom JUSTICE COMPTON joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">While the majority affirms the judgment appealed from, it holds that the trial court had no \u201cauthority to \u2018discharge\u2019 the hospital\u2019s 1985 judgment.\u201d I agree with that holding. Yet, the majority proceeds to discharge the judgment in part by holding that the funds received by the plaintiff are \u201cimmune from the claims of the other parties to the apportionment.\u201d I cannot agree with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">If the trial court had no power to discharge the judgment in toto, from whence comes the power of the majority to discharge it in part? Certainly not from the apportionment language of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, which the majority assigns as the sole source of its authority. As the majority notes, \u201capportion\u201d means to \u201cdivide and assign in just proportion ... to allot.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cto discharge [a] debt or claim is to extinguish it, to annul its obligatory force, to satisfy it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 416 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The majority says that, if the judgment lienor is permitted to seize the share of the recovery apportioned to the plaintiff in this case, the \u201clegislative purpose is subverted, and the \u2018mischief at which the 1981 amendment [to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9] was directed remains without redress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">But this Court is confined to the language the General Assembly used in attempting to deal with the mischief, and, if that language is insufficient for the purpose, so be it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
