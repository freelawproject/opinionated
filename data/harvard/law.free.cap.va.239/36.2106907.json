Tannehill, deceased, filed an application for appeal as a matter of right, pursuant to Code \u00a7 64.1-78, from the probate of the will of the deceased. Subsequently, other heirs of Tannehill appeared as parties to contest the will, including appellant Patricia T. Robinson. The application stated that the \u201cexecution and/or attestation of said will did not comply\u201d with the statutory requirements, thus invalidating the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Appellees Katherine D. Ward, individually and as administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; and Boys Home, Inc. (collectively, proponents) appeared in opposition to the application. They asserted that the document in question was a valid will and that its probate should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Following an ore tenus hearing, at which only the proponents presented evidence, the trial court upheld the validity of the document as the last will and testament of the deceased. We awarded the contestant this appeal from the September 1988 judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The facts are undisputed. Prior to her death, Tannehill, who was not married, resided in Staunton and on her 75-acre farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>near Deerfield, where she grew and sold Christmas trees. Appellee Ward, a close friend of Tannehill, moved to the farm several days before the events in question to assist her in the operation of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">During the morning of May 18, 1986, Tannehill, 52 years of age and apparently in good health, became ill with \u201ca violent headache.\u201d Shortly, Tannehill directed Ward to obtain \u201ca legal pad.\u201d Tannehill stated: \u201cWrite exactly what I say, and do not interrupt me.\u201d As Tannehill dictated, Ward wrote by hand with a pencil on a page of the pad.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The writing follows, complete with spelling and other errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cTo Katherine D. Ward I leave everything I own for her life time. She is to maintain the farm &amp; provide employment for Penny Guin for as long as Penny cares to stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201cI would hope that Katherine can maintain the farm &amp; herself with the income from the farm &amp; interest on my principal. At her death, the principal that is left is to be used as an endowment as maintaing this farm, which I wish to go to Covington Boys Home. The farm is to used by them as a teaching facility. If they do not wish to use it that way than the entire request is to go to VPI to be used in the same manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">After Ward \u201cfinished writing the will,\u201d Tannehill \u201cread it over, signed her name, dated it [May 18, 1986],\u201d and \u201chanded it back\u201d to Ward. She placed the document on a table in Tannehill\u2019s bedroom, where the events in question occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">After trying unsuccessfully to reach several local physicians, Ward was directed by Tannehill to call a friend, Colonel George A. Knudson, a retired Marine and a member of the local rescue squad. Upon arrival, Knudson took Tannehill\u2019s blood pressure, which \u201cwas rather high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Tannehill then told Knudson that she had dictated her will to Ward and asked him to \u201cplease read it and witness it \u2014 which he did.\u201d Present in the room at the time were Tannehill, Ward, and Knudson. The following appears on the lower left portion of the document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">\u201cWitness George A. Knudson May 18, 1986\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The will again was placed on the bedside table.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Tannehill took some medication and \u201ca short time after that, she kind of cried out, her body jerked, she lost control, and she was unconscious.\u201d She was rushed to a Staunton hospital and, shortly after noon on May 18, was flown to a Charlottesville hospital where she remained in a coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Distraught by the grave condition of her friend, Ward \u201cfelt\u201d that she needed \u201clegal advice\u201d to determine what she \u201cshould do step-wise for Joane or anything.\u201d With the aid of her sister, Ward contacted a Maryland attorney on May 19 who \u201csaid that he felt that in Virginia there should be two witnesses \u2014 two witness signatures on the will.\u201d The attorney suggested that Ward sign \u201con the bottom\u201d and have Ward\u2019s \u201cname witnessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On May 19, Ward returned to the farm and signed the document in the presence of Gwin, the farm employee. Ward signed below Knudson\u2019s signature and Gwin signed on the lower right portion. Both affixed the date \u201cMay 18, 1986\u201d under their signatures. When asked why the date of May 18, instead of May 19, was written, Ward testified that she \u201cwas extremely upset\u201d and that she \u201cjust picked up what was on the will.\u201d She stated, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking what day of the month or year it was.\u201d She said, \u201cthere was no evil intent or anything on my part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The testatrix died later on May 19 without regaining consciousness. The document was probated subsequently by the clerk of the court below as the deceased\u2019s last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In a letter opinion sustaining the validity of the will, the trial court made the following findings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201cIn this case there is no question, but that the writing expressed the testamentary intent of Joane G. Tannehill. That is conceded by all parties. The testatrix was a well educated and very intelligent person. At all times she was a strong willed individual and was in full control of her mental faculties. At age 52, she was enjoying good health, and had no reason to expect to die. Her only problem was anxiety caused by the unexpected death of her fiance ten days before. She clearly had the capacity to make a will, and she expressed her testamentary intentions in the document which she dictated. When she completed her dictation, she took it, reviewed it, and then signed and dated it. She clearly recognized the accuracy of the transcription of her dictation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>accepted it as the authentic expression of her testamentary intentions. This was done in the presence and with the knowledge of Katherine Ward, a person in whom she placed great trust and confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Accordingly, the court ruled that Ward\u2019s name appearing in the first sentence of the document \u201cconstitutes a sufficient compliance with prerequisites of the Statute of Wills to permit the document to be admitted to probate.\u201d The court said: \u201cEven though the name appearing in the first sentence was not made as a signature, it does link the second witness with the writing and its execution, and it does identify her with it.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cThe words \u2018Katherine D. Ward\u2019 written by her while not a signature when made were sufficient subscription under the unique facts of this case to constitute satisfactory compliance\u201d with the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On appeal to this Court, the contestant argues the trial court erred \u201cin holding that the appearance of a witness\u2019s name on the first line of a will written by the witness is sufficient subscription to constitute satisfactory compliance\u201d with Code \u00a7 64.1-49. The contestant maintains that there is \u201cno compliance with the Will statute where the second witness does not subscribe the will as a witness.\u201d The contestant says: \u201cWhen Katherine Ward wrote her name on the first line of the will at the direction of Joane Tannehill, she neither signed nor subscribed the will. When Katherine Ward placed her name on the first line, she merely wrote her name as a beneficiary of the estate.\u201d According to the contestant, \u201cwhile Virginia law requires no formal attestation clause for a subscribing witness ... , it does require that one who takes the solemn step of subscribing a will as a witness to the fact that the will has either been signed or acknowledged in her presence must do so with the intention of acting as a witness.\u201d We do not agree that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The purpose of the statute in requiring subscription of a will by competent witnesses in the presence of the testator is to prevent fraud, deception, mistake, and the substitution of a surreptitious document. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>187 Va. 581, 591, 47 S.E.2d 346, 352 (1948). These requirements, however, \u201care not intended to restrain or abridge the power of a testator to dispose of his property. They are intended to guard and protect him in the exercise of that power.\u201d <em>French </em>v. <em>Beville, </em>191 Va. 842, 848, 62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>S.E.2d 883, 885 (1951). The safeguards of the statute \u201care not designed to make the execution of wills a mere trap and pitfall, and their probate a mere game.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Timmins, </em>190 Va. 648, 657, 58 S.E.2d 55, 59 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Accordingly, and while the statute must be strictly followed, it is vital that the provisions not be construed in a manner which would \u201cincrease the difficulty of the transaction to such an extent as to practically destroy\u201d the right of the uninformed lay person to dispose of property by will. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>103 Va. 540, 546, 49 S.E. 668, 669-70 (1905). The statute should be given \u201ca sound and fair construction\u201d with rigid insistence \u201cupon substantial compliance with its requirements.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>190 Va. at 657, 58 S.E.2d at 59-60. <em>Accord Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Birchett, </em>51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 67, 89 (1853).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The function of the witnesses\u2019 subscription \u201cis to establish and prove the genuineness of testator\u2019s signature.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>187 Va. at 591, 47 S.E.2d at 352. \u201cTo attest a signature means to take note mentally that the signature exists as a fact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>47 S.E.2d at 351. Formal attestation is unnecessary and the statute mandates no specific form nor particular place on the document for the witness\u2019 signature. <em>Peake </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>80 Va. 293, 296 (1885). Indeed, there is no statutory guidance for what constitutes a sufficient subscription of a will. <em>See Ferguson, </em>187 Va. at 590, 47 S.E.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We agree with the trial court and hold that, under the facts of this case, there was sufficient subscription by Ward to constitute substantial compliance with the statute in question. Most importantly, there is no hint of fraud disclosed by the evidence. Furthermore, there is no dispute that the testatrix had the capacity to make a will and that the document accurately expresses her testamentary intentions. Nevertheless, the contestant seeks to invalidate the will, principally on the ground that Ward, when she wrote her name in the first line of the document, did not \u201cdo so with the intention of acting as a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The case of <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Glassell, </em>43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 439 (1846), is particularly appropriate here. In that case, an ill testatrix expressed her wishes for disposition of her property to one S. S. Ash-ton, who recorded the information as the testatrix dictated it. At the foot of the paper, Ashton wrote, \u201cWritten by S. S. Ashton for,\u201d intending to add the testatrix\u2019 name if the latter should be unable to authenticate the paper by her own signature. The testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>trix did, in fact, sign her name to the document and Ashton struck the word \u201cfor.\u201d At the testatrix\u2019 request, another person signed the paper as a witness. When the testatrix asked Ashton to sign as a witness, she responded that it was unnecessary for her to sign the paper again because her name was already on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Rejecting the argument that the attestation by Ashton was insufficient under the statute (because she intended to act as a scribe when she wrote her name), this Court upheld the validity of the document as a codicil. The Court said that plainly the statutory requirement means \u201cnothing more than that the instrument itself should be attested, in order to identify the witnesses, and designate who are to prove its due execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. The Court stated: \u201cThe subscription of their names by the witnesses denotes that they were present at, and prepared to prove, the due execution of the instrument so attested, and nothing more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court noted that Ashton\u2019s \u201csubscription alone was a sufficient attestation, and the memorandum [\u2018Written by S. S. Ashton for\u2019] does not disprove it was so intended. At most, it can only call for explanation, and that given by her testimony is completely satisfactory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The <em>Ferguson </em>decision is also instructive. There, a notary public, who had prepared a will at the testator\u2019s request, signed the document as \u201cC. E. Trout, Notary Public,\u201d after the testator had affixed his mark to the document in the presence of Trout and at least one other witness. In ruling that Trout was an attesting witness to the will, even though he had signed solely in his capacity as a notary public, this Court said: \u201cWhere, as in Virginia, a formal attestation is unnecessary, any form of signing a will with the intention of acting as a witness is sufficient.\u201d 187 Va. at 591, 47 S.E.2d at 351. But the Court ruled: \u201cConceding the general rule to be that a witness must intend to attest the will as a witness, the language of the certificate, the actions and the testimony of Trout all declare that he acted as a witness, no matter how he regarded himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 47 S.E.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Likewise, in <em>French </em>v. <em>Beville, supra, </em>one Pitts signed his name to a will for the purpose of certifying as a notary public that another witness had observed the testator\u2019s execution of the document. The Court held that Pitts signed as a witness to the will, citing <em>Pollock </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>and stated that the witness\u2019 attestation \u201cmay be contradicted or explained.\u201d 191 Va. at 850, 62 S.E.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>As the proponents contend, the general rule \u201cthat a witness must intend to attest the will as a witness,\u201d is not applied mechanically. The important fact, as noted in <em>Ferguson, </em>is not how the witness regarded himself during execution of the will, but what he observed, because the witness\u2019 signature serves mainly to identify to whom the testator acknowledged the instrument. In other words, as the proponents argue, the witness need not realize his status during execution of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Ashton in <em>Pollock, </em>Trout in <em>Ferguson, </em>and Pitts in <em>French </em>did not intend to attest the respective documents when they wrote their names on the instruments upheld in each case. In those cases, as here, each person was declared to be a witness because the transaction was free of fraud, the document expressed the testamentary intent of a competent testator, the witness had written his or her name, and the will was acknowledged before at least two witnesses present together.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Similarly, Ward did not intend to act as a witness when she wrote her name in the first line of the document. Yet, she was a subscribing witness to the execution of the will, within the meaning of the statute. While the testatrix never formally asked Ward to be a witness to the will, the evidence establishes that Tannehill expected her to act as a witness and treated her as one, as the trial court noted. Moreover, Ward\u2019s testimony, and the other evidence, establishes that she, in fact, acted as a witness to the preparation and execution of the will and that she was present with Colonel Knudson when the testatrix acknowledged her signature to the document. Under these circumstances, the statute requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">A statement from <em>Sturdivant </em>is apropos here: \u201cUpon the whole, . . . there has been a reasonable and substantial, if not a literal, compliance with the requirements of the statute shown in this case, sufficient for all practical purposes, and which in favor of the testamentary right ought to be sustained. To reject the will . . . would be . . .to sacrifice substance to form, and the ends of justice to the means by which they are to be accomplished.\u201d 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO,</author>\n<p id=\"Azs\">with whom JUSTICE STEPHENSON and JUSTICE WHITING join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Code \u00a7 64.1-49 provides that a witness to a will \u201cshall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator, but no form of attestation shall be necessary.\u201d What the majority does in this case is to dispense not only with form, which the Code section permits, but also with substance, which, I submit, is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The substantive element of subscription requires \u201csigning a will <em>with the intention of acting as a </em>witness.\u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. Ferguson, 187 Va. 581, 591, 45 S.E.2d 346, 351 (1948) (emphasis added). Here, there is (absolutely nothing in the record to support the proposition that when Katherine D. Ward placed her name on the first line of the will in question, she did so with the intention of acting as a witness. Indeed, the record is conclusive of the proposition that the only reason Ms. Ward wrote her name in the will was to identify herself as a beneficiary. I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
