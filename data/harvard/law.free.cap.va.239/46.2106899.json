(Record No. 881390)</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-6\">Justice Compton</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">We consolidated three appeals arising from a single suit brought by the trustee of a charitable, testamentary trust. The trustee sought the trial court\u2019s aid and guidance in administration of the trust and in construction of certain racially discriminatory trust provisions applicable to private educational institutions. The provisions allegedly are unconstitutional and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In 1956, Jack Adams, a resident of Lynchburg, executed his will establishing the trust in question. In 1964, the testator executed a codicil to the will. In 1968, Adams died testate. The will and codicil, drafted by a Lynchburg attorney, were duly probated.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Article IV of the codicil provides that the residuum of Adams\u2019 estate be held in trust and the income therefrom be distributed pursuant to clause (a). The clause provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">\u201cSo long as Prince Edward School Foundation, Prince Edward Co., Va., admits to any school, operated or supported by it, only members of the White Race . . . my said Trustee shall pay the net income ... to the Trustees (or other governing body) of such Foundation, to be expended by them ... for the benefit of any of said schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The clause further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">\u201cIn the event that the said Foundation should cease to operate for one year, or should at any time permit to matriculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>in any of the schools operated or supported by it any person who is not a member of the White Race, no further payment of income shall be made to the said Foundation; but all income accruing after such date shall be paid to the Trustees of the Miller School, situated in Albemarle County, ... so long as said School admits only members of the White Race; said income shall be expended by such Trustees ... for the payment of the expenses of maintaining and operating said School</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The clause further provides for successive gifts over first to Seven Hills School, Inc., located in Lynchburg, and then to Hampden-Sydney College, in the event of the occurrence of the same contingencies. The final beneficiary of the successive gifts over is Hermitage Methodist Homes of Virginia, Inc., without the limitation of the described contingencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Code \u00a7 55-26 (Repl. Vol. 1974) was effective when the will and codicil were executed, and at the time of the testator\u2019s death. It provided, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cEvery gift, grant, devise or bequest which, since April second, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, has been or at any time hereafter shall be made for literary purposes or for the \u2022 education of white persons, and every gift, grant, devise or bequest which, since April tenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, has been or at any time hereafter shall be made for literary purposes or for the education of colored persons, and every gift, grant, devise or bequest made hereafter for charitable purposes, whether made in any case to a body corporate or unincorporated, or to a natural person, shall be as valid as if made to or for the benefit of a certain natural person, . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Trotter, </em>169 Va. 440, 193 S.E. 514 (1937), this Court construed the statute as validating a charitable gift for the education of members from one of the two races, but not from both. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 193 S.E. at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In 1975, the General Assembly repealed \u00a7 55-26. Acts 1975, ch. 547. In the next year, the legislature enacted the substance of former \u00a7 55-26 without the discriminatory provisions as present Code \u00a7 55-26.1. Acts 1976, ch. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In 1987, appellee Dominion Trust Company filed the present suit naming as parties defendant the income beneficiaries and the Attorney General of Virginia. Asserting that it was the successor trustee of the Adams Trust, the trustee alleged that it had paid over the income to Prince Edward School Foundation since the creation of the trust. It stated that \u201ca determinable event\u201d as described in Article IV may have occurred with respect to the school administered by the Foundation. (Counsel represented at the bar of this Court that subsequent to creation of the trust each educational beneficiary had enrolled black students in its schools.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">The trustee sought advice and guidance on \u201cwhether the determinative event or contingency [was] legal, valid and enforceable.\u201d Therefore, the trustee asserted, it was \u201cuncertain as to the proper income beneficiary of said trust\u201d and asked the court to construe and interpret the will to determine the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In its answer, Prince Edward, stating that it does not discriminate in the admission of students to the school, asserted that the discriminatory provisions of Article IV of the will \u201care illegal, invalid and unenforceable,\u201d and that the proper interpretation of the disputed provisions requires \u201cthe continued payment of the trust income to the Prince Edward School Foundation without interruption or diminution.\u201d Prince Edward asserted that the \u201cracially discriminatory provisions of Article IV are unconstitutional under Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In its answer, the Miller School likewise asserted that the trust provisions under Article IV are discriminatory and unconstitutional. It further asserted that since \u201cthe precise object of the trust fails because of the trust\u2019s illegality,\u201d it should be entitled to all the income from the trust under the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>because the testator\u2019s \u201cprimary charitable intent\u201d was to benefit the Miller School.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In its answer, Seven Hills School also asserted that the trust provisions are unconstitutional and also asked the court to apply the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine to find that it \u201cshould be entitled to all or such portion of the income from said trust as may be determined proper without enforcing the illegal racially discriminatory provisions thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In its answer, Hampden-Sydney College, asserting that it has accepted students \u201cwithout regard to race, color, creed or religion,\u201d asked the court to construe and interpret the will, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>award it all sums to which it may be entitled under the will and trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">In its answer, the Hermitage Methodist Homes of Virginia, Inc., asked the court to construe the will and trust, stating that it employs no racially discriminatory conditions upon the admission of persons into its homes for the aging and that it would \u201caccept all sums which may be due it under the will and trust,\u201d if the court found it so entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In her answer, the Attorney General joined in the request for interpretation of the documents. Also, she asked that \u201cno action be taken which is adverse to the public\u2019s interest in charitable trusts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Additionally, Prince Edward filed a motion for summary judgment. It asserted that absent a statute, the common law of Virginia does not recognize the validity of a\u2019charitable trust like the one in issue here. It asserted that former Code \u00a7 55-26 \u201cwas the sole statutory basis for the creation of a trust for educational purposes with a corporate beneficiary.\u201d Further, Prince Edward alleged the discriminatory provisions of Adams\u2019 will, as amended by the codicil, were necessary to make a valid bequest under Code \u00a7 55-26. Thus, according to Prince Edward, the discrimination compelled by the Commonwealth through the statute violated the rights of Prince Edward and its students to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Further, Prince Edward alleged that neither the trustee, the court, nor the Attorney General can compel or effect a divestiture of it as beneficiary of the trust because such action would be unconstitutional by \u201cgiving continuing effect to the unconstitutional discriminatory requirements\u201d of repealed \u00a7 55-26. Thus, Prince Edward asked the court to strike the discriminatory language from the will, give effect to the primary charitable intent of the testator to promote the education of children by the Prince Edward School Foundation, and order the trustee to pay it all trust income.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Hermitage also filed a motion for summary judgment. It asserted that the trust is valid and that the language should be given its plain meaning to carry out the testator\u2019s intent. When this is done, according to Hermitage, a \u201cdeterminable event has occurred with regard to each\u201d other income beneficiary, resulting in the final beneficiary, Hermitage, \u201cbeing entitled under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>trust to receive all future trust income payments as they become due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">Upon consideration of the argument of counsel on the motions for summary judgment, the trial court, in a letter opinion, granted Prince Edward\u2019s motion and denied Hermitage\u2019s motion. The court found, \u201cAll racially discriminatory conditions of the Trust are unconstitutional and void.\u201d The court further determined that Prince Edward \u201cshall continue as the principal and sole beneficiary of the Trust, as long as the school remains in operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The court also ruled that if Prince Edward ceases operation for one year, all income accruing after such date shall be paid to Miller School. The court pointed out that the trust named three more successive, but not joint, beneficiaries \u201ceach of whom may become the principal and sole beneficiary of the Trust in the event that all prior beneficiaries named, in the order set forth, cease to operate.\u201d The court said, \u201cThis construction gives full recognition to the intent of the testator in naming successive beneficiaries.\u201d Finally, the court ruled that the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">From the September 1988 final decree incorporating those rulings, we awarded separate appeals to Hermitage, Miller School and Seven Hills School. The trustee, Hampden-Sydney College, and the Attorney General did not participate in the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Hermitage assigns error to the trial court\u2019s rulings that the conditions of the trust are unconstitutional and void, and that Prince Edward shall continue as the sole beneficiary of the trust as long as the school operates. Seven Hills School and Miller School assign error to the trial court\u2019s ruling granting Prince Edward\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its decision that <em>cy pres </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">These assignments of error present the following issues on appeal. First, are the discriminatory provisions of Article IV valid, or are they unconstitutional and invalid? Second, if such provisions are invalid, is the primary educational bequest of the trust nevertheless valid, or must it fail, requiring future income to be paid to Hermitage? And, third, if the provisions are invalid, is the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>applicable?</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">On the first question, Seven Hills School and Miller School adopt the trial court\u2019s ruling that the racially discriminatory conditions of the trust established in Adams\u2019 will are unconstitutional under both the federal and Virginia constitutions. The constitutional argument is articulated by Prince Edward as follows. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a state from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Article I, \u00a7 11, of the Constitution of Virginia provides \u201cthat the right to be free from any governmental discrimination upon the basis of . . . race [or] color, . . . shall not be abridged. . . .\u201d Thus, the argument goes, all persons in Virginia, including the students and prospective students of the educational institutions named as beneficiaries of the Adams Trust, have a constitutional right to be free from state-compelled racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The argument continues that the Supreme Court of the United States has established a clear distinction between deprivation by the state, so-called \u201cstate action,\u201d and purely private conduct against which the Fourteenth Amendment affords no protection. <em>See e.g., Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 349 (1974). Here, the racially discriminatory conditions of the trust are unconstitutional because they are compelled by state law, specifically by repealed Code \u00a7 55-26. As interpreted in <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Trotter, supra, </em>for an educational trust to be valid in Virginia, the statute required the beneficiary school to admit students from one of the two races, but not from both.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Accordingly, the argument goes, \u201cthe ability of Mr. Adams to create this educational trust had its sole source in a state law which required him to discriminate on the basis of race in order to give effect to his intent to further education.\u201d The argument points out that while \u00a7 55-26 required discrimination with respect to educational trusts, it did not impose such a requirement with respect to general charitable gifts, such as the gift over to Hermitage.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On the other hand, Hermitage contends that the application of the restrictive provisions of the trust would not constitute a deprivation of any constitutionally protected right. It argues that the provisions were not the result of any \u201cstate action,\u201d or state-compelled conduct, but were motivated by the testator\u2019s own social philosophy, regardless of any statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Because of the view we take of the second issue, based on principles of real property law, we will agree with Prince Edward, Seven Hills School, and the Miller School on the first issue for purposes of this decision. Whether the discriminatory provisions are valid or void, the result is the same, as we will demonstrate below. Thus, we will assume, without deciding, that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>correctly ruled that the racially discriminatory provisions are unconstitutional and void. This brings us to the second issue, that is, whether the educational trust is otherwise valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">Asserting that the restrictive language provides for an illegal condition subsequent, Prince Edward relies on <em>Meek </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>118 Va. 774, 88 S.E. 161 (1916), to sustain the trial court\u2019s ruling that the racially discriminatory condition is void, but the gift is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The issue presented in <em>Meek </em>involved the proper construction of a will regarding the testator\u2019s devise to his daughter, Julia Anne. In the will, the testator devised one-third of his land to his son in fee simple. To Eliza, his only married daughter, he devised one-third of his land during her life, remainder to her heirs. The testator made the following provision for Julia Anne: \u201cAlso to my daughter, Julia Anne, I desire that she shall have her equal share laid off, also according to quality and quantity, and she shall have it forever, except she should marry, then at her death I desire that it shall revert to her legal heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">After the testator\u2019s death, Julia Anne married. Later, she conveyed the land devised by the above clause to one Fox and another. After Julia Anne\u2019s marriage, her brother conveyed his land to one Meek, and included in his conveyance what he claimed to be his remainder in the land devised to his sister, Julia Anne, by the foregoing clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In the ensuing litigation brought to remove a cloud upon the title to the land devised to Julia Anne, the appellant claimed the land under the conveyance to Meek while the appellees claimed under Julia Anne. The appellees contended that a fee simple estate vested in Julia Anne under the will; that the provision in the will created a condition subsequent in general restraint on marriage; that the condition was void as against public policy; and that the subsequent marriage of Julia Anne did not divest her of the fee simple estate, but the same continued in her and was passed from her by the conveyance to Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This Court agreed with the appellees and held that the devise to Julia Anne, \u201cand she shall have it forever,\u201d transferred to her upon the testator\u2019s death a fee simple estate in the land. The Court further held that the added provision of the devise, \u201cexcept she should marry, then at her death I desire that it revert to her legal heirs,\u201d was a condition subsequent and was in restraint of marriage, and void. Therefore, the Court struck the condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cand the estate thus became absolute and free from condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 88 S.E. at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Drawing on the rationale of <em>Meek, </em>Prince Edward contends that because the discriminatory condition is void, its \u201cinterest in the income from the Trust remains vested\u201d and \u201ca subsequent beneficiary\u2019s interest will vest only in the event that Prince Edward ceases operation of a school.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The principle of striking the offending condition subsequent and thereby creating an absolute estate, as applied in <em>Meek, </em>does not control this case because the provision at issue here is not a condition subsequent. Rather, this provision is a special limitation. Further, the estate in personalty created here is defeasible subject to an executory limitation. <em>See Daniel </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>110 Va. 563, 566-67, 66 S.E. 850, 851-52 (1910) (estate was a fee subject to executory limitation and not determinable fee because future interest was created in third person following defeasible fee, and not possibility of reverter in grantor or his heirs).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Professor Minor explains that \u201cspecial limitations are created by such words as \u2018while,\u2019 \u2018during,\u2019 \u2018as long as,\u2019 \u2018until,\u2019 etc. Thus, a grant to A <em>until </em>Z returns from abroad; to a woman <em>while </em>she remains a widow, or <em>during </em>widowhood . . . , to D and his heirs <em>as long as </em>Y has heirs of his body ... , all these are special limitations and not conditions subsequent.\u201d 1 <em>Minor on Real Property </em>\u00a7 525 at 690 (Ribble ed. 1928). \u201cLimitations differ from conditions subsequent in this: A limitation marks the <em>utmost time of continuance </em>of an estate; a condition marks some event, which, if it happens in the course of that time, is to <em>defeat the </em>estate.\u201d <em>Id., quoted in Meek, </em>118 Va. at 778, 88 S.E. at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In the granting clauses of Adams\u2019 will, he repeatedly specified that each educational beneficiary\u2019s right to receive income extended only \u201cso long as\u201d the beneficiary complied with the restrictive provision. But, if an educational beneficiary violated the restrictive provision by the matriculation of a black student, that beneficiary\u2019s interest would terminate, and the gift would devolve to successive educational beneficiaries who had not violated the provision. Further, Adams makes his intent clear in clause (b) that the creation of the educational beneficiaries\u2019 rights to receive income \u201cshall be determinable\u201d upon the happening of the contingency and that \u201call rights\u201d of those institutions, successively to receive income from the trust \u201cshall automatically terminate.\u201d Clearly this is language of limitation and not condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Meek </em>makes clear that if the provision in that case had been a limitation, although equally offensive to the public policy against restraints on marriage, the Court could not have found it void. \u201cHence, while an estate limited \u2018to A in fee, but if he attempts to alien his estate then to B in fee,\u2019 would give A an absolute estate and in fee, free from condition, because the condition is an unreasonable restraint of alienation and void, yet a limitation \u2018to A until he attempts to alien, and then to B,\u2019 would be a perfectly good limitation, and upon A\u2019s attempt his estate would cease and go over to B.\u201d 118 Va. at 779-80, 88 S.E. at 162-63. Although it did not address the issue of what happens when a gift subject to a special limitation offends constitutional considerations, the essential nature of a limitation as described by the Court in <em>Meek </em>points to the decision of the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">In the words of Minor, a limitation marks the utmost time of continuance of the estate. And, a limitation cannot be altered to extend \u201cbeyond that period without violating the terms of the devise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 88 S.E. at 162. If a condition subsequent is unlawful, a court can merely excise the offending language and leave the remaining estate intact. But, where a gift or estate subject to a limitation is unlawful, in order to cure the defect the court must terminate the entire gift or estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Therefore, unlike in <em>Meek, </em>the interests of the educational charities fail completely. And, this is not because we give effect to an invalid trust provision. Rather, we strike the entire gift to Prince Edward and the gifts to the other educational beneficiaries because the offending language cannot be stricken from the provision without changing the essential nature and quality of the estate. <em>See Evans </em>v. <em>Abney, </em>396 U.S. 435, 444-45 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">It necessarily follows from the foregoing that, while the gifts to all the beneficiaries of Adams\u2019 charitable educational trust must fail, the executory interest of Hermitage survives. Adams did not place any unconstitutional limitations upon Hermitage\u2019s interest. And, as all prior estates have been declared invalid, Hermitage has the only valid, remaining interest. The trial court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Because we find that the provision is a limitation, the same final result would be reached if we found that the trust\u2019s provisions were constitutional, as we have said earlier. By the natural operation of this limitation, if it were valid, upon the matriculation of a black student into Prince Edward, the school\u2019s interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>terminated. And, because as counsel have represented, the educational institutions have all admitted black students, their respective interests in the trust proceeds can never vest into possession. Hermitage would be the ultimate beneficiary since no limitations are placed on its interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Finally, we reject the contentions of Seven Hills School and Miller School that, once the restrictive provisions are declared invalid the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine should b.e applied and evidence taken to determine the testator\u2019s intent in view of the changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The doctrine is codified in Code \u00a7 55-31, which provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cWhen any . . . person gives, bequeaths, . . . any . . . property in trust to or for any educational, charitable or eleemosynary purpose, the indefiniteness or uncertainty of the beneficiaries named in any instrument creating such a gift, bequest ... or the indefiniteness of the purpose of the trust itself, shall not defeat any such trust and, ... it shall be administered to conform as near as may be to the purpose for which created or, if impossible of performance for this purpose, for some other educational, charitable, benevolent or eleemosynary purpose . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Here, there is no indefiniteness or uncertainty regarding the beneficiaries or purpose of the trust. Moreover, there is a valid gift over to Hermitage, as we have said, and this eliminates any need for the court to search for the testator\u2019s intent. Under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to look beyond the four corners of the testamentary documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that <em>cy pres </em>is inapplicable. We will reverse the ruling that the trust income will be paid to Prince Edward. Instead, we will enter final judgment here ordering the trustee to pay all' retained trust income and future trust income to Hermitage.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Thus, the final decree of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
