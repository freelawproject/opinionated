A few weeks after the building permits were issued, the area was flooded during a storm. On June 23, 1983, Claude G. Cooper, a Fairfax County building official, revoked the permits on the ground that the applications \u201cdid not contain complete and accurate information regarding soil and drainage conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">On October 1, 1984, Occoquan appealed Cooper\u2019s revocation to the Fairfax County Board of Building Code Appeals (the local board). The local board ordered restoration of the building permits, conditioned upon \u201cfull compliance with the Building Code and accompanied by Engineering Documentation on establishing flood plains and a Soils Report on each lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On November 19, 1984, Occoquan appealed the local board\u2019s action to the State Building Code Technical Review Board (the state board). After hearing evidence on January 11, 1985, the state board took the matter under advisement. On February 22, 1985, the state board amended the local board\u2019s decision to provide that restoration of the permit should be conditioned only upon compliance with \u201cthe provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code in effect at the time the permits were issued.\u201d The state board\u2019s order recites that the decision was entered on February 22, 1985; however, its chairman signed the order reflecting the decision on April 2, 1985, and the secretary of the state board attested it on April 8, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Pursuant to Fairfax County\u2019s motion, on June 28, 1985, the state board reconsidered the matter, heard additional evidence and argument, and indicated to the parties that it adhered to its original conclusion. Later, the chairman of the state board signed the final order which confirmed its previous ruling. The final order concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>This Decision has been entered this <em>28th </em>day of June, 1984 [sic]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\">/s/ Bernard E.

On August 21, 1985, in purported compliance with Rule 2A:2, dealing with notices of appeal under the Administrative Process Act, Cooper, Jane W. Gwinn, Zoning Administrator for Fairfax County, and the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County (collectively the county) mailed a notice of appeal to the state board\u2019s secretary. It was apparently received on August 22, 1985. On September 17, 1985, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 2A:4, the county filed its petition for appeal in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, naming Occoquan and the state board as appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The trial court sustained Occoquan\u2019s motion to dismiss the county\u2019s appeal on the ground that it had not been filed within the time required by Rule 2A:2. Rule 2A:2 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny party appealing from a . . . case decision shall file, within 30 days after . . . entry of the final order in the case decision, with the agency secretary a notice of appeal signed by him or his counsel.\u201d Additionally, the trial court found that even if the notice of appeal had been properly filed, there was no error in the state board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">The county appealed the trial court\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeals. On March 7, 1989, that court reversed the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the trial court and entered final judgment for the county. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Occoquan Land Development Corp., </em>8 Va. App. 1, 377 S.E.2d 631 (1989). We granted Occoquan this appeal, deeming the issues raised to have significant precedential value. Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">First, we must decide whether the county failed to file a timely notice of appeal, as the trial court ruled. If so, the trial court had no further jurisdiction in the matter, and we need not consider the county\u2019s substantive claims. <em>See Upshur </em>v. <em>Haynes Furniture Co., </em>228 Va. 595, 597, 324 S.E.2d 653, 654 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The county advances four reasons why it did not lose its right to appeal. We find no merit in any of those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">First, the county argues that the state board\u2019s responsive pleading contains a judicial admission which is dispositive of the issue. The county\u2019s petition for appeal to the circuit court alleged, and the state board\u2019s answer admitted, that \u201con <em>July 23, 1985, </em>the [state] Board reaffirmed the April 8, 1985, decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Assuming, but not deciding, that this was a judicial admission, it does not bind Occoquan, which was not in privity with the state board. <em>See Wytheville Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Frick, </em>96 Va. 141, 144, 30 S.E. 491, 491-92 (1898); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>White, </em>94 Va. 236, 242, 26 S.E. 573, 575 (1897). Moreover, a court cannot acquire jurisdiction by a party\u2019s consent to the existence of what we find in this opinion to be an erroneous fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Second, the county notes that, but for an exception inapplicable here, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:14 requires final decisions or orders of state agencies to \u201cbe served upon the private parties by mail.\u201d The county contends that the 30-day period set forth in Rule 2A:2 could not begin to run until the state board complied with this mandatory service requirement. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:14, however, does not deal with appeals but only with the duties of the various agencies. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16(A), on the other hand, specifically provides for judicial review by \u201can appropriate and timely court action against the agency as such or its officers or agents in the manner provided by the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u201d Therefore, the 30-day period specified in Rule 2A:2 begins to run upon \u201centry of the final order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Third, the county maintains that the date upon which the state board\u2019s decision was \u201centered\u201d is unclear. According to the county, the date of entry might be June 28, 1985, in which event its due process rights might have been violated because notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the order\u2019s entry was not mailed until July 23, 1985, and was not delivered until more than 30 days after the decision, too late to file a notice of appeal. Rule 2A:2, however, clearly provides that the appeal period begins upon the \u201centry of the [board\u2019s] final order.\u201d In an analogous context, dealing with appeals from final judgments of trial courts, we have held that a judgment is not ordinarily \u201centered\u201d upon its oral pronouncement; its \u201centry\u201d occurs when the judge <em>signs </em>an order prepared by counsel or the court, reflecting the judgment previously pronounced. <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Ellyson, </em>207 Va. 423, 430-31, 150 S.E.2d 104, 110 (1966); <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>Dye, </em>193 Va. 390, 393-94, 69 S.E.2d 459, 462-63 (1952). Accordingly, the 30-day period within which the county was required to file its notice of appeal began on July 20, 1985, the date the state board\u2019s chairman signed the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\">The flexible standard of due process does not require any particular form of procedure and its requirements are non-technical, <em>Klimko </em>v. <em>Virginia Empl. Comm\u2019n, </em>216 Va. 750, 760, 222 S.E.2d 559, 568, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 849 (1976). Thus, we conclude that in this case the county had a reasonable time in which to file its notice of appeal, and its due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Finally, the county relies upon Rule 1:7, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Whenever a party is required or permitted under these Rules to do an act within a prescribed time after service of a paper upon him and the paper is served by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The county, however, was not required to file its appeal \u201cwithin a prescribed time after <em>service </em>of\u2019 the order upon it; instead, it was required to file within 30 days of the <em>entry </em>of the final order. Therefore, Rule 1:7 does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We conclude that the county failed to perfect its appeal in a timely manner and, therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the case. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and, pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-681, we will enter final judgment for Occoquan.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\"> The parties agreed that the date of June 28, 1984, appearing in the final order, was a typographical error and that it should have been June 28, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
