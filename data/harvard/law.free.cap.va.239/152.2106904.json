Any sole proprietor or the partners shall, upon such election, be entitled to employee benefits and be subject to employee responsibilities prescribed in this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">When any partner or proprietor is entitled to receive coverage under this title, such person shall be subject to all provisions of the Act as if he were an employee, provided, however, that the notices required under \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-51, 65.1-85 and 65.1-86 of this title shall be given to the insurance carrier and that the panel of physicians required under \u00a7 65.1-88 shall be selected by the insurance carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On December 7, 1985, while inspecting and attempting to repair an industrial vacuum on the roof of a plant owned by Stone Hopewell, Inc. and Stone Container Corporation (collectively Stone), Cecil R. Counts, Jr., one of Ace\u2019s partners, fell through a hole in the roof. As a result of his fall, Counts sustained serious injuries, including brain damage. Charlotte D. Counts was later appointed as his guardian. Because of his injuries, Counts and his guardian were awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits on December 18, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On December 4, 1987, the guardian filed this common-law negligence action against Stone. Stone moved for summary judgment, alleging that because it was Counts\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under the act, his common-law remedy was precluded by Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-29 and -40. Those sections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">When any person (in this section and \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-31 and 65.1-32 referred to as \u201cowner\u201d) undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-31 to 65.1-34 referred to as \u201csubcontractor\u201d) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Code \u00a7 65.1-29.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Act respectively to pay and accept compensation on account of personal injury or death by accident shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury, loss of service or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Code \u00a7 65.1-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The trial court found that Counts had voluntarily elected to be bound by the provisions of the act pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2, and because he was engaged in an activity that was part of Stone\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, Counts was Stone\u2019s \u201cstatutory employee\u201d under the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-29. Therefore, the court sustained Stone\u2019s jurisdictional plea based on the exclusive remedy provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-40 and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Contending that the trial court erroneously applied Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 in this case, the guardian appeals. She offers a number of reasons why this code section is inapplicable; we find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">First, the guardian maintains that Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 is merely intended to permit self-employed individuals to purchase workers\u2019 compensation for themselves, not to confer \u201cwindfall immunity\u201d on a tortfeasor such as Stone. She says that \u201c[t]he statutory legal fiction that Counts is an \u2018employee\u2019 was never intended to shield Stone with the protected status of a statutory employer under [Code] \u00a7 65.1-29 when under no circumstances could Stone ever be liable to pay Chip Counts compensation as its statutory employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The guardian considers only a part of Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2. Although the statutory provision ensures Counts\u2019s entitlement to employee benefits upon his election and entitlement to coverage, it also makes him \u201csubject to employee responsibilities prescribed in this title\u201d and \u201csubject to <em>all </em>provisions of the Act as if he were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>an employee.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 (emphasis added). One of the provisions to which Counts subjected himself upon his election and entitlement to coverage is the exclusive remedy provision of Code \u00a7 65.1-40, which precludes this common-law action.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Moreover, assuming but not deciding, that even if Stone could not have been liable to pay Counts workers\u2019 compensation benefits, as the guardian argues, it would make no difference. We rejected a similar argument in two cases similar to this one in which the defendants\u2019 immunity pleas were sustained, despite the fact that neither of the defendants could have been liable to pay compensation benefits to the injured workers. <em>See Whalen </em>v. <em>Dean Steel Co., </em>229 Va. 164, 171, 327 S.E.2d 102, 106, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>474 U.S. 802 (1985) (subcontractor\u2019s plea of immunity sustained in common-law action brought by injured employee of general contractor); <em>Feitig </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>185 Va. 96, 107, 38 S.E.2d 73, 78 (1946) (fellow employee\u2019s plea of immunity sustained in common-law action brought by injured employee). As we said in Whalen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">As long as the injured worker has recourse to compensation from his own employer, or a statutory employer, he has the benefit of the <em>quid pro quo </em>upon which the compensation scheme is based, and it is immaterial whether he would have been entitled to claim compensation from other employers who are also under the canopy of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">229 Va. at 171, 327 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In a related argument, the guardian notes that because Counts paid the insurance premiums with his own funds, it would be unfair to give Stone the benefit of that coverage by extending immunity to it. This assertion ignores the broad sweep of the act\u2019s societal interests in: (1) charging the costs of an industrial accident to the industry involved through workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and (2) assuring that others involved in that industry are immune from further common-law liability arising from those industrial accidents which are covered by the act. <em>See Feitig, </em>185 Va. at 103-104, 38 S.E.2d at 76-77. We think that, in binding partners to the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-40 by way of Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2, the General Assembly considered that any insurance premiums paid by a partnership for individual coverage of its partners would ultimately be reflected in the cost of doing the va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>rious jobs on which the partners might be injured. Considered in that light, Stone, and all other statutory employers similarly situated, do ultimately bear the burden of compensation benefits paid to partners such as Counts who have been injured on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Next, the guardian contends that Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 creates an internal inconsistency in the act by impliedly authorizing Counts as an \u201cemployer\u201d to take money from Counts as an \u201cemployee\u201d to pay workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums in violation of Code \u00a7 65.1-107. This section provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]t shall not be lawful for any employer to deduct from the wages of any of his employees any part of the cost of insurance . . . or to require or permit any of his employees to contribute in any manner toward such cost of insurance.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-107. We find no such inconsistency. When the owners of a business pay their workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums from business assets, as Counts did in this case, the payment is a business expense they incur as owners rather than a deduction from an employee\u2019s wages. Therefore, such payments are not a violation of Code \u00a7 65.1-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Finally, the guardian insists that our decision in <em>Intermodal Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 364 S.E.2d 221 (1988), is controlling in this case. <em>Intermodal </em>involved a similar factual situation, except that nothing in the <em>Intermodal </em>record suggests that the injured party satisfied the election and notification requirements of Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, Counts explicitly elected to be covered by the act pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 and so notified the insurance carrier, as that code section requires. Therefore, <em>Intermodal </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Given the clarity of expression with which the legislature has conferred the benefits of the act upon persons in Counts\u2019s position and, likewise, the certainty with which it has imposed its burdens upon such persons, we apply the statute as written. Accordingly, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> We need not decide whether the trial court erred in permitting the defendants to file late pleadings pursuant to Rule 1:9, as the plaintiff contends. Whether the plaintiff has a common-law remedy is a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>Nolde Bros. </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>184 Va. 553, 560, 35 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1945), which may be raised at any time, even after a default judgment has been entered. <em>See Landcraft Co. </em>v. <em>Kincaid, </em>220 Va. 865, 870, 263 S.E.2d 419, 422 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> In fact, the <em>Intermodal </em>defendant never contended that Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2 barred the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
