Chapter 8, Title 18.2, Article 1.1 (Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-340.1 to -340.14).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In former Code \u00a7 18.2-340.2, the General Assembly provided that before an organization engages in any bingo game or raffle, it \u201cshall be required to obtain an annual permit from the governing body <em>... or from a local official, designated by the governing body.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Additionally, an organization\u2019s records of receipts and disbursements must be filed annually \u201cwith a local official designated by the local governing body,\u201d former Code \u00a7 18.2-340.6. Former Code \u00a7 18.2-340.10 provided that \u201c[t]he <em>governing body . . . </em>may deny, suspend or revoke the permit of any organization found not to be in strict compliance with the [statute].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Before a bingo or raffle permit may be denied, suspended, or revoked, however, the <em>local governing body </em>must conduct a hearing to determine whether the organization is in compliance. Former Code \u00a7 18.2-340.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">To facilitate regulation of bingo games and raffles within the localities, Code \u00a7 18.2-340.8 authorizes local governing bodies to \u201cadopt an ordinance, not in conflict with the provisions of [Article 1.1].\u201d Pursuant to this enabling statute, the council of the City of Richmond (the City) adopted ordinances regulating bingo and raffles in the City. Section 4-55 of the City Code provides that \u201c[t]he director of finance may deny, suspend or revoke the permit of any organization found not to be in strict compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>provisions of this article,\u201d and Section 4-57 empowers the City\u2019s director of finance to conduct the hearing to determine whether the permit should be denied, suspended, or revoked. Richmond, Va., City Code (1985 &amp; Supp. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">On January 13, 1986, the City issued a bingo permit to Confrere Club of Richmond, Virginia, Inc. (Confrere). Thereafter, the City auditor\u2019s staff conducted a field audit of Confrere\u2019s records for the three-month period ending September 30, 1986. The audit disclosed violations of certain accounting and recording regulations adopted by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">On June 16, 1987, the City\u2019s director of finance conducted a hearing to determine whether Confrere\u2019s bingo permit should be suspended or revoked as a result of the violations disclosed by the audit. After a hearing, the director of finance suspended Confrere\u2019s permit for a period of 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Confrere appealed the director\u2019s decision to the trial court, Code \u00a7 18.2-340.12, and the suspension was stayed pending the appeal. The trial court ruled that suspending a previously granted permit is one of the functions bestowed by the General Assembly only upon the \u201clocal governing body\u201d and that the authority to suspend the permit could not be delegated. The trial court vacated the suspension and remanded the case to the City \u201cfor such further proceedings as [the City] deem[ed] advisable.\u201d The City appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In determining the legislative powers of local governing bodies, Virginia follows the Dillon Rule of strict construction. The Dillon Rule provides that municipal corporations possess and can exercise only those powers expressly granted by the General Assembly, those necessarily or fairly implied therefrom, and those that are essential and indispensable. <em>Stallings </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>235 Va. 313, 315-16, 367 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1988); <em>County Board </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. 341, 344, 329 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1985); <em>Tabler </em>v. <em>Fairfax County, </em>221 Va. 200, 202, 269 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1980); <em>Hylton </em>v. <em>Prince William Co., </em>220 Va. 435, 440, 258 S.E.2d 577, 581 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arlington County Bd., </em>217 Va. 558, 573-74, 232 S.E.2d 30, 40 (1977); <em>Bd. of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>216 Va. 113, 117, 215 S.E.2d 453, 455-56 (1975); <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>County Board, </em>199 Va. 679, 684, 101 S.E.2d 641, 644-45 (1958); <em>Donable </em>v. <em>Harrisonburg, </em>104 Va. 533, 535, 52 S.E. 174, 175 (1905); <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>93 Va. 711, 714, 25 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1896). If there is any reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>whether legislative power exists, that doubt must be resolved against the local governing body. Stallings, 235 Va. at 316, 367 S.E.2d at 497; <em>Winchester, </em>93 Va. at 714, 25 S.E. at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">However, when a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning must be accepted without resort to extrinsic evidence or to the rules of construction. Legislative intent is determined from the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>234 Va. 4, 11, 360 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1987); <em>Va. Dept. of Labor </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 99, 353 S.E.2d 758, 760-61 (1987); <em>Ambrogi </em>v. <em>Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 386, 297 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1982). When legislative intent is plain, we must respect it and give it effect. <em>Arlington County Bd., </em>217 Va. at 579, 232 S.E.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The legislative scheme makes clear that, with respect to matters in which limited discretion is exercised, a local official designated by the governing body is empowered to act. When, however, the issue is whether a permit previously granted should be suspended or revoked, broad discretion is involved. In such circumstances, the General Assembly clearly and unequivocally granted such power only to the local governing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Because the General Assembly expressly granted to City Council alone the power to suspend a permit, Council was powerless to delegate that authority to the director of finance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the director\u2019s actions were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-11\"> This appeal involves Article 1.1 as it existed prior to its amendment in 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\"><em> </em>In 1989, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-340.10 and -340.12 to provide that \u201cthe local official or board designated by the governing body,\u201d as well as the governing body, may deny, suspend, or revoke a permit.
