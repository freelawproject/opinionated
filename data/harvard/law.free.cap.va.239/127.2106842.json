Page, James L. Page, Walter R. Page, and Lawrence J. Page formed a general partnership known as Page-Holland Partnership (the partnership) for the purpose of acquiring, owning, and developing a tract of land on Holland Road in Virginia Beach. The partnership entered into a number of contracts to facilitate the construction of a building which it planned to rent to a car dealer. One such contract was with Richard D. Hook, a self-employed architect, to design and supervise the construction of the building. Another contract was with Lasal Construction Company (Lasal) to construct the building. Lasal then subcontracted the masonry work to Commonwealth Masonry, Inc. (Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On September 23, 1986, Richard W. Evans, a laborer employed by Lasal, was injured while working near a masonry wall, constructed by Commonwealth, which collapsed on him. Evans sued Hook and Commonwealth, alleging that his injuries were the result of Hook\u2019s individual negligence and the negligence of Commonwealth\u2019s employees. Hook and Commonwealth filed pleas contesting the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court on the ground that Evans\u2019s remedy was limited to the benefits provided by the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the act).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The trial court sustained the pleas and Evans appeals only the judgment in Hook\u2019s favor. After granting Evans\u2019s appeal, we permitted the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects to file a brief <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of Hook\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Hook contends that he is entitled to the immunity provided by Code \u00a7 65.1-40. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Act respectively to pay and accept compensation on account of personal injury or death by accident shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury, loss of service or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Although they are not common-law employers of injured workers, independent contractors who are subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-29 (imposing liability upon owners for payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>compensation benefits to employees of subcontractors) have been characterized as \u201cstatutory employers,\u201d <em>see Cinnamon </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>238 Va. 471, 474, 384 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1989). Also, the injured workers making claims against such parties are considered \u201cstatutory employees.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Construction Company, </em>201 Va. 266, 272, 110 S.E.2d 396, 400 (1959), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>363 U.S. 719 (1960). Code \u00a7 65.1-29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">When any person (in this section and \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-31 and 65.1-32 referred to as \u201cowner\u201d) undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-31 to 65.1-34 referred to as \u201csubcontractor\u201d) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>232 Va. 302, 351 S.E.2d 14 (1986), we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 65.1-29] and related provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to bring within the operation of the Act all persons engaged in work that is part of the trade, business, or occupation of the party who undertakes as owner or who contracts as contractor to perform the work, and to make liable to every employee engaged in the work every such owner, contractor, or subcontractor above such employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 305, 351 S.E.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On the other hand, as we pointed out in <em>Smith, </em>a common-law action may be brought against an \u201cother party\u201d under the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-41. 232 Va. at 306, 351 S.E.2d at 16. Code \u00a7 65.1-41 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">The making of a lawful claim against an employer for compensation under this Act for the injury ... of his employee shall operate as an assignment to the employer of any right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to recover damages which the injured employee . . . may have against <em>any other party </em>for such injury . . . .[<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">(Emphasis added.) We described that \u201cother party\u201d as \u201cone who is a stranger to the employment and the work and who is thus not within the scope of the exclusion of \u00a7 65.1-40.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>232 Va. at 306, 351 S.E.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Because statutory employers are not \u201cstranger[s] to the employment and work\u201d of the owner, they are not \u201cother parties\u201d under the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-41. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, even though they are independent contractors and are not the injured employees\u2019 common-law employers, they are under the canopy of the act and entitled to the immediate employers\u2019 statutory immunity from common-law actions provided by Code \u00a7 65.1-40. <em>See, e.g., Conlin </em>v. <em>Turner\u2019s Express, Inc., </em>229 Va. 557, 559, 331 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1985); <em>Floyd, Administratrix </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>203 Va. 269, 274, 123 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1962); <em>Rea, Administratrix </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>198 Va. 712, 716-17, 96 S.E.2d 92, 95-96 (1957). Moreover, even though such an independent contractor may not have been liable for payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the injured employee, he is still entitled to such immunity. <em>See Anderson, </em>201 Va. at 272, 110 S.E.2d at 400 (injured employee of one contractor suing another contractor); <em>Rea, Administratrix, </em>198 Va. at 717, 96 S.E.2d at 95-96 (personal representative of deceased employee of principal contractor suing subcontractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Similarly, because he is not a \u201cstranger to the employment,\u201d an allegedly negligent employee of one contractor, engaged in the same business or project of an owner as an injured employee of another contractor, is not an \u201cother party\u201d amenable to suit under Code \u00a7 65.1-41. <em>See Smith, </em>232 Va. at 307, 351 S.E.2d at 17. Therefore, although not a statutory employer, a fellow statutory employee is still entitled to such immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Evans contends that because Hook has no employees and is an independent contractor, he cannot be a statutory employer as described in <em>Cinnamon, </em>nor can he be a fellow statutory employee of Evans, as described in <em>Smith. </em>Accordingly, Evans concludes that Hook must be an \u201cother party,\u201d subject to common-law actions under the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>However, a defendant\u2019s business structure and number of employees have never been considerations in deciding whether he is entitled to the act\u2019s immunity. Instead, as we have pointed out, the issue turns on the defendant\u2019s relation to the project on which the plaintiff was injured. <em>Cinnamon, </em>238 Va. 471, 384 S.E.2d 618; <em>Smith, </em>232 Va. 302, 351 S.E.2d 14; <em>Conlin, </em>229 Va. 557, 331 S.E.2d 453; <em>Floyd, Administratrix, </em>203 Va. 269, 123 S.E.2d 369; <em>Rea, Administratrix, </em>198 Va. 712, 96 S.E.2d 92. Indeed, citing <em>Floyd, Administratrix </em>and <em>Rea, Administratrix, </em>we have held that a defendant, who had no employees and caused injury to another\u2019s employee while both were engaged in the owner\u2019s business, was not an \u201cother party\u201d and thus was entitled to the act\u2019s immunity from common-law actions. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>204 Va. 309, 315, 130 S.E.2d 582, 586-87 (1963). We said that it did not matter whether the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">was an independent contractor or a fellow-servant of the plaintiff. . . . The purpose of the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act is to limit recovery to all persons engaged in the business of the employer to compensation under the Act and to deny an injured person the right of recovery against any other person unless he is a stranger to the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 315, 130 S.E.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Evans contends that the recent case of <em>Intermodal Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 364 S.E.2d 221 (1988), overrules <em>Lucas </em>to the extent that it held that the defendant in that case was an \u201cother party\u201d against whom a common-law action could be maintained. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Evans fails to recognize that before an employee can claim the benefits of the act, or be subject to its restrictions, he must be considered an employee under its terms. The <em>Intermodal </em>plaintiff, an independent contractor vis-a-vis the defendant, was simply <em>not </em>an employee under the act and, therefore, was not subject to its limitations in bringing his common-law action, even though the defendant was not a stranger to the employment. <em>Intermodal, </em>234 Va. at 602, 364 S.E.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">On the other hand, the plaintiff in <em>Lucas was </em>an employee within the meaning of the act, and the defendant, who was not a stranger to the plaintiffs employment, was either a fellow-employee or an independent contractor entitled to statutory immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>nity from the injured employee\u2019s common-law action. <em>Lucas, </em>204 Va. at 315, 130 S.E.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">If, as Evans contends, Hook and others similarly situated are amenable to common-law actions brought by workers injured on the same job, they would obviously adjust their future contract prices to meet this contingency. As a result, those persons who bear the burden of workers\u2019 compensation payments, as owners, employers, and statutory employers, would ultimately bear the additional cost of protecting against such common-law claims. Such a construction of the act would defeat one of its primary purposes, which is to limit the burden of those responsible for the cost of industrial accidents to the payment of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Lucas, </em>204 Va. at 315, 130 S.E.2d at 586; <em>Feitig v. Chalkley, </em>185 Va. 96, 102, 38 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court correctly sustained Hook\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction of the court, and the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> Hook does not raise the issue, and we do not decide, whether the assignment provisions of this section are sufficient to preclude this action by Evans in his own right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
