As pertinent, the section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">The signature of an attorney . . . constitutes a certificate by him that (i) he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, (ii) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law . . . and (iii) it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed or made in violation of the rule, the court . . . shall impose upon the person who signed the paper or made the motion, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper or making of the motion, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Seeking to have a rezoning ordinance declared invalid, Morton Rau, Anita Rau, and Reinhold C. Dedi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (collectively Rau) filed a petition for a declaratory judgment, attorney\u2019s fees, and other relief against the Board of Supervisors of Prince William County (the board) and others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition averred that because of procedural irregularities, the board had no jurisdiction to rezone approximately 24 acres near Rau\u2019s land in Prince William County and, therefore, that its rezoning ordinance was void. In response, the board\u2019s attorney filed pleadings contending that the rezoning action was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On February 7, 1989, after hearing evidence and argument, the trial court ruled orally that the rezoning ordinance was invalid. On June 12, 1989, it imposed sanctions upon the board for a violation of Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1, and awarded Rau a judgment against the board for $6,078, based on his attorney\u2019s fees incurred in prosecuting the suit. The board appeals only the award of sanctions, which was included in the final order deciding the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">First, we review the facts giving rise to the litigation in order to decide the sanctions issue. On September 16, 1987, at a public hearing before the Prince William County Planning Commission (the commission), to which the matter had been referred, a landowner requested that the parcel in question be rezoned. Rau and other nearby property owners spoke in opposition to the proposed rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">After the commission heard arguments by both sides and discussed the matter, Commissioner Hefter moved to continue the public hearing until a fixed date during the following month. The motion was seconded. Prior to a vote on the motion, Commissioner Gray offered a \u201csubstitute\u201d motion to recommend denial of the rezoning. Gray\u2019s motion was seconded and passed by a four-to-three vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">No one said that a further vote on the substitute motion was required;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> therefore, the commission treated its vote on the substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tute motion as dispositive, and it went on to other matters. After the meeting, the commission sent an attested copy of its resolution to the board, recommending denial of the rezoning petition. Shortly thereafter, the board published its first notice of a public hearing on the matter, which was scheduled for October 20, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"ANrr\">Later, Guy Anthony Guiffre, a board member, contacted John H. Foote, the County Attorney for Prince William County, for an opinion regarding the validity of the commission\u2019s action in light of the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-493(B). This statute provides that a board of supervisors cannot act upon a rezoning request until after it has received its planning commission\u2019s recommendation .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In a memorandum dated October 7, 1987, Foote opined that <em>Robert\u2019s Rules of </em>Order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required a second vote on the substitute motion. He described the deficiency as \u201ca small procedural irregularity [which] might be seized upon to assail the County\u2019s ultimate decision. . . .\u201d Foote suggested that the deficiency could be corrected by taking another vote at a scheduled commission meeting later that day. At that meeting, however, only six members were present, and there was a tie vote on the motion. The commission then treated the matter as deferred for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Some time before the board\u2019s October 20 public meeting, the board\u2019s chairman was told of the commission\u2019s tie vote. The Director of Planning for Prince William County advised him that the commission had failed to \u201ccomplete its recommendation while the ninety-day clock was still ticking.\u201d Nevertheless, the board\u2019s chairman directed that the advertisement for the public hearing continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">During the board\u2019s executive session on the evening prior to its October 20 public hearing, Foote discussed his October 7 memorandum. The board\u2019s chairman disagreed with Foote\u2019s opinion because he believed that the commission\u2019s resolution of September 16 overcame the procedural deficiency. Furthermore, one board member testified that Foote did not advise the board that it had no right to consider and vote upon the rezoning matter. During its October 20 meeting, attended by all board members and held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>without objection as to the manner in which the chairman had scheduled it, the board voted to approve the rezoning application. As a result, this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We must determine whether the board\u2019s defense was unreasonable in light of the alleged irregularities which occurred during the commission\u2019s meeting on September 16. To establish a basis for sanctions, the record and existing law must be sufficient to establish that, after reasonable inquiry, the board could not have formed a reasonable belief that its defense was \u201cwarranted by existing law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We need not decide whether the board\u2019s position was <em>actually </em>\u201cwarranted by existing law.\u201d In assessing conduct which is allegedly in violation of Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1, we apply an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Tullidge </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>239 Va. 611, 613, 391 S.E.2d 288, 289 (1990) (this day decided). We also resolve any doubts in favor of the board, and eschew the wisdom of hindsight. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 391 S.E.2d at 290. Furthermore, as \u201cthe issue is one of law, and not fact, we do not accord the trial court\u2019s ruling the same weight it would be accorded if reached upon conflicting factual evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 391 S.E.2d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We think that the board reasonably could have concluded that the September 16 resolution was a valid recommendation. Ample authority exists for the principle that \u201c[m]ere failure to conform to parliamentary usage will not invalidate [an] action when the requisite number of members have agreed to the particular measure.\u201d 4 E. McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 13.42a (3d ed. 1985 &amp; Supp. 1989); <em>see also </em>1 J. Sutherland, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 7.04 (4th ed. 1985 &amp; Supp. 1989). Therefore, at the very least, the board had reasonable cause to believe that the commission could and did waive one of its parliamentary rules, based on the commission\u2019s September 16 resolution recommending denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Furthermore, although Rau argues that the commission\u2019s October 7 meeting resulted in \u201cno recommendation,\u201d the record does not show that the commission rescinded or modified its September 16 recommendation. We consider the commission\u2019s \u201cno recommendation\u201d of October 7 to be in conflict with its previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>recommendation of denial. Opinion 34 of the American Institute of Parliamentarians indicates that \u201c [according to Robert, a motion is out of order and, if adopted, null and void if it conflicts with a motion previously adopted which has not been rescinded, or rejected after consideration.\u201d V. Schlotzhauer, W. Evans, J. Stipp, <em>Parliamentary Opinions </em>16 (1982) (published by the American Institute of Parliamentarians).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court erred in imposing sanctions. Under existing law, it was reasonable for the board to believe that it could treat the commission\u2019s September 16 resolution as a valid recommendation under Code \u00a7 15.1-493. Because the board reasonably believed that it was authorized to act on the rezoning request, it was justified in filing its defensive pleadings in this suit. Therefore, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment insofar as it imposed the sanction of payment of attorney\u2019s fees, will order the sanction expunged from the record, and will enter final judgment for the board on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> Leland Rearick and Katherine Rearick, who were also plaintiffs, were later granted a nonsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The defendants were: the County of Prince William, Virginia, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Prince William, and the Planning Commission of the County of Prince William.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-11\"> Hefter testified that he felt his motion had been defeated and that the motion to recommend denial had been adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\"> Code \u00a7 15.1-493 gives the planning commission a period of 90 days after its first public hearing to make a recommendation to the board. If it makes no recommendation within that period, the rezoning request is deemed approved by the planning commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> The parties agreed that <em>Robert's Rules of Order </em>governed the commission\u2019s parliamentary procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> We are not concerned with the issue of improper motive. <em>On </em>brief, Rau indicates that he does not know why the board decided to do what it did. He cites, and we find, nothing in the record which indicates an improper motive under Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
