The Roy Rogers (formerly Hot Shoppes, Jr.) restaurant is on premises leased to Marriott in the Pickett Shopping Center in the City of Fairfax. The proposed McDonald\u2019s restaurant is to be situated on premises it leased in 1986 from Combined across a street in the Fair City Mall, but only 785 feet from Marriott\u2019s demised premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Marriott relies on the following paragraph in a 40-year lease executed in 1967 between predecessors of Marriott and Combined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201c2.3 <em>Non-Competition. </em>Landlord covenants that Landlord will not at any time during the continuance of this Lease directly or indirectly engage primarily in the business of operating a drive-in food establishment within an area of 2,000 feet in any direction of the Leased Premises; nor will Landlord, except with respect to present tenants of property owned by Landlord presently engaged in such business, sell, rent, or permit any land owned or controlled by Landlord to be used for such purpose during such period in such area. With respect to property sold or leased by Landlord subject to the restrictions of this Section, appropriate covenants will be made a part of any deed or lease in order to accomplish the objectives hereof. Tenant agrees not to operate directly or indirectly a Hot Shoppes, Jr. within the above described area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Marriott asserted that drive-in food establishments in 1967 were what are now called fast-food restaurants, and that the prohibition of paragraph 2.3 applied to the proposed McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Accordingly, Marriott asked the trial court to declare the proposed establishment a violation of its lease and to permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>enjoin the landlord and McDonald\u2019s from constructing and operating the McDonald\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">The trial court overruled demurrers filed by defendants and, after amendments were made to the bill of complaint, the parties joined issue. The chancellor heard the evidence ore tenus during three days in May 1989 and ruled from the bench in favor of defendants. We awarded Marriott an appeal from the June 1989 final decree dismissing the amended bill. We also agreed to consider the landlord\u2019s assignments of cross-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">As the chancellor observed at the hearing, there is one, simple, dispositive issue in the case. Yet the parties have over-litigated the matter, building an unnecessarily large record and filing briefs that are verbose, duplicative, and overlong. Indeed, the parties even disagree on the statement of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The main question on appeal is whether the trial court erred in determining under the evidence that the term \u201cdrive-in food establishment\u201d had a common, ordinary meaning in 1967 and referred to a food establishment which, as an essential feature, permitted and encouraged customers to eat food in their motor vehicles while parked on the establishment\u2019s lot. The facts presented on the question were in conflict but, according to settled appellate principles, we will state them in the light most favorable to defendants, the parties prevailing below.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In 1967, when the lease was negotiated, there was no discussion between the parties\u2019 representatives about the meaning of the term \u201cdrive-in food establishment.\u201d The term was one of common usage and had no special, technical meaning in the food service or shopping-center leasing industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The language of the disputed covenant was proposed by Marriott. The evidence showed that other restaurant leases negotiated by Marriott contained restrictive covenants prohibiting specific restaurants or \u201chamburger-oriented restaurants\u201d as well as prohibiting \u201cself-service eat in or take out restaurants.\u201d None of these restrictive terms was proposed by Marriott because it \u201cwanted to include the term \u2018drive-in\u2019 in the restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">According to the evidence, there were two types of food service facilities in the 1960\u2019s called \u201cdrive-in food establishments.\u201d One consisted of facilities with carhop or curb service. The customer would park the vehicle on the lot and place an order, either in person to a carhop or through a \u201ccar phone.\u201d The food was brought to the parked vehicle and the customer would eat it there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Marriott\u2019s Hot Shoppes restaurants were examples of drive-in food establishments with carhop service. Throughout the 1960\u2019s, many Hot Shoppes restaurants had \u201cdrive-in capability\u201d and used the term \u201cdrive-in\u201d on their signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The second type of food establishments in the 1960\u2019s called \u201cdrive-ins\u201d had no carhop service. In those facilities, the customer parked the vehicle on the lot, walked to a service window, purchased the food, and returned to the vehicle, where the food was consumed. The McDonald\u2019s restaurants of the 1960\u2019s were examples of drive-in food establishments without curb service. By the late 1960\u2019s, this type of facility had become the more common; most of the carhops were \u201cgone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In 1967, when the lease in question was being negotiated, Marriott was competing in the \u201climited menu, fast service\u201d market in the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia area through its Hot Shoppes, Jr., facilities, which were known as \u201cdrive-in restaurants.\u201d Marriott was seeking \u201ca competitive edge against the market leader . . . McDonald\u2019s.\u201d According to the evidence, the term \u201cdrive-in\u201d was employed in the restrictive covenant \u201csimply because it was the key descriptive phrase of the day\u201d to describe the types of facilities Marriott was developing and the types of establishments operated by its competitors, mainly McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">During the late 1960\u2019s, the nature of the competition among drive-in food establishments was evolving. Owners of many food establishments were attempting to compete with drive-ins either by developing competitive restaurants that were not drive-ins or by changing formats of existing drive-in facilities. These changes included the use of indoor seating and the development of features that did not promote the \u201ceat in the car on the lot\u201d arrangement. For example, Marriott replaced the Hot Shoppes, Jr., facilities with its Roy Rogers restaurants to attract \u201cmore of an adult population.\u201d The drive-ins had acquired a negative image as places for people, primarily young persons, to loiter on the lot. These quick service establishments \u201cdidn\u2019t want the reputation of just \u2018drive-in.\u2019 \u201d McDonald\u2019s was among the establishments which changed over the years after 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The evolution of the McDonald\u2019s establishments is illustrated by the proposed facility which generated this controversy. In 1967, McDonald\u2019s \u201cdrive-in\u201d restaurants were red and white tile buildings with no dining rooms; customers were encouraged to consume food in their motor vehicles. Today, at least one-half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>McDonald\u2019s customers consume food on the premises in dining rooms seating from 100 to 350 persons. The focus is \u201con the pleasant experience of families eating at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d Approximately 50 percent of the food served by McDonald\u2019s is taken off the lot and consumed outside the restaurant. Presently, less than one percent of McDonald\u2019s food is eaten \u201cin cars on the parking lots.\u201d The proposed McDonald\u2019s will have approximately 122 seats with the construction cost of seating and interior decor to be about $125,000. It will have a \u201cdrive through\u201d feature whereby the customer places an order from the vehicle through a \u201cspeaker system,\u201d receives the food at a window, pays for the order, and drives away.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">The trial court, announcing its opinion from the bench at the conclusion of the trial, stated that the \u201coperative question . . . is what did the language, \u2018drive-in food establishment,\u2019 mean to the parties as it was used in this lease.\u201d The court determined \u201cthat a drive-in was a place to which one went and got quick service either at the car or at the window and was encouraged to, and most people did, eat the food in the car,\u201d stating that the proposed McDonald\u2019s is not that type of establishment. Accordingly, the court ruled.in the final decree that \u201cthe proposed construction and operation of the McDonald\u2019s restaurant... is not a violation of the prohibition of a drive-in food establishment in the non-competition clause\u201d of the lease in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">On appeal, Marriott argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the restrictive covenant was \u201cnot to provide protection from similar food competition,\u201d but only from restaurants where food was consumed \u201cin the car on the lot.\u201d Elaborating, Marriott says there was \u201cno dispute\u201d at trial that Hot Shoppes, Jr., and later Roy Rogers, \u201cwas what is now called a fast-food restaurant, that McDonald\u2019s in 1967 was also what is now called a fast-food restaurant, and that they were direct competitors and have remained so to this day, competing for the same customers with the same style of business and merchandise - fast food.\u201d Marriott contends that the trial court mistakenly was convinced \u201cthat the market threat perceived by Marriott, and at which the agreement was aimed, was not the sale of similar food products, but businesses whose building facilities were so limited that customers could not carry their food to indoor tables, but could only carry their food out to their car on the lot.\u201d We do not agree that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Where, as here, the terms of an agreement are clear and unambiguous, the language used will be taken in its ordinary signification, and the plain meaning will be ascribed to it. <em>Amos </em>v. Coffey, 228 Va. 88, 92, 320 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1984). And, specific words in a covenant will be given the common, ordinary meaning attributed to them at the time when the instrument containing the covenant was executed. <em>Elterich </em>v. <em>Leicht Real Estate Co., </em>130 Va. 224, 239, 107 S.E. 735, 740 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Disregarding the covenant\u2019s plain meaning, Marriott implicitly seeks to rewrite it to prohibit operation of a \u201cfast-food\u201d establishment which sells food products similar to those dispensed by Marriott\u2019s Roy Rogers. The difficulty with Marriott\u2019s position is that the clear language of the covenant fails to so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Upon conflicting evidence, the trial court determined that the term \u201cdrive-in food establishment\u201d meant in 1967 a facility which emphasized eating food in motor vehicles on the establishment\u2019s parking lot. Additionally, the trial court determined that the proposed McDonald\u2019s restaurant is not prohibited by the covenant because the present-day McDonald\u2019s facilities are no longer \u201cdrive-in food establishments\u201d as defined in 1967. When a chancellor, after hearing evidence ore tenus, makes findings of fact, the judgment based upon those findings will not be disturbed \u201cunless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Giannotti </em>v. <em>Hamway, </em>239 Va. 14, 23, 387 S.E.2d 725, 730 (1990). We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact were plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Additionally, the trial court correctly refused to endorse Marriott\u2019s view that the definition of the disputed term changed over time and applied to present McDonald\u2019s restaurants even though they are no longer \u201cdrive-ins\u201d in the 1967 sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Likewise, we reject Marriott\u2019s contention that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting expert testimony \u201cto interpret the intent\u201d of the restrictive covenant. McDonald\u2019s presented testimony from a university professor who taught courses in the subject of \u201cPopular Culture,\u201d and the witness gave his opinion on the 1967 meaning of \u201cdrive-in.\u201d Although allowing the testimony, the trial court stated, during the course of his oral opinion, \u201cI am frankly not impressed with the expert and don\u2019t rely heavily, if at all, on his testimony.\u201d Hence, even if we assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the court erred in admitting the testimony, the error was harmless in view of the trial court\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Turning to the landlord\u2019s assignments of cross-error, we find no merit in any of them. Initially, Combined argues that Marriott failed to prove it will suffer irreparable harm should the permanent injunction fail to issue. In view of our decision on Marriott\u2019s appeal, this issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The remaining assignments of cross-error attack the trial court\u2019s action in overruling the landlord\u2019s demurrer. One ground of Combined\u2019s demurrer was directed to the plaintiffs allegations (1) that the parties to the lease intended \u201cto restrict competition within the 2,000 foot radius\u201d from the Roy Rogers restaurant and (2) that the location of the proposed facility \u201cis within 2,000 feet of [Marriott\u2019s] leased premises.\u201d The landlord noted that the covenant speaks only of \u201ca drive-in food establishment within an area of 2,000 feet in any direction of the Leased Premises.\u201d It contended that, applying the appropriate mathematical formula by which \u201carea\u201d of a circle is determined (A=7rr2), a circle with a 50-foot diameter will \u201cencompass 2,000 feet.\u201d Attempting to restrict the reach of the covenant, the landlord contended that Marriott incorrectly injects into the measurement of the distance the concept of \u201cradius\u201d which, it said, \u201cis defined as a line segment extending from the center of a circle to the outer curve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In a letter opinion overruling the demurrer, the trial court addressed this issue. The trial court ruled: \u201cThere is absolutely no indication that the parties to the lease intended the word \u2018area\u2019 to be used in a geometric context. It is clear to this Court that \u2018area\u2019 is referring to the collective territory within a radius of 2000 feet from the [Marriott] restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The landlord makes the same argument on appeal, and we furnish the same response as the trial court. It- is equally clear to us that the rather absurd interpretation urged by the landlord was not within the intention of the parties to the lease. We hold that the plain meaning of the territorial restriction provides for inclusion of the collective territory within a radius of 2,000 feet from Marriott\u2019s demised premises, not within 50 feet as the landlord theorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The final issue raised on cross-error relates to the fact that Combined acquired the Fair City Mall property, upon which the proposed McDonald\u2019s will be situated, after the execution of the lease in 1967. Combined contended on demurrer, as on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>that \u201cMarriott could not enforce a restrictive non-competition covenant upon land not shown by the allegations of the Amended Bill of Complaint to have been within the contemplation of the original parties to the lease nor which was part of the original property interest of the lessor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The trial court correctly found no merit in this contention dealing with the supposed extra-territorial effect of the covenant. This covenant is personal to the landlord and does not run with the land; it bound the landlord not to allow competition during the term of the lease on \u201cany\u201d of its land within the 2,000-foot restriction. The restricted distance is over twice the distance from Marriott\u2019s demised premises to the farthest point of the shopping center owned by the original lessor. As the trial court noted, \u201cThis fact indicates that it was within the contemplation of the parties that the lessor might expand its enterprise at some future date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">For these reasons, the trial court\u2019s final decree will be</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
