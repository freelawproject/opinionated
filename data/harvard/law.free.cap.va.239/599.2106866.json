(Country Kitchen) contracted for group health insurance with Blue Cross of Southwestern Virginia and Blue Shield of Southwestern Virginia, now a single entity known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia (Blue Cross). In two group policies, Blue Cross agreed to provide certain health care benefits to Country Kitchen\u2019s employees during specific periods indicated in the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The \u201cbasic\u201d policy provided certain primary benefits for a limited period of time; the other policy supplemented the \u201cbasic\u201d policy and provided \u201cmajor medical\u201d benefits during specified periods. The \u201cbenefit period\u201d of both policies ran from September 1 through August 31 of each successive policy year. After giving notice, Country Kitchen could terminate coverage at the end of any period for which subscription dues had been paid. In that event, Blue Cross was obligated to continue paying the covered health care benefits of a participant who \u201cincurs Covered Expenses prior to the date of termination for any injury or illness commencing prior to the date of termination . . . but only for . . . one Benefit Period. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">On September 1, 1983, Leslie L. Wingfield, an employee of Country Kitchen, became a participant under both policies. Wingfield was given a booklet or brochure which outlined the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>icy benefits. The booklet stated that \u201c[n]o brochure, pamphlet or other publication outlining the benefits of your contract is a part of your contract.\u201d The booklet noted that \u201cif a participant is confined as a hospitalized patient in a hospital ... on the date of termination, coverage will continue for that hospital admission in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d The booklet ended with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\">THIS BROCHURE IS NOT A CONTRACT WITH BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD OF SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. IT IS A SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS. IF THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BOOKLET AND THE CONTRACT, THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT WILL GOVERN.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">On July 4, 1986, Wingfield was admitted to the Lynchburg General Hospital suffering from necrotizing pancreatitis. He was transferred to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) on July 8, 1986, where he remained throughout the period involved in this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Effective October 1, 1986, Country Kitchen terminated the coverages of both policies in accordance with their terms. Blue Cross paid Wingfield\u2019s covered expenses incurred through August 31, 1987, totalling $560,623.46, which the parties agree constituted full performance of its obligation through that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In this breach of contract action against Blue Cross, Wingfield sought payment of an additional $266,566.50 for allegedly covered hospital and medical expenses incurred from September 1, 1987, through June 20, 1988. The case was submitted to the trial court for decision upon stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Although Wingfield relied upon other conduct of Blue Cross to establish grounds for estoppel, the trial court entered judgment for Wingfield on the basis of estoppel only \u201cbecause of the difference in the language in the brochure furnished [Wingfield] and that in the contracts.\u201d Blue Cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Citing <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Richmond Life Ins. Co., </em>212 Va. 229, 233, 183 S.E.2d 132, 135 (1971), Wingfield correctly \u201cacknowledges the general rule in Virginia is that the coverage of an insurance contract may not be extended by estoppel or implied waiver to include <em>risks </em>not covered by its terms. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>nal.) He claims, however, that unlike the claims in <em>Sharp </em>and a subsequent similar case, <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>218 Va. 718, 728-29, 239 S.E.2d 902, 908 (1978), his claim \u201cdid not extend coverage to include risks excluded by the policy, but extended coverage only to the extent of increasing the quantum of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">Wingfield fails to recognize that neither policy grants unlimited coverage based solely on the illnesses described therein. On the contrary, the liability of Blue Cross is explicitly limited to payment of certain health care expenses incurred during specified periods of time. Thus the trial court\u2019s application of the doctrine of estoppel, requiring payment of benefits beyond the limited contractual time, extended coverage to include risks not covered by the policy. In doing so, the court erroneously brought \u201cinto being a contract of insurance where there was none.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 239 S.E.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
