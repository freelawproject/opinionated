Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (f).

Code \u00a7 17-110.1(A) and (F).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">According to familiar principles, we will state the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The record reveals that Smith, a 41-year old computer technician, resided with his spouse in a townhouse development in the City of Manassas, Prince William County.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On July 24, 1988, a Sunday, Mrs. Smith announced that she was \u201cgoing to her company picnic.\u201d She departed about noon without inviting Smith to accompany her, which caused him to feel \u201cpretty letdown.\u201d He began drinking, consuming \u201celeven beers\u201d between 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">That evening, Smith decided to go to Noble\u2019s Restaurant in Manassas to \u201cget something to eat.\u201d As he was leaving home, Mrs. Smith \u201cwas just driving in.\u201d They did not communicate with one another \u201cat that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">According to Pat Davis, manager of Noble\u2019s Restaurant, Smith, who frequented the place \u201cone or two times a week,\u201d arrived at the restaurant \u201caround 8:00 o\u2019clock.\u201d He had three beers and a hamburger dinner. He became \u201cobnoxious\u201d when he \u201cstarted talking about his . . . girlfriend.\u201d He stated that \u201c[h]e wanted [the girl friend] to move ... to Manassas, except his wife wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d He also said that \u201c[i]f he couldn\u2019t have his . . . girlfriend, he wanted to commit suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">When customers began complaining about Smith\u2019s behavior, Davis \u201casked him to vacate\u201d the premises even though he had not finished \u201cthe beer that he had in front\u201d of him. As he was leaving, the manager observed what \u201clook[ed] like a gun in the left side of his pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Smith left Noble\u2019s \u201cright at eight-thirty\u201d and returned home. When he arrived, Mrs. Smith \u201cwas not there\u201d and \u201csome of her personal belongings\u201d were missing. Smith \u201cbecame very upset\u201d and took a \u201c.357 Magnum out of the gun case.\u201d He then took an \u201cAR15\u201d rifle out of its gun case and \u201cput the bayonet on it.\u201d Finally, he took a \u201c.44 Magnum out,\u201d attached it to a \u201cweb belt,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and put clips \u201cfor the AR15\u201d in the \u201cweb belt pouches.\u201d He also loaded the AR-15 rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Linda and Emmett Cottrell were Smith\u2019s next-door neighbors. On the evening in question, Ms. Cottrell came out of her house and saw Smith sitting on his front porch. Referring to his wife, Smith asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the bitch?\u201d Ms. Cottrell replied that she did not know and left to visit a neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">About 8:45 p.m., Emmett Cottrell observed Smith sitting on the front steps of his home. Smith was holding a rifle with a bayonet \u201con the end of it,\u201d pointing \u201cstraight in the air.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant told Cottrell that \u201c[t]he bitch ha[d] left [him]\u201d and that he was \u201cnot going to make it through the night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Previously, Smith had discussed his personal affairs with the Cottrells\u2019 seventeen-year-old daughter, Chrissy. Smith told Chrissy that he was in love with his girl friend and that, if he could not have the girl, \u201cthen he didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d On the evening in question, Chrissy saw Smith sitting on his front porch, holding \u201ca big gun\u201d between his legs. She heard him say that \u201che hoped . . . somebody would call the cops because one way or another someone was going to die tonight.\u201d Chrissy then left to visit a neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">While Smith and Emmett Cottrell sat talking, Smith \u201cfired one round into the air.\u201d A few minutes later, \u201ckids across the street\u201d set off some fireworks, and Smith fired two rounds \u201cin that general direction.\u201d When Cottrell said he had \u201chad enough,\u201d Smith stated: \u201cI hope somebody calls the police because I\u2019ll shoot the first one that arrives and I hope they shoot me in return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Daniel Wood, another of Smith\u2019s neighbors, remonstrated with Smith about firing the weapon. Wood told Smith: \u201cYou know, sir, [you] shouldn\u2019t really do that\u201d and \u201c[y]ou\u2019re going to get yourself in some serious trouble.\u201d Smith replied: \u201cWell, hey, m_ f_, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. You wait till I start shooting people.\u201d Wood walked away, and Smith hollered: \u201cYes, that\u2019s all I\u2019m waiting [for] is [for] somebody [to] call the police . . . then you [will] really start seeing some shooting. I\u2019ll probably shoot the first one I see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Wood went into a neighbor\u2019s house and called the police. He urged the dispatcher \u201cto tell them to be on extreme caution because the man seems to mean business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Just before 9:00 p.m., a number of police officers arrived on the scene and parked where their vehicles would not arouse Smith\u2019s suspicions. Officer Anderson, in one of the units, observed Smith \u201csitting on his front porch.\u201d Anderson directed the dispatcher to \u201c[h]ave a unit cruise around ... to the rear of the townhouses.\u201d The dispatcher relayed the order to Sgt. John Conner, a uniformed officer, who indicated that \u201che was en route.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">At this point, Smith \u201cwas still on [his] front steps,\u201d but when \u201csome person . . . started across the street,\u201d Smith \u201cimmediately got up\u201d and went inside. In a few moments, Sgt. Conner reported on his portable radio: \u201cI\u2019ve got him in sight he\u2019s coming out the back door.\u201d Other officers proceeded toward the rear of the house, and one of them, James K. Ryan, heard Sgt. Conner say: \u201cDrop the rifle, drop the rifle now.\u201d Ryan then heard \u201cgunfire going off,\u201d consisting of \u201ceight to 12 . . . real sharp . . . cracks,\u201d followed by \u201ca short pop and after that . . . there was a succession of real sharp cracks again.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Ryan heard a man \u201cgroaning or . . . moaning\u201d and, when he ran around the end of a fence separating Smith\u2019s back yard from his neighbor\u2019s, he saw Sgt. Conner lying on the ground in a \u201cbare spot in the alleyway.\u201d Ryan observed \u201ca lot of blood around [Conner\u2019s] head and two wounds in his back.\u201d Ryan left Conner in the care of another officer and went to help subdue Smith, who was struggling with several officers some twenty to twenty-five feet from Conner\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Officer Steven Bamford \u201cstarted up the alleyway\u201d after he heard the shots fired. When he arrived at the rear of Smith\u2019s house, he saw Smith \u201ccrouching down [or sitting] next to the deck\u201d with \u201ca long barreled weapon laid across his lap.\u201d A light above the door to Smith\u2019s house \u201cshown back out onto the alleyway and that yard, [and] illuminated that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">As Bamford \u201ctook a step,\u201d Smith saw him and tried to \u201cput a magazine in the bottom of the weapon.\u201d Bamford attempted to \u201cget back out of the way,\u201d but slipped and fell. When he regained his feet, Smith started to get up, and Bamford pointed his shotgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>at him and yelled, \u201c[d]rop it\u201d several times. Smith said, \u201cI give up, I give up\u201d and dropped his rifle, which was still equipped with a bayonet.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Bamford told Smith to get down on his knees. Smith complied, but when Bamford ordered him to \u201cput his hands on the ground and walk out, to lay flat,\u201d Smith refused. A struggle ensued involving several officers, who were unable to \u201cget the rifle from under [Smith].\u201d When one of the officers said, \u201che\u2019s got another gun,\u201d Bamford kicked Smith in the face, but he continued to struggle. The struggle ended only after Smith had been placed in leg restraints and handcuffed behind his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">During the struggle, Smith told the officers to \u201c[g]o ahead and kill [him].\u201d After he was subdued, Smith said that Conner was the \u201cfirst priority, take care of him, take care of him. He\u2019s one of us, he\u2019s one of ours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Mortally wounded, Sgt. Conner died several hours later. In the gun battle with Smith, Conner suffered wounds to his right leg, right forearm, back, and head. The wound to the head, which caused \u201ca peach size section of skull [to be] missing,\u201d proved fatal. Gunpowder debris was found in the head wound, indicating the wound was caused by a gunshot fired within three feet if inflicted by a handgun or six feet if inflicted by a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Conner also suffered a wound to his left thigh, apparently self-inflicted. After the officers had handcuffed Smith, they heard a gunshot and saw \u201csmoke coming out from around [Conner\u2019s] belly.\u201d Conner\u2019s nine-millimeter revolver was found in his right hand, underneath his body, pointing toward his left thigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In addition to the AR-15 rifle the police officers seized during the struggle, Smith had on his person a Ruger .44 magnum revolver with a ten-inch barrel and a Ruger .357 magnum revolver. The twenty-cartridge magazine for the AR-15 rifle contained three live cartridges, and another live cartridge was jammed in the firing chamber. The .44 magnum revolver was fully loaded with six live cartridges. The cylinder of the .357 magnum revolver contained three live cartridges and three spent casings. An ammunition belt taken from Smith\u2019s person contained seven clips of live ammunition for the AR-15 rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The officers found behind Smith\u2019s house ten empty .223 caliber cartridge casings, which had been discharged by the AR-15 rifle. One casing was discovered midway along the fence line between Smith and his neighbor, and nine were discovered in the alleyway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201cdirectly outside [Smith\u2019s] backyard.\u201d In the area where Sgt. Conner was found, five spent nine-millimeter casings were found. As noted previously, Conner carried a nine-millimeter revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Smith was transported to police headquarters, where it was discovered that he had suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. He was taken to a hospital, treated in the emergency room, and returned to headquarters. He gave the police a statement, which was recorded on tape. In the statement, Smith said that he did not start firing until after he was shot in the foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A blood test showed that Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.11 per cent by weight by volume. Smith\u2019s hands were tested for gunshot residue. Both tested positive for antimony, but only the left hand tested above the threshold for barium. Expert testimony showed that a revolver generally allows more of \u201cthese gases to escape and carry these particles on the hand\u201d than a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Testifying in his own defense, Smith stated that he became \u201cvery upset\u201d when he returned home after visiting Noble\u2019s Restaurant and found that his wife was not at home. He stated that he armed himself with his rifle and two revolvers, and he admitted firing two shots into the air from his front porch. He also admitted telling Daniel Wood, \u201cwait \u2018til I start shooting people.\u201d He denied saying he would shoot a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Smith testified he went inside to put his weapons away because he assumed that someone would report the shooting incident and that the police would respond. When he went inside, he saw that the security light on the rear of his house was on, and he immediately went into his back yard and out into the alleyway to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Seeing no one, Smith walked back into his yard and heard someone say, \u201c[h]alt, or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d He saw a \u201cflash\u201d out of the corner of his eye and felt something hit his right foot. He shot the rifle in the direction of the flash, then turned in the opposite direction and fired three times. Thinking that the \u201cclip was empty,\u201d he was trying to reload when he saw two police officers near his storage shed, and he dropped his rifle at the officers\u2019 command.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Smith denied that he ever saw Sgt. Conner or any other police officer prior to the time he started shooting in his back yard. He stated he did not know that Conner was a police officer or that an officer had been shot until he heard it on the police radio. He denied shooting Conner in the back of the head with his .357 magnum revolver. He said that he fired no weapon other than his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>rifle and that he only fired that weapon with his right hand. He claimed he was incapable of firing a weapon with his left hand because of a pre-existing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">PRETRIAL MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"Afb\">Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Smith contends that Virginia\u2019s capital murder scheme is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. All the arguments he makes, however, save one, have been consistently rejected by this Court in decisions ranging from <em>M. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979), to <em>Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 433, 389 S.E.2d 886 (1990). We reaffirm our earlier decisions and reject Smith\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The one argument Smith makes which appears novel is that Virginia\u2019s capital murder statute is unconstitutional because \u201cit does not provide the defendant a meaningful avenue of appeal, both as written, and as applied.\u201d Smith maintains that this Court\u2019s review of death sentences is \u201csporadic and arbitrary\u201d because we fail to make an in-depth analysis in determining \u201c[wjhether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1). Smith maintains further that this Court is \u201calso sporadic and arbitrary\u201d in its review to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2). We reject this argument as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Smith filed a pretrial motion to suppress the statement he gave police following his arrest. Smith conceded that he had been given the warnings outlined in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), but contended that he did not make a voluntary and knowing waiver of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In a pretrial hearing, the trial court heard the testimony of the police officers who struggled with Smith before arresting him, of the officer who took the statement from him, and of the rescue squad and emergency room personnel who treated him. The trial court also listened to a tape recording of Smith\u2019s statement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>trial judge then stated that he had \u201cno difficulty in finding that the statement was made voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">On appeal, Smith contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. The Attorney General argues, however, that because the statement was not admitted into evidence during the guilt phase of Smith\u2019s trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the question whether the statement was voluntary is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We would agree with the Attorney General except for the fact that Smith also argues that a consent he gave for the search of his house was tainted because it was the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d Smith argues this point in summary fashion. He says the tactics employed by the police in obtaining the statement were designed \u201cto take advantage of [his] intoxicated, emotional, physically injured state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We answer in similar summary fashion. We have read the testimony of the officers who struggled with Smith before arresting him, of the officer who took the statement from him, and of the rescue squad and emergency room personnel who treated him. We have also listened to the tape recording of the statement. And we think the trial court was correct in finding that the statement was made voluntarily and that the consent to search was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"Af7\">Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Smith contends that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse for cause prospective jurors Kenneth Johnson and Kenneth Moore. Johnson, however, was chosen as an alternate juror. When the jury retired, his participation was not needed, and he was dismissed prior to the time the jury began its deliberations. Hence, Smith suffered no harm from the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse Johnson for cause. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 339, 356 S.E.2d 157, 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">With respect to prospective juror Moore, Smith objected to his selection on the sole ground that \u201che had a predisposition to believe testimony by police officers, to give that more weight than lay witnesses.\u201d On appeal, Smith raises other objections to Moore\u2019s selection, but we will consider only the ground advanced in the trial court. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>When asked whether he felt \u201cthat the testimony of a police officer carries more weight . . . than that of an ordinary citizen,\u201d Moore said: \u201cThat is a tough call.\u201d Continuing, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">Police officers have always been in a high esteem and you always think that they are the ones that are being able to tell the truth more than an average citizen. But then, again, it is a preconceived notion that I have probably had for the majority of my life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Moore then replied in the negative when asked whether \u201cthat preconceived notion [would] interfere with [his] ability to weigh the evidence and render a fair and impartial decision ... or would [he] automatically give more weight to the testimony of a police officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">A closely similar situation was presented in <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 251 S.E.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979). By substituting the name of Moore for the prospective juror in <em>Waye, </em>that case decides the point involved in this one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Whether [Moore] should have been excluded for cause was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . [Moore\u2019s] ultimate attitude on the subject of the testimony of police officers was essentially neutral. His responses to the various questions propounded to him, while perhaps not displaying the grasp of a legal technician, satisfactorily indicated that he not only stood indifferent in the cause but also possessed sufficient intelligence to be able to afford the defendant a fair and impartial trial. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to exclude [Moore] for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 251 S.E.2d at 206-07 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Motion in Limine</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">On the morning of trial, Smith moved to exclude the testimony of a security guard and two police officers the Commonwealth intended to call for the purpose of showing that Smith had threatened them several months before the shooting in question. The trial court held that the testimony was admissible but in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>structed the jury on the limited purposes for which the testimony could be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Frederick Lepine, a security guard at a hotel in Waltham, Massachusetts, testified that on February 5, 1988, some five and one-half months before the shooting in question, he observed Smith with an open whiskey bottle in the hotel lobby and told him drinking was not permitted in the lobby. Smith became angry, told Lepine that he would be sorry, that \u201call people like [him] will be sorry,\u201d and swung the whiskey bottle at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Police were called, and Officer David H. Allen was one of those responding. He testified that he and a fellow officer got into a struggle with Smith and that after Smith was subdued and placed in a police cruiser, he said: \u201cYou guys are f_ing a_holes, I have a 44 magnum and I\u2019m going to blow you guys away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Craig Sala, a police officer in Santa Clara, California, testified that on March 24, 1988, four months before the shooting in question, he arrested Smith in a restaurant and transported him to the police station. There, Sala advised Smith that he \u201cwas going to go to county jail and he wasn\u2019t going to be able to catch his plane flight back to Manassas.\u201d Smith became angry and told Sala that \u201cif circumstances were different he\u2019d blow [Sala] away with his gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Smith first argues that the foregoing testimony was inadmissible because irrelevant. Generally, evidence of prior offenses is inadmissible because it \u201cconfuses the issue before the jury, unfairly surprises the accused with a charge he is not prepared to meet, and tends to prejudice him in the minds of the jury.\u201d <em>Fleenor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 270, 275, 105 S.E.2d 160, 163 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">However, we have recognized specific exceptions to the rule. We have upheld the admission of evidence of prior offenses when offered to prove (1) premeditation, <em>M. Smith, supra, </em>219 Va. at 471, 248 S.E.2d at 145, (2) absence of mistake or accident, <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 72, 76, 278 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1981), (3) motive or intent, <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 142, 314 S.E.2d 371, 383, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984), and (4) the conduct and feelings of the accused toward his victim, <em>Hawks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 244, 247, 321 S.E.2d 650, 652 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">The trial court held that the testimony of Lepine, Allen, and Sala was admissible under any one of the foregoing exceptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>We agree with the trial court. The trial court also held that the lapse of time between the prior occurrences and the date of the present offense was not so great as to render the testimony inadmissible. We also agree with the trial court on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Smith argues further that the testimony was inadmissible because it was the Commonwealth\u2019s theory Smith disliked all police officers and, at the point Lepine, Allen, and Sala testified, the Commonwealth had adduced no evidence showing Smith knew Conner was a police officer at the time of the shooting. However, as we shall demonstrate <em>infra, </em>there was abundant evidence produced later in the trial showing that Smith did know Conner was a police officer when the fatal shooting occurred. Hence, there was an evidentiary link established between the statements made by Smith in February and March of 1988 and the occurrences of July 24, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is immaterial that the disputed testimony was admitted before the evidentiary link was established. The order of presentation of evidence \u201cis usually a matter left to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 582, 249 S.E.2d 171, 175 (1978). We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, Smith argues that the Commonwealth is mistaken in its assertion that the testimony was admissible as evidence of threats against a class, <em>viz., </em>police officers. We need not settle this dispute, however, since we have held the testimony admissible on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Admission of Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Frances Patricia Fields, the assistant medical examiner who conducted an autopsy on Sgt. Conner\u2019s body, stated during her testimony that she found powder debris at the lower part of the wound in the back of Conner\u2019s head and that this was consistent with a \u201cclose gunshot wound.\u201d The prosecutor then asked the doctor \u201chow far away ... the weapon [would] have to be.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the ground Dr. Fields had not been qualified as an expert in ballistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">There followed questions which elicited the information that Dr. Fields had received training in, and had read literature on, the subject of \u201cthe distance of weapons . . . and the cause and effect of wounds.\u201d The doctor also answered affirmatively to the question whether she customarily testified \u201cto such things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The prosecutor then said, \u201cI think she can testify to that your Honor.\u201d Without further objection from Smith\u2019s counsel, the doctor was permitted to state that powder debris \u201cmay reach a body . . . out two to three feet\u201d with a handgun or \u201cout to approximately six feet\u201d with a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We think that in the absence of further objection from the defense, the qualification of Dr. Fields to testify as an expert in ballistics was sufficiently established. Hence, the trial court did riot err in permitting the witness to state her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Smith makes another contention concerning the testimony of Dr. Fields. Evidence previously introduced showed that the barrel of Smith\u2019s .357 magnum revolver contained \u201ctiny spatters\u201d of human blood, rather than \u201ca drip,\u201d which means that the blood was \u201cdeposited with some force behind it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">During her testimony, Dr. Fields was asked whether the presence of \u201cspatters of blood\u201d on the barrel of a gun was consistent with \u201cblow back blood,\u201d meaning that material a \u201cbullet hits can be propelled by gases, back towards the gun itself.\u201d In answering the question, the doctor used in the presence of the jury a drawing which had been prepared by a previous witness but which had not been introduced into evidence. Dr. Fields stated that the presence of blood on a gun barrel is consistent with \u201cblow back blood\u201d and went on to say that \u201c[b]lood spatters can generally be blown back four to six inches from the skin surface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Smith argues that because the drawing had not been admitted into evidence, Dr. Fields should not have been permitted to use it in giving her expert opinion. However, all the facts necessary to the formation of the doctor\u2019s opinion were already in evidence. Hence, it was not error to permit use of the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Refusal of Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Prior to trial, Smith filed a Notice of Diminished Capacity Defense, stating that he proposed \u201cto introduce psychiatric evidence at trial that he lacked the capacity to form the necessary premeditation to commit the offense of capital murder as charged in the indictment.\u201d The Commonwealth filed a motion in limine seeking to \u201cprohibit [Smith\u2019s] diminished capacity defense and the use of any psychiatric evidence in support thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The trial court heard the motion on a stipulation of what Smith\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph J. David, would say if called as a witness. The court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, but per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mitted Smith to proffer the evidence at trial. Again at trial, the court ruled the evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The stipulation and proffer show that Dr. David examined Smith and diagnosed him as suffering from \u201calcohol dependence and from a borderline personality disorder.\u201d The doctor stated that Smith, whose I.Q. is 124, had the ability to form intentions and to premeditate, but that he did not have the capacity to follow through on his intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Smith contends that the trial court erred in ruling the evidence inadmissible. He argues that the evidence should have been admitted on the issue of premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We disagree. In <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 384 S.E.2d 95 (1989), we said that \u201c \u2018[t]o premeditate means to adopt a specific intent to kill, and that is what distinguishes first and second degree murder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 384 S.E.2d at 98 (quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 696, 700, 261 S.E.2d 550, 553 (1980)). While neither <em>Rhodes </em>nor <em>Smith </em>was a capital murder case, the adoption of a specific intent also distinguishes capital murder from second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985), we held that \u201c[u]nless an accused contends that he was beyond [the borderline of insanity] when he acted, his mental state is immaterial to the issue of specific intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 324 S.E.2d at 688. In the course of the opinion, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">The use of expert evidence has been approved in some jurisdictions to show \u2018diminished capacity,\u2019 . . . and in others to show, by circumstantial evidence, that the requisite specific intent did not in fact exist. . . . The first theory represents \u2018a fundamental change in the common law theory of [criminal] responsibility,\u2019 . . . and we decline to adopt it. The second approach has been characterized in our holdings as an invasion, by expert opinion on the ultimate fact in issue, of the province of the factfinder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 688 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Smith argues that <em>Stamper </em>is inapposite because it involved a charge of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, rather than capital murder. Under Virginia law, Smith says, it is clear that \u201cthere exists a defense available only to capital or first degree murder cases and not to any other offense.\u201d That defense, Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>points out, is voluntary intoxication, evidence of which is offered to negate specific intent or premeditation. This, Smith maintains, is the same purpose for which he offered Dr. David\u2019s testimony. Then, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>102 N.J.L. 659, 133 A. 274 (1926), Smith asserts it would be \u201cbarbarous and insensible ... to extend a more lenient legal rule to the case of a drunkard . . . than to the case of a poor demented creature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 133 A. at 285 (Kalisch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><em>Stamper </em>provides the reason for excluding the type of evidence Smith champions. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">The state of knowledge in the fields of medicine and psychiatry is subject to constant advance and change. The classifications and gradations applied to mental illnesses, disorders, and defects are frequently revised. The courts cannot, and should not, become dependent upon these subtle and shifting gradations for the resolution of each specific case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">228 Va. at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Smith argues that even if Dr. David\u2019s testimony was inadmissible under <em>Stamper, </em>it was admissible as rebuttal of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of Smith\u2019s prior bad acts, which was admitted, Smith points out, to show motive, intent, and premeditation. Dr. David\u2019s testimony, however, would not have served Smith\u2019s purpose. The doctor did not testify that Smith was incapable of forming an intent or of premeditating. Rather, the doctor testified to the contrary. Smith\u2019s impairment, according to Dr. David, consisted of an inability to follow through on his intentions. Evidence of this inability would have been irrelevant to the question whether Smith could form an intent or premeditate in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Refusal to Admit Taped Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Smith contends that the trial court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the tape recording of the statement he gave police on the night of the murder. In the trial court, Smith argued that the tape recording was admissible under the \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. Smith obviously offered the taped statement to show that his testimony at trial was consistent with his earlier statement, recorded on tape, that he did not start firing until after he was shot in the foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Smith now argues that the statement was admissible under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. But the same reason that makes the \u201cprior consistent statement\u201d exception inapplicable also makes the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception inapplicable. At the time he gave the taped statement, Smith had a reason to fabricate. By then, even according to his own account, he knew he had shot a police officer, and, according to the account accepted by the jury, he knew he had threatened to \u201cshoot the first [police officer] that arrive[d].\u201d Hence, he had a clear motive to lie about who fired the first shot, and he had sufficient time to fabricate a story. Under these circumstances, his prior statement was inadmissible. <em>See Scott </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>143 Va. 425, 433, 130 S.E. 241, 243 (1925), and <em>Honaker Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Kiser, </em>134 Va. 50, 60, 113 S.E. 718, 721 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Smith contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. Quoting <em>Delong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 357, 369, 362 S.E.2d 669, 676 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 929 (1988), Smith argues that the burden was upon the Commonwealth to prove that he \u201cacted with the purpose of interfering with what he perceived to be an officer\u2019s performance of a law enforcement duty.\u201d <em>A fortiori, </em>Smith maintains, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving he knew Sgt. Conner was a police officer. The proof on that point, Smith says, \u201cfalls far short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We disagree with Smith. He takes a slanted view of the record. He picks out isolated portions of the evidence and then concludes it was too dark in the area where the shooting occurred for him to have seen Sgt. Conner or his uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">For example, Smith quotes a portion of the testimony of Daniel Wood where the witness said \u201cit was dark . . . then.\u201d Later in his testimony, however, Wood stated that he stood on an overturned bucket to peer over a fence and that there were \u201ca couple\u201d lights burning \u201cout back,\u201d including one on Smith\u2019s house. Importantly, Wood said that, from \u201c[a] little more than a hundred feet\u201d away, he could see \u201cofficers around Mr. Smith\u201d and \u201cfour or five . . . around where the officer was laying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Another instance of the liberty Smith takes with the facts involves the testimony of Officer Bamford. Smith quotes a portion of Bamford\u2019s testimony where he stated that \u201cin the alleyway there was no light at all.\u201d It is obvious, however, that this statement did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>not pertain to the portion of the alleyway behind Smith\u2019s house. After making the statement, Bamford testified that he \u201cstarted up the alleyway\u201d and when he reached a point behind Smith\u2019s house, a light between the first and second floor windows of that house \u201cshown back out onto the alleyway and that yard [and] illuminated that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Smith also states that Officer Ryan testifed \u201che was not certain that it was a law enforcement officer behind [Smith\u2019s] house until he heard the voice of Sgt. Conner over the radio.\u201d But Officer Ryan\u2019s statement referred to a point in time when he was \u201ccrouched down behind [a] station wagon\u201d that was \u201cbacked up into the driveway\u201d <em>at the front </em>of one of the houses in the area. Besides, Ryan\u2019s statement obviously did not refer to lighting conditions. Indeed, Ryan said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t need headlights to get [to the area] and it was just starting to get dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">When he did reach the rear of Smith\u2019s house, Ryan was able to see a figure on the ground, which turned out to be the figure of Sgt. Conner, from \u201cone and a half townhouse back yards\u201d away, or approximately 30 feet. And, according to Ryan, there was \u201ca light on\u201d which made the area \u201c[w]ell lit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In addition to this evidence supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s position that Smith knew his firing was directed at a police officer, there are numerous other incidents of proof throughout the record in support of that position. Not the least is the testimony of Smith\u2019s neighbors about his hope that the police would be called and his threat that he would shoot the first police officer to arrive. Further evidence of Smith\u2019s guilty knowledge came from his own testimony that he had assumed someone would report the front-porch shooting incident to the police and that the police would respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Then, there is Smith\u2019s statement, made after he was subdued, that Sgt. Conner was \u201cone of us . . . one of ours.\u201d We think this statement was a devious attempt by Smith to align himself with the police. But, whatever Smith\u2019s purpose in making the statement, it served as evidence of his guilty knowledge. There was other evidence showing that the statement was made before anyone had \u201cverbally identified the man who had been shot as a police officer.\u201d Smith has not claimed that the way he learned a policeman had been shot was by observing the victim\u2019s uniform <em>after </em>the shooting; indeed, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Smith insisted in his testimony that the area where Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ner fell was dark. Hence, the jury was entitled to find that the only way Smith could have known Conner was a police officer was by observing his uniform <em>before </em>he shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Our final observation on the sufficiency of the evidence concerns Smith\u2019s testimony that he did not start firing until after he was shot in the foot. Given the fact that only Smith fired a rifle and given the further fact that the first shots fired were \u201creal sharp . . . cracks\u201d indicative of rifle fire, we think the jury was entitled to disbelieve Smith\u2019s testimony and find it was he who fired the first shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Smith contends that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 4, offered by the Commonwealth, and in refusing his Instruction H. Smith says Instruction No. 4 erroneously equates premeditation with \u201cspecific intent to kill,\u201d while Instruction H properly equates premeditation with \u201cdesign to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">As noted previously, however, we held in <em>Smith, supra, </em>220 Va. at 700, 261 S.E.2d at 553, that \u201c[t]o premeditate means to adopt a specific intent to kill.\u201d Hence, Instruction No. 4 properly stated the law applicable to this case, and Instruction H did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Smith next contends that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 6 on circumstantial evidence, offered by the Commonwealth, instead of his Instruction C. The only difference we can discern between the two instructions is that Instruction C mentions \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d while Instruction No. 6 does not. The jury was fully instructed on the presumption, however, and it was not necessary to reiterate the point in an instruction on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Smith also contends that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 7, offered by the Commonwealth, which told the jury that it might infer malice \u201cfrom the deliberate use of a deadly weapon unless, from all the evidence, [the jury has] a reasonable doubt as to whether malice existed.\u201d This instruction, Smith argues, is violative of the rule enunciated in <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 (1979), that an instruction which constitutes \u201ceither a burden-shifting presumption ... or a conclusive presumption\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Although decided before <em>Sandstrom, Warlitner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 348, 228 S.E.2d 698 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>430 U.S. 957 (1977), is dispositive here. We held in <em>Warlitner </em>that an instruction which told the jury \u201cmalice may be implied from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 349, 228 S.E.2d at 699-700, did not constitute a conclusive presumption or \u201cimpose upon the accused any burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350-51, 228 S.E.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Finally, Smith contends the trial court erred in amending one of his instructions and in refusing to grant two other instructions he offered. We find no error in the actions of the trial court with respect to these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">SENTENCING PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A9V\">Admission of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Prior to trial, Smith filed a motion asking the trial court to require the Commonwealth to furnish a bill of particulars with respect to the evidence it intended to introduce at sentencing. The court ordered the Commonwealth to furnish certain information by March 7, 1989, and the Commonwealth complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">On March 27, 1989, shortly before the sentencing hearing began, the Commonwealth filed a supplemental bill of particulars. In the supplemental bill, the Commonwealth stated it intended to introduce evidence through a witness, Travis Peters, that prior to the shooting in question, Smith told Peters \u201che was thinking of killing his wife and moving his . . . girlfriend into his residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The supplemental bill also stated that the Commonwealth intended to call Officer Plum of the Manassas Police Department. According to the supplemental bill, Plum would \u201ctestify to Sgt. Conner\u2019s words, actions and condition after the shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Smith moved that the trial court rule the evidence inadmissible because not timely furnished. During argument on the motion, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told the court that although the witness Peters had been summoned for an earlier trial date, the Commonwealth had not learned of the evidence of Smith\u2019s threat against his wife until the middle of the guilt phase of Smith\u2019s trial. With respect to the evidence the prosecution wanted to introduce through Officer Plum, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told the court he had attempted to introduce the same evidence at the guilt phase of the trial but it was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The court denied Smith\u2019s motion, and the disputed evidence later was admitted. Smith contends the trial court erred in admitting the evidence. -</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">We disagree with Smith. We will assume, without deciding, that the Commonwealth was required under Rule 3A:11 and the trial court\u2019s order to furnish the information in question. When such information is required but the Attorney for the Commonwealth has failed to comply, Code \u00a7 19.2-265.4(B) vests the trial court with wide discretion. It may order the Commonwealth to permit discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, prohibit the Commonwealth from introducing evidence not disclosed, or \u201center such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Here, where there was no failure to comply but only an allegedly late compliance, the trial court certainly was not bound to prohibit introduction of the disputed evidence. It was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit the evidence if it deemed such action \u201cjust under the circumstances.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Smith also contends that the trial court erred in permitting a witness, Douglas Guernsey, to testify that he had suffered certain injuries at Smith\u2019s hands in 1971. Guernsey testified that he was involved in a minor traffic accident caused by Smith, after which Smith, without provocation, stabbed him several times with a bayonet. Guernsey stated that as a result of the stabbing, he suffered a severed rib and a punctured lung, leaving him with the use of only \u201cone and a half lung.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Smith argues that the trial court should have required Guernsey to qualify as an expert before permitting him to testify concerning \u201cthe nature and extent of his injuries.\u201d The admission of this evidence, Smith says, \u201cconstituted prejudicial error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We disagree. We think that once the Commonwealth proved Smith\u2019s brutal and unprovoked attack upon Guernsey, the admission of his testimony concerning the nature and extent of his injuries was harmless error, if error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Smith contends the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 2 at the sentencing phase. This instruction told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">In deciding whether the defendant committed an \u2018aggravated battery\u2019 when he shot John Conner, you may consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the number of gun shot wounds inflicted upon the victim provided you find that death did not result instantaneously from the first shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Smith argues that the instruction \u201cwas an incorrect statement of the law and was argumentative rather than instructive.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The trial court also granted Instruction B. This instruction stated that \u201c \u2018[aggravated battery\u2019 means a battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Instruction B is taken from the language of <em>M. Smith, supra, </em>219 Va. at 478, 248 S.E.2d at 149. Instruction No. 2 is taken from the language of <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 139-40, 360 S.E.2d 196, 203 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036 (1988). Both instructions contain correct statements of the law and complement each other in the factual situation presented here. Hence, it was not error for the trial court to grant Instruction No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Smith also contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant Instruction D at the sentencing phase. This instruction would have told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">In order for you to find that there is a \u2018probability\u2019 that Roy Smith would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society you must find that there is a likelihood substantially greater than a mere possibility that he would commit such acts in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">During a discussion of the instruction, Smith\u2019s counsel conceded that it \u201csimply define [d] probability.\u201d The trial judge stated that he did not \u201cthink the Jury needfed] to be instructed on the difference between possibility and probability.\u201d We agree with the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Denial of Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">During closing argument in the sentencing phase, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told the jury: \u201c[I]f you don\u2019t believe that this man is dangerous and you don\u2019t believe he will constitute a continuing threat to society, you ought to acquit him.\u201d Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>objected to the statement, asked the court to instruct the jury to disregard the remark, and moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The trial judge said to the prosecutor: \u201cI assume you misspoke?\u201d The prosecutor replied: \u201cI apologize. You ought to sentence him to life, rather than death, if you believe that \u2014 \u201d Defense counsel interrupted to say: \u201cWill the Court rule on the motion for a mis-trial?\u201d The trial judge replied: \u201cI\u2019ll deny your motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Smith argues that because he had already been convicted, the argument of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney \u201ceffectively equated a sentence of life imprisonment with an acquittal\u201d and the trial court \u201crefused to grant a mistrial\u201d or to \u201cask the jury to disregard [the] statement.\u201d This refusal, Smith concludes, represents prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Under Code \u00a7 8.01-361, \u201cin any case, the court may discharge the jury when it appears that . . . there is a manifest necessity for such discharge.\u201d In determining whether manifest necessity exists, a trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 328, 335, 218 S.E.2d 541, 546 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Here, we think the trial judge\u2019s inquiry about whether the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had mispoken, followed by the latter\u2019s immediate apology and correction, were sufficient to dissipate any prejudice that may have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s obvious slip-of-the-tongue. Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial or in failing to instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Post-Sentence Report</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court ordered the preparation of a post-sentence report before deciding whether to impose the death sentence fixed by the jury. The report was prepared by a probation officer and filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Smith contends the trial court should have commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment because the report contained a victim impact statement prepared by Sgt. Conner\u2019s widow. Smith maintains that inclusion of the impact statement was improper under <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>482 U.S. 496 (1987), rendering the trial court\u2019s imposition of the death sentence erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">In <em>Booth, </em>a victim impact statement was read to the jury before it retired to determine whether the sentence for capital murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>should be death. The statement not only described the impact of the murder upon the victim\u2019s family but also expressed the opinions of family members on an appropriate sentence. The jury fixed the sentence at death. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that use of the impact statement violated the Eighth Amendment because the jury\u2019s consideration of the statement created \u201can impermissible risk that the capital sentencing decision will be made in an arbitrary manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Here, however, the impact statement was not read to the jury nor was the jury ever made aware of its existence. It was considered, if at all, only by the trial judge and then only after the jury had fixed Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Smith argues that this distinction is irrelevant. He says that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5 places upon the trial court the responsibility of making the final determination of the appropriate sentence and that the court functions much like a jury and is subject to the same improper influence of .a victim impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We disagree with Smith. We think the distinction between this case and <em>Booth </em>is both relevant and dispositive. \u201cA judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments . . . during the mental process of adjudication. . . .\u201d <em>Richard Eckhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Hence, the \u201cimpermissible risk\u201d present in <em>Booth </em>does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Smith also contends that the trial court improperly \u201cadmitted\u201d the post-sentence report because \u201cit had been done in violation of the statute.\u201d Smith\u2019s complaint is that the probation officer \u201cdid not make efforts to contact certain people\u201d and made \u201csubjective decisions about what information he was going to provide in the report.\u201d The result, Smith says, is that the report did not fully disclose \u201cinformation in mitigation or which might have been beneficial to [Smith] in his attempt to have the court set aside the death sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We reject Smith\u2019s contention. In <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5 provides only that a thorough investigation be conducted; it does not specify that any particular procedure be used in compiling the report or that any partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ular information be included therein. Decisions concerning such matters must by necessity be left largely to the discretion of the trial court and the individual probation officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">220 Va. at 279, 279 S.E.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">PROPRIETY OF THE DEATH SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C) requires this Court to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d and whether the sentence \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Passion and Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The sum total of Smith\u2019s argument on this subject is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">The Commonwealth did not rely upon the evidence in seeking the conviction and sentence of death but rather relied upon passion and prejudice in gaining [its] goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">The verdict and sentence of death were not supported by the evidence but were a product of passion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Notwithstanding the brevity of Smith\u2019s argument, this Court must determine for itself whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. Having searched the record with this duty in mind, we have found nothing which suggests that the death sentence was the product of any arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In fixing Smith\u2019s punishment at death, the jury found there was a probability Smith \u201cwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d The jury also found that Smith\u2019s \u201cconduct in committing the offense [was] outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Hence, the jury found both aggravating factors, \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness,\u201d which, singly or in combination, may support a sentence of death. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. We think that the record amply supports both findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>With respect to \u201cfuture dangerousness,\u201d the evidence shows a chain of events beginning with Smith\u2019s unprovoked stabbing of a motorist in 1971, followed by his threat, made at the point of a gun, to kill a police officer in the same year. In 1973, he threatened to kill another police officer. In 1978, while completely nude, he broke into the home of a sleeping couple and attacked them with a hammer. In 1985, he was convicted of indecent exposure. He was arrested for similar conduct in 1988, but he failed to appear for trial, and a bench warrant was issued for him. He threatened two more police officers in 1988 and swung a whiskey bottle at a security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The trial judge aptly characterized this case history when he said it was \u201ca chilling and telling prediction of what was to come.\u201d And what was to come, of course, was the tragedy which removed all doubt, if any existed before, of Smith\u2019s \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">With respect to \u201cvileness,\u201d Smith\u2019s depravity of mind is exemplified by his actions on the night in question, which may be described as the carrying out of a diabolical plot to lure \u201cthe police there to his house,\u201d as the trial judge put it, \u201cobviously with the intent to take deadly action against them.\u201d And the jury\u2019s finding of aggravated battery is supported by the evidence of the multiple wounds Smith inflicted upon Sgt. Conner. The trial judge correctly described Conner\u2019s wounds as \u201cmore than necessary to accomplish the death of the victim.\u201d Furthermore, the wounds did not result in instantaneous death but caused the victim severe pain until he was drugged into insensibility at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The finding of aggravated battery is supported further by the viciousness with which the fatal wound to the head was inflicted. The trial judge observed that, after Sgt. Conner \u201cwas already hit and down,\u201d Smith \u201cwalked up to the officer\u201d and \u201cshot him [in the back of the head] at point blank range.\u201d This observation was fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Smith\u2019s entire argument on this point reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">The sentence [of death] was not proportional to similar cases and should be commuted to a life sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The test of proportionality is whether \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>220 Va. at 284, 257 S.E.2d at 824. In <em>Delong, </em>234 Va. at 372, 362 S.E.2d at 677, we compiled the capital cases involving the murder of police officers. And in <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 319-20, 384 S.E.2d 785, 799-800 (1989), we compiled those cases where, as here, the death sentences were based upon both aggravating factors of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Having reviewed our earlier decisions and having considered both the crime and the defendant involved here, we have no hesitancy in saying that juries in this jurisdiction will generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes. Accordingly, and because we have found no error in the proceeding in which Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\"> Smith was also convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, but that conviction was not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-13\"> Other evidence showed that the weapon was a Colt AR-15 .223 semi-automatic rifle.
