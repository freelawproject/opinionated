The trial court held that the limitation does apply and dismissed the second proceeding. We granted an appeal to review the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The record shows that on April 18, 1985, the plaintiff, Clarence C. Moore, was an inmate at the Brunswick Correctional Center in Brunswick County and that the defendant, Elvertha D. Gillis, was a corrections officer employed at the same facility. On that date, Moore was injured when an electronically operated door through which he was passing slammed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On March 11, 1987, Moore filed a motion for judgment against Gillis in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. In the motion, Moore alleged that Gillis negligently caused the door to slam against him and, accordingly, that she was liable to him in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">On April 6, 1987, Gillis filed a motion to transfer venue of the action to the Circuit Court of Brunswick County. Moore agreed to the transfer, but, on April 16, 1987, before the transfer order was entered, filed another motion for judgment on the same claim in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. By order dated May 18, 1987, the Richmond court transferred venue of the first action to Brunswick County. Nearly a year later, on April 18, 1988, Moore nonsuited the first action, which was then pending in the Circuit Court of Brunswick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">On December 7, 1988, acting on its own motion, the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond held that it lacked jurisdiction to \u201chear the \u2018new\u2019 proceeding.\u201d On December 29, 1988, the court dismissed Moore\u2019s second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Moore contends that the statutory limitation contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) \u201cdoes not apply to cases where two lawsuits are pending simultaneously and one is subsequently nonsuited.\u201d A defendant\u2019s only option in such a situation, Moore says, is to \u201cmake a motion to require the plaintiff to elect which suit he will pursue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Gillis contends that the limitation in question \u201cis intended to prevent a plaintiff from \u2018forum-shopping\u2019 by instituting his suit in a new court after encountering difficulties in his original suit.\u201d Gillis maintains that to \u201callow a plaintiff to circumvent the statute in this way would lead to an absurd result - a plaintiff who desires to nonsuit and refile in a new court need only file in the new court the day <em>before </em>he nonsuits.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Gillis says that this Court has \u201cthe duty to construe the statute so as to avoid [an absurd] result, and to adopt a reasonable construction within the legislative intent and purpose.\u201d And we must adopt that interpretation \u201cwhich is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intention,\u201d Gillis opines, \u201ceven though such interpretation may not be in conformity with the strict letter of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We do not disagree with Gillis\u2019s contention that it is this Court\u2019s duty to give effect to legislative intent. Neither do we doubt the accuracy of Gillis\u2019s assertion that a purpose of the limitation contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) was to prevent a plaintiff from \u201cforum-shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The narrow question in this case, however, is whether the General Assembly intended the limitation to be so sweeping in effect that it would prohibit the prosecution of a proceeding filed <em>before </em>a nonsuit is taken in a pending action covering the same claim. And in resolving that question, a well-established rule controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">If statutory language \u201cis clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction by the court; the plain meaning and intent of the enactment will be given it.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). \u201cWhen an enactment is clear and unequivocal, general rules of construction of statutes of doubtful meaning do not apply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Here, the statutory language is not of doubtful meaning but is clear and unambiguous. In plain terms, the limitation contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) is made to apply only where a <em>new proceeding </em>is brought <em>after </em>a nonsuit is taken in an action previously filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>In this case, the second proceeding was an <em>existing </em>proceeding, not a new one, brought <em>before, </em>not after, the nonsuit was taken in the action previously filed. Hence, disagreeing with Gillis\u2019s contention that a result contrary to her view would be absurd, we hold that the limitation in question was not intended to apply to the sort of situation presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, reinstate Moore\u2019s second motion for judgment, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
