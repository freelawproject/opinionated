Major suffered incapacitating injuries while driving his employer\u2019s delivery truck which collided with a tractor-trailer in Hanover County. At that time, Major was a named insured in an automobile liability policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) which insured two cars owned by him. In pertinent part, the policy provided medical payment coverage in this situation if Major\u2019s injury was caused by an accident <em>\u201cwhile not occupying a motor vehicle, </em>through being struck by an automobile or trailer of any type.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Erma W. Major, who was appointed as Major\u2019s guardian, filed this action to recover Major\u2019s medical expenses. In part, State Farm contended that the policy did not provide medical payment coverage since Major was occupying a motor vehicle at the time of his injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The guardian argued, and the trial court agreed, that because of the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-318(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Farm\u2019s medical payment limitation was superseded by Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(l) because the two were inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Prior to its amendment in 1986, Code \u00a7 38.1-21(2), provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Any policy of motor vehicle [liability] . . . insurance . . . may include appropriate provisions whereby the insuring company assumes the obligation of payment of medical . . . expenses arising out of the . . . injury of any person, and any <em>such </em>policy of motor vehicle insurance may include appropriate provisions whereby the insuring company assumes the obligation of payment of weekly indemnity or other specific benefits to persons who are injured ... if such injury ... is caused by accident and sustained <em>while in </em>or upon, entering or alighting from, or through being struck by <em>a motor vehicle, </em>provided that such obligations are irrespective of any legal liability of the insured or any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Acts 1956, c. 678 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In 1986, Title 38.1 was repealed, and Title 38.2 was enacted \u201cso as to revise, rearrange, amend and recodify the insurance laws of Virginia generally.\u201d Acts 1986, c. 562. Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(1) replaced the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 38.2-21(2). As pertinent, Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Any policy of \u2018motor vehicle insurance\u2019 . . . may include appropriate provisions obligating the insurer to pay medical . . . expenses arising out of the . . . injury of any person. Any policy of motor vehicle insurance may include appropriate provisions obligating the insurer to pay weekly indemnity or other specific benefits to persons who are injured ... if the injury ... is caused by accident and sustained while in or upon, entering or alighting from, or through being struck by a motor vehicle. These provisions shall obligate the insurer to make payment regardless of any legal liability of the insured or any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The guardian argues that because Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(1) is simply a recodification of the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 38.1-21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>without effecting any change in its meaning, this case is controlled by our decisions in <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. </em>v. Seay, 236 Va. 275, 373 S.E.2d 910 (1988), and <em>Virginia Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>Jerrell, </em>236 Va. 261, 373 S.E.2d 913 (1988). Both cases considered a similar issue; however, they involved a construction of the last paragraph of now repealed Code \u00a7 38.1-21, not Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(1). Because of the change in language in the recodified provision, we must decide whether it effects a substantive change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Noting that there are no revisors\u2019 notes to Code \u00a7 38.2-124, the guardian cites <em>Good </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>140 Va. 399, 125 S.E. 321 (1924), which held that \u201cmere changes in the phraseology of an act carried into a general revision of the statutes\u201d does not alter the meaning of the provision, absent a revisors\u2019 note indicating a material alteration. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 125 S.E. at 322. <em>Good, </em>however, involved the construction of a statute modified by the general revision of the Code in 1919. The statute authorizing the revision\u2019s publication and distribution, Acts 1918, c. 108, explicitly directed the revisors to \u201cpublish such notes to each section . . ., as they may deem useful in explanation of the changes made in the law in such revision and codification.\u201d In addition, the re-visors noted in the preface to the Code of 1919 that they \u201cendeavored to point out the material changes made by the revision . . . .\u201d 1919 Code at xi.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In contrast, there is no such directive in Code \u00a7 9-77.11, the current statute providing for the code\u2019s periodic revision and recodification. Nor is there any similar notation concerning material changes by the revisors of Titles 38.1 and 38.2. Accordingly, we attach no significance to the lack of a revisors\u2019 note to Code \u00a7 38.2-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We compare these two statutes in light of the presumption that revised or recodified statutes are not substantively changed unless a contrary intent plainly appears in the revised statute. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>123 Va. 388, 391, 96 S.E. 776, <em>777 </em>(1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Code \u00a7 38.2-124(B)(l) divided into three sentences what had been the only sentence in the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 38.1-21. The legislature deleted the word \u201csuch\u201d in the second sentence, indicating that the ideas expressed in the first two sentences are now independent of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The first sentence deals specifically with medical payment coverage, the second sentence with weekly indemnity and other specific benefits. Each sentence specifies that the policy may include \u201cappropriate provisions\u201d for the specific coverages described.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">These statutory changes plainly indicate a legislative intent to alter the substantive meaning of the recodified provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the statutory clause mandating coverage for injuries sustained \u201cthrough being struck by a motor vehicle\u201d applies only with respect to weekly indemnity or other specific benefits, because that clause only appears in the now wholly independent second sentence of the recodified provision. Therefore, the policy\u2019s medical payment limitation does not conflict with the statute and the trial court erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, and enter final judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\"><em> </em>State Farm also claimed that there was no coverage because the delivery truck was furnished for Major\u2019s regular use and, therefore, was not a \u201cnon-owned\u201d motor vehicle within the coverage of the policy. Although the trial court found that the delivery truck was not furnished for Major\u2019s regular use, his guardian concedes that this finding was erroneous because of our recent decision in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>238 Va. 467, 383 S.E.2d 734 (1989). <em>Jones </em>was decided after the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\"><em> </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-318(A) provides that \u201c[ajny insurance policy or form containing any condition or provision that is not in compliance with this title shall be valid, but shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>construed and applied in accordance with the conditions and provisions required by this title.\u2019'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> <em>Seay </em>and <em>Jerrell, </em>construing the earlier code section, were decided <em>after </em>the 1986 amendment. Thus, at the time of the recodification of Title 38.1, the General Assembly was unaware of our later decisions interpreting the earlier statute. Its recodification could have merely been designed to reflect more clearly the General Assembly\u2019s understanding of the original meaning of that section, at a time when it was unaware of our interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
