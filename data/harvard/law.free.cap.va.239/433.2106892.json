Invoking the three grounds defined in subsections (c), (d), and (e) of Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (Repl. Vol. 1988) (now, subsections (3), (4), and (5) of \u00a7 18.2-31), the indictment alleged that the killing had been committed while the accused \u201cwas a prisoner confined in a State or local correctional facility or while in the custody of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>employee thereof, or while in the commission of robbery, while armed with a deadly weapon, or during the commission of or subsequent to rape\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The verdict form submitted to the jury in the first phase of the bifurcated trial quoted the three grounds alleged in the indictment and instructed the jury to \u201cstrike out\u201d any ground \u201cthat you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The jury marked through the third ground and returned a guilty verdict based upon the first and second grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The verdict form submitted to the jury in the penalty phase of the trial quoted the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) defining the \u201cdangerousness\u201d and the \u201cvileness\u201d predicates and instructed the jury to strike out the language of either predicate \u201cif either you do not unanimously find.\u201d The jury, \u201chaving considered the evidence in mitigation of the offense,\u201d returned the form unaltered and \u201cunanimously fix[ed] . . . punishment at death.\u201d After reviewing the probation report required by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court entered judgment confirming the conviction and imposing the penalty fixed by the jury. We have consolidated the defendant\u2019s appeal of the conviction with the automatic review of the sentence, Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (A) and (F), and accorded both priority on our docket, Code \u00a7 17-110.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">I. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Most of the facts and circumstances related to the attack which led to the victim\u2019s death are drawn from the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. Convicted in 1973 of first degree murder and sentenced to a term of 48 years, the defendant was an inmate at Haymarket Field Unit #26. On the morning of September 22, 1988, he and five other prisoners were transported to the Virginia Department of Transportation\u2019s Dale City Headquarters (VDOT) where they were assigned to a work detail supervised by a VDOT employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">During the course of his work that morning, the defendant damaged the point of a screwdriver which he repaired with the use of a bench grinder. At the same time he used the grinder to sharpen a short piece of metal (sometimes referred to as a \u201chighway spike\u201d) into the shape of a screwdriver, added a wooden handle, and attached the device to his shirt pocket with a holder fashioned from a paper clip. When the work crew suspended operations for lunch, the defendant crossed the perimeter fence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>and walked along Interstate Route 95 a distance of approximately a mile to Ashdale Plaza, a shopping center. There, he entered Dale City Floors, a retail carpet store, and inquired of the operator, Mrs. Gladys Napwasky, about oriental carpets.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The defendant challenged the prices she quoted, and a heated argument ensued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the defendant, she \u201cstarted screaming . . . nigger this and nigger that\u201d and \u201cspit in [his] face.\u201d The defendant slapped her with his open hand, and she kicked him in the genitals. As the defendant fell to the floor, he \u201ccaught the top part of her pants\u201d and pulled them \u201cdown right . . . by the thighs.\u201d Mrs. Napwasky \u201cslashed\u201d at him with a steak knife. The defendant \u201cpushed her off and . . . went straight for the shirt pocket and . . . came up and hit her in the chest and hit her up in the neck.\u201d \u201cBlood was coming from the nose and mouth and ... a trickle of blood . . . from the neck.\u201d The defendant \u201cchecked her pulse to make sure she was okay\u201d, placed a wet washcloth on the neck wound, and \u201ctook the sleeve of [his] shirt and . . . wiped her face.\u201d While searching for a first aid kit, the defendant found four dollars in coins. He explained that he left the store intending to use the coins to purchase ice from a vending machine located in the shopping center to apply to his victim\u2019s wounds. Changing his mind, he re-entered the store and \u201cstarted wiping all the things that [he] could remember that [he] had touched.\u201d When he returned to the VDOT, he washed blood from his shoes, took off his bloody shirt, \u201cput it in the trash bag and threw it in the trash can.\u201d He discarded the weapon used in the attack along the highway. The defendant testified that he had not raped his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A customer of the carpet store found Mrs. Napwasky lying on the floor and called a rescue squad. A paramedic testified that he had found her \u201cface up on her back on the floor in a pool of blood that was around her head and upper body\u201d; that she was naked below the waist and her blouse and brassiere had been pulled above her breasts; tfiat although her heart was beating, \u201cshe was breathless and pulseless\u201d because there was \u201cno . . . fluid for it to actually pump.\u201d The autopsy report identified 16 cuts and puncture wounds on the face, neck, chest, and left arm. A neck wound, three inches deep, severed the jugular vein. A wound four inches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>deep in the left chest cavity penetrated the left lung. Evidence of numerous \u201cblunt-force trauma injuries\u201d was found on her face and forehead. The victim\u2019s genital area was undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of several of the defendant\u2019s fellow inmates concerning his conduct following arrest. One witness testified that the defendant had fallen to his knees, crying and saying that he had killed somebody. Another said that the defendant had told him that he had murdered and robbed his victim. A third prisoner testified that the defendant had conceived an escape plan involving the use of violence. In a search of the defendant\u2019s cell while he was awaiting trial, the authorities found a piece of metal taken from a typewriter page stand and an ear bracket from a pair of spectacles. Both appeared to have been sharpened.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II. PRE-TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Au9\">A. <em>Constitutional Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the capital murder statutes are unconstitutional. The trial court rejected the several challenges articulated in a detailed memorandum. The defendant incorporated the memorandum in his brief filed in this Court. All the arguments urged by the defendant have been considered and rejected. See the decisions cited in <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 563, 568-69, 385 S.E.2d 850, 853-54 (1989); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 341, 352, 385 S.E.2d 50, 56-7 (1989); <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 412-13, 384 S.E.2d 757, 771 (1989), <em>cert. </em>denied, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 880 (1990); and <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 121-22, 360 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988). We reaffirm our decisions in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">B. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements he had made to an officer in two interviews conducted prior to his arrest. Initially, he stated that, upon hearing a scream, he had entered the carpet store to find \u201ca white guy\u201d with \u201clong blond hair\u201d who was \u201cbending over\u201d with \u201chis pants pulled down\u201d and a \u201clady . . . laying on the floor\u201d alive but \u201cbleeding through her mouth [and] nose\u201d. The white man fled, Mu\u2019Min said, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the defendant \u201cwent out the [back] door.\u201d Abandoning that account later, the defendant acknowledged that he had entered the store to inquire about an oriental rug and had struck Mrs. Napwasky twice during a bitter quarrel over prices. In significant respects, Mu\u2019Min\u2019s two statements were irreconcilably inconsistent. They were no more incriminating than his testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Attacking the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting selective portions of his extra-judicial statements to be read into evidence, the defendant contends that his statements were not voluntary because, he says, they were made while he was \u201cincarcerated on a prior charge\u201d, while he \u201cwas tired and scared\u201d, and at a time when he was given no \u201copportunity to speak with legal counsel.\u201d He declares on brief that he \u201cmerely said what the Investigator wanted him to say in the misguided belief that the Investigator was going to help him.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statements is an issue to be decided by the [trial] court, which evaluates the credibility of the witnesses, resolves any conflicts in the testimony, and weighs the evidence as a whole. The court must decide whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished and abandoned his rights. The court\u2019s determination is a question of fact based upon the totality of the circumstances. This factual finding will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\"><em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 477, 331 S.E.2d 422, 429-30 (1985) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">A review of the transcript of a tape recording of the testimony at the suppression hearing discloses no evidence of coercion. The two interviews were conducted at appropriate hours by a single investigator; the officer fully, definitively, and repeatedly advised Mu\u2019Min of each of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and the defendant expressly waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The defendant was qualified, both by training and experience, to make a knowing and voluntary waiver. Mu\u2019Min, a graduate of a private \u201cprep\u201d school, had earned a college degree in business administration and was literate in four languages. In his testimony at the suppression hearing, he acknowledged that, in response to questions propounded to him by the investigator, he had agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>that he understood each element of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, that he knew the interviews were being recorded, and that, because he had been represented by an attorney appointed to defend him at his 1973 murder trial, he was already aware that he was entitled to the advice of counsel. Nevertheless, he readily assented to the question whether he was \u201cwilling to talk . . . without consulting a lawyer or having a lawyer present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">We hold that the record completely supports the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his extra-judicial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">C. <em>Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Prior to trial, Mu\u2019Min filed a motion to require the Commonwealth to disclose \u201cthe factual basis\u201d for a claim of future dangerousness, one of the statutory predicates for the death penalty. Specifically, he requested detailed information concerning evidence of prior convictions, unadjudicated criminal charges, psychological evaluations, and any threatening statements made by the defendant which the Commonwealth intended to introduce at the penalty trial. Defense counsel claimed that, without such information, \u201cthe possibility arises of trial by ambush\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The trial court granted the motion, and the Commonwealth complied with the defendant\u2019s request. The Commonwealth then moved for disclosure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of those \u201cfacts in mitigation defendant intends to introduce at the penalty phase\u201d. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney explained that \u201cwe are merely asking for the same thing as defense asked of the Commonwealth\u201d. Granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, the court stated that the purpose of discovery is \u201cto prevent total surprise\u201d and that discovery \u201cruns [in] both directions\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">On appeal, Mu\u2019Min contends that the trial court infringed his due process rights by not limiting the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery rights to those granted expressly by Rule 3A: 11(c) and Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that, as Mu\u2019Min <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>argues, the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, and assuming further that the error was not invited as the Attorney General contends, we hold that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The information the defendant disclosed was couched in broad generalizations. Indeed, Mu\u2019Min\u2019s response to the discovery order contained little more than a routine recitation of the mitigating factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) and a reference to a \u201chistory of psychiatric evaluations\u201d. It did not contain the names of any potential witnesses or any other evidence Mu\u2019Min intended to offer. Moreover, the transcript of proceedings at the penalty trial shows that the Commonwealth offered no evidence to rebut the testimony Mu\u2019Min adduced as evidence in mitigation. The defendant cannot logically claim that he was prejudiced by a pretrial order granting the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery motion when his response disclosed nothing which gave the Commonwealth an unfair advantage at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">D. <em>Jury Selection</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5X\">1. Content Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In advance of trial, defense counsel submitted for approval a list of questions designed, in part, to determine what a prospective juror had seen, read, or heard about the case. Such questions are of a type characterized at bar as \u201ccontent questions\u201d. The trial court refused to allow counsel to propound such questions, and Mu\u2019Min argues on appeal that the court\u2019s refusal constituted \u201ca denial of due process of law\u201d and a violation of his right to \u201ctrial by an impartial jury\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Sixteen of the 20 members of the jury panel had indicated on <em>voir dire </em>that they had acquired some information from the news media or from conversations with acquaintances. In reply to questions propounded, both by the court and by counsel during the course of an examination that consumed 172 pages of the transcript, all members of the panel attested, collectively and in groups of four, that they had not formed any opinion based upon the information they had acquired, were not sensible of any bias or prejudice, could enter the jury box with an open mind, and were able to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the law and the evidence admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">We agree with the Attorney General that an opportunity to pose the kind of \u201ccontent questions\u201d the defendant proposed is not a matter of right. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31, 67-8 (D.C. Cir 1976) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 933 (1977) (affirming trial court\u2019s rejection of \u201ccontent questions\u201d on <em>voir dire </em>related to pre-trial publicity). The information a person acquires about a case from others may or may not prove to be the facts of the case as developed by evidence admitted at trial. Such information may or may not induce a person to form an opinion before trial. Any opinion formed before trial may or may not affect a person\u2019s ability as a juror to reach a different conclusion at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Of course, parties litigant may properly inquire whether a prospective juror has acquired information about the case before trial. It does not follow that litigants have a constitutional right to know what that information is. They are entitled to know only whether the prospective juror, in reliance upon the information acquired, has formed an opinion and, if so, whether the juror can yet \u201cstand indifferent in the cause\u201d. Code \u00a7 8.01-358; <em>L.E. Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 180, 184-87, 279 S.E.2d 151, 154-55 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723 (1961) (citations omitted). Quoting and applying this rule in a later case, the Supreme Court upheld the seating of a juror who had said on <em>voir dire, </em>\u201cMy experience of [the accused] is such that right now I would find him guilty.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 802 n.5 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Here, none of the members seated on the panel had formed an opinion based upon the information acquired before trial, and all had affirmed on oath that they could stand indifferent in the cause. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not err in disallowing the content questions proposed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">2. Seating Two Jurors</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Renewing objections raised during <em>voir dire, </em>Mu\u2019Min moved to strike two jurors for cause. On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motions to strike Alexandria Santiago, a prospective alternate, and Gregory Dailey. He argues that Ms. Santiago was not impartial because, he says, she \u201chad patronized Dale City Floors\u201d and referred during <em>voir dire </em>to Mrs. Napwasky \u201cby her first name\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The transcript shows that Ms. Santiago had said that she \u201cknew Gladys\u201d, that their relationship had been \u201cfriendly\u201d, but that \u201cwe weren\u2019t friends.\u201d In reply to questions put by defense counsel, she affirmed that her contacts with the victim did not \u201ccause [her] to form an opinion\u201d, that she was not \u201caware of any bias or prejudice\u201d, and that she was \u201cable to render a fair and impartial verdict and set aside [her] knowledge of Mrs. Napwasky\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Mu\u2019Min challenges the seating of Mr. Dailey on the ground that \u201chis deliberations would [have been] hampered and rushed by the financial hardship caused by jury service in a lengthy case.\u201d According to the record before us, Mr. Dailey made no plea of personal financial hardship. Asked what hardship his service on the jury would cause, he said, \u201cI\u2019m doing telephone communications, and the company I work for is very small and it would jeopardize their business right now.\u201d This, he believed, could make him feel \u201crushed\u201d and \u201ccould somewhat hamper\u201d his ability as a juror to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Under Code \u00a7 8.01-341.2, a person\u2019s duty to serve on a jury may be deferred or limited \u201cif serving on a jury . . . would cause such a person a particular occupational inconvenience.\u201d The privilege, one the statute makes available at the discretion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>court, is purely personal to the prospective juror and altogether unrelated to the inconvenience suffered by the person\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We find no merit in these assignments of error. Every question contemplated by Code \u00a7 8.01-358 and required by Rule 3A:14 was addressed to these prospective jurors by court and counsel. Every response Santiago and Dailey made fully supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that both were qualified to sit on the jury, and we will uphold his rulings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">III. GUILT TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">A. <em>Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">One of the elements of one of the forms of the offense charged in the indictment was the status of the accused at the time the offense was committed, <em>i.e., </em>that he was then \u201ca prisoner confined in a state or local correctional facility\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-31(c). As proof of Mu\u2019Min\u2019s status, the Commonwealth offered in evidence at the guilt trial a copy of the order of conviction of first degree murder entered against Mu\u2019Min in 1973. In keeping with its ruling against a motion that defense counsel had made <em>in limine, </em>the trial court admitted the order over the defendant\u2019s objection. On appeal, the defendant argues that evidence of prior crimes is inevitably prejudicial and that references the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made in the presence of the jury to the facts disclosed by that order compounded the prejudice. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s rulings constituted reversible error. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">A transcript of Mu\u2019Min\u2019s interview with the investigator in which, eventually, he confessed his assault upon Mrs. Napwasky was read to the jury. As the following excerpt reveals, the defendant initiated several references to his prior conviction and to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">WATSON: You tried to wipe off your fingerprints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">MU\u2019MIN: Wipe my fingerprints off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">WATSON: Why did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">MU\u2019MIN: Because I\u2019m a convicted murderer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">WATSON: Why didn\u2019t you come forward with this story earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">MU\u2019MIN: Because I\u2019m a convicted murderer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">MU\u2019MIN: I know what you\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing back in \u201873 . . . . When I got this murder charge I was sitting home. My aunt and my uncle both in the house, testified that I was home when a shot was fired, but because of certain physical evidence that they picked up, they had similarities and someone who said that he thought he saw me by the way someone walked, I\u2019ve been sitting in the penitentiary since this, since this \u201873 incident, the last 15 years ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">MU\u2019MIN: I mean how can it \u2014 that look, you know, how can that look good for me? I\u2019m a convicted murderer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">WATSON: Think about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-17\">MU\u2019MIN: Serving a 48 year sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">These several references, integral parts of a confession we have found to be voluntary, were competent evidence. <em>See Boggs </em>v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 501, 517, 331 S.E.2d 407, 419 (1985), <em>cert. denied </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986); <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>174 Va. 461, 463, 5 S.E.2d 497, 498-99 (1939). We hold, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>fore, that error, if any, resulting from the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning the 1973 order of conviction was rendered harmless by the defendant\u2019s own account of the same facts disclosed by that order. <em>See Schindel </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 814, 817, 252 S.E.2d 302, 304 (1979) (hearsay error rendered harmless by defendant\u2019s \u201cown testimony corroborating the factual details\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Challenging another evidentiary ruling, Mu\u2019Min argues that the trial court erred in excluding from the evidence a copy of a VDOT departmental regulation. The defendant offered the document to show that a VDOT employee assigned to supervise his work crew had not taken an oath as a peace officer as required by the regulation and, hence, that at the time the victim was killed, he was not \u201ca prisoner ... in the custody of an employee [of a correctional facility]\u201d within the contemplation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We need not consider this issue. The jury finding in the language of \u00a7 18.2-31(c) was only one of the bases for the guilty verdict. The jury also rested its verdict upon its finding in the language of \u00a7 18.2-31(d) that Mu\u2019Min committed the killing \u201cduring the commission of robbery while . . . armed with a deadly weapon.\u201d Consequently, the issue raised on appeal is moot. <em>Cf. Zant </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>462 U.S. 862 (1983) (death penalty upheld although one of three statutory aggravating circumstances subsequently declared invalid); <em>accord Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 427, 329 S.E.2d 815, 830, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888 (1985); <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 99, 110, 334 S.E.2d 838, 845 (1985), <em>cert. denied </em>478 U.S. 1010 (1986); <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 126, 134, 376 S.E.2d 288, 292, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. __, 109 S.Ct. 3263 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">B. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The defendant assigns error to the trial judge\u2019s rulings refusing four instructions relating to Mu\u2019Min\u2019s contention that he was not a prisoner within the intendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(c) and his ruling granting the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction to the contrary (see footnote 7 <em>supra). </em>For the reason just stated, we need not address these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Mu\u2019Min also questions another ruling on another instruction granted by the trial court. Instruction number 1 defined capital murder in terms of the three statutory definitions charged in the indictment and the elements of the lesser-included offenses of first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. The defendant believes that the instruction defined first degree murder and the standard of proof incorrectly and that the trial court erred in refusing his substitute draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In pertinent part, instruction number 1 told the jury that if they failed to find any of the three predicates for capital murder,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">but find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">(1) That the defendant killed Gladys Napwasky; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">(2) That the killing was malicious; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">(3) That the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcK\">then you shall find him guilty of first degree murder. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">We find no error in this instruction. Indeed, we see no material difference between this definition and that of the substitute draft, and we reject the defendant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">IV. PENALTY TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">A. <em>Passion or Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Whenever the death penalty is imposed, this Court is required to review the record to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d. Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1). The defendant claims that the trial court committed error by refusing the jury\u2019s request for a definition of the particulars of a life sentence. We disagree. Rejecting a similar claim in an earlier capital case, we said that the jury\u2019s question actually \u201ctends to show that the jury\u2019s deliberations were dispassionate, unprejudiced, and guided by earnest consideration of every factor relevant to the portentous decision they were required to make.\u201d <em>Delong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 357, 370, 362 S.E.2d 669, 676 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 929 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">The defendant also suggests that the jury\u2019s penalty decision was the result of some \u201cother arbitrary factor\u201d. The defendant offered in evidence at the penalty trial a copy of a departmental regulation providing that \u201c[a] prisoner . . . shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>left without supervision at any time.\u201d In response to the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the trial judge said, \u201cI question the relevancy . . . .\u201d The defendant urges us to commute the sentence of death on the ground that the judge\u2019s comment influenced the jury \u201cto disregard a major component of the defendant\u2019s evidence in mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">For two reasons, we decline to do so. First, the transcript shows that the judge\u2019s comment was made to the attorneys in a side-bar conference. Having in mind the purpose of such a conference, we think it is unlikely that the comment was heard by the jury. Second, even if the comment was overheard, the trial court\u2019s decision to overrule the Commonwealth\u2019s objection and admit the document for the jury\u2019s consideration cured any prejudice the comment may have caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Having conducted a thorough review of the voluminous record of both phases of the trial, we find nothing to show that the penalty imposed by the jury and confirmed by the trial court was the product of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">B. <em>Propriety of the Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">As required by Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2), we must now determine \u201cwhether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">1. Excessiveness</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">A death penalty is inherently excessive unless it is based upon what has come to be known as the \u201cdangerousness predicate\u201d or the \u201cvileness predicate\u201d. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">The penalty of death shall not be imposed unless the Commonwealth shall prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability based upon evidence of the prior history of the defendant or of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which he is accused that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, or that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Tracking the language of the statute as incorporated in the court\u2019s instruction number 1, the jury\u2019s verdict based the death penalty upon both predicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The defendant challenges the jury\u2019s finding of the vileness predicate because, he says, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney failed \u201cto include torture in his bill of particulars\u201d and \u201cthe evidence . . . did not establish torture.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think the evidence of the multiple, grievous wounds inflicted upon Mrs. Napwasky was sufficient to prove torture, <em>see Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 516, 323 S.E.2d 539, 553 (1984), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>471 U.S. 1096 (1985) (\u201ctorture\u201d correctly included in vileness instruction where evidence was sufficient to show victim, \u201c[w]hile still alive, . . . was severely bruised and bitten on her breast\u201d). However, it is immaterial that the jury instruction and the jury\u2019s verdict contained the word \u201ctorture\u201d when the bill of particulars did not. It is immaterial because, as defined in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and -264.4(C), \u201cthe term \u2018vileness\u2019 includes three separate and distinct factors, with proof of any one factor being sufficient to support a finding of vileness and hence a sentence of death.\u201d <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 442, 304 S.E.2d 271, 282, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The autopsy report identified 16 cuts and puncture wounds on the victim\u2019s face, neck, chest, and left arm and numerous blunt-force injuries to the face and forehead. Clearly, the evidence was sufficient to prove an \u201caggravated battery\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ca battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d <em>M. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). Indeed, a single stab wound may, under certain circumstances, be sufficient to satisfy this definition. <em>See, e.g., Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. at 132-33, 376 S.E.2d at 291-92; <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 303, 313, 329 S.E.2d 807, 814, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In light of the \u201cevidence of the prior history of the defendant [and] of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense\u201d, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C), we think the jury was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tirely justified in finding that the defendant \u201cwould constitute a continuing serious threat to society\u201d, <em>id. </em>We need not recite the details of that evidence. It is enough that we have found proof of the vileness predicate sufficient to support the imposition of the death penalty. \u201cWhen a jury makes separate findings of specific statutory aggravating circumstances, any of which could support a sentence of death, and one of the circumstances subsequently is invalidated, the remaining valid circumstance, or circumstances, will support the sentence.\u201d <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. at 110, 334 S.E.2d at 845, quoted with approval in, <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. at 134, 376 S.E.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">2. Disproportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) requires us to compare the case under review with \u201csimilar cases\u201d in making our determination whether \u201cthe sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate\u201d. To facilitate that comparison as directed in \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated the records in all capital murder cases to come before this Court (including those in which the penalty imposed was a life sentence) and stored and indexed those records apart from those in all other criminal cases. In selecting cases from that inventory for purposes of our comparison, we give special attention to those in which the death penalty was based upon the same statutory predicate (or predicates) as that underlying the penalty under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The cases in which the death penalty was based, as it was here, upon both the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate and the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate are collected and annotated in our recent opinion in <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 319-20, 384 S.E.2d 785, 799-800 (1989). <em>See also R. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 389 S.E.2d 871 (1990). We have compared the records in those cases with that in the case at bar, and we are satisfied that \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">V. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">By counsel appointed specially, Mu\u2019Min charges that his trial lawyer was ineffective because he failed at the penalty trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>to submit certain instructions and to object to several instructions as well as to the verdict form approved by the trial court. These failures, he says, are patently prejudicial and unjustifiable by any acceptable explanation. In <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 352 S.E.2d 342, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987), we rejected just such a claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Defendant complains of errors of omission committed by his trial counsel. Yet the record contains no testimony from trial counsel concerning his alleged acts of omission. Were we to attempt to dispose of defendant\u2019s contentions on this record, we would be called upon to declare the work of an attorney to be ineffective without that attorney having an opportunity to explain his conduct, [citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">The defendant argues, however, that though the record does not contain everything that relates to the question of ineffective assistance of counsel, it contains enough to establish that trial counsel failed to do things that obviously should have been done and for which there can be no acceptable explanation. However, [Code \u00a7 19.2-317.1] does not say that we can proceed where there is partial evidence of ineffectiveness. The statute presupposes a full record on the very issue that is the basis for the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We conclude, therefore, that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel cannot be raised in this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 352 S.E.2d at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Applying the qualifying language of Code \u00a7 19.2-317.1,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we remain committed to our previous rulings. Trial counsel will not be exposed to the possibility of professional disgrace without \u201can opportunity to defend himself on the record by giving the rationale for his challenged acts of omission or commission\u201d. <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 470, 352 S.E.2d 352, 362, <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987); <em>accord Frye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 400, 345 S.E.2d 267, 287-88 (1986). <em>See R.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Finding no reversible error in the conduct of either phase of the bifurcated trial and no cause to commute the death sentence, we will affirm the judgment confirming the jury\u2019s two verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> Other evidence showed, however, that Dale City Floors had not stocked oriental carpets for eleven years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> It is of no consequence that both Mu\u2019Min and the Commonwealth labelled their pleadings as motions for bills of particulars.

Applying Rule 5:25 in a similar procedural context, we have refused to consider a challenge to a death-qualifying question. \u201cIf a party objects to rulings made during the voir dire of a prospective juror, but subsequently fails to object to the seating of that juror, the party has waived the voir dire objections.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 306, 384 S.E.2d 785, 793 (1989).

A trial court\u2019s assessment of prospective jurors\u2019 potential for bias is presumptively correct, <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1036 (1984); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 124, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987), absent manifest error, <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1031-32 n.7; <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723 (1961); <em>Pope, </em>234 Va. at 124, 360 S.E.2d at 358. In this case, however, I believe there was \u201cmanifest error\u201d in refusing to permit <em>any </em>of the questions necessary to establish a factual and objective basis for assessing juror impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The record discloses an unusual amount of pretrial publicity. The charge involved the alleged capital murder of a local resident by a convict who was serving a part of his sentence for first degree murder as a member of a road gang. After this murder, county officials and local citizens publicly expressed surprise, outrage, and fear for the safety of local residents upon discovery that prisoners like Mu\u2019Min, who had been convicted of violent crimes, were permitted to work in such close contact with the public. When the prospective jurors were assembled, 16 of them responded affirmatively to the question of whether they had \u201cacquired any information from the news media or from any other source\u201d regarding the offense. The trial court then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">Would the information that you heard, received, or read from whatever source, would that information affect your impartiality in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Is there anyone that would say what you\u2019ve read, seen, heard, or whatever information you may have acquired from whatever the source would affect your impartiality so that you could not be impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">In view of everything that you\u2019ve seen, heard, or read, or any information from whatever source that you\u2019ve acquired in this case, is there anyone who believes that you could not become a Juror, enter the Jury box with an open mind and wait until the entire case is presented before reaching a fixed opinion or a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Only one prospective juror responded to these inquiries; the balance remained silent. That prospective juror was excused for cause when he said he could not be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Because of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we do not know what the prospective jurors had read or heard about the case before trial. We do know, however, that the following information regarding the accused, not a part of the evidence at the guilt phase of trial, was published in the local papers:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">1. His suspected assault upon a fellow prisoner, resulting in a broken nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">2. His citation for 23 prison violations and his rejection for parole on six previous applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">3. His 1973 conviction for the murder and robbery of a Grayson County cab driver, with some details of the crime and a statement from the Grayson County prosecutor that the death penalty was not available when the accused was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">4. His juvenile record in New York and Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">5. His alleged commission of a burglary and engagement in \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d activities while a prisoner. Also, there were indications that a rape may also have been involved in the commission of this murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">An accused has statutory and constitutional rights to trial by an impartial jury. I do not believe that defense counsel was afforded a meaningful voir dire examination of prospective jurors, as mandated by Code \u00a7 8.01-358. The majority disposes of this contention in a footnote (n.3) by relying upon <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>where we said that \u201c[a] party has no right, statutory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>otherwise, to propound any question he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad </em>infinitum.\u201d 225 Va. at 581, 304 S.E.2d at 653. Nothing in the record in the present case, however, suggests that defense counsel sought to \u201cpropound any question he wishe[d], or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad </em>infinitum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Code \u00a7 8.01-358 mandates that \u201ccounsel for either party shall have the right to examine under oath any person who is called as a juror . . . and shall have the right to ask such person ... directly any relevant question to ascertain whether he ... is sensible of any bias or prejudice.\u201d The section further provides that \u201c[a] juror, knowing anything relative to a fact in issue, shall disclose the same in open court.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358. Moreover, as we said in <em>LeVasseur, </em>\u201c[t]he court must afford a party a full and fair opportunity to ascertain whether prospective jurors \u2018stand indifferent in the cause.\u2019 \u201d 225 Va. at 581, 304 S.E.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In enacting Code \u00a7 8.01-358, the General Assembly intended to provide counsel a meaningful voir dire examination. Clearly, questions pertaining to what a prospective juror had seen, read, or heard about the case are \u201crelevant ... to ascertain whether he ... is sensible of any bias or prejudice.\u201d Therefore, the court violated Mu\u2019Min\u2019s statutory right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Additionally, \u201c[ujnder the Federal and State Constitutions, U.S. Const, amends. VI and XIV; Va. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8, an accused has a right to trial by an \u2018impartial jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wm. Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 653, 658, 283 S.E.2d 212, 215 (1981). As illustrated by the majority opinion, 239 Va. at 443-44, we frequently apply federal decisions construing the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury in construing this same right under art. 1, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution. <em>See also, Mackall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 251, 372 S.E.2d 759, 766 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>109 S.Ct. 3261 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">An accused\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury is violated if jurors are impanelled after an inadequate voir dire examination. <em>See, e.g., Turner </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>476 U.S. 1 (1986). If the examination is inadequate, the accused\u2019s right is prejudiced in two respects; he is unable to exercise effectively his right of challenge, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340, 368 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 970 (1973), and the trial court is unable to assess fairly the prospective jurors\u2019 impartiality. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>583 F.2d 190, 197-98 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Thus, when there has been unusual pretrial publicity in a criminal case, the Supreme Court has said that there must be \u201cfair support in the record for the state courts\u2019 conclusion that the jurors . . . would be impartial.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1038. Moreover, where prospective jurors have indicated that they were exposed to pretrial publicity in response to questions similar to those posed in this case, we have warned: \u201c[T]he <em>proof </em>that [a prospective juror] is impartial and fair, should <em>come from him </em>and not be based on his mere assent to persuasive suggestions.\u201d <em>Breeden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1976) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In other words, \u201cin the absence of an examination designed to elicit answers which provide an <em>objective basis </em>for the court\u2019s evaluation, \u2018merely going through the form of obtaining jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality is insufficient ....\u2019\u201d <em>Silverthorne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>400 F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. 1968) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). In at least two of our cases involving pretrial publicity, we have said that a trial court should have rejected such subjective assurances. <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 977, 266 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1980); <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 298-300, 227 S.E.2d at 736-37. \u201c[H]owever willing the juror might be to trust himself, the law will not trust him.\u201d <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Accordingly, whether a juror can impartially render a verdict \u201cshould not be [based] on that juror\u2019s [subjective] assessment of self-righteousness without something more.\u201d <em>Silverthorne, </em>400 F.2d at 639. Instead, a trial court must objectively and independently assess each prospective juror\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">When a juror is exposed to potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity, it is necessary to determine whether the juror can lay aside any impression or opinion due to the exposure. The juror is poorly placed to make a determination as to his own impartiality. Instead, the <em>trial court </em>should make this determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Lippman, </em>763 F.2d 1265, 1274 (11th Cir. 1985) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \u201cThe issue of who is, or is not, a competent juror is one for the trial court to decide,\u201d <em>Justus, </em>220 Va. at 976, 266 S.E.2d at 91, not the juror himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Furthermore, I believe the questions in this case were deficient in that the prospective jurors could simply remain silent as an implied indication of a lack of bias or prejudice. This gave the trial court no effective opportunity to assess the demeanor of each prospective juror in disclaiming bias. Moreover, even if the court had required an express affirmation of each prospective juror, such an affirmation would have required an admission of bias or prejudice before the assembled panel. \u201cNo doubt each juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and impartial to the [accused], but the psychological impact requiring such a declaration before one\u2019s fellows is often its father.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Apparently, we have never addressed the <em>necessity </em>of such questions at voir dire, where panel members have been exposed to unusual pretrial publicity. However, we have ample precedent for such questions. In <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 710, 204 S.E.2d 414 (1974), the trial court sought a description of what was actually remembered by those prospective jurors who had been subjected to pretrial publicity. There, we sustained the trial court\u2019s objective findings regarding the impartiality of those prospective jurors, who we noted had remembered few of the details of such publicity. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 204 S.E.2d at 420. Although not the subject of our discussion, an inspection of the appendices in the following cases indicates that \u201ccontent\u201d questions were likewise asked of prospective jurors exposed to pretrial publicity. <em>Mackall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 372 S.E.2d 759 (1988); <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 564, 304 S.E.2d 644 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 844, 284 S.E.2d 844 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Justus, </em>220 Va. 971, 266 S.E.2d 87; <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. 297, 227 S.E.2d 734; <em>Greenfield, </em>214 Va. 710, 204 S.E.2d 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The questions proffered by the accused,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and refused by the court, were clearly designed to provide a factual and objective basis for assessing the potential for bias.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some prospective jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>may honestly have felt that the publicity had not affected their impartiality; however, a disclosure of what was actually remembered could lead an impartial observer to conclude that there was a bias of which the potential juror was unaware, as in <em>Justus </em>and <em>Breeden. </em>\u201cVoir dire examination serves to protect [the right to a fair trial] by exposing possible biases, both known and unknown, on the part of potential jurors.\u201d <em>McDonough Power Equipment </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 554 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">I believe that the majority\u2019s citation of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976), for the proposition that the opportunity to ask \u201ccontent questions\u201d is \u201cnot a matter of right,\u201d misconstrues the essence of that holding. The <em>Haldeman </em>Court explicitly agreed that a certain ABA Standard \u201cmandate [d] an inquiry into the <em>sources and intensity </em>of a venireman\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity, not an inquiry into his recollection of the content of that publicity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69 (emphasis added). Moreover, emphasizing that the voir dire in <em>that </em>defendant\u2019s case permitted counsel to determine the <em>nature and intensity of the exposure </em>to pretrial publicity, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">We agree that it would have been reversible error for the Court to accept jurors simply because they said they would be fair .... In this case, however, the Court had before it and acted on not only the jurors\u2019 subjective assurances but also <em>objective information </em>relating how closely they had followed Watergate and their <em>sources </em>of information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 67 n.51 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In addition, <em>Haldeman </em>distinguished <em>Dellinger </em>and <em>Silverthorne, </em>two cases involving constitutionally inadequate voir dire, on the ground that the trial courts in those cases failed to permit <em>any </em>questions concerning the source and intensity of exposure to pretrial publicity. <em>See id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As in <em>Dellinger </em>and <em>Silverthorne, </em>the trial court in this case rejected <em>all </em>voir dire questions aimed at determining the source and intensity of exposure to pretrial publicity, as well as \u201ccontent\u201d questions. In my view, it was not necessarily error to preclude some or even all of the \u201ccontent\u201d questions; however, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>court\u2019s conduct of voir dire was constitutionally inadequate, even under <em>Haldeman, </em>in its blanket refusal to permit <em>any </em>questions aimed at determining the <em>sources and intensity </em>of exposure to pretrial publicity (e.g., where did you hear about this case; how many times did you hear about it; and when did you hear about it).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">In my opinion, under the circumstances of this case, the refusal to permit any questions regarding the source and intensity of knowledge regarding pretrial publicity violated the accused\u2019s statutory and constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury. Although I agree with the majority opinion in all other respects, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial at which appropriate voir dire questions should be asked.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> The tenor of the proffered questions was: What have you seen, read or heard about this case; from whom did you get this information; when and where did you get this information; have you discussed this case with anyone; with whom; when and where; what did you discuss; if an opinion had been formed, what is it; has anyone expressed an opinion about this case to you; who; what; when; and where?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> Without necessarily approving each of the proffered questions, if the trial court permits no questions regarding the source and extent of exposure to pretrial publicity, and, therefore, content questions are necessary, at minimum, I believe each prospective juror subjected to pretrial publicity should have been asked what information he recalled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>when it was received. Moreover, the risk of \u201ctainting\u201d the other prospective jurors could have been minimized by excluding the others from the courtroom during each examination, or by examining them in smaller groups, as the court did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
