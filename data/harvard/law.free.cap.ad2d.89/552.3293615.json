Upon the appeal, order modified by deleting the words \u201cany further construction or development of correctional facilities or structures, at, or\u201d and the words \u201cand pending further order of the Court.\u201d As so modified, order affirmed, without costs or disbursements. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, it is inappropriate to compel appellants to undergo the additional expense entailed in stopping the construction presently in progress. We urge the parties to complete the hearing and the Special Term Justice to make a decision no later than July 9, 1982. An expeditious hearing and decision will best serve the public interests and the interests of all parties. Mollen, P. J., Titone, Mangano and Thompson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
