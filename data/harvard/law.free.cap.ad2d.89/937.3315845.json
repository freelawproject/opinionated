Order modified, on the law, by deleting therefrom the second decretal paragraph thereof and by substituting therefor a provision denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, and said indictment is reinstated. As so modified, order affirmed. Liberally construed, the charge of the District Attorney to the Grand Jury was sufficient. We find the other point raised by the defendant to be without merit. Damiani, J. P., Shapiro, Hargett and Martuscello, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
