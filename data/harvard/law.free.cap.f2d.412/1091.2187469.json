Hardy, Director of the Department of Corrections; Charles M. Rodgers, Acting Superintendent of the District of Columbia Jail; and two Corrections Officers at the jail. In this complaint, appellant alleged that certain \u201cunjust and cruel\u201d disciplinary action, <em>i. e., </em>placement in a \u201ccontrol cell,\u201d was taken against him, for which no \u201cprobable cause can be given.\u201d He alleged further that the officers, in transferring him to the control cell, used \u201cabusive language\u201d and threatened him, putting him \u201cin fear of suffering severe bodily harm or being killed.\u201d He sought an order that he be released from the control cell and \u201cgiven the privileges of all other inmate [sic] thus the right to attend religious service [sic] without discrimination or criminal negligence of the defendants,\u201d or his release from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>custody \u201cfor such reasons as cruel and inhuman punishments inflicted because of prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Appellant was granted leave to file his complaint without prepayment of fees and costs, but the District Court, on January 24, 1967, denied his motion for appointment of counsel. On February 1, 1967, appellees filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment,\u201d asserting 1) that no claim is stated, since the allegations relate to the \u201cinternal management of prisons,\u201d and 2) that the \u201caffidavit of Charles M. Rodgers attached to the instant motion * * * indicates that the prison authorities had substantial grounds upon which to base their disciplinary action against plaintiff and that they have not abused their discretion in this regard.\u201d The affidavit of appellee Rodgers stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-6\">That on the 14 November, 1966, Hudson was cited in two (2) Disciplinary Reports for Violations of Regulations No. 6 &amp; 7, Profanity and Threats of Bodily Harm and Rule #7, Refusing to Cooperate, and that on 14 November, 1966, he was placed in the Control Cell Area to await action of the Disciplinary Board. That on 30 November, 1966, Plaintiff was released from the Control Cell Area and transferred to Cell Block Two, Special Treatment Unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">On March 1, 1967, the District Court ordered \u201cThat the motion of defendants to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment be, and the same is, hereby granted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>was granted by the District Court on March 15, 1967, and on October 6, in response to an inquiry from the Clerk of this court, appellant moved for appointment of counsel on appeal. Because of errors appearing on the face of the record, we vacate the judgment appealed from and remand for further proceedings, without reaching the question of appointment of counsel in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">It is well settled that a complaint may not be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While it is true that jail officials have wide discretion in matters of discipline and security,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that discretion is not limitless, and allegations of cruel or unreasonable punishment are clearly matters for judicial inquiry<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 especially where it is alleged that such punishment reflects discriminatory treatment of a racial or religious minority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, appellant alleged that he was threatened and subjected to \u201ctorture\u201d and \u201ccruel and inhuman punishments,\u201d without \u201cprobable cause.\u201d In addition, he alleged that he was punished \u201cbecause of prejudice,\u201d and sought the right to attend religious services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>\u201cwithout discrimination.\u201d Despite their vagueness,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> these allegations were sufficient to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Summary judgment may be entered if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In resisting a motion for summary judgment which is supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence, a party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). In this case, appellant\u2019s general allegations of discrimination and cruel and unreasonable punishment were met by the affidavit of appellee Rodgers that certain punishment had been inflicted for specific infractions of jail rules and regulations. In the ordinary civil case, appellant\u2019s failure to respond by affidavit might have warranted the entry of summary judgment against him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\"> We have recognized, however, that the requirements of the summary judgment rule may not fairly be applied \u201cwith strict literalness\u201d to a prisoner unrepresented by counsel and subject to the \u201chandicaps * * * detention necessarily imposes upon a litigant.\u201d Phillips v. United States Board of Parole, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 352 F.2d 711 (1965). In <em>Phillips, </em>we noted that \u201cappellant has neither the facilities nor has he had the opportunity to provide the documentary evidence that would have been necessary, by ordinary standards, to defeat appel-lees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u201d 122 U.S.App.D.C. at 238, 352 F.2d at 714. As in <em>Phillips, </em>appellant in this case was not represented by counsel; and nothing in the record indicates that he was notified that failure to respond to appellees\u2019 motion and affidavit would result in the entry of summary judgment against him. Under these circumstances, appellant was clearly not afforded an \u201copportunity\u201d to comply with Rule 56(e), whether or not he also lacked the \u201cfacilities\u201d to do so. We hold that before entering summary judgment against appellant, the District Court, as a bare minimum, should have provided him with fair notice of the requirements of the summary judgment rule. We stress the need for a form of notice sufficiently understandable to one in appellant\u2019s circumstances fairly to apprise him of what is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">Merely providing notice of the technical requirements of the summary judgment rule, of course, cannot be expected in every case fully to compensate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>for the handicaps resulting from detention and indigency. It may be that, even if apprised of the need for a factual response to appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion, appellant would have lacked sufficient access to sources of proof, understanding of the legal issues involved, or ability to express himself, to demonstrate the existence of a question of material fact. In a proceeding of this kind, the District Court has discretion with respect to appointment of counsel,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we do not suggest that the initial denial of appellant\u2019s motion for counsel constituted an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An indigent prisoner, however, may be more greatly disadvantaged by the absence of legal assistance when he is called upon to resist a motion for summary judgment than might otherwise have been the case. When necessary to insure that an indigent prisoner\u2019s allegations receive fair consideration, the court\u2019s plain duty is to appoint counsel to assist him in defending the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">We conclude by noting that considerable flexibility and a wide range of alternatives are available to the District Court in dealing with the problem presented by this case. One possibility, of course, would be simply to deny summary judgment and hold an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Permitting the prisoner to appear in person and testify in his own behalf may, at least in some cases, be both a fairer and a more economical \u201cmeans of discovering the bases of his complaints and assaying the credibility of his representations.\u201d Phillips v. United States Board of Parole, <em>supra, </em>122 U.S.App.D.C. at 238, 352 F.2d at 714; see United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, 281 F.2d 707, 715-716 (2d Cir. 1960). Other means of dealing with prisoner complaints may occur to the District Court which afford substantial justice without imposing undue burdens on the court, the bar, or those who are called upon to defend such suits. We repeat, however, that any procedure chosen must be such as to \u201cassure that the prisoner\u2019s claims receive fair, adequate, and meaningful consideration.\u201d United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, <em>supra, </em>at 716. Since the procedure followed in this case was deficient measured by these standards, we vacate the judgment appealed from and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">.
