He was sentenced to a term of four years with parole eligibility to be determined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (a) (2). The only point raised on this appeal is that the sentence is harsh and excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-25\">The record shows that the defendant was represented by competent counsel and knowingly and voluntarily entered a plea of guilty. The sentence was within the five-year maximum authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. We have repeatedly held that a sentence within the statutory limits is invulnerable to attack on appellate review. Hall v. United States, 10 Cir., 404 F.2d 1365, 1366; Davidson v. United States, 10 Cir., 411 F.2d 75; and Little v. United States, 10 Cir., 409 F.2d 1343. Counsel for defendant argues that appellate control of sentences is permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. This contention was specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>rejected in Smith v.
