Koppel Company (the Company) to bargain upon request with the National Organization of Industrial Trade Unions (the Union). See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). For reasons which hereinafter appear, we deny the petition without prejudice and remand the case to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">The Company processes and sells textile remnants at a plant in Newark and a store in Westwood, New Jersey. In 1966, Koppel was the President and Strauss, his nephew, was the Vice-President and Manager. At that time, approximately ten employees worked at the plant and two at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">Glassman, an organizer for the Union, gave several Union authorization cards to Thompson, an employee of the Company, on August 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thompson distributed the cards to other employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>and, within four days, seven of them, including himself, had signed and returned cards to Glassman. Thereafter, under date of August 23, the Union sent a letter to the Company, stating that <em>\u201ca </em>majority of your employees\u201d had authorized it to represent them and requesting \u201c[a]n early conference * * * for the purpose of discussing formal recognition of the Union and terms of a collective bargaining agreement\u201d. Without waiting for a reply, the Union filed the next day, August 24, a petition with the regional director of the Board, seeking certification as representative of the employees for collective bargaining purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Also on August 24, the letter arrived at the Company plant. However, Koppel and his wife were in Europe, having left about two weeks before on an extended vacation. Strauss responded immediately that \u201c[o]ur Mr. Koppel, who is the head of our organization, is presently out of town, and shall not return until late September, at which time your communication will be brought to his attention\u201d. On August 25, Strauss received a copy of the representation petition. That same day, he went to the plant\u2019s sorting room and questioned the five employees he found there about the Union. Ascertaining that several of them had signed authorization cards, Strauss apparently communicated with his uncle in Europe. Thereafter, a letter arrived from the Koppels, dated August 29 and addressed to all the employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was read to them aloud and posted on a bulletin board at the plant. On September 8, Strauss granted incremental wage increases to the four girls who worked in the sorting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Meanwhile, the Company was participating in the various stages of the representation proceeding. Prehearing conferences, with representatives of the Company and the Union present, were held on August 29 and September 13. Although the Koppels returned from Europe on September 11, Glassman never demanded of Koppel that he bargain with the Union. Instead, a representation hearing was conducted on September 14 and on October 6 the regional director ordered an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">However, the Union then withdrew its representation petition and, on October 13, filed unfair labor practice charges against the Company. A Complaint was duly issued by the General Counsel and a hearing conducted before a trial examiner. His decision held that Strauss\u2019 interrogation of the girls, the Koppels\u2019 letter, and the wage increases \u201cinter-ferred with, restrained, and coerced [the], * * * employees\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1). Also, upon a finding that the Union had, by its August 23 letter, requested bargaining in an appropriate unit, he held that the Company had refused to bargain within the meaning of \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act. A bargaining order was recommended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board affirmed without substantial modification and now petitions us to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">We hold that the Company was denied procedural due process of law in the proceedings before the trial examiner and that the possibility of resulting prejudice requires a remand to the Board for the taking of additional testimony and consideration of an appropriate order in the light of the supplemented record.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">Because the Union had withdrawn its representation petition and substituted the unfair labor practice charges, the trial examiner apparently regarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>representation proceedings as irrelevant to the issues before him. This attitude manifested itself in the exclusion from evidence of both the petition and the regional director\u2019s direction of election \u201cfor all purposes\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as in the refusal to allow counsel for the Company to examine Strauss concerning the relationship between the representation proceedings and certain of his actions alleged to be unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Strauss received the Union\u2019s representation petition within a day after its letter had arrived. He was \u201ccompletely surprised\u201d such a petition had been filed, he testified, since Glassman had orally assured him the Union would await Koppel's return before taking any further action. According to Strauss, he questioned the sorting room girls in an effort to determine which employees the Union was claiming for a bargaining unit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and whether it in fact had the \u201cmajority\u201d referred to in the letter. Counsel for the Company, however, was not permitted to fully examine Strauss about his doubts as which employees were being referred to in the petition, insofar as such doubts precipitated his questioning of the girls. We think this was unfairly restrictive, in view of the fact that the trial examiner found the questioning to have taken place before receipt of the petition<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that Strauss\u2019 actual purpose was to \u201cfrighten [the girls] * * * into withdrawing * * * from the Union\u201d. The excluded testimony was relevant, not only to a determination of the correct sequence of these events but also to the causal relationship between them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\"> Also, counsel for the Company was not allowed to question Strauss about his understanding of the Union\u2019s August 23 letter in the context of the representation petition. On the record before us, this was error. An employer is under no duty to accede to an ambiguous request to bargain. National Can Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 374 F.2d 796 (7th Cir. 1967). The trial examiner stated during the hearing that \u201c[t]he letter will have to speak for itself\u201d and held in his decision, without discussion, that it \u201ccontain [ed] a plain request for recognition and collective bargaining\u201d. However, the letter was clearly incapable of speaking for itself. The contemporaneous filing of a representation petition was relevant to the important issue of whether the letter constituted a legally sufficient request for bargaining in an appropriate unit, such as could be the basis of a refusal to bargain. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>National Can Corporation v. N. L. R. B., supra, at 800-802; Flomatic Corporation, 147 N.L.R.B. 1304 (1964); Longview Furniture Company, 100 N.L.R.B. 301 (1952).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The filing of the petition, however, was not the only surrounding circumstance which the trial examiner failed to take into consideration in determining whether there had been a \u00a7 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain. Strauss testified that on two occasions prior to receiving the Union\u2019s letter of August 23, Glass-man had orally assured him that he would wait and discuss the Union with Koppel when he returned. Although this testimony was uncontradieted, the examiner rejected it, finding it \u201cimpossible to believe\u201d that any assurances had been given by Glassman.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> Such a determination of credibility would ordinarily be entitled to our respect. See Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Bd., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); Valley Forge Flag Company v. N. L. R. B., 364 F.2d 310 (3rd Cir. 1966). However, our respect is not justified where, as here, the examiner himself has contributed to a witness\u2019 lack of credibility by improperly restricting his testimony. Counsel for the Company was not permitted to examine Strauss regarding two additional instances of assurances received from Glassman. According to the offers of proof, Strauss would have testified that, after he received the representation petition, Glass-man twice told him that the letter and petition were formalities and that he was continuing to await Koppel\u2019s return, at which time an election could be held. The disallowance of this testimony was error. See National Can Corporation v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra; </em>Flomatic Corporation, <em>supra; </em>Longview Furniture Company, <em>supra. </em>Corroborating testimony on this point was also excluded, which magnified the error since Strauss was the Company\u2019s only witness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>pare Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 225-226, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). The trial examiner was not entitled to refuse to credit testimony for whose limited nature his improper exclusionary rulings were responsible. Cf. Valley Forge Flag Company v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The examiner compounded this inequity in his decision by treating such of this testimony as he did allow inconsistently from other testimony in the record. As part of the Company\u2019s attack on the validity of the Union authorization cards,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Strauss related that Wilson, one of the seven employees who had signed cards, had told him he did so only \u201cto be one of the gang,\u201d and because the other employees had assured him it was \u201cjust an address card\u201d. The examiner rejected this uneontradicted testimony, citing the fact that the Company did not produce Wilson as a witness. Yet Strauss\u2019 testimony of Glassman\u2019s assurances, also uncontradicted, was rejected even though Glassman, who was present at the hearing, was not recalled by the Union to refute it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are unable to reconcile such disparate treatment of the failure of a witness to testify. Together with the trial examiner\u2019s improper restriction of Strauss\u2019 direct examination, it signifies to us the denial of an essentially fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">We pass finally to the question of whether the trial examiner\u2019s improper handling of the hearing and record prejudiced the Company to the extent that we should refuse enforcement of the Board\u2019s petition. Strauss\u2019 understanding of the Union\u2019s August 23 letter, in the light of the contemporaneous representation proceedings and of Glassman\u2019s oral assurances,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was an important factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>this case. The restrictions on his relevant testimony resulted in what we regard as a record inadequate for the proper determination of whether there had been a proper request and subsequent refusal to bargain under \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act. It is of no moment on such a record that evidence of unfair labor practices may be \u201csubstantial\u201d in itself. \u201cThe substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Bd., <em>supra, </em>340 U.S., at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464. If the Company were permitted to supplement the record, the additional testimony might so detract from the substan-tiality of the Union\u2019s case that we would be required to reach a different result in, a later enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Accordingly, the petition for enforcement will be denied. This proceeding will be remanded to the Board, with the direction that the Company be afforded an opportunity to adduce that testimony erroneously excluded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our decision is without prejudice to the Board\u2019s right to renew its petition for enforcement if, after a fair and objective appraisal of the supplemented record has been completed, its order is again in the Union\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">.

The letter contained, inter alia, a request that the employees wait until the Koppels returned before undertaking to join the Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b739-15\">. The examiner stated that even if the Union\u2019s request was inadequate to give rise to \u00a7 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain, the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations were sufficiently severe to warrant issuing a bargaining order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\">. The General Counsel, however, was permitted to introduce into evidence a list of employees which the Company had submitted to the regional director in the representation proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. The letter contained only a reference to \u201cyour employees,\u201d whereas the petition named \u201call production, maintenance, shipping, and receiving employees,\u201d but in the factory only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. The examiner stated that \u201cthe interrogation tool: place <em>before </em>he had even received the petition, for it [the petition] could not have been received by him until <em>after </em>lie had received [the Union\u2019s] * * letter of August 23 and replied to the letter on August 24\u201d. Strauss did testify that he received the petition after he had sent off the reply letter, but there is no indication in the record that the interrogation preceded that letter, sent August 24, which appears to be basic to the examiner\u2019s conclusion. Indeed, the only clear testimony in the record as to the correct sequence was Strauss\u2019 uncontra-dicted statement that he had already received the petition when he questioned the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">The Board compounded this confusion by stating in footnote 2 of its order and in its brief before us (p. 4) that the correct sequence could not be established from the record since there was a conflict as to the exact date of the interrogation. This misses the mark. The crucial factor is not when Strauss questioned the girls, but whether he had received the petition when he did so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b740-14\">. However, where an employer has doubts about the appropriateness of the unit requested by the Union, he should not refuse to bargain but should place the issue before the Board for resolution by it in a representation proceeding, such as was pending in this case on and after August 24. See N.L.R.B. v. Quality Markets, Inc., 387 F.2d 20, 24 (3rd Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">. The petition itself, which was erroneously excluded from evidence, is particularly relevant to the Union\u2019s own conception of whether the letter served as a request for bargaining. For, although it had already dispatched the letter, the Union did not fill in this interrogatory in the petition: \u201cRequest for recognition as Bargaining Representative was made on <em>(Month, day, year) </em>and Employer declined recognition on or about <em>(Month, day, year)\u201d. </em>In this vein, a 1967 Union newsletter, describing its activities at the Comjmny, should also have been admitted. It stated, \u201cMr. Glassman * * * was requested to wait until Mr. Koppel returned * * *. On this premise, Mr. Glassman acted as a gentleman, * * * and waited until Mr. Koppel returned\u201d. Compare Boeing Airplane Company, 80 N.L.R.B. #86, at p. 450 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">On the question of the appropriate unit, it has been noted that the letter ambiguously referred only to \u201cyour employees\u201d. See footnote 7, <em>supra. </em>And the representation petition claimed only the employees at the plant, whereas the regional director in his direction of election and the trial examiner in his decision both included the store personnel in the appropriate unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\">. His reasoning was that \u201c * * * if he had in fact obtained such an assurance, he would have accused the Union, in replying to its letter of August 23, of a breach of faith in failing to honor the supposed assurance\u201d. The disregard of uncontroverted testimony on the ground that it is inconsistent with the trial examiner\u2019s concept of what human behavior \u201cwould have\u201d been strikes us as questionable at best. However, as indicated <em>infra, </em>there are other more compelling reasons why Strauss\u2019 testimony as to Glassman\u2019s assurances should be reconsidered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">We note that Strauss was directly impeached only once \u2014 with respect to his recollection of when he had discovered that a disputed \u201cemployee\u201d had become pregnant and was planning to leave \u2014 and was substantially rehabilitated on redirect. The trial examiner did not base the rejection of Strauss\u2019 testimony on his impeachment as to this unrelated matter, nor, we think, would he be justified in doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">. At the hearing\u2019s end, counsel for the Company offered \u201ctwo witnesses\u201d whose testimony \u201cwould be completely corroborative of the matter Mr. Strauss has testified to.\u201d The trial examiner replied, \u201cI am not interested in what their testimony would be\u201d. Also, the Company\u2019s Motion to Reopen the Record, filed after the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>aminer\u2019s decision but before the Board\u2019s order, offered corroborative testimony by a Company attorney as to the fourth of the occasions upon which Glassman gave assurances to Strauss. This motion was denied in the Board\u2019s order, which noted that the Company \u201chas not shown * * that [it] * * * was denied an opportunity to introduce such evidence at the hearing\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">. We have reviewed those points in the record at which, the Company urges us, the trial examiner erroneously refused to allow examination of the employees with respect to the Union authorization cards. To the extent the questions were directed to the employees\u2019 subjective understanding of the meaning of the cards, these rulings were proper. See International Union, United A., A. &amp; A. Imp. Wkrs. of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. N.L.R.B., 124 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 363 F.2d 702, 705 (1966), cert. den. sub nom. Aero Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 385 U.S. 973, 87 S.Ct. 510, 17 L.Ed.2d 436 (1966). The title of the cards, \u201cApplication for Membership,\u201d and their legend, \u201cI hereby authorize N.O.I. T.U. to represent me and, in my behalf, to negotiate and conclude all agreements as to hours of labor, wages and other employment conditions\u201d, are unambiguous. We do not regard the additional recital that \u201cAll information will be held strictly confidential\u201d as necessarily controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">To the extent the questions at the hearing were concerned with the representations, if any, made to the employees at the time the cards were distributed, the trial examiner\u2019s rulings were erroneous. <em>Ibid. </em>However, in view of the nature of the proceedings on remand, see footnote 16, <em>infra, </em>it may appear that such error was not prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b742-15\">. Glassman was the first witness to testify at the hearing; Strauss was the last.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b742-16\">. Counsel for the Board conceded in oral argument before us that Glassman had given assurances to Strauss, but maintained that they were irrelevant because the Company\u2019s conduct subsequent to receiving the Union\u2019s letter negatived any inference of refusal to bargain based on a good faith doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">There are two answers to this argument. In the first place, not every violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act necessarily supports a refusal to bargain finding, see N.L.R.B. v. Quality Markets, Inc., 387 F.2d 20 (3rd Cir. 1967). The record, as supplemented on remand, may reveal that the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations, if any, are not inconsistent with a good faith doubt on the Company\u2019s part that the Union had a genuine majority based on cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">Secondly, a legally sufficient request for bargaining must precede a \u00a7 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain, see National Labor Relations Board v. Columbian Enameling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>&amp; Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939). We have indicated that an employer\u2019s understanding in the light of surrounding circumstances, of the significance of an otherwise innocuous document is relevant to whether it constitutes such a \u201crequest.\u201d Relevant also may be an employer\u2019s subsequent conduct, but we do not regard the Company\u2019s conduct in this case as sufficient to show that it could not have regarded the Union\u2019s August 23 letter other than as a request to bargain. Furthermore, we cannot say that the presence of a \u201crequest\u201d is not an issue in this case simply because the trial examiner stated that the severity of the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations would warrant a bargaining order even if there were a \u201ctechnical flaw in the union\u2019s request.\u201d The supplemented record may justify a conclusion that any \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations are so insubstantial that a bargaining order could only be grounded on a finding of a request and refusal to bargain under \u00a7 8(a) (5). See N.L.R.B. v. Flomatic Corporation, 347 F.2d 74 (2nd Cir. 1965); compare G.P.D., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 406 F.2d 26 (6 Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b743-28\">. The Company\u2019s Application for Leave to Adduce Additional Evidence, made to us pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), will be granted. If the evidence adduced on remand should establish that the change in identity of the Company\u2019s employees since August 1966 has been substantial, the Board should consider this in determining the propriety of issuing a bargaining order (assuming the supplemented record otherwise justifies one), as against ordering an election.
