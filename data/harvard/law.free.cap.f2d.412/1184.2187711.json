He entered a plea of not guilty at his first arraignment on February 2, 1967, while represented by Melvin Dil-dine, Esq. of the Philadelphia Voluntary Defenders Association. He was rear-raigned on April 3, 1967, and entered a plea of guilty to Counts 2 and 3 of each indictment. He was then represented by Austin Hogan, Esq., a member of the Philadelphia Voluntary Defenders Association. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on each count, all sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">Erthal filed the instant action for vacation of sentence under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that his guilty plea had not been voluntarily and intelligently entered. Judge Joseph S. Lord III who had received the guilty plea and sentenced Erthal denied the \u00a7 2255 application in a Memorandum and Order in which he found Erthal\u2019s contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-20\">On review of the record we find no error in Judge Lord\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-21\">On this appeal Erthal for the first time alleges that his plea was induced by a broken promise of leniency. The arraigning judge specifically inquired prior to accepting the plea as to whether there had been any promises of leniency or other inducements or threats and received negative answers. Moreover, he informed Erthal that he would not be bound by any promise of leniency if one had been made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the record completely refutes this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-22\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">. The transcript of the April 3 arraignment reveals the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"aia-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: Do you understand that by pleading guilty to these indictments that you admit all the facts that are alleged in the counts to which you plead guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"AlKn\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"apq-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: And are you doing that \u2022 because these facts are true?</p>\n<p id=\"A33\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"a2n-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: Has anybody made any promises to you of leniency of any sort?</p>\n<p id=\"AC2z\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqip\">\u201cThe Court: Do you realize, do you, that the Court wouldn\u2019t be bound by any suggestion of leniency anyway?</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-23\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"ABs\">\u201cThe Court: Has anybody made any threats or inducements?</p>\n<p id=\"AkP\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"aar-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: Of any kind?</p>\n<p id=\"AGQv\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"aaa-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: And being aware of the nature of the charges and being aware of the possible consequences you are intending to make this plea freely, voluntarily, and of your own free will and with full knowledge?</p>\n<p id=\"ad4-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
