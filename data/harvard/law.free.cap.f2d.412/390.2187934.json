It supersedes and makes irrelevant judicially fashioned concepts of the scope of judicial review of a federal agency\u2019s action, declared both prior and subsequent to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Section 706 is mandatory by its terms and not merely declarative of \u201cguidelines\u201d with respect to the scope of judicial review of a federal agency\u2019s action. It imposes on a federal court, <em>inter alia, </em>the mandatory duty to \u201creview the whole record [of the administrative proceedings] or those parts of it cited by a party\u201d, and to determine therefrom whether the agency\u2019s action was in accordance with procedures required by law and supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d, or alternatively, capricious, arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">In full sweep Section 706 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">\u201cScope of review</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">\u201cTo the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.

Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 496-497, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); In re United Corporation, 249 F.2d 168, 178-179 (3 Cir. 1957).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">This_ must be said with reference to the cases cited by the District Court in support of its holding that once it\" is determined that procedural requirements have been satisfied a district court \u201cshould not inquire into the merits of the employee\u2019s dismissal\u201d and \u201ccannot inquire further into the matter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">It is true that these eases state and apply the narrow and unqualified doctrine that once it is determined that procedural requirements have been met \u201cThe Courts will not examine into the merits of the dismissal\u201d of a civil service employee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>It must immediately be noted that cases more recently decided hold that courts after determining whether procedural requirements have been met <em>must </em>further determine, upon review of the administrative record, -vyhether substantial evidence supports the federal /agency\u2019s action in disciplining a federal employee. Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822 (D.C.Cir.1968); Halsey v. Nitze, 390 F.2d 142 (4 Cir. 1968), cert. den. 392 U.S. 939, 88 S.Ct. 2316, 20 L.Ed.2d 1399; Taylor v.

Hodges, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 320 F.2d 754 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The consensus of the cited cases was thus epitomized in <em>Dabney:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * the standard of judicial review is that\" of whether there is evidence of substance in that [administrative] record which supports the Commission\u2019s view of the matter.\u201d 358 F.2d 535.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">and in <em>Pelicone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cOur review in this kind of case [dismissal of a federal civil service employee] is limited to determining whether the statutory and regulatory procedures were observed and whether the challenged action was arbitrary and capricious or was supported by evidence.\u201d 320 F.2d at 755.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The judicial scope of review declared and applied by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>Dabney </em>and <em>Pelicone </em>cannot be reconciled with that Court\u2019s earlier holdings in Hargett v. Summerfield, <em>supra, </em>and Hofflund v. Seaton, <em>supra</em>\u2014which the District Court relied on in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">In <em>Hargett </em>it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">\u201c * * * so long as there was substantial compliance with applicable procedures and statutes, the administrative determination was not reviewable as to the wisdom or good judgment of the department head in exercising his discretion.\u201d 243 F.2d 32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aob\">In Ellis v. Mueller, the Court, citing <em>Hargett, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">\u201cThe function of the courts in cases like this <em>is not to review the merits </em>of a dismissal, but to determine whether the employee was accorded his statutory and procedural rights.\u201d 280 F.2d 722. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">In Hofflund v. Seaton, the Court, citing <em>Hargett, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-16\">\u201cInsofar as appellant here relies upon * * * the Administrative Procedure Act * * * we note only <em>our consistent refusal to review the merits or </em>wisdom of agency personnel action.\u201d 265 F.2d 364. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">It must here be noted that it was made clear in <em>Hargett, </em>that it premised its holding on the ruling in Keim v. United States, 177 U.S. 290, 20 S.Ct. 574, 44 L.Ed. 774 (1900) that under then existing statutes courts could not review the dismissal of a civil service employee. In doing so the Court in <em>Hargett </em>gave no effect to the Supreme Court\u2019s further statement in <em>Keim </em>that <em>\u201cuntil Congress by some special and direct legislation makes provision to the contrary, </em>we are clear that they [dismissals of civil service employees] must be settled by those administrative officers.\u201d 177 U.S. at 296, 20 S.Ct. at 576. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 \u2014 46 years after <em>Keim </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u2014constituted \u201cspecial and direct legislation\u201d which not only empowered but mandated federal courts to inquire into the <em>merits </em>of a civil service employee\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">There remains this to be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On this appeal, the Commission has cited, in support of the District Court\u2019s holding with respect to its limited scope of review, our per curiam affirmance at 373 F.2d 530 (1967) of another District Court\u2019s opinion in Cohen v. Ryder, 258 F.Supp. 693 (E.D.Pa.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">It is true that the District Court in <em>Cohen, </em>in specific subscription to the doctrine of <em>Hargett, </em>declared that \u201cThe scope of judicial review in an employee removal'~case is extremely harrow\u201d, and \u201cis limited to a determination of whether \"the\u201drequired <em>procedural </em>steps have been substantially complied with\u201d, and that in\" affirming we said \u201cThe judgment of the district court will be affirmed on its well reasoned opinion, 258 F.Supp. 693\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The record in <em>Cohen </em>discloses that the Complaint presented the single issue whether the plaintiff, a government employee, had been accorded <em>procedural </em>due process in'the administrative proceedings.\" The Complaint did not present -the- question whether substantial evidence supported the administrative fact-finding that she had been incompetent in the performance of her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s brief on appeal, did not raise any issue as to the scope of the District Court\u2019s review of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Our per curiam affirmance in <em>Cohen </em>related only to the correctness of the District Court\u2019s finding that the procedural requirements had been satisfied and, accordingly, is not to be construed as a holding on our part that the scope of judicial review in a case involving removal or discipline'of a civil service employee is limited to the procedural aspects of the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">In summary, we are of the opinion that the scope of judicial review of a federal agency\u2019s action with respect to the dismissal or discipline of a civil service employee extends to the determination whether procedural requirements have been satisfied in the administrative proceedings, and whether the \u00bfdministrative record establishes that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s action and that it was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In accordance with what has been said the Order of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-20\">.

Charlton was dismissed on September 29, 1963, from his position as an IRS special investigator on the grounds of (1) failure to report an attempted bribery and (2) failure to properly care for official documents. Before dismissal, he had been notified of the charges and had replied to them both orally and in writing. Charlton appealed to the IRS Regional Commissioner. After a hearing, at which Charlton was represented by counsel, the hearing officer found evidence to sustain the charge of failure to report an attempted bribe but not to support the charge of improper care of official documents. The Regional Commissioner, nevertheless, sustained both charges and affirmed the removal decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">On further appeal, the Philadelphia Regional Office of the Civil Service Commission held that the record sustained both charges; that Charlton\u2019s removal was for such cause as to promote the efficiency of the IRS; and that the IRS had complied with all necessary procedural requirements pertinent to the removal. The Civil Service Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review on January 8, 1965 affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b449-19\">. Baum v.

I also agree that our prior decision in Cohen v.

However, I cannot go all the way with the position adopted by the majority that in cases involving discharge of government employees the <em>substantial evidence test </em>is one of the standards of review to be followed in addition to whether the agency action (1) has met all procedural requirements, and (2) was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion \u2014 but more on that score later.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">At the outset it should be noted that there may be a serious jurisdictional question posed here as well.

See, <em>e. g., </em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140-141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); Rusk v. Cort, 369 U.S. 367, 371-372, 82 S.Ct. 787, 7 L.Ed.2d 809 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In any event, the power of the courts to review claims by government employees alleging improper dismissal is too well established to be rejected here. Although the basis for such review has not always been clearly spelled out, the following cases are illustrative of the different ways in which agency action has been brought up for review: Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822 (D.C.Cir. 1968) (complaint sought a declaratory judgment and a mandatory injunction to remedy an allegedly illegal discharge); Taylor v. United States Civil Service Commission, 374 F.2d 466 (9th Cir. 1967) (suit in nature of mandamus seeking reinstatement and damages for wrongful dismissal); McTiernan v. Gronouski, 337 F.2d 31 (2d Cir. 1964) (mandamus action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 seeking reinstatement); Pelicone v. Hodges, 320 F.2d 754 (D.C.Cir.1963) (characterized, as are many District of Columbia cases, as a \u201cgovernment employee discharge case\u201d); Mendez v. Macy, 292 F.Supp. 802 (S.D.N.Y.1968) (action brought pursuant to Administrative Procedure Act and Declaratory Judgment Act). See Byse and Fiocca, <em>supra </em>at 342 (1967). Suits are also brought before the United States Court of Claims seeking back pay or damages for wrongful dismissal. See, e. <em>g., </em>Armstrong v. United States, 405 F.2d 1275, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 1997, 23 L.Ed.2d 449 (1969); Heffron v. United States, 405 F.2d 1307 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Assuming that an action of this type may properly be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, or that in a reinstatement case reference to the Administrative Procedure Act for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>standards governing review of agency-action is permissible, a further question arises. The Administrative Procedure Act excepts from its coverage agency action \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) (2). The dismissal of government employees has usually been held to involve matters of discretion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the question thus presented is whether <em>any </em>of the standards of review now contained in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, may be applied in this kind of case. Stated another way, does the \u00a7 701 exception for cases involving agency discretion exempt from review dismissals which may constitute an abuse of discretion or arbitrary and capricious action or otherwise violate the Act? To say that the controversy on this question Has-been heated' is perhaps an understatement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I am inclined to the view that agency action resulting in the discharge of an employee, though obviously involving discretion, is subject to review when it is asserted that the discretion has been abused or has been exercised in an arbitrary manner. <em>Cf. </em>Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1, 5-6 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Assuming that this case is properly brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, or that the Administrative Procedure Act provides the applicable standards for the district court to apply in employee discharge cases, I do not believe that the full sweep of the standards of review adopted by the majority opinion is clearly supported by the Administrative Procedure Act itself or by the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The scope of review section of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, provides af follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action. The reviewing court shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">(A) <em>arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-15\">(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-16\">(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-17\">(D) <em>without observance of procedure required by law;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-18\">(E) <em>unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or other</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>wise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">In making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Thus there appear to be three principal standards of review in government employee dismissal cases suggested by the Administrative Procedure Act quoted above or by case law generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">(1) whether there has been procedural regularity, i.e., compliance with statutory and other requirements for the giving of notice, conduct of hearings, allowance of appeals and the like;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">(2) whether the agency action is arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (A) ); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">(3) whether the agency action is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (E).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The second and third tests I do not consider to be the same. While agency action which is arbitrary and capricious,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or which constitutes an abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would no doubt be action which is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d the reverse is not true. In other words, even where the agency action is not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion, there may still not be \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the accepted use of that test to justify the agency action. The very listing of the substantial evidence test as a separate and alternative ground for reviewing agency action indicates a legislative intent that it be a different standard from that permitting the setting aside of the findings or conclusions of an agency as arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">While admittedly some courts have articulated the substantial evidence test in government employee cases, usually without reference to the Administrative Procedure Act, I have been unable to find a clear explanation of the basis for the use of such test. And in some of the instances in which this test was mentioned, the court was able to find that the agency action was or was not arbitrary and capricious and did or did not lack substantial evidence to support it, without having to pin down the precise test which must be followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In remanding this appeal to the district court, where we find that the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>regularity standard applied by the trial judge is too narrow,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I think we have an obligation to formulate as clearly as possible the proper tests to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Looking to the precise language of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (E), we find that it applies only in a case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(1) which is subject to \u00a7\u00a7 556 and 557 of Title\u2019 5; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">(2) which is \u201cotherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by <em>statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Sections 556 and 557 deal with the procedure to be followed when an agency is required to hold a hearing, and these sections seem to apply only to those hearings provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553 and 554. The former, \u00a7 553, relates to rule-making and is inapplicable here. Section 554, which deals with adjudications, is limited in its application to adjudications \u201crequired by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing * * *.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a). And even then there is an exception, \u00a7 554 not being applicable if the adjudication involves the selection or the tenure of an employee. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a) (2). Thus, even if by <em>statute </em>government employees were entitled to a hearing in dismissal cases, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a) (2) seems to preclude the courts from applying the substantial evidence test when review of adverse agency action involving an employee\u2019s tenure is sougnt.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">The alternative ground for applicability of the substantial evidence rule, i.e., where the agency action is \u201creviewed on- the record of an agency hearing provided by statute,\u201d is also inapplicable because the statutes dealing with the removal or suspension of individuals in the competitive service, including those who have veterans preference, do not expressly create the right to a hearing, although a hearing is permitted. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7501, 7512. While federal employees have now been afforded a <em>right </em>to an administrative hearing by virtue of Executive Order No. 10987, January 17, 1962, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7501, and the implementing civil service regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 771.213, 772.305, it would, in my opinion, be stretching the language of the Administrative Procedure Act to hold that such hearings are provided by <em>statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Furthermore, I do not read the cases relied upon by the majority as clearly and definitively supporting the proposition for which they were advanced. Though the words \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d or their equivalent, appear in the cited cases, when the opinions are read in their entirety and fully analyzed it is less than clear that the substantial evidence test is being directly applied or followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In my view the proper scope of review in cases of this type is limited to ascertaining whether applicable procedural requirements have been met and whether the agency action was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Beyond this, I would not go. Certainly the agency record should be carefully examined, for agency action totally devoid of factual support would warrant, if not compel, a determination that the action was arbitrary or capricious. But where under the governing statute removal may only be \u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\u201d I believe it is neither advisable nor permissible for the courts to exercise the broad degree of scrutiny adopted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">In concluding, I would observe that we are here dealing with a problem that merits statutory clarification both as to the jurisdictional basis for review and the scope of review so afforded. If the cases make anything clear, it is the desirability of Congressional action in this murky and troublesome area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. A government employee in the competitive service may be removed \u201conly for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7501. By its very nature, the issue of \u201cefficiency\u201d is \u201ca matter peculiarly discretionary.\u201d Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 372 (1965). The great majority of the employee discharge cases appear to recognize that the taking of disciplinary action against government employees is a matter of executive discretion. Courts should be alert to protect procedural rights and to guard against arbitrary action, but to engage in wholesale review-on the merits would, under the present state of the law, be an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of another branch of the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-19\">.

As indicated in the majority opinion in note 6 and the accompanying text, there is case support for the application of this narrow rule, but I agree the standard is too limited.

Professor Davis concludes that there has developed a \u201ccommon law\u201d of review of administrative action in employee discharge cases under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard: 4 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 28.05, p. 18 n. 5 (1958). See also the references to the Davis Treatise in note 5, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">The <em>Meehan Halsey </em>and <em>Dabney </em>cases cited by the majority do seem to apply the substantial evidence rule, the <em>Meehan </em>ease, involving a vital free speech issue, perhaps justifying the more liberal scope of review. A recent district court decision flatly follows the substantial evidence test of the APA. Mendez v. Macy, 292 F.Supp. 802, 804 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">It is less clear that the <em>Pelicone </em>and <em>Taylor </em>cases directly apply the substantial evidence test. <em>Pelicone </em>relied on the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard as well as the fact that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to support the charges against the employee. In <em>Taylor, </em>after determining that the employee\u2019s dismissal was not in violation of procedural requirements and was not arbitrary or capricious, the court concluded also that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>action of the Civil Service Commission was supported by substantial evidence. 374 F.2d at 469, 470. (This is similar to Lewis v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, <em>supra </em>note 5, where, after deciding that the substantial evidence rule did not apply in a LMRDA case, we nevertheless found it appropriate to say that on the particular record in that case, even if the rule were applicable, there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the expulsion from union membership there challenged. 407 F.2d at 1198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>Meehan, Dabney </em>and <em>Pelicone </em>were District of Columbia Circuit Court appeals. Earlier District of Columbia cases, Hofflund v. Seaton, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 171, 265 F.2d 363, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 837, 80 S.Ct. 55, 4 L.Ed.2d 77 (1959), and Hargett v. Sommerfield, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 243 F.2d 29 (1957), followed the narrowest of the possible tests, the procedural regularity rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The Court of Claims which, like the District of Columbia Circuit, has had occasion to decide many government employee dimsissal cases, has followed different standards at different times, as evidenced recently by two cases decided the same day. In Armstrong v. United States, 405 F.2d 1275, 1277 (1969), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 1997, 23 L.Ed.2d 449 (1969), the court said that absent any showing that the Civil Service Commission finding in the case \u201cwas arbitrary and capricious, it must stand.\u201d In Heffron v. United States, 405 F.2d 1307, 1310 (1969), the court said that it \u201c * * * will accord finality to an administrative decision to remove unless' it is shown that it is arbitrary or not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">I have adverted to these cases, and there are many others that could be cited, not to quibble with language but to show the distressing absence of uniformity in the scope of judicial review in employee discharge appeals. Some district courts have recognized the uncertainty in this field as, e. <em>g., </em>Veatch v. Resor, 266 F.Supp. 893, 896 (D.Col. 1967), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">* <em>* * </em>Some courts have limited the review to an inquiry: 1) whether the removal violated some statutory provision; and 2) whether the procedures established were followed. Other courts have inquired as to whether the administrative decision was supported by substantial evidence or was arbitrary and capricious. These standards are included within the Administrative Procedure Act. Whether this act applies to a review such as the present one is questionable and unnecessary to a determination of the case at bar since judged by any of the mentioned standards the plaintiff\u2019s discharge must be upheld. * * * (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b456-18\">. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 371 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b456-19\">. In Connelly v. Nitze, 401 F.2d 416, 417 n. 1 (D.C.

This creates difficulties, as here, in our ability to give, effectively and expeditiously, the most appropriate kind of relief- It also raises questions as to why Congress should not provide for statutory direct review of Civil Service Commission determinations in employee cases, comparable to that now employed in respect of other major federal administrative agencies.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
