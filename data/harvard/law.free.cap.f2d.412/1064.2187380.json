App. \u00a7 462. He asserts that the Selective Service System applied erroneous standards and that, accordingly, the denial of his conscientious objector claim for exemption was without a \u201cbasis in fact.\u201d The District Court specifically rejected these contentions, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">The events surrounding Bishop\u2019s conviction are not in dispute. He registered with Local Board No. 29 at Port Angeles, Washington, on November 8, 1963. After reviewing his initial Classification Questionnaire (SSS Form No. 100), the local board placed him in class I-S until the expected date of his high school graduation. Following that graduation, in June 1964, the local board classified Bishop as available for military service (class I-A). Thereafter, in April 1965, Bishop requested and received a Special Form for Conscientious Objectors (SSS Form No. 150) which he promptly completed and returned. After reviewing the information supplied in that form, the local board again classified Bishop I-A and granted his subsequent request for a personal appearance to contest this classification. Bishop appeared before his local board on June 23, 1965, but failed to convince any of its members that his claim was meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">When the appellant sought review of this final rejection by Local Board No. 29, his entire file was transferred to the Selective Service Appeal Board for the Western District of Washington. On July 26, 1965, the appeal board reviewed the registrant\u2019s file and tentatively decided that he should be denied his claimed exemption. Before making a final determination, however, the appeal board asked the Department of Justice to investigate Bishop\u2019s claim and render an advisory opinion pursuant to Selective Service Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Acting on this request, the Department of Justice authorized one of its Hearing Officers, Mr. Arnold Robbins, to conduct an investigation. After reviewing all the information in the Selective Service file and conducting extensive interviews with the registrant and at least nine members of the small community in which Bishop resided, Robbins submitted his final report. This report, recommending denial of the claimed exemption, was referred to T. Oscar Smith, Chief of the Department of Justice\u2019s Conscientious Objector Section. Smith agreed with the Robbins recommendation and, on November 4, 1966, notified the registrant\u2019s appeal board that the Department of Justice advised against granting Bishop military exemption as a conscientious objector. The appeal board immediately sent Bishop a copy of the Department of Justice recommendation to provide him with the opportunity to respond to findings which he might consider unwarranted. When Bishop failed to respond, the appeal board affirmed its initial decision, and Bishop was notified that his appeal had been unsuccessful. Thereafter, when the local board issued an Induction Notice, Bishop refused to submit and the judicial proceedings leading to the instant appeal commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">The foregoing summary discloses that Bishop was afforded every opportunity within existing Selective Service Regulations to prove the merit of his conscientious objector claim. Having failed at each successive stage of these proceedings, he now seeks to overturn their results by insisting that erroneous legal standards were adopted and applied by his local board, his appeal board, and the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">Initially, we must reject Bishop\u2019s assumption that were we to decide that incorrect standards were applied by his local board, reversal is required. That question was settled in Tomlinson v. United States, 216 F.2d 12 (9th Cir. 1954), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 970, 75 S.Ct. 528, 99 L.Ed. 755 (1955), wherein we explained that it is the very purpose of the appeal board to correct any local board errors by making its separate in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>vestigation of the registrant\u2019s file and an independent classification decision. <em>See also </em>Storey v. United States, 370 F.2d 255 (9th Cir. 1966); DeRemer v. United States, 340 F.2d 712 (8th Cir. 1965). Accordingly, we limit our scrutiny to the standards applied by Bishop\u2019s appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Bishop attacks the appeal board\u2019s determination in an indirect fashion. He insists that the Justice Department's unfavorable recommendation rests upon illegal grounds which invalidate the board\u2019s ultimate decision under the teachings of Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436 (1955) and Shepherd v. United States, 217 F.2d 942 (9th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">In <em>Sicurella </em>the petitioner, a member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, had been denied classification as a conscientious objector when the Department of Justice, although admitting the sincerity of the petitioner\u2019s beliefs, recommended denial of his claim because of his admitted willingness to fight in defense of \u201chis ministry, Kingdom Interests and * * * his fellow brethern.\u201d The Supreme Court held that the petitioner\u2019s expressed willingness to fight \u201ctheocratic wars\u201d did not, <em>per se, </em>invalidate his claim and that since the appeal board likely relied upon an erroneous opinion to the contrary, the conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-6\">\u201c[T] he Department of Justice * * * clearly bases its recommendation on petitioner\u2019s willingness to \u2018fight under some circumstances, namely in defense of his ministry, Kingdom Interests, and in defense of his fellow brethren,\u2019 and we feel that this error of law by the Department, to which the Appeal Board might naturally look for guidance on such questions, must vitiate the entire proceedings at least where it is not clear that the Board relied on some legitimate ground. Here, where it is impossible to determine on exactly which grounds the Appeal Board decided, the integrity of the Selective Service System demands, at least, that the Government not recommend illegal grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">348 U.S. at 392, 75 S.Ct. at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">Similar logic was employed by our court several months before the <em>Sicurella </em>decision. Shepherd v. United States, <em>supra. See also </em>Batelaan v. United States, 217 F.2d 946 (9th Cir. 1954). In <em>Shepherd, </em>the Department of Justice recommended against the registrant\u2019s exemption and advised the appeal board that notwithstanding his sincerity, Shepherd\u2019s claim could be denied simply because he would willingly engage in theocratic wars. Noting that the appeal board was not bound by the Department\u2019s recommendations, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.25 (c), our court recognized that the board\u2019s classification may have properly rested on the belief that Shepherd was insincere. Nevertheless, we concluded that it was equally probable, if not more probable, that the appeal board was greatly influenced by the Department\u2019s categorical statement \u201cthat even if the registrant was sincere he could not be exempted because of his expressed beliefs relating to self defense and theocratic wars.\u201d 217 F.2d at 945. Hence, since under such circumstances we believed it impossible to presume that the board acted permissibly, Shepherd\u2019s conviction was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-11\">The ultimate question in a conscientious objector case is, of course, the sincerity of the registrant\u2019s objection to participation in war. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 381, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955). In the instant controversy, a portion of the Department\u2019s recommendation recites \u201cthat in view of the registrant\u2019s apparent intellectual capacities it may be doubtful whether he is capable of formulating or adhering to a set of beliefs.\u201d By taking this language from its context, Bishop insists that the Department of Justice equated the term \u201cbelief\u201d as found in the exempting statute with \u201cknowledge\u201d and thereby adopted a standard other than sincerity by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>which to judge his claim to exemption. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Bishop did not claim to have been a conscientious objector from his early childhood; rather, in his Form No. 150, he explained that his views had materialized from bible study with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Therefore, since Bishop claims to have derived his beliefs through exercise of his intellect, his inherent ability to formulate such thoughts are relevant to the honesty and sincerity of the asserted beliefs. In these circumstances, Bishop\u2019s \u201cintellectual capacity\u201d is one of the \u201cobjective facts\u201d from which inferences as to his sincerity or insincerity can be fairly drawn. <em>See </em>Witmer v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 381-382, 75 S.Ct. 392. Moreover, when the Department\u2019s reference to Bishop\u2019s \u201cintellectual capacity\u201d is examined in the complete context of the Department\u2019s recommendation, it is clear that this was the limited manner in which it was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">There is another significant distinction between the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation here and those analyzed by the <em>Sicurella </em>and <em>Shepherd </em>courts. In each of the latter cases, the Department\u2019s report specifically announced that <em>regardless </em>the registrants\u2019 sincerity, their belief in self defense and theocratic warfare negated their claims for conscientious objector exemptions. <em>See </em>Sicurella v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 392, 75 S.Ct. 403; Shepherd v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 944. Here, the Justice Department made no such explicit finding with respect to any lack of intellectual capability on Bishop\u2019s part, but, as already emphasized, merely reported this capability as one of the factors weighed in the evaluation of Bishop\u2019s sincerity. Hence, Bishop\u2019s reliance upon <em>Sicurella </em>and <em>Shepherd </em>is misplaced. <em>See generally </em>Bradley v. United States, 218 F.2d 657, 663 (9th Cir. 1954).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">Bishop\u2019s second contention is that there is no \u201cbasis in fact\u201d supporting the denial of his claimed conscientious objector exemption. The rejection of such claims have been frequently reviewed by our court; however, the experience of dealing with this recurrent problem makes the inquiry no less difficult, since, as the Supreme Court has remarked, the subjective state of a registrant\u2019s mind is simply not amenable to unerring objective determination. Hence, lest our own subjective appraisal be permitted to supplant that of the agency in whom Congress has placed the unenviable task, we are warned not to attempt to sit as super draft boards and that the scope of our review is \u201cthe narrowest known to the law.\u201d Blalock v. United States, 247 F.2d 615, 619 (4th Cir. 1957). Long ago, our court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-10\">\u201c[W]hen a reviewing court is considering whether a board\u2019s denial of a conscientious objector claim in a given case had basis in fact, the board\u2019s action is entitled to the support of any inference of sham or insincerity on the part of the registrant which the board could have drawn validly and fairly from the record upon which it acted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">Bradley v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 661 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>The record upon which Bishop\u2019s appeal board rejected his claim for exemption includes his Selective Service Classification Questionnaire (SSS Form No. 100), a Special Form for Conscientious Objector (SSS Form No. 150), a letter from the local presiding Minister of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a memorandum transcript of the proceedings during Bishop\u2019s personal appearance, and the Department of Justice letter of recommendation. Under the limited scope of review permitted .us, these documents provide solid support for affirmation of the board\u2019s determination. For purposes of this opinion it is only necessary that we point to some of the information which they contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">In late 1963, when Bishop filed his initial Selective Service Questionnaire, he crossed out the portion pertaining to conscientious objection and reported that he was then engaged in agricultural work on his family\u2019s farm while attending high school. Based on this information, the local board determined that while Bishop did not qualify for an agricultural deferment, he should be exempted pending his completion of high school. After completing high school, Bishop received a Current Information Questionnaire (SSS Form No. 127). This advised him to report any changes since his initial questionnaire had been filed which might affect his classification. Bishop returned this form, informing the local board that he had completed high school and was continuing to work part-time on the family farm; however, he again failed to make any reference to possible conscientious objection. The local board, remaining unimpressed by his agricultural status, classified Bishop as available for military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Several months later, as the date of induction for those registrants in Bishop\u2019s age group approached, the local board mailed the appellant a second Current Information Questionnaire which was completed and returned the very next day. Bishop reported that he was-no longer working the family farm, but he took this occasion to inform the board that as a result of bible studies with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses he had become a conscientious objector. Thereafter, when Bishop completed the Special Form for Conscientious Objectors, he further explained that his beliefs were acquired from a study of the bible begun as early as 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">The record, therefore, discloses that Bishop\u2019s beliefs, whatever their substance, solidified sometime'. after his graduation from high school, sometime after exemption for his argicultural status had been implicitly denied, sometime after he completed his first Current Information Questionnaire, and, most significantly, sometime after he was classified I-A, available for military service. We do not suggest, of course, that sudden \u201cRoad-to-Damascus\u201d conversion is impossible or even unusual; however, when such a claim is asserted the Selective Service authorities are authorized to treat its sincerity as so sufficiently suspect that the suddenness of the conversion may be considered as one of those \u201cobjective facts before the Appeal Board * * * [which] cast doubt on the sincerity of his claim.\u201d Witmer v. United States, <em>supra </em>348 U.S. at 382, 75 S.Ct. at 396. <em>See also </em>United States v. Corliss, 280 F.2d 808, 812 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 884, 81 S.Ct. 167, 5 L.Ed.2d 105 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">Furthermore, several residents of the small community where Bishop lived, worked, and attended school cast doubt on the sincerity of his religious beliefs. An official of Bishop\u2019s school, who claimed to know the registrant well, expressed his opinion that Bishop was attempting to use Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as a \u201cfront\u201d to avoid military service, explaining that he was more a \u201cparty boy\u201d than a religious person. This impression was also held by a school teacher who had known Bishop for six or seven years. The teacher told FBI investigators who conducted an investigation for the Justice Department that he had never, during their association, heard Bishop speak of religion or take a stand ordinarily expected of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and that he believed Bishop was simply trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>dodge the draft because he had \u201cjust seen him run around and drinking too much.\u201d Finally, a neighbor of Bishop confirmed the fact that young Bishop had at times been excessive in his use of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">To be sure, as the appellant suggests, there was evidence contradictory of the opinions expressing doubt as to Bishop\u2019s sincerity. Moreover, we agree that one need not be a \u201csaint\u201d in order to qualify as a conscientious objector. However, we are not authorized to evaluate the record beyond satisfying ourselves that facts existed from which an inference of insincerity could be fairly drawn. We are convinced that under the appropriate standard of review, the opinions expressed by associates of Bishop, although in part contradicted, provided the board with sufficient \u201cbasis in fact\u201d to support its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Finally, as the Justice Department noted, Bishop presented only the vaguest description of the nature and origin of his religious attitude. Indeed, when pressed for an explanation of the nature of his bible studies and why his beliefs had changed, Bishop offered little more information than that he had been studying with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. It does appear that the teaching which he had received was casual and intermittent and had been given him by a cousin. One seeking exemption from military service bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to a particular exemption; hence, we have repeatedly emphasized that a registrant does not sufficiently establish a valid claim for conscientious objector exemption by merely proving his membership in a particular religious sect. <em>See, e.g., </em>Bradley v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 661 and eases cited therein. Bishop was not, and had never been, a member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and the showing which he made in support of his conscientious objector claim was, as we see it, essentially weak. While his appeal board was empowered to decide that he had successfully carried his burden, it made its decision to the contrary. The record, parts of which we have emphasized, fully reveals the adequate \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for that decision,</p>\n<p id=\"AFO\">Affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">. It should be noted that both the <em>Sicurella </em>and <em>Shepherd </em>opinions emphasize the high probability that the appeal boards relied upon the erroneous legal conclusions expressed in the challenged recommendations of the Department of Justice and the fact that the records contained <em>nothing </em>to discount that probability. This is not the situation here. Bishop\u2019s appeal board referred Bishop\u2019s file to the Department of Justice <em>after </em>it had tentatively determined that his claim should be rejected. While there is little doubt that Bishop\u2019s appeal board considered the Department\u2019s recommendation, since the recommendation served simply to confirm the board\u2019s initial determination, it is unlikely that the board afforded it the significant weight which was presumed in <em>Sicurella </em>and <em>Shepherd. </em>Hence, as the situation here is unlike those in <em>Sicurella </em>and <em>Shepherd, </em>we think we should apply the usual presumption that the appeal board fully considered all the relevant information presented and properly classified Bishop according to the applicable statutes and regulations. <em>See </em>Oestereich v. Selective Service System Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
