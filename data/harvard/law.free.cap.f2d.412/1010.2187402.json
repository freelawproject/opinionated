Appellant was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment for each of the convictions under counts I, II and III and five years\u2019 imprisonment for conviction under count <em>V.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>All sentences were to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel limited his oral argument in this court to count V and suggested that the appeal of the convictions under counts I, II and III be considered moot because appellant had substantially served his one-year concurrent sentences under those counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find it improper to dismiss as moot appellant\u2019s appeal of his convictions under counts I, II and III, see Sibron v. New York, 1969, 392 U.S. 40, 50-58, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917, and have accordingly examined the entire record for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Appellant contends that the evidence as to all counts was insufficient to support conviction; that he was a \u201ctool\u201d of a government agent; that his conduct, if illegal, was condoned; and that he was entrapped. Appellant did not testify and he offered no testimony in his own behalf. The trial transcript consists solely of the testimony of agents of the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control and exhibits which they obtained either from or through appellant. It yields no support to appellant\u2019s contentions. The convictions under counts I, II and III are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">In Leary v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57, and United States v. Covington, 1969, 395 U.S. 57, 89 S.Ct. 1559, 23 L.Ed.2d 94, the Supreme Court reversed convictions under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(a) because that section of the Marijuana Tax Act violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We think it clear that there is no significant distinction for purposes of the Fifth Amendment privilege between 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(a) and 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4742(a), upon which appellant\u2019s count V conviction is based. Although appellant did not assert his right against self-incrimination at the trial, we deem it only \u201cjust under the circumstances\u201d to reverse his conviction on count V through application of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2106. See, Harris v. United States, 8 Cir., 1968, 390 F.2d 616, 617. Cf., our opinions recently filed in Becton v. United States, 8 Cir., 412 F.2d 1005 and Miller v. United States, 8 Cir., 412 F.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">. Appellant was found not guilty of violation of count IV, which charged the acquisition of marijuana without payment of the tax thereon, in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1066-24\">. The sentence for count V is the minimum under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1067-19\">. After appellant had served his sentences under counts I, II and III and upon his <em>pro se </em>motion, this court granted appellant\u2019s release on his own recognizance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
