The sole issue presented is whether decedent\u2019s power to invade the principal of a trust, the decedent also being the income beneficiary, was a power of appointment limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support or maintenance of decedent within the meaning of \u00a7 2041(b) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-19\">In his will,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the relevant provisions of which are set out in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> decedent\u2019s husband established a trust of the residue of his estate. The trustee was directed to pay the net income to the decedent as well as \u201csuch amounts out of the principal as my said wife from time to time may require; she to be the sole judge as to the amounts and frequency of such principal payments.\u201d During her life,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the decedent received the income from the trust but she neither requested nor received any portion of the principal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>The estate tax return filed by Elsie O\u2019Brien\u2019s executor reported the existence of the trust but did not include in the taxable estate the value of the principal. The Internal Revenue Service disputed the claimed exclusion and assessed estate taxes in the amount of $21,978.92 plus interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The assessment was paid by the appellant, the executor-bank, and following denial of its refund claim by the taxing authorities the bank brought this action in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">The bank contended in the court below that decedent\u2019s power to consume the trust principal was limited by an ascertainable standard so that under \u00a7 2041 (b) (1) (A) the value of the principal was not includable in decedent\u2019s gross estate. On the basis of factual stipulations and briefs submitted by the parties the district court entered judgment for the United States <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the taxpayer has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">We start with the proposition that while the taxability of the interest possessed by decedent is to be determined by federal law, we must look to the local law \u2014 here New Jersey\u2019s \u2014 to determine the legal rights and interests possessed by decedent under the trust: Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U.S. 78, 80-81, 626, 60 S.Ct. 424, 84 L.Ed. 585 (1940); Miller v. United States, 387 F.2d 866, 868 (3d Cir. 1968); Strite v. McGinnes, 330 F.2d 234, 238 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 836, 85 S.Ct. 69, 13 L.Ed.2d 43 (1964); Citizens First Nat\u2019l Bank of Ridgewood v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 750, 753 (D.N.J.1968); 2 Mertens, Law of Federal Gift &amp; Estate Taxation \u00a7 19.08, pp. 515-517 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-15\">Determining the nature of decedent\u2019s interest under New Jersey law requires us to construe the will of her husband, Paul O\u2019Brien, and in so doing our function is \u201cto ascertain and give effect to the \u2018probable intention of the testator,\u2019 \u201d Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, 36 N.J. 561, 564, 178 A.2d 185, 187 (1962), having in mind that when construing wills \u201cthe controlling consideration is the effect of the words as actually written * * In re Armour\u2019s Estate, 11 N.J. 257, 271, 94 A.2d 286, 292 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-16\">In ascertaining the meaning of Item C. of Paragraph Seventh of the will, appellant would have us focus on the words \u201cmay require\u201d as providing the standard or measure of decedent\u2019s right to request and utilize principal. To read \u201cshe to be the sole judge as to the amounts and frequency of such principal payments\u201d as supplying the stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>ard governing decedent\u2019s right to consume principal would, according to the appellant, result in ignoring the words \u201csuch\u201d and \u201crequire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">In the taxpayer\u2019s view, proper construction of Item C. indicates that decedent\u2019s right to consume was limited to such amounts out of principal as she may require. By reference to New Jersey law, appellant then argues that \u201crequire\u201d means \u201cneeds\u201d and that the power to consume is limited by a duty imposed under New Jersey case law to consume only such principal as is reasonably necessary for comfortable maintenance and support. In other words, while decedent was to be the sole judge of the amounts and frequency of payments from principal, her requests were limited by what she believed she required, in good faith, for reasonable necessities or maintenance. And appellant argues further that the decedent would have been accountable as a fiduciary to the remaindermen for any invasion of principal beyond her good faith needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">For a number of reasons we are unable to accept the arguments which appellant advances. First, the New Jersey cases to which we have been referred do not, as appellant asserts, consistently construe \u201crequire\u201d to mean needs, or necessities, or maintenance. In fact, in one of the early New Jersey eases we have found which deals with the question the court implicitly assumed that \u201crequire\u201d meant \u201cdemand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">In Lippincott v. Stokes, 6 N.J.Eq. 122 (Ch.1847), the issue presented was whether certain securities belonged to the estate of one Hope Haines and were to be disposed of under her will or whether they belonged to a trust created by the decedent\u2019s mother. By her will the decedent\u2019s mother had created a trust of one-fourth of her personal property, with directions to pay the interest to Hope for her life and to pay her \u201cso much of the principal as she shall, from time to time, by writing under her hand, attested by two credible witnesses, require of the said trustees. * * * \u201d During her life Hope had acquired the principal of the trust from the trustees, and the issue presented was whether she had \u201crequired\u201d payment of the principal in the manner prescribed in the will, that is, by her own attested writing. In finding that she had not met these testamentary commands, which if followed would have entitled her to the principal without meeting any other condition, the court impliedly assumed that \u201crequire\u201d meant \u201cdemand.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>also </em>Lippincott v. Ridgeway, 11 N.J.Eq. 526 (Ch.1858) (different issue but same will); <em>cf. </em>Corlies v. Allen, 36 N.J.Eq. 100 (Ch.1882) (payment of trust income \u201cas she may need or require\u201d held to limit the beneficiary\u2019s rights to income to so much as the trustees in good faith decide is necessary for her comfortable support, the court distinguishing the will under consideration in the <em>Lippincott </em>cases by stating \u201cthat there the word [require] was used in the sense of \u2018demand.\u2019 \u201d 36 N.J.Eq. at 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">We have examined other New Jersey cases, particularly those upon which appellant relies,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we do not find them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>to support the conclusion that in every case \u201crequire\u201d means \u201cneed.\u201d Rather \u201crequire\u201d has been viewed in the context in which it was used and an effort made in each instance to interpret its meaning in light of the instrument as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">Evidently pursuing that course, the district court, in reaching its conclusion, found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-5\">The wife and life beneficiary was the object of the testator\u2019s bounty. All of his personal belongings were bequeathed to his wife; all of his real estate was devised to his wife; and the residue of the estate was put in trust for her benefit. * * *<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9P\">Such a finding with respect to the testator\u2019s intent suggests that the power conferred be given a broad construction: Sibson v. First Nat\u2019l Bank and Trust Co., 61 N.J.Super. 88, 160 A.2d 76, modified, 64 N.J.Super. 225, 165 A.2d 800 (1960).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Appellant objects to the foregoing finding of fact by the district court, contending that the record contains no evidence of the value of the probate estate of Paul O\u2019Brien to support or rebut the court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A lower court\u2019s findings of fact are not to be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. We are satisfied that on this point the district court did not err. A reading of decedent\u2019s husband\u2019s will amply supports this finding. With the exception of his medical books and equipment, the testator gave his wife all of his personal property, all of the real estate which he might own at his death, all of the income from the trust created from his residuary estate, plus the power to invade trust principal. In addition, it is not without significance that in providing for the disposition of trust principal to his children upon his wife\u2019s death, Paul O\u2019Brien directed the payment of \u201call that may remain of the principal of this trust * The use of these words suggests that the testator envisaged the possibility that his wife might utilize some or all of the principal of the trust, New Jersey Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co. v. Dailey, 123 N.J.Eq. 205, 196 A. 703 (Ch.1938), and is further support for the proposition that the wife\u2019s power to consume was not a nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>row one within the limits of the statutory ascertainable exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Moreover, even were we to accept appellant\u2019s argument that decedent\u2019s utilization of principal was limited because she was accountable as a fiduciary to the remaindermen for any invasion not made in good faith, the statutory standard would still not be met for, as Judge McLaughlin said in Strite v. McGinnes, <em>supra,, </em>in response to a similar argument,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdK\">* * * [I]t is a fair construction of this section that the measure of control over the property by virtue of the grant of power is the determinant of the taxability of property subject to the power. See Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U.S. 78, 60 S.Ct. 424, 84 L.Ed. 585 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-6\"># *x* # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-7\">* * * The search of \u00a7 2041 is the breadth of power given a decedent. When that is determined, the tax consequence follows. <em>Good faith exercise of a power is not determinative of its breadth. </em>(Emphasis added.) 330 F.2d at 238, 240.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">In light of the language chosen by the testator, Paul O'Brien, and his clear purpose and decision to provide amply for his wife, we find that the decedent\u2019s power to consume corpus was not limited by an ascertainable standard relating to decedent\u2019s health, education, support or maintenance. And even if some limits were thought to be imposed by the \u201cmay require\u201d standard, it seems fairly clear that the power possessed by the decedent would permit consumption of principal for her general benefit and so exclude the power from the \u00a7 2041(b) (1) (A) exception: Miller v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Strite v. McGinnes, <em>supra; </em>Internal Revenue Service Regulations, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2041-1(c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">Appellant relies on two earlier decisions of this court, preceding Strite v. McGinnes, which dealt with the problems of the marital deduction and the taxability of the income from a trust, respectively. Commissioner v. Ellis, 252 F.2d 109 (3d Cir. 1958); Funk v. Commissioner, 185 F.2d 127 (3d Cir. 1950). Neither of these cases is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-15\">In Ellis, a case arising in Pennsylvania, the taxpayer had the power under her husband\u2019s will to invade the corpus of a trust he had established for her if she should \u201crequire * * * she, and she alone, shall be the judge of how much shall be required * * * \u201d The court held the trust ineligible for the marital deduction on the ground that the widow\u2019s power to invade the corpus of the trust was not completely unfettered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-16\"><em>Ellis </em>is to be distinguished because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-17\">(1) it related to the marital deduction rather than the \u00a7 2041 issue we have here;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>(2) it was decided under the law of Pennsylvania which may not necessarily be exactly the same as that of New Jersey on the construction of the language in the will;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-4\">(3) insofar as <em>EUis </em>relied on the \u201cgood faith\u201d duty imposed upon the life tenant, it is not in accord with <em>Strite </em>which applied the \u201cmeasure of control\u201d test; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">(4) the interpretation of the critical language in <em>Ellis </em>and in our case must, of course, be made in the context of the particular wills in which the words appeared. <em>(See </em>Security-Peoples Trust Co. v. United States, 238 F.Supp. 40, 51 (W.D.Pa.1965), for a thorough analysis of the will in <em>Ellis.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\"><em>Funk, </em>a case arising in New Jersey, did not involve the ascertainable standard problem under \u00a7 2041, but rather the taxability of certain income under a trust which gave the wife-beneficiary power to distribute income to herself and her husband \u201cin accordance with our respective needs, of which she shall be the sole judge.\u201d The court held the wife\u2019s power not. to be completely unfettered and, therefore, the income not taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">We do not believe <em>Funk </em>to be significant because there the trust instrument actually used the term \u201cneeds.\u201d Here, Paul OBrien\u2019s will used the word \u201crequire\u201d which, as we have shown above, does not conclusively and uniformly mean \u201cneeds\u201d under the New Jersey case law. Also, the fact that a decedent\u2019s power of appointment may not be completely unlimited, as in <em>Funk, </em>does not mean that it comes within the strict elements of the ascertainable standard test under \u00a7 2041. Finally, as in <em>Ellis, </em>the court\u2019s reliance in <em>Funk </em>on the \u201cgood faith\u201d test is not wholly consistent with the subsequent Strite v. McGinnes decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">Appellant also asks that we follow the rationale of Pittsfield National Bank v. United States, 181 F.Supp. 851 (D.Mass. 1960), a \u00a7 2041 ascertainable standard case arising under Massachusetts law. The relevant language in the trust in that case gave to the decedent the income during his life \u201ctogether with all or such part of the principal of same as he may from time to time request, he to be the sole judge of his needs.\u201d The district court concluded that the limitation came within the ascertainable standard test under \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\"><em>Pittsfield </em>is not directly in point here because it involves the law of another jurisdiction and because, as in <em>Funk, </em>the trust language actually referred to \u201cneeds\u201d whereas the trust in the instant case, of course, uses the term \u201crequire.\u201d Furthermore, the Massachusetts district court in analyzing the testator\u2019s intent from the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the instrument said, in a portion of its opinion quoted in appellant\u2019s brief (pp. 34, 35):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-14\">* * * The grant of the power must be read in its entirety, and so read I rule that it was a grant of a power to invade corpus only in the event the donee was in financial or physical need. This conclusion becomes even more compelling upon an examination of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the trust and the provisions concerning the disposition of the remainder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-15\">* * * It is quite apparent that Mrs. Colt intended principally to provide for the remaindermen and to give her husband a power of invasion only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>the unlikely event that he should need any part of the principal without subjecting the property again to taxation. 181 F.Supp. at 854.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">As previously indicated, Judge Wor-tendyke, in the court below, found the intent in the trust created by Paul O\u2019Brien\u2019s will to be to the contrary, a finding we consider to be fully supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">In summary, appellant\u2019s two main arguments in support of its position are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-6\">(1) that \u201crequire\u201d means \u201cneeds\u201d and, therefore, comes within the ascertainable standard test of \u00a7 2041; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-7\">(2) that, in any event, the good faith fiduciary duty imposed by New Jersey law upon the decedent as life tenant is sufficient to restrict her power within the ascertainable standard formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">The first argument, as we have shown, founders on the uncertainty of New Jersey case law; the second is in direct conflict with our prior holding in Strite v. McGinnes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">The judgment entered by the district court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">.

Watson, 78 N.J.Eq. 307, 79 A. 275 (Ch. 1911) (\u201cto pay my wife, out of the income of my estate * * * such sums of money as she shall want or require for her comfortable support and maintenance * * *.\u201d); Cox v. Wills, 49 N.J.Eq. 573, 25 A. 938 (1892) (widow directed to distribute by will <em>among </em>testator\u2019s near relatives so much of testator\u2019s property \u201cas she may not use for her comfortable maintenance\u201d); Reeves v. Beekman, 42 N.J.Eq. 613, 9 A. 27 (Ch. 1887), aff\u2019d, 44 N.J.Eq. 295, 18 A. 80 (N.J.Eq. 1888) (daughter to receive \u201cthe whole of the interest * * * and so much oi the principal as she may need and her cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>cumstances may require, from time to time * * * \u201d); Corlies v. Allen, 36 N.J.Eq. 100 (Ch. 1882) (trustees directed ..to pay interest to testator\u2019s daughter \u201cas she may need or require.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">. App. A-12.</p>\n<p id=\"AEzk\">In Strife v.

United States, 387 F.2d 866, 868 (3d Cir. 1968); <em>see also </em>Hoffman v. McGinnes, 277 F.2d 598, 604 (3d Cir. 1960). It is the function of the district court to ascertain that intention in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1217-20\">. <em>See also </em>Citizens First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 750, 753 (D.N.J.1968), a charitable deduction tax case, in which Chief Judge Augelli stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-22\">[I] t is a rule of construction in New Jersey that provisions in a will for the benefit of a widow should be construed liberally in her behalf * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1217-23\">. Appellee\u2019s answer to this contention is well taken, as set forth in its brief, p. 10, n. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-25\">The taxpayer disputes this finding on the ground that the record offers no indication of the values of the testator\u2019s real estate and personal belongings, which the decedent received in full and which the taxpayer claims were small in amount compared to the residuary estate (Br. 6-7). Taxpayer\u2019s argument proves too much. Even if most of the testator\u2019s assets were poured into the trust, the decedent was incontestably entitled to the life estate in the trust and she enjoyed the power to invade corpus at least to the extent of her \u201cneeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">. The applicable language in the will in <em>Strite </em>was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">It is my desire that my sisters enjoy the benefit of my property to as full an extent as they may require. If, therefore, in the sole judgment of the trustees hereinafter named, it is at any time necessary or advisable in order to provide for the reasonable needs and proper expenses or the benefit or comfort of my sisters or the survivor of them, I authorize, empower, and direct them to sell any or all of the said residue of my property as they may think proper and pay over to my sisters, or to my surviving sister, the proceeds or any part thereof as if it were income. 330 F.2d at 235 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">. Cases under the marital deduction section of the Internal Revenue Code are not necessarily binding in the interpretation of \u00a7 2041: Strite v. McGinnes, <em>supra </em>note 5 <em>(tut see </em>Security-Peoples Trust Co. v. United States, 238 F.Supp. 40 (W.D.Pa.1965).) In <em>Strite, </em>the district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-20\">* * * Cases under \u00a7 2056 [the marital deduction provision] have only limited relevance since the question which arises is not whether an ascertainable standard exists but whether <em>any </em>standard exists. In order to qualify for the marital deduction, the surviving spouse must have an <em>unqualified </em>power to appoint the principal to herself during her lifetime. The power must be one that may be exercised \u201cin all events.\u201d 215 F.Supp. at 514 n. 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>In 2 Mertens, <em>supra </em>note 2 at \u00a7 19.13, p. 547 n. 3, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-10\">A comparable problem is present under the marital deduction provision as to whether the right to invade is such as to constitute a power to appoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-16\">* * * The two statutory sections are not comparable, however, and particular weight must be given to the fact that the surviving spouse has an interest which is \u201cterminable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">. If appellant were correct in its \u201cgood faith\u201d argument, there would appear to he little need for the \u00a7 2041 exclusion of powers of appointment limited by an ascertainable standard as undoubtedly most states impose a similar duty of good faith on the life tenant in favor of the remain-dermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">It is interesting to note that in the district court opinion in Strite v. McGinnes, <em>supra </em>note 5, Judge Freedman considered it possible for a power of appointment to be subject to good faith requirements and still he outside the restrictions of the ascertainable standard test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-12\">* * * There is present here a power to consume which extends beyond the statutory exception of an ascertainable power for health, education, support or maintenance, even though it is confined within the outer reaches of the judicial limitation of good faith. * * * There are areas of expenditure beyond support and maintenance which do not cross the line of good faith. * * * 215 F.Supp. at 518.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1220-22\">. In its brief appellant asked that we direct the court below \u201cto enter judgment that the fees to be paid to the attorneys for the Taxpayer for conducting this litigation be allowed by the Internal Revenue Service as a deduction in the calculation of the taxable estate and that a refund, with interest as aforesaid, be paid to the Taxpayer upon submission of Internal Revenue Service Form 843 (Claim for Refund).\u201d (See also paragraph 8 of Complaint, App. A-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-23\">We believe that the matter of deduction of attorney\u2019s fees should be determined by the district court, Phinney v. Kay, 275 F.2d 776, 781 (5th Cir. 1960), or, as suggested by government counsel at oral argument, by the Internal Revenue Service. Our affirmance of the decision below is, therefore, without prejudice to appellant to seek additional relief with respect to the deduction of attorney\u2019s fees in the appropriate forum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
