As part of the plan to catch Daniels, Dukes conducted in Daniels\u2019 home negotiations for the purchase of narcotics. Dukes had on his person, unknown to Daniels, a Fargo electronic transmitter placed there by the agents who listened to the conversations of Dukes and Daniels.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">We were asked on this appeal to find this conduct proscribed by Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. Now Desist v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed. 248, decided March 24, 1969, has informed us that Katz is to be applied to fruits obtained after December 18, 1967. The jury found Daniels guilty on October 13, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Of course, what Dukes did was sneaky and not the act of a gentleman, but we do not believe he was offending the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Other points briefed, we find without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
