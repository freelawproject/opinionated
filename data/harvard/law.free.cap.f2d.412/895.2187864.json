In a separate trial with a jury waived, Pearce was convicted on five counts and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. An acquittal was ordered on two counts, and a third was dropped. Appealing, Pearce argues failure of proof of guilt and ineffective assistance of counsel. These assignments are not substantiated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">Four of the five co-defendants testified at his trial. Each of these witnesses had earlier pleaded guilty to a single count and not guilty to the remainder. Sentencing of these four was postponed until after Pearce\u2019s trial, and then the Government dismissed the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-23\">Granting that \u201cthe testimony of an accomplice may be sufficient to sustain a conviction even though not corroborated, if it generates a belief beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d United States v. Maddox, 394 F.2d 297, 299 (4 Cir. 1968), the appellant insists that the co-defendants\u2019 evidence was inherently untrustworthy, for this: they were testifying while themselves under indictment, their statements were contradictory and, at times, inconsistent, and the principal witness was a drug addict. The Government, on the other hand stresses that corroboration was adduced on each count. We see evidence aplenty warranting the District Judge\u2019s findings of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Cross-examination of the four co-defendants testifying against Pearce could have been more exhaustive, but it was not so lacking as to render Pearce\u2019s representation insufficient in law. <em>Cf. </em>Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1, 3 (4 Cir. 1964), cert. denied 382 U.S. 866, 86 S.Ct. 135, 15 L.Ed.2d 104 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
