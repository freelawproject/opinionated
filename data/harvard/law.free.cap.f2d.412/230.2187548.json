He had been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. (People v. Atchley, 53 Cal.2d 160, 346 P.2d 764 (1959).) Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was granted, and then dismissed as improvidently granted. (366 U.S. 207, 81 S.Ct. 1051, 6 L.Ed.2d 233 (1961).) Appellee\u2019s sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment without possibility of parole in 1961, and was further commuted to allow parole in 1966. Appel-lee petitioned the United States courts for a writ of habeas corpus. This was denied, without a hearing, and the denial affirmed upon the ground there was no lack of due process. Atchley v. Dickson, 338 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">This is an appeal, therefore, from a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on the claim (1) petitioner\u2019s confession was improperly admitted into evidence; (2) the trial court erroneously excluded evidence as to petitioner\u2019s mental condition; (3) that no hearing was held outside the jury\u2019s presence to determine the admissibility of petitioner\u2019s extra-judicial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The Supreme Court of California specifically recognized the general rule of the inadmissibility of confessions, or any statement made by the accused relative to the offense charged, if made involuntarily. It passed upon the admission of appellee\u2019s \u201cimplicating statement\u201d by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201cThe People contend, however, that the voluntary nature of defendant\u2019s statements was adequately shown before the recording was admitted into evidence. Travers testified that no threats were made, that no inducements were offered, and that in an earlier conversation defendant had volunteered substantially the same statements without being asked. Defendant at no time contradicted this testimony or suggested that any of his recorded statements were untrue. Moreover, the recorded conversation demonstrates that Travers referred to the insurance policy to explain why he was asking questions and not as an inducement for any particular answers. The trial court listened to the tape in chambers before ruling on its admissibility. There is therefore no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the recording was admitted without a proper showing that his statements were made voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">\u201cDefendant also contends that the recording was obtained by such fraud that its use as evidence was inconsistent with due process. He relies primarily on Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556, 74 S.Ct. 716, 98 L.Ed. 948. In that case the police, having promised a suspect medical treatment for an acutely painful attack of sinus, introduced as the \u2018doctor\u2019 a highly skilled psychiatrist with a considerable knowledge of hypnosis. The psychiatrist used threats, promises of leniency, and expressions of sympathy to reduce the physically exhausted suspect to almost trance-like submission. Use of his resulting confessions violated due process, largely because they were the product of \u2018mental coercion.\u2019 [footnote omitted] Although there was a similar deception in the present case, there was no comparable mental coercion. The deception itself does not render defendant's statements inadmissible, for it was not a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement. People v. Connelly, 195 Cal. 584, 597, 234 P. 374; People v. Castello, 194 Cal. 595, 602, 229 P. 855.\u201d 53 Cal.2d 160 at 170-171, 346 P.2d 764 at 769.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Thus we see there was an in-chambers hearing of the tape recording, outside the presence of the jury, prior to any ruling by the state trial judge on admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Likewise, the California Supreme Court had before it, and considered, the second error listed above \u2014 the exclusion of medical testimony as to defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the shooting. The court concluded this was not error because never offered or raised below. <em>Id., </em>p. 176, Key \u00b6 20, 346 P.2d, p. 773. The harmless error found by the Supreme Court of California in the exclusion of certain expert opinion testimony was with respect to defendant\u2019s reflexes and memory, not to the accuser\u2019s mental condition at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The California Supreme Court also found there was \u201csubstantial and uncon-tradicted evidence that no coercion occurred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p. 171, 346 P.2d, p. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">I turn to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Keeping in mind the findings of the California Supreme Court, I must ask, was this \u201ca determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue\u201d? I think it was. It was \u201cmade by a state court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d This was \u201cin a proceeding in which [this] applicant for the writ and the state or an officer or agency thereof were parties.\u201d It was made in a \u201cwritten opinion.\u201d It must therefore \u201cbe presumed to be correct\u201d unless the applicant can bring himself within any one of the exclusions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, numbered 1 to 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In considering these exclusions (there being no admissions by the respondent state) the burden is on the applicant to establish the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">With this in mind I turn to the district court findings in this case. It first determined that it was presently unable \u201cto say that the confession was involuntary.\u201d (C.T. 73.) If the court was unable to do so, then, if I read \u00a7 2254 correctly, the applicant has not met the burden of proof required by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The district court said that the state trial court did not \u201creliably\u201d determine whether Atchley\u2019s confession was voluntary or involuntary, following the language of Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 391, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). As pointed out above, the Supreme Court of California referred to the \u201cproper showing\u201d made in the trial court \u201cthat his statements were made voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao_e\">It seems improper to me for a federal court, ten years after the event, after examining a record from which it cannot conclude the confession was involuntary, and without pointing out (except for general and conclusionary language) any evidence of convincing force that the confession was an involuntary act \u2014 to require an evidentiary hearing in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Without any recital of a factual showing by the petitioner that he falls within the \u00a7 2254 exceptions, the purpose of the \u201cshowing required to offset the presumption created by the statute,\u201d is meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The legislative history of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 shows that it was passed \u201cto prevent the abuse of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d by state prisoners in federal courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">\u201c[S]uch purposes are to be attained by provisions for a qualified application of the doctrine of res ad judicata in Federal court habeas corpus proceedings brought by State prisoners, by provisions according a presumption of correctness to factual determinations made at a hearing on the merits by State courts and by provisions with respect to the burden of proof in Federal court proceedings for habeas corpus by State prisoners.\u201d 1966 U.S.Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 3663 at 3666.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">The statute adopted by the Congress in 1966 says it places \u201cthe burden shall rest on him [petitioner] to establish by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous.\u201d Id., p. 3667.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">I do not think that here it can fairly be stated that such \u201cconvincing evidence,\u201d existed, and I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision, and deny the petition, in an attempt to follow congressional dictates.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
