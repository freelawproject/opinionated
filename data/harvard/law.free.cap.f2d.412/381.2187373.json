GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b437-30\">Nathaniel Brown appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri where a jury found him guilty of violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown received a sentence of eight years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, Brown, on April 4, 1966, entered the premises of Conservative Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association at the southwest corner of Ninth and Olive Streets, St. Louis, Missouri, approached the window of teller Marcella Simmons and passed a note over the counter to her which read: \u201cThis is a Hode [sic] up. If you say a word I will kill you.\u201d Miss Simmons dropped the note to the floor in an attempt to attract the attention of a fellow teller Magdeline Sehmiehausen, opened her cash drawer and pulled out some marked money. She whispered to Brown, \u201cShow me your gun.\u201d Brown moved his right hand that was in his jacket pocket. Miss Simmons then screamed, \u201cShow me your gun, you little snot, or get out of here.\u201d Brown left the premises empty-handed, having displayed no weapon at any time. Miss Simmons, Miss Sehmiehausen, and a customer of the institution all identified Brown as the person involved in the aborted robbery attempt. Further, a fingerprint examiner testified that a print found on the note corresponded with the left thumb print of Brown.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown denied the attempted robbery and offered an uncorroborated alibi. The factual matters were all resolved by the jury adversely to Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On appeal Brown raises one basic issue : The District Court erred in overruling his motion for dismissal since the government failed to establish the crime charged as there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that anyone was intimidated or put in fear of bodily harm. As a corollary claim of error, Brown contends that the District Court should have sustained an objection and sustained a motion for a mistrial when government counsel stated in closing argument that Miss Simmons was intimidated in that this argument assumed the ultimate issue to be determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A8B\">.The indictment was cast under the second paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) and charged Brown with entering the financial institution with intent to commit a felony. The Court\u2019s charge was responsive to the first paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) and placed on the government the burden of proving that intimidation was used in the attempted robbery of the financial institution. The overt act of demanding money accompanied by a threatening gesture of any type intended to intimidate could reasonably be viewed as either evidence of the attempted robbery itself, or as evidence of the perpetrator\u2019s intent to commit a felony. The party accosted or threatened does not have to be put in fear of his life, only intimidation need be shown along with a demand for funds to satisfy the first paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a), and any evidence showing an entry with intent to commit a felony satisfies the requirements for conviction under the second paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) \u2014 the intimidating note is evidence of the would-be robber\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">We believe that the evidence adduced by the government establishes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Brown was guilty of both crimes defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as stated in Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957), there was no congressional intent in enacting \u00a7 2113(a) in its present form to pyramid penalties, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201c * * * the unlawful entry provision was inserted to cover the situation where a person enters a bank for the purpose of committing a crime, but is frustrated for some reason before completing the crime. The gravamen of the offense is not in the act of entering, which satisfies the terms of the statute even if it is simply walking through an open, public door during normal business hours. Rather the heart of the crime is the intent to steal. This mental element merges into the completed crime if the robbery is consummated.\u201d 328 of 352 U.S., 406, 407 of 77 S.Ct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We find the contentions raised by Brown are without merit and affirm the judgment of conviction. Similar arguments to those raised by Brown were raised by the defendant in United States v. Baker, 129 F.Supp. 684 (S.D.Cal.1955). In <em>Baker, </em>the defendant passed a note to the teller which read: \u201cPlease check all, into this sack. Thank you E C B.\u201d The teller asked, \u201cWhat is this ?\u201d The defendant said, \u201cJust put everything you have in the sack and there won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d The teller tripped an alarm and the defendant was apprehended. No weapon had been displayed, nor w\u00e1s one found on the defendant. The defendant argued that the facts could not support a charge, of an attempt to take by intimidation. The Court said at 686-687 of 129 F.Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cIt is apparent that in the statute under consideration the \u2018attempt\u2019 re-? lates to the <em>taking </em>and not to the intimidation. Thus, what is involved in this indictment is an <em>attempted taking </em>by intimidation, the means being intimidation, or putting in fear instead of by force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">\u2022***\u2022* \u00ab .*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af_\">\u201cThe handing of similar notes to bank tellers is a familiar <em>modus operandi </em>of both armed and unarmed bank robberies. * * *. The fact that this teller called for help instead of handing over money, keeps this case an attempt. The method used has often induced a bank teller to part with cash, for the circumstances do not admit of an examination to determine whether the man at the window is armed or not. The very presence of a man, having a note, who assures the teller, \u2018Do as I say, and there won\u2019t be any trouble\u2019, infers that failure to do as ordered is an invitation to trouble. Defendant intended to get money from the teller by intimidation. * * * That she did not respond as defendant expected, saves defendant from having committed the robbery he planned, but does not wipe out his overt acts wilfully done as an endeavor to do or perform and, hence, an attempt to commit, a bank robbery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">From the facts adduced in this case, the jury could justifiably find that the teller, Miss Simmons, was intimidated. The note that confronted Miss Simmons clearly stated that her life was in jeopardy if she did not comply with Brown\u2019s commands. The fact that she subsequently ascertained, apparently to her satisfaction, that Brown was not in possession of a weapon with which to readily carry out his threat, and the fact that she thwarted the robbery attempt by shouting at Brown, did not preclude as a matter of law the jury\u2019s finding that Miss Simmons was in fact intimidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>when presented with the threatening note.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The abortive attempt made in this ease was but a reflection of a common pattern followed by those desiring to commit a bank robbery. An oral or written demand for money accompanied with a threat of reprisal, blatant or subtle, is intended to enforce compliance by intimidation; and that intimidation accompanied by a demand for funds constitutes the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In this case the note contained a threat to kill, which is intimidating to anyone not knowing for sure whether the party making the threat has means at his disposal to carry it out. True, parties do react differently and sometimes strangely to threatening demands, and under the impact of emotional stress caused by such threats often attempt to repel the threat hy counteraction instead of submission. However, the reaction of the party threatened, even if it foils the robbery, does not wipe out the attempted robbery, nor does it expunge the initial crime of entering the financial institution with intent to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Since the facts also clearly show an entry with intent to commit a felony, Brown was not prejudiced by the government being required in the charge to furnish a greater quantum of proof under the first paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) than is necessary under the second paragraph. The paragraphs are written in the alternative and a violation of either is sufficient for a conviction under \u00a7 2113(a). The proof here warrants a conviction under either paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The corollary contention that the District Court erred in not declaring a mistrial when government counsel argued to the jury that the facts showed that Miss Simmons was intimidated, is frivolous. The Court in overruling the motion correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201cI think the attorneys are entitled to draw their inferences of what they show. This is merely argument to the jury. The jury understands, of course, they\u2019re bound exclusively by the testimony as it comes from the stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avy-dedup-0\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-31\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\">\u201c(a) Whoever, by force and violence, <em>or by intimidation, </em>takes, or <em>attempts to talce, from the person </em>or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the care, custody, control, management, or <em>possession of, </em>any bank, or <em>any savings and loan association; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">\u201cWhoever enters or attempts to enter any bank, or any savings and loan association, * * * <em>with intent to commit </em>in such bank, or <em>in such savings and loan association, </em>* * * <em>any felony affecting </em>such bank or <em>such savings and loan association </em>and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">\u201c(g) As used in this section the term \u2018savings and loan association\u2019 means any Federal savings and loan association and any savings and loan association the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-14\">. Although the offense took place in April 1966, Brown was not a suspect until March 1967 when he was linked to the crime by the thumbprint on the note. At that time Brown was serving a six-month sentence in the St. Louis Workhouse for conviction of possession of marijuana. Trial in this case was on March 25-26, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">. In prosecutions under \u00a7 2113(a), conviction of the lesser offense \u2014 entering an institution with intent to commit a felony \u2014is merged in a conviction of the offenses defined in the first paragraph of that section \u2014 attempted or consummated robbery of an institution; consecutive sentences could not be imposed for violation of both-the first and second paragraphs of \u00a7 2113 (a). Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. The Court correctly instructed on the \u201cintimidation\u201d issue submitted in the charge. This part of the charge was taken from Mathes and Devitt, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 43.05, pp. 337-338 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cTo take, or attempt to take, \u2018by intimidation\u2019 means willfully to take, or attempt to take, by putting in fear of bodily harm. Such fear must arise from the willful conduct of the accused, rather than from some mere tempermental timidity of the victim; however, the fear of the victim need not be so great as to result in terror, panic, or hysteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-18\">\u201cA taking, or an attempted taking, \u2018by intimidation\u2019 must be established by proof of one or more acts or statements of the accused which were done or made, in such a way or manner, and under such circumstances, as would produce in the ordinary person fear of bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiT\">\u201cHowever, actual fear need not be proved. Fear, like intent may be inferred from statements made and acts done or omitted by the accused, and by the victim as well; and from all the surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
