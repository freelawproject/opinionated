We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-26\">Burke\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. We reject this argument because the testimony of a Government undercover agent, if believed, proved all of the elements of the offense charged. Burke relies upon the fact that he was able to present in his defense multiple witnesses who contradicted the agent\u2019s testimony. However, questions of credibility raised by contradictions in the evidence are to be resolved by the jury. United States v. Plata, 7 Cir. 1966, 361 F.2d 958, cert. denied 385 U.S. 841, 87 S.Ct. 94, 17 L.Ed.2d 74; Wyatt v. United States, 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 304. Taking the view most favorable to the Government, so long as there exists substantial evidence to support the jury verdict, we must affirm. Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680; Peters v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 839; Downing v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 348 F.2d 594. In the case, <em>sub judice, </em>we find substantial direct evidence to support the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
