Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-20\">In the <em>Enterprise </em>case, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-21\">\u201cThe refusal of courts to review the merits of an arbitration award is the proper approach to arbitration under collective bargaining agreements. The federal policy of settling labor disputes by arbitration would be undermined if courts had the final say on the merits of the awards.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra at 596, 80 S.Ct. at 1360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-22\">There are no disputes of fact which required factual hearing before the District Court. The District Judge noted: \u201cThere has been no contention by any party that the dispute was not arbitrable, but in any event, this court believes that the matter was properly before the arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-23\">Our review of this record sustains his finding that the issues presented were arbitrable. For the reasons outlined in the District Judge\u2019s unreported opinion, the arbitrator\u2019s award is not subject to relitigation in the courts, and, hence, the merits of this dispute were not before him and are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-24\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-25\">.
