The jury found for the defendant on counts one and two. On this appeal plaintiff asserts various errors, only one of which requires discussion. Plaintiff testified that in a rough sea he slipped on a deck that had a large patch of slime and moss, thick as a blotter. The defendant denied this, and over plaintiff\u2019s objection the captain was permitted to testify that no accident had ever occurred there before.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">Since the jury could have found that the condition the plaintiff described, had it existed, would have been of some permanence and a continual danger, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to admit this evidence as tending to contradict plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">Plaintiff seeks to draw too much from Robitaille v. Netoco Community Theatre, Inc., 1940, 305 Mass. 265, 25 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>749, 128 A.L.R. 592. That case, at most, established a rule vesting a great deal of discretion in the trial judge to decide when evidence of a prior safety record is admissible. <em>See </em>Riley v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 1968 Mass.Adv.S. 385, 388-389, 234 N.E.2d 746. Even if <em>Robitaille </em>could be thought to have established a restrictive rule, we would feel obliged under F.R.Civ.P. 43(a) to follow a more liberal rule of admissibility if there were such. There is. <em>See, e.g., </em>Zheutlin v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., 1962, 149 Conn. 364, 179 A.2d 829; Erickson v. Walgreen Drug Co., 1951, 120 Utah 31, 232 P.2d 210; Jackson v. Chicago, M., St.P. &amp; P.R.R., 1947, 238 Iowa 1253, 30 N.W.2d 97; Doyle v. St. Paul, M. &amp; M. Ry., 1889, 42 Minn. 79, 43 N.W. 787. <em>See generally, </em>Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 252, 458; McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
