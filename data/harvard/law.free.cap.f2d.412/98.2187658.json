The sole issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized pursuant to an illegal search and seizure. We affirm for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Northern Federal was robbed of approximately $5,500 shortly after noon on September 29, 1967. Approximately an hour later at 1:15 P.M., the defendant was arrested at the Burlington Hotel by St. Paul Police Detective Vernon Michel. Detective Michel became aware of the robbery at about 12:10 P.M. when it was broadcast over police radio. Detective Michel obtained all his information from the police broadcasts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The robber was originally described as a middle-aged white man of 45 years, weighing 155 pounds, five feet ten inches tall, slender build, wearing a brown hat and a red coat sweater with white stripes on the sleeves. The description was later amended to add that the man was in need of a shave, weighed 145-170 pounds, had brown hair turning gray and thinning, and wore a green and red stocking cap. This description was further amended to delete the stocking cap and add that the hat was a short brimmed brown or gray hat and that the robber was definitely less than five feet six inches tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A subsequent broadcast added that a man answering the description had fled from police officers into the union depot and down the tracks losing his hat in the process. It was then reported that railroad employees in the control tower spotted a man matching the description down \u201cby that Burlington House near the fish hatchery.\u201d Then, it was reported that two men were seen by a switch-man near the fish hatchery and that one had graying hair, but the description was vague. Other reports from switch-men reported a lone man in the fish hatchery area. Other officers were directed to cut off retreat to the west. It was then reported that an officer had found a sweater at Sibley and Kellogg, which is slightly west of the depot and considerably west of where the search was centering. Information that the robber was wearing a dark colored \u201csport\u201d shirt was broadcasted. A witness to the robbery identified the sweater and hat and the Deputy Chief, apparently concluding that the switchmen had been mistaken, redirected the search to the area west of the depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The railyards east of the depot are bordered by the Mississippi River on the south. On the north, the yards are bordered by a 100-foot bluff \u201cwhich is nearly straight up and down\u201d and which runs from the depot to a point just short of the Burlington Hotel. Although the Deputy Chief ordered the search concentrated to the west, Detective Michel was convinced the geography of the area, plus the earlier reports, dictated that the robber would flee east. He decided to check an old railroad workers\u2019 hotel, the Burlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Detective Michel and Officer Biagi entered the hotel and talked to the owner. They noticed two persons sitting at the lunch counter. The owner stated that he knew one of the men but not the other. Detective Michel approached the unidentified man and asked him to identify himself. Detective Michel stated that the man matched the description of the wanted man in every respect. The suspect showed Detective Michel his Navy discharge papers and Detective Michel asked him if he could search him. The man stated, \u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d The man pulled a wallet out of his pocket and put it on the table. Detective Michel proceeded to search the man\u2019s front pocket and discovered a handful of bul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>lets. Simultaneously, Officer Biagi noted that the defendant had a pistol. Detective Michel then said, \u201cYou are under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The officers seized the pistol and continued their search. They recovered some $5,500 concealed on the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The defendant contends that the evidence \u2014 the bullets, the pistol and the money \u2014 should have been suppressed on the grounds that it was obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure. He argues that probable cause to arrest did not exist prior to the search and that, in any event, the arrest was not made until after he had been partially searched and the bullets and gun discovered. Thus, he reasons that the search and seizure cannot be sustained as being incident to a lawful arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Because we believe that this search was incident to and contemporaneous with, Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483, 486, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964), a lawful arrest, United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 60-61, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we do not consider the consent issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>PROBABLE CAUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Whether probable cause exists to make an arrest turns upon the facts of the particular case. Pigg v. United States, 337 F.2d 302, 305 (8th Cir. 1964). Its existence here turns on whether the broadcast description of the suspect was sufficiently detailed so as \u201cto warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175-176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">The trial court, after a full hearing, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-21\">\u201cThe officers were in fresh pursuit, that they had reasonable cause to suspect and to believe defendant was the robber and reasonable grounds to arrest defendant. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-22\">The facts support the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-23\">Detective Michel was looking for a person matching the following description: white, male, 35-45 years old, slender build, less than five feet six inches in height, brown hair, turning gray, needing a shave, hatless and located in a limited geographic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-24\">This was not a general description applicable to a large number of people. It was reasonably detailed and specific. Detective Michel testified that the defendant matched the description in every respect. The trial court found that the defendant matched the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tion. The defendant was found in the limited geographic area where the suspect was reported to have fled. The two officers were in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of the suspect. Under such circumstances, it cannot be said that the arrest of the defendant was based on mere suspicion, Pigg v. United States, <em>supra, </em>or was an arrest for investigatory purposes. Compare Rodgers v. United States, 362 F.2d 358 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 993, 87 S.Ct. 608, 17 L.Ed.2d 454 (1966); Gatlin v. United States, 117 U.S. App.D.C. 123, 326 F.2d 666 (1963). The facts are such that a reasonably prudent man, independent of evidence obtained in the search, could conclude that the defendant was the person who robbed the savings and loan association.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd\">\u201cIn dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. They are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. The standard of proof is accordingly correlative to what must be proved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. at 175, 69 S.Ct. at 1310. See, Jackson v. United States, 408 F.2d 1165 (8th Cir. 1969); Kayser v. United States, 394 F.2d 601 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 919, 89 S.Ct. 250, 21 L.Ed.2d 206 (1968); Gullett v. United States, 387 F.2d 307 (8th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1044, 88 S.Ct. 1645, 20 L.Ed.2d 307 (1968); Dupree v. United States, 380 F.2d 233 (8th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 944, 88 S.Ct. 2289, 20 L.Ed.2d 1407 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance upon Detective Michel\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe bullets convinced [him] that [the defendant] was the one who robbed the bank\u201d to establish lack of probable cause is misplaced. When the statement is read in context, it indicates only that the discovery of the bullets only seemed to strengthen the detective\u2019s reasonable belief that he had the right man. To the extent that testimony tends to show Detective Michel\u2019s state of mind at the time, it is of limited importance. Our primary concern is not with the officer\u2019s state of mind but with whether, viewed in retrospect, the objective facts were such as to justify a prudent person in believing that he had enough facts on which to base an arrest before a search was made. Compare, Klingler v. United States, 409 F.2d 299 (8th Cir. 1969), where the officer, having probable cause to arrest for armed robbery, arrested the petitioner on the grounds of vagrancy. There, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cBecause probable cause for an arrest is determined by objective facts, it is immaterial that Kisecker, at the hearing on the motion to suppress, testified that he did not think that he had \u2018enough facts\u2019 upon which to arrest Klingler for armed robbery. His subjective opinion is not material. See, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). A constitutional safeguard predicated on an objective standard requires an even-handed application. From the standpoint of the individual, the figurative zone protecting his privacy and personal integrity may be encroached under the law only by facts and circumstances totaling probable cause for arrest. See, Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 17, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948). * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">409 F.2d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\n<em>TIMING OF THE ARREST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The defendant contends that he was not arrested until after Detective Michel searched him and found the bullets. He relies on the fact that Detective Michel conceded, on cross-examination, that he did not inform the defendant that he was under arrest until he found the bullets on the defendant\u2019s person. He argues, from these facts, that even though the police officer had probable cause to arrest him prior to the search, he failed to do so, thus the search cannot be justified as being incidental to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The government contends that the police officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant and the fact that the search may have preceded the formal arrest by a few moments is irrelevant. We believe its position is a sound one.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and other Courts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have held, in circumstances somewhat similar to those here, that notwithstanding the fact that a suspect was not formally placed under arrest until after he had been searched, he had in fact been arrested prior thereto because his liberty had been effectively restrained at an earlier time. We could perhaps follow the same reasoning here. Without depreciating in any way the strength of our prior decisions, we decline to do so. We accept the question as it is posed by the defendant and the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> We hold that where the government sustains its burden of proving that a police officer had probable cause for arresting a suspect for a felony and where it is clear that evidence seized in a contemporaneous search of the suspect\u2019s person was in no way necessary to establish probable cause, the search is incidental to the arrest. The search is valid whether it took place moments before or moments after the arresting officer took the suspect into actual custody or announced his intention of so doing. We believe that this holding is supported and suggested by language of the Supreme Court in Husty v. United States, 282 U.S. 694, 700, 51 S.Ct. 240, 241, 75 L.Ed. 629 (1931); <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-17\">\u201cThe 4th Amendment does not prohibit the search, without warrant, of an automobile, for liquor illegally transported or possessed, if the search is upon probable cause; and arrest for the transportation or possession need not precede the search. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A52\">and this Court in Reed v. United States, 401 F.2d 756, 761 (8th Cir. 1968):<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">\u201cWe are not persuaded by the argument that the search was invalid because it preceded the moment when Officer Blythe formally informed the defendant that he was under arrest. According to the evidence the formal declaration was made contemporaneous with or immediately after the shotgun was seized. \u2018An arrest to be effective does not require formal words of arrest or stationhouse bookkeeping.\u2019 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-19\">In our view, the announced rule protects the rights of accuseds and provides a non-technical standard for police to follow. It permits trial courts and reviewing courts to determine whether a search is incidental to a valid arrest by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>objective standards. It relieves the courts in the proper case of the difficult task of determining the moment at which an arrest takes place, and the even more difficult task of determining the moment at which a police officer intended to make an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In holding as we do, we expressly negate any intention of relaxing the standards incident to the \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement and reiterate the frequently stated maxim that a search is not to be made legal by what turns up.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">. \u201cThe details concerning a case which are furnished an officer via police radio can be taken by him as reasonably trustworthy information upon which to base his actions. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.)
