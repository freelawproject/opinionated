The Commissioner disallowed the deduction taken for any of these alleged entertainment expenditures if in excess of $25.00, and allowed the alleged non-reimbursed entertainment expenses that were less than $25.00. The latter figure amounted to $682.86. The former figure totaled $4,984.31, and the dispute here relates to the disallowance of the $4,984.31. The Commissioner disallowed these deductions taken for expenses in excess of $25.00 because, as required by Treasury Regulation 1.274-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>5(c) (2) (iii), the taxpayer was unable to produce any restaurant receipts or other documentary evidence to supplement notations made in code on his desk calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The taxpayer petitioned the United States Tax Court for a redetermination of the tax deficiency resulting from these disallowed deductions. The Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner. Appellant now seeks a review of the decision of the Tax Court. We affirm the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The taxpayer\u2019s only substantial claim is that the above Regulation is invalid because it directly contradicts \u00a7 274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 274. That section begins with the statement: \u201cNo deduction shall be allowed unless the taxpayer substantiates by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement * * It is the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the two methods of substantiation outlined in the Code are distinct and unambiguous, and that his desk calendar notes completely satisfied the \u201cadequate records\u201d method of subst\u00e1ntiation, a method which the taxpayer argues requires no corroboration of taxpayer\u2019s own personal records.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Taxpayer\u2019s contention is without merit. Treasury regulations are to be upheld unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the statute under which they are promulgated. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. South Texas Lumber Co., 333 U.S. 496, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948). Here the disputed Regulation is not inconsistent with the statute, for the phrase \u201cadequate records\u201d is clearly open to interpretation, and the Regulation interprets the phrase so as to carry out the stated congressional purpose of insuring \u201cthat no deduction is allowed solely on the basis of his own [the taxpayer\u2019s] unsupported self-serving testimony.\u201d H. Rep. No. 1447 (1962-3 Cum.Bull. 405, 427); S. Rep. No. 1881 (1962-3 Cum.Bull. 707, 741). Moreover, there is, of course, specific statutory authority to enact the present Regulation for \u00a7 274(h) delegates authority to the Secretary to prescribe those regulations necessary to carry out the purpose of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Finally, even were we to agree with the taxpayer (which we are not) that documentary evidence was not necessary to fulfill the \u201cadequate records\u201d requirement, the records here would be deficient and inadequate for the calendar notations were extremely scanty and made in a code decipherable only by the taxpayer. This again is in direct contradiction of the congressional intent manifested when the provision was before the Congress. \u201cGenerally, the substantiation requirements of the bill [\u00a7 274(d)] contemplate more detailed record keeping than is common today in business expense diaries.\u201d H. Rep. No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. p. 23 (1962-63 Cum.Bull. 405, 427).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
