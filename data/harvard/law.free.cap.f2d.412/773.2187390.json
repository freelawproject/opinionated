He entered a plea of guilty-to the bail-jumping charge in the presence of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-22\">On this appeal he makes the following contentions: (1) error was committed in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea of guilty at the time of sentence; (2) the trial court did not comply with Rule 11 Fed.R.Crim.P. in accepting his plea of guilty; (3) the trial court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s pro se motion to withdraw his plea of guilty filed after sentence was pronounced; and (4) error was committed in denying appellant an evidentiary hearing on his oral motion to withdraw his plea of guilty before sentence was pronounced. In summary the appellant contends that his guilty plea should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-24\"> Upon a review of the record we are convinced that the contentions of the appellant are without merit. We take note of the fact that the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Court rendered its decision in McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) subsequent to the submission of this case to the court. After <em>McCarthy, </em>however, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (May 7, 1969), wherein it considered the question \u201cwhether McCarthy should be applied to guilty pleas accepted prior to the date of that decision.\u201d The Court answered the question as follows: \u201cWe hold that only those defendants whose guilty pleas were accepted after April 2, 1969, are entitled to plead anew if their plea was accepted without full compliance with Rule 11.\u201d Appellant Bell\u2019s plea was entered prior to the date specified in <em>Halliday.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-25\">. Tlie provisions of this section are now covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3150, 3151 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
