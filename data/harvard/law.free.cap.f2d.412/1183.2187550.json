Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">This appeal is from a judgment denying an Alabama convict\u2019s habeas corpus petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Appellant was convicted by a jury of first degree manslaughter and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. No direct appeal was taken. He applied for a writ of error coram nobis in the state trial court alleging failure of his retained counsel to advise him of his right to appeal. After an evidentiary hearing at which appellant and his trial counsel testified, the court found that appellant was advised of his right to appeal by counsel and denied relief. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed without an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Appellant filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court contending, in addition to the aforementioned lack of knowledge of his right to appeal, lack of effective counsel during the cor-am nobis proceedings both in the trial court and on appeal. The district court denied habeas corpus relief without holding an evidentiary hearing. Based upon a review of the state records and transcript, the court below found that appellant was given a full and fair evi-dentiary hearing in the state court and that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">On this appeal, appellant claims the state trial court erred in denying relief and the district court erred in denying relief without a hearing. We disagree with these contentions. The district court specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-11\">There is sufficient evidence to support the State Trial Judge\u2019s finding that the [appellant] was adequately represented at his trial and with regard to his right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">Having come to this conclusion, one in which we find no clear error, the court below was justified in denying appellant\u2019s habeas corpus petition without a hearing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Gomez v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 766. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
