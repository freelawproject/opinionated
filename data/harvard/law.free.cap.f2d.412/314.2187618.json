[In 1963, Congress enacted Section 217 of the Code providing that moving expenses should be deductible, but the statute was given prospective application only and does not apply here.] The Tax Court, in a divided decision, decided such expenses could be deducted, distinguishing the case of Mendel v. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 32 (1963), rev\u2019d, 351 F.2d 580 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">Upon consideration, we are of the opinion that under the circumstances shown here such expenses may not be deducted under authority of Mendel, supra, and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Dodd, 410 F.2d 132 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Tax Court for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
