The judgment awarded to Burns Bros. Plumbers, Inc., plaintiff-appellee and cross-appellant, the sum of $28,832.55 in Burns\u2019 suit against Groves Ventures Company and its subsidiary, S. J. Groves &amp; Sons Company (treated together here as Groves), defendants-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Burns\u2019 suit against Groves asserted claims totalling $130,000 arising out of work connected with a subcontract that Burns had made with Groves in June, 1959. Groves, in May, 1959, had entered into a contract with the United States Corps of Engineers for construction of the Meldahl Locks in the Ohio River between Clermont County, Ohio, and Bracken County, Kentucky. The price for the entire work was $25,000,000 and Burns\u2019 subcontract, covering certain work on the piping and mechanical systems for the locks, originally called for payment of about $387,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">This suit, first brought in the Southern District of New York, was transferred to the Southern District of Ohio pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). By agreement of the parties, the Court appointed a Special Master, D. G. Aron-berg, to hear the evidence and make proposed Findings of Fact. Aronberg, who was not a lawyer but an engineer with fifty years of experience in the construction industry, filed an initial report on November 4, 1966, after taking evidence. Upon objection filed by both parties, the District Court resubmitted the matter to the Master who considered interrogatories and answers submitted by both parties and made a supplemental report on June 20, 1967. The District Court on November 3, 1967, pursuant to Rule 53(e) (2), Fed.R.Civ.P., determined that the Master\u2019s Findings were not clearly erroneous, accepted them, and ordered that Burns recover from Groves the sum of $28,832.55, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Groves appeals from three parts of that decision: (1) an award of $4,541.-41 in payment for the cost of Burns\u2019 sectional testing of pipe which was demanded by Groves but which had not been stipulated in the subcontract; (2) $6,150 awarded to Burns as damages alleged to have been suffered because of 41 days delay in the completion of the project caused by the flooding of the Ohio River, and (3) $18,141.14 awarded to Burns as damages alleged to have ac-curred because of Groves\u2019 failure to supply Burns adequate electricity. Burns cross-appeals from part three of the decision, claiming that the award was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">We affirm the judgment entered upon the above items (1) and (3), but reverse as to item (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">1. Sectional testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">Burns\u2019 work of installing the piping and mechanical systems for the locks was initially carried on inside the cofferdam.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of the work, Burns, at the request of Groves, did what is referred to as separate or sectional testing of the various component installations making up the hydraulic system. Burns\u2019 position is that its only obligation under the subcontract was to carry out such testing at the conclusion of its work, and that the interim sectional testing added to its cost in the amount of $4,541.41. The prime contract between Groves and the Corps of Engineers provided in Sections 16-14 and 16-16 in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-17\">\u201c16-14 <em>Hydraulic Oil.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-18\">Upon completion of the installation and cleaning of oil lines, hydraulic oil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>shall be added to the system to fill all hydraulic lines and equipment including all hydraulic operating machinery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">* * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c16-16 <em>Operating tests.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Upon completion and prior to acceptance of the installation, the contractor shall subject the hydraulic system to such operating tests as may be required by this contracting officer to demonstrate satisfactory functional and operating efficiency. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Groves seemed to concede that the above provisions did not explicitly require any testing prior to the completion of the hydraulic system. While there is sharp dispute on the point, Burns claimed that Groves agreed that the work of interim sectional testing, made necessary by the progress of the work, should be considered as an extra for which Burns should be paid. Testing of the hydraulic system was done by introduction of oil. Burns showed that if it could do this work in one final operation, it would bring the oil to the site of the work by an oil tanker and the pumping of oil from such tanker into the system would be a much more economical operation \u2014 both from handling and the price of the oil \u2014 than the piecemeal testing which required transporting and handling the oil in barrels. The Special Master found that Groves had agreed to pay for the involved work as an extra, and awarded Burns $4,541.41 \u2014the amount which he found the cost of the sectional testing exceeded the cost of testing in the manner provided for in the subcontract. There was evidence from which such a finding of fact could be made, the finding was adopted by the District Judge and we are satisfied that it was not clearly erroneous. It is binding on us. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Appellant Groves argues that Section 28 of the subcontract is controlling. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">\u201cIt is agreed that the terms and conditions of this agreement are fully covered in the foregoing and that any verbal statements made by either party or agents claiming to represent either party are to be considered of no effect whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">In disposing of this contention, the District Judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">\u201cWe do not consider that Section 28 amounts to a \u2018contract in writing not to make any other contracts except in writing.\u2019 * * * In any event, the finding of fact of the Master was that a new contract was in fact made covering something not covered by the original contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Groves also argues that the parol evidence rule was offended by permitting the establishment of a term not in the original subcontract, and employing parol evidence to do so. Notwithstanding the many efforts to expand the parol evidence rule so as to foreclose contracting parties from making new oral agreements relating to the general subject matter of a written contract, it is now well established that the rule does not foreclose what was agreed upon by Burns and Groves as found by the Master.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">\u201cThis [the parol evidence rule] does not preclude parol evidence from being introduced to prove the making of a contemporaneous contract which does not cover the same ground [as the written contract] * * *. Nor does the rule preclude the admission of evidence of the subsequent modification of the integrated agreement by parol or written contract.\u201d 4 Williston on Contracts, \u00a7 631, pp. 948-951.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">The alleged oral agreement in the case at bar was entered into subsequent to the signing of the subcontract and the Master found it to cover terms not covered in either the prime contract or the Burns-Groves subcontract. In Grandcourt Land Co. v. Raymond, 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Ohio Law Abst. 629 (1920), the Ohio Court of Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">\u201cWhere an oral contract is made subsequent to a written contract and especially after work under the written contract has been commenced, parol evidence of the latter contract is competent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>See also, </em>Dusi v. Albanese, 74 Ohio App. 136, 57 N.E.2d 802 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Groves also urges that the Ohio Statute of Frauds, Ohio Revised Code, \u00a7 1335.05, bars Burns\u2019 recovery. This statute requires that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cNo action * * * upon a contract or sale of lands, tenements, * * * or interest in or concerning them, or upon an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfB\">shall be maintainable unless such agreement is in writing. This statute is inapplicable as the alleged oral agreement involved the performance of certain testing operations. It did not concern a contract or interest in land and was to be performed in less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">2. Delays caused by flooding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Neither the prime contract nor the Burns-Groves subcontract was performed within the original time schedule. The subcontract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201c6. The Subcontractor agrees to commence work contracted for within five calendar days after being notified in writing by the Contractor to do so and to complete said work to the satisfaction and acceptance of the Owner within 700 calendar days from notification to commence, or by August 1, 1961. No extension of time of performance of this contract shall be recognized by the Contractor without the written consent of the Contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ams\">Completion of the prime contract was delayed some 467 days beyond the original completion date of August 1, 1961. Part of this delay was the result of the flooding of the cofferdam as a consequence of an unforeseen rise in the Ohio River, and part was the result of additional work performed by Groves as a consequence of changes in specifications by the Corps of Engineers. For additional work performed and for the consequences to Groves for the flooding of the cofferdam, Groves received nearly two million dollars over the original $25,000,000 contract price. The principal contract provided in Clause 1-09:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\"><em>\u201cFlooding of cofferdam. </em>In the event that the cofferdam is in an unwatered condition and a rise in the river over-tops and floods the cofferdam, an allowance of $25,000 for flooding and cleanup of the cofferdam, plus a sum of $1,000.00 per day for each calendar day, or fraction thereof, beginning at midnight following the time the cofferdam is flooded and ending at the time the river recedes below the elevation of the bottom of the sluiceway, will be paid the contractor, subject to the following conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">The evidence showed that Groves was allowed no extra compensation for the mere delay following flooding of the cofferdam, but <em>only for work </em>actually done during such time. There was evidence from which it could be found that the delays due to flooding damaged Burns by both indirect and direct costs accruing to it during such delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The Master found that Burns suffered such damage, and granted relief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-16\">\u201cThere is no reason to write any new language into this Clause, because it clearly states that $25,000.00 per flood is for <em>\u2018flooding and clean-wp\u2019 </em>and the $1,000.00 is not stated to be for any work, but merely \u2018per day\u2019. I claim that it\u2019s for Overhead and Indirect Cost that could not be cut off Groves\u2019 payroll during the delay period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-17\">\u201cAt the time of Groves first flood, May 19, 1960, Burns was not yet on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the job, so we will deduct $13,000.00 (13 calendar days at $1,000.00) from the total of $54,000.00 (54 calendar days at $1,000.00) which Groves received, which leaves us $41,000.00. As to Burns\u2019 Overhead and Indirect Cost, I estimate it at about $150.00 per day. I Find at this point that Burns is entitled to 41 days at $150.00 per day, a total of $6,150.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">He determined that no other allowance against Groves could be made and concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cIn view of all the foregoing, I cannot Find for the Plaintiff in any amount for the Second part of this Count [claim outside of the flooding matter], but do Find for him, for the first part of the Count in the sum of $6,150.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The District Court affirmed the Master\u2019s Finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We share the Master\u2019s apparent view that Burns must have suffered substantial damages from these delays and understand his desire that Burns should have some share of what the Corps of Engineers paid to Groves. The Master sought to do equity, but we consider that there was no contractual basis for his Finding. Section 10 of the Burns-Groves subcontract precluded Burns from claiming \u201cextra compensation on account of delays, interference or hindrance caused by the Contractor or other Subcontractors in the performance of their respective items of work.\u201d The subcontract is silent with respect to damages on account of delays caused by any other source, such as flooding of the cofferdam. We consider that the absence of a clause allowing claims for such damages forecloses Burns from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Moreover, there is no provision in the prime contract which indicates that Groves was to use its payments under Clause 1-09 for the purpose of reimbursing its subcontractors. There were eighteen subcontractors in addition to Burns involved on the project and presumably some of them were damaged by the flooding. If several were to claim and be awarded damages, Groves\u2019 $1,000 per day payment would soon be depleted, and the beneficiaries of Clause 1-09 of the prime contract would be the subcontractors rather than Groves.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Flooding of the Ohio River is predictable and contemplated. The - specifications for the job warned all bidders of the possibility of floods. Burns had the opportunity to raise its bid to account for anticipated flooding or to request a clause pertaining to flood damage in its subcontract. The absence of such a clause forecloses relief. The award is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">3. Damages for inadequate electric supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The prime contract between Groves and the Corps of Engineers provided in paragraph 10 of the Special Conditions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-15\">\u201cAll electric current required by the Contractor * * * shall be furnished at his own expense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aya\">and Section 21 of the Burns-Groves Subcontract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\">\u201cThe Contractor agrees to provide working areas, not including buildings or utilities, except that <em>the Subcontractor may connect to the Contractor's utilities </em>* * * <em>without charge for such services.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">Burns chose to connect to Groves\u2019 source of electricity which came from the Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. To have made its own connection and paid for the electricity used would have prohibitively added to the cost of Burns\u2019 completion of the contract. The Master commented on this by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-19\">\u201c[F]or Burns to have furnished his own temporary electrical service, according to the testimony as to what it cost Groves, it could have cost Burns half or more of his entire contract price, and this was taken into consideration by both parties when preparing their bids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-20\">The Master, contrary to the contention of Groves, held that the above quoted Section 21 of the subcontract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201cEstablishes Groves\u2019 obligation to Burns just as clearly as if these two clauses were transformed to the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u2018All Subcontractors without cost to them shall connect to the Contractor\u2019s Temporary Electrical Service and the Contractor guarantees that this Installation and Maintenance will provide proper service to all Subcontractors for their operations requiring electrical current.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We are satisfied that in this case there is evidentiary support for the Master\u2019s conclusion. If his findings in this regard may in part be read as conclusions of law, we observe that the District Judge agreed with the Master, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">To support its claim for damages for breach of Groves\u2019 contract to furnish an adequate supply of electricity, Burns\u2019 employees testified that throughout their work the supply fluctuated and periodically failed to the extent that the efficiency of their welding equipment was seriously impaired. There was testimony that because of the inadequate supply of electricity, a team of Burns\u2019 welders \u2014 whose principal work on the project consisted of welding pieces of pipe together \u2014 would weld an average of only four to six welds per day instead of the normal ten to sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Using the hourly rate of pay for Burns\u2019 welders and computing Burns\u2019 loss resulting from their reduced productivity, Burns\u2019 supervisor calculated the loss at a total figure of $40,313.63. The Master found that Burns had suffered damages but, because Burns\u2019 calculations of the loss were in part determined from \u201cmemory and observation,\u201d he applied an error factor of 10%, thus reducing the loss to $36,282.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Groves contended that Burns\u2019 failure to efficiently employ the available elec-trie supply was due to the type of welding equipment used by it \u2014 the buzz-box or transformer-rectifier type \u2014 instead of the so-called motor-generator type. From the evidence it was permissible for the Master to conclude that some part of Burns\u2019 loss was due to the type of its welding equipment used on this project. The Master concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">\u201cIn view of all the foregoing, I am satisfied that Burns had fluctuating voltage and voltage drop difficulties due to inadequate temporary wiring, and that this could have been made adequate by Groves electrical engineer Bosch, but Groves never reported Burns\u2019 trouble to Bosch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201cThe next subject to deal with is the so-called \u2018buzz-box\u2019 or more correctly, transformer-rectifier type of welding machines used by Burns. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">\u201cMr. Bosch stated in his Testimony that 90% of all mechanical Contractors used Motor Generator Sets and that the type Burns used was only 60% efficient. Other witnesses also testified that Motor Generator Sets should have been used. Therefore, the weight of evidence is strongly against the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">\u201cTo conclude, I find both the Plaintiff and the Defendant equally at fault, the Defendant furnishing inadequate Electrical Service and the Plaintiff using the wrong Welding Machines. This item should be split 50-50. But first, I want to cut 10% off Roberts\u2019 estimate of $40,313.63, as I can\u2019t go along with his estimating by \u2018memory and observation\u2019. This leaves $36,-282.27 and, one-half of this, $18,141.14 I find for Burns, the Plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">The Special Master\u2019s appears to have again used his expertness to come up with what he considered a just approximation of a proper award. We, however, are satisfied that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>evidence which raised the Masters\u2019 calculations above mere speculation, and as findings of fact they were found by the District Judge not to be clearly erroneous. We do not find reversible error in the District Judge\u2019s conclusion. He followed the familiar rule that, where one\u2019s right to damages is established, his right will not be denied even though a calculation of damages cannot be accomplished with mathematical exactness. Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562-563, 51 S.Ct. 248, <em>75 </em>L.Ed. 544, 548 (1931); Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 263, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652, 660 (1946); Flame Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, 303 F.2d 39, 44 (6th Cir.1962); Merritt, Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 295 F.2d 14, 17 (9th Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Our sustaining of the District Judge and the Master upon the merits of this issue disposes of Burns\u2019 cross-appeal on the Master\u2019s finding that Burns\u2019 inferi- or equipment created 50% of the welding problem. We need not consider Groves\u2019 contention that Burns\u2019 cross-appeal was procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We affirm the District Court as to issues 1 and 3 and reverse as to the award of damages for delay. The case is remanded to the District Court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion. Each party will pay its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">.

The Master in making these strong and forthright observations was in part employing his own long experience as an engineer and builder. It may point up the dangers inherent in using experts in the subject matter of litigation as the final arbiters on disputed questions of fact and law. Such persons may at times rely on their own knowledge and ability rather than evidence, subject to testing by cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
