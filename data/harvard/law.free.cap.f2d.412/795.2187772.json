Under the collective bargaining contract between the International Longshoremen &amp; Ware-housemen\u2019s Union and the Pacific Maritime Association, representing the ship owners, grievances respecting ship clerks are handled by respondent Joint Checker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Labor Relations Committee, which is composed of representatives of both the union and the association. If agreement is not reached by the committee the dispute can go to arbitration and from there to further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In appellant\u2019s case a grievance was asserted by Matson Terminals, Inc., appellant\u2019s employer at the time in question. Appellant presented his ease to the labor representatives on the joint committee. He admitted the mistake with which he was charged and that it was costly, but felt that under the circumstances it could be excused. In committee meeting the labor representatives presented appellant\u2019s case to the association representatives who found it insufficient and insisted that he be stricken from the casual rolls of the hiring hall. The labor representatives were of the view that appellant\u2019s defense was not sufficiently compelling to warrant taking the matter to arbitration. They capitulated and appellant\u2019s name was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Appellant then brought this suit under \u00a7 801 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, charging that he was being deprived of employment in violation of the collective bargaining contract and that the union, in failing adequately to represent him, had deprived him of the full scope of the grievance procedure provided by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Certainly appellant cannot be charged with failure to exhaust his remedies under the contract. The union representatives on the joint committee have precluded that by failing to press for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">However, findings of the District Court, which are not clearly erroneous, establish that appellant was fairly represented and that Matson\u2019s complaint against him was true. The court concluded that there was no breach of contract in terminating appellant\u2019s employment, relying on Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
