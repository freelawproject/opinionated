Passing under a bridge Melanson came out from the pilot house and his head was caught between it and the bridge, causing serious injuries. Written notice of the injury was not given, but McKie knew of the occurrence and notified its insurer, plaintiff appellant, Travelers Insurance Company. Travelers paid Me-lanson what it terms voluntary compensation, hereinafter more fully described, until June 1962, when Melanson sued McKie under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Travelers then discontinued payments, and Melanson promptly made claim and sued for compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>This claim was heard by a deputy commissioner of the United States Department of Labor, hereinafter the commissioner, who took testimony and found in favor of Melanson. Travelers sought review in the United States district court, in which proceeding Melan-son intervened. The district court in an opinion, 290 F.Supp. 221, upheld the commissioner, and Travelers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Travelers\u2019 first defense, which was not sustained, is that Melanson failed to file timely notice of claim. On the commissioner\u2019s express findings Melanson did not file within the one-year statutory period, but only after Travelers discontinued the \u201cvoluntary\u201d payments. Melanson claims that these payments tolled the one-year period. This would be so if they constituted \u201cpayment of compensation * * * without an award.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Travelers says the payments were not \u201ccompensation\u201d because they did not constitute \u201cmoney * * * payable * * * as provided for in this chapter,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(12) and Melanson recognized this by signing a document dated March 30, I960.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It may be that the payments made pursuant to this agreement were not, strict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ly, \u201ccompensation.\u201d Only a sea lawyer, however, would notice the difference. Melanson had no lawyer, sea or otherwise; nor would he be aware of any need to obtain counsel when payments were regularly coming in. The fact that they were styled in a paper signed by him as \u201cequal to\u201d payments as distinguished from \u201cpayments\u201d is not significant. This may have been clear to Travelers, but it must have been equally clear to Travelers that it alone had this sharpness of vision. The document is valueless, and if we were engaged in ethical appraisals we would say, in the light of what it sought to provide, worse than valueless. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 916; Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Brown, N. D.Ill., 1930, 47 F.2d 265; <em>see also </em>McCabe Inspection Serv., Inc. v. Willard, 2 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 942; Lawson v. Standard Dredging Co., 5 Cir., 1943, 134 F.2d 771. Notice was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The substantive question in the case is whether Melanson is barred from recovery by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), which provides, \u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel * * Since Melanson was the sole person engaged in operating the LOUISE at the time in question \u2014 and had done so on numerous other occasions, Travelers not unnaturally asserts that he was the crew.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Before testing this, however, we face the subsidiary problem of the adequacy of the commissioner\u2019s findings. Although Me-lanson\u2019s status as crew was the principal bone of contention, the commissioner made no reference to the term. The brief filed by the government<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on his behalf in seeking to dispose of the requirement of factual findings, Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c), says that \u201cif\u201d there is any such requirement, Travelers has no standing to raise it because it failed to submit proposed findings or to seek to recommit for further findings. Travelers, however, properly asserted its substantive claims before the commissioner and, having done so, its only appeal from his order and findings lay to the district court by way of a suit for injunction. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b), (d). The commissioner\u2019s obligation under the Act to make findings of basic facts is unconditional. Austin v. O\u2019Keefe, 5 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 930; Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. v. Einbin-der, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 343 F.2d 338; <em>see also </em>United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 1946, 327 U.S. 515, 533, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821; SEC v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626; Northeast Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, 1 Cir., 1964, 331 F.2d 579, 586. We consider the government\u2019s totally unsupported contentions an imposition on our time.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The government argues, further, that the commissioner\u2019s general finding of liability imports all necessary subsidiary findings. The converse, of course, is true; a general finding may be implied if all necessary subsidiary findings have been made. Texas Co. v. R. O'Brien &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 526. But the contention that the commissioner must be taken to have resolved all disputes or inferences in whatever manner was necessary for his general finding is just another way of denying his statutory obligation to find the underlying facts. It is meritless. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the commissioner\u2019s decision is to be affirmed it can be on only one of two bases: either he must have made adequate findings, or the record must be such that the omitted findings were compelled as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The commissioner\u2019s total findings were exceptionally brief, namely, though \u201crequested to pilot the employer\u2019s work-boat LOUISE,\u201d Melanson\u2019s \u201cprimary duties [were] as carpenter-foreman on said date.\u201d This has led to much unproductive discussion. We pass over the government\u2019s constant reference to Me-lanson as a \u201cdriver,\u201d and the LOUISE as a \u201cpickup launch,\u201d meant apparently to suggest that he was a chauffeur of a truck, with the observation that Melan-son as well as the commissioner used seafaring terms, even if counsel dislikes them, and that the Louise was a 40' vessel. In spite of the government\u2019s further protest that Melanson was not performing a crewman\u2019s duties because it did not appear that he filled the gasoline tank, kept the engine in repair, and painted the hull,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we are obliged to observe that he was serving as crew within a normal meaning of the word.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">This, however, is not the end of the journey. We must reject Travelers\u2019 contention that only the employee\u2019s duties at the time of the injury are of any relevance. In dealing with the Longshoremen\u2019s Act this was correct when the problem was one of distinguishing between state and federal jurisdictions. <em>See, e. g. </em>Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 1952, 342 U.S. 187, 190, 72 S.Ct. 216, 96 L.Ed. 205; Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., 1941, 314 U.S. 244, 62 S.Ct. 221, 86 L.Ed. 184, <em>but see generally </em>Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368. In resolving conflicts between two federal remedies, however, the question is one of status not situs. To this inquiry the employee\u2019s other duties, at least those engaged in on the day of the accident, are of significance. <em>See </em>South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 1940, 309 U.S. 251, 260, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732; Long Island R.R. v. Lowe, 2 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 516, 518. Thus in Braen v. Pfeifer Oil Transp. Co., 1959, 361 U.S. 129, 80 S.Ct. 247, 4 L.Ed.2d 191, a seaman regularly employed on, and hence crew of, a barge, was temporarily assigned to lay new decking on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>raft, in the course of which he was injured. Concededly, he was not a member of the crew of the raft. The court said, 361 U.S. at 133, 80 S.Ct. at 250,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201cThe fact that the raft was not presently being used to repair respondent\u2019s barge is in our view immaterial. Petitioner was acting \u2018in the course of his employment\u2019 at the time of the injury, for at that moment he was doing the work of his employer pursuant to his employer\u2019s orders. No more is required by the Jones Act, as the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>case indicates, petitioner being a seaman who was injured as a consequence of the negligence of his employer.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">At least within reasonable limits this principle should work in reverse, to prevent longshoremen from being considered to be seamen because of merely incidental contacts with a vessel. \u201cSeamen,\u201d as used in the Jones Act, and \u201cmembers of the crew\u201d as excluded from the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, are equivalent terms. Swanson v. Marra Bros., 1946, 328 U.S. 1, 66 S.Ct. 869, 90 L.Ed. 1045. The concept, while perhaps not always effectively adhered to, is to separate harbor workers from persons whose livelihood is on the sea. Norton v. Warner Co., 1944, 321 U.S. 565, 570-571, 64 S.Ct. 747; South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, <em>supra </em>at 309 U.S. 256-257, 60 S.Ct. 544. <em>Compare </em>Rotolo v. Halliburton Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 317 F.2d 9, 13, cert. denied 375 U.S. 852, 84 S.Ct. 111, 11 L.Ed.2d 79, <em>with </em>Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 523, 527-528. <em>See also </em>Offshore Co. v. Robison, 5 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 769, 779, 75 A.L.R.2d 1296. Melanson, in our opinion, clearly falls in the former category.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">It is true that Melanson\u2019s relationship to the LOUISE was not a single episode, such as the court hypothesized in Long Island R.R. v. Lowe, <em>supra. See also </em>Wheeler Shipyard v. Lowe, E.D.N.Y., 1935, 13 F.Supp. 863, aff\u2019d, 2 Cir., 82 F.2d 1022. Rather, it was customary for him to pilot her whenever he was aboard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He was aboard, however, not because of attachment to the ship, but only because of the location of his work as a carpenter-foreman. Even while piloting, since he was travelling back from his island carpentry work he was still in the course of that employment. <em>Cf. </em>Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 1943, 318 U.S. 724, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107. In this dichotomy it may be questioned whether he was \u201caboard <em>primarily </em>to aid in navigation,\u201d Carumbo v. Cape Cod S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>S. Co., 1 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 991, 995 (emphasis suppl.), but even if he were we do not regard these occasional and brief dual-purpose episodes as permitting a finding of sufficient attachment to the LOUISE to be considered a member of her crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Since as a matter of law Melanson was not a master or a crew of a vessel within the exclusion clause of the act, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\">. This suit was later dismissed, with prejudice, with Melanson\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 913(a). In such event claim must be made within one year of the last payment. The fact that claim must still be filed is an answer to the government\u2019s contention on behalf of Melanson that Travelers cannot be heard to complain in the case at bar, timely claim or no, because it had actual notice. Actual notice would affect the limitations period if the employer, having such notice, failed to file a proper report of the accident. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 930(a), (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-12\">. The presently material part of this paper reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cI acknowledge and agree that this sum represents the voluntary payment by The Travelers Insurance Company, of benefits for the accident sustained by me on or about the fifth day of January 1960 equal to the amount that would have been payable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Har-borworkers &amp; Longshoremen if said accident had been compensable under that Law in accordance with the provisions of an insurance policy issued by The Travelers Insurance Company to McKie Lighter Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-17\">\u201cIn consideration of the payment for which receipt is hereby acknowledged, I do hereby remise, release and forever discharge, McKie Lighter Company, its successors and assigns and the insurer, The Travelers Insurance Company, from any and all claims, demands, rights or causes of action of whatever kind or nature arising out of said accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. Travelers makes no claim that Melan-son was a \u201cmaster\u201d even though he was in charge of the vessel. \u201cMaster\u201d is a word often signifying important distinctions in function and responsibility, June T., Inc. v. King, 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 404, 406 n. 1; United Geophysical Co. v. Vela, 5 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 816, 818-819, but in this case nothing turns, or should turn, on distinguishing master from crew. <em>See </em>Norton v. Warner Co., 1944, 321 U.S. 565, 571, 64 S.Ct. 747, 88 L.Ed. 931; Diomede v. Lowe, 2 Cir., 1937, 87 F.2d 296, 298, cert. denied Moran Bros. Contracting Co. v. Diomede, 301 U.S. 682, 57 S.Ct. 783, 81 L.Ed. 1340; <em>cf. </em>Warner v. Goltra, 1934, 293 U.S. 155, 162, 55 S.Ct. 46, 79 L.Ed. 254; The Balsa, 3 Cir., 1926, 10 F.2d 408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\">. We use the term government to avoid confusion with what the commissioner himself found or asserted in his decision allowing the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">. Both parties seem to misunderstand the applicability of the statutory presumption of coverage, 33 U.S.O. \u00a7 920(a). Travelers suggests that, although certain evidence apparently favorable to Melan-son was not only corroborated but un-contradieted, the commissioner was not obliged to accept it. Where the evidence for the claimant appeared reasonable on its face and was totally unimpeached, Travelers\u2019 contention is directly contrary to the spirit of the Act embodied in the special presumption. O\u2019Keefe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Assocs., Inc., 1965, 380 U.S. 359, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 13 L.Ed.2d 895. The government, on the other hand, seems to believe that when evidence against the claimant is equally substantial. and undisputed the commissioner could disregard it by an explicit or implicit finding of insubstantiality on the basis of the presumption. This is not the law. <em>See </em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Shea, 5 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 344, 346, cert. denied McCullough v. Travelers Ins. Co., 389 U.S. 1050, 88 S.Ct. 780, 19 L.Ed.2d 842. Once the employer has satisfied his burden of going forward, either in the course of his or the claimant\u2019s case, the presumption falls. Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 1935, 296 U.S. 280, 286, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229; John W. McGrath Corp. v. Hughes, 2 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 314, cert. denied 360 U.S. 931, 79 S.Ct. 1451, 3 L.Ed.2d 1545. We then apply the substantial evidence test to the record as a whole without reference to the presumption. O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., 1951, 340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483; Davis v. Department of Labor, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246; Michigan Mut. Liab. Co. v.
