In essence, the letter asserts that since \u201cany action\u201d violative of the Selective Service Act, regulations, or \u201crelated processes\u201d is patently contrary to the national interest, registrants who commit such actions \u201cshould be denied deferment in the national interest.\u201d In addition, it condemns \u201cillegal activity which interferes with recruiting or causes refusal of [military] duty\u201d as \u201cnot by any stretch of the imagination\u201d compatible with the national interest. It goes on to declare that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-20\">Demonstrations, when they become illegal, have produced and will continue to produce much evidence that relates to the basis for classification and, in some instances, even to violation of the act and regulations. Any material of this nature received in national headquarters or any other segment of the system should be sent to state directors for forwarding to appropriate local boards for their consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-21\">A local board, upon receipt of this information, may reopen the classification of the registrant, classify him anew, and if evidence of violation of the act and regulations is established * * *, also * * * declare the registrant to be a delinquent and * * process him accordingly. This should include all registrants with remaining liability up to 35 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>The letter concludes by urging</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-4\">all elements of the Selective Service System * * * to expedite responsive classification and the processing of delinquents to the greatest possible extent consistent with sound procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Local Board Memorandum No. 85, apparently attached to this letter, instructs local boards to forward any abandoned or mutilated draft card they might receive to the owner\u2019s draft board, and informs the recipient board how it should go about declaring the owner delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The delinquency regulations provide in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-7\">Whenever a registrant has failed to perform any duty or duties required of him under the selective service law [other than certain designated duties] * * *, the local board may declare him to be a delinquent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1642.4(a) (1968); a delinquent registrant may be classified 1-A and, if he is, should be moved to the head of the induction list. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1642.-12, 1642.13, 1631.7 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">The complaint alleges that Congress has in no way deputized selective service members to help courts and prosecutors enforce the law; their business, it says, is to determine a registrant\u2019s eligibility for statutorily defined deferments or exemptions according to such criteria as Congress has established, not according to their own or their Director's view of whether a registrant\u2019s every act is \u201cin support of the national interest.\u201d If Congress did intend draft boards to exercise a law enforcement function, the complaint asserts that such authorization necessarily abridges the freedoms of speech and assembly and imposes punishment without any of the trappings of criminal due process. Accordingly, appellants seek a declaratory judgment voiding the Hershey directive and the delinquency regulations and an injunction against the enforcement of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. However, we think appellants were entitled to partial relief in accordance with the following conclusions :</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">I. Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, which prohibits judicial review of a draft board\u2019s \u201cclassification or processing of any registrant,\u201d is not a bar to this suit <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1107-1109).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">II. A. An allegation that the general threat of enforcement of a law or official policy chills the exercise of protected First Amendment freedoms does not automatically establish the existence of a justiciable case or controversy, but in some circumstances such an allegation maybe sufficient <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1110-1121).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">B. There is no justiciable case or controversy with respect to (1) the delinquency regulations or that part of the Hershey directive which purports to construe them <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1116-1117), or (2) Local Board Memorandum No. 85 <em>(infra, </em>p. 1117), but there is a justicia-ble controversy with respect to (3) the remaining portion of the directive, envisaging reclassification on account of protest activity which is not within the scope of the delinquency regulations <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1117-1119).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">C. The appellant organizations, as student political associations substantially committed to anti-war or anti-draft activities, have standing to bring this suit, since they and their members are vulnerable to the directive\u2019s chilling effect on protected protest <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1119-1120).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-15\">III. That portion of the Hershey directive which purports to authorize draft boards, independently of the delinquency regulations, to deny deferments or exemptions on the basis of illegal protest activity is itself unauthorized, and the local boards have no such authority <em>(infra, </em>pp. 1121-1124).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>I. Section 10(b) (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act provides in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-5\">no judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution * * * after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) (Supp. III, 1965-67). Appellants carefully note that they are neither seeking \u201creview * * * of the classification or processing of any registrant,\u201d nor contesting .any classification action of \u201clocal boards, appeal boards, or the President.\u201d Instead, they have mounted a direct attack on administrative regulations and an official policy, and with one exception<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> none of them even claims to have been classified or processed by a draft board.</p>\n<p id=\"ASz\">Since appellants\u2019 complaint does not fall within the literal terms of Section 10(b) (3), the question is whether it is encompassed by the section\u2019s rationale. The legislative history<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> discloses three interrelated purposes to be served by this provision: (1) to reaffirm existing law; (2) to reverse recent court holdings apparently disregarding that law; and (3) to prevent \u201clitigious interruption of military manpower procurement.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that none of these purposes precludes prompt judicial review of the legality of announced criteria for classification, provided such review is otherwise proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-18\">(1) The \u201cexisting law\u201d which Congress approved is the doctrine that a draft registrant must exhaust his internal administrative remedies to the point of reporting for induction before he can challenge the legality of his classification or processing in court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This doctrine rests on the provision ascribing \u201cfinality\u201d to local board decisions on such matters,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>not apply to litigation involving no challenge to local board actions. Such litigation may raise questions of general law, to be considered <em>infra, </em>concerning the presence of a justiciable case or controversy, but it does not affront the finality provision of the Selective Service Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">(2) Congress did not say which court holdings it sought to expunge by way of Section 10(b) (3),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but appellee refers us to Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Townsend v. Zimmerman,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Ex parte Fabiani.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In each of these cases, the court reviewed the classification action of Selective Service boards even though the registrant had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The language of Section 10(b) (3) can readily be construed to overrule these cases without operating as a bar to the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\"> Moreover, it may be that Congress could not overrule the <em>Wolff </em>decision without running afoul of the First Amendment. In <em>Wolff, </em>the appellant registrants had been reclassified as delinquents because of their participation in a draft board sit-in demonstration protesting the war in Vietnam. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals felt obliged to \u201cintervene at once\u201d in the processing of these registrants in order to prevent irreparable constitutional injury, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-14\">the effect of the [challenged] reclassification * * * [was] immediately to curtail the exercise of First Amendment rights * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">372 F.2d 817, 823-24. Appellants conclude that since the Hershey directive similarly threatens to inhibit protest protected by the First Amendment, Section 10(b) (3) could not constitutionally bar their suit. In Clark v. Gabriel,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Supreme Court recently held Section 10(b) (3) constitutional as applied to preclude interlocutory review of a draft board\u2019s determination that a registrant did not qualify as a conscientious objector. However, as Justice Douglas\u2019s concurring opinion makes clear, this de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>cisi\u00f3n does not remove the doubts raised by <em>Wolff </em>as to whether the Section could preclude preinduction review of a classification ostensibly based on protected protest activities,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and these doubts argue in favor of a narrow construction in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">(3) Finally, appellants\u2019 suit does not constitute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-6\">the kind of \u201clitigious interruptions of procedures to provide necessary military manpower\u201d * * * which Congress sought to prevent when it enacted \u00a7 10(b) (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">Clark v. Gabriel, <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at 258-259, 89 S.Ct. at 426. Congress and the courts have been understandably concerned to avoid serious interference with efficient recruitment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The exhaustion doctrine codified in Section 10 (b) (3) protects against the danger that multitudes of draftees can delay their induction by ill-founded judicial challenges. The inescapable price of that protection is the possibility that some well-founded challenges must be postponed or perhaps abandoned. But we cannot assume that Congress sought deliberately to insulate illegal or unconstitutional practices from judicial review as an end in itself.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 suit, which does not attack any specific classification and thus does not interrupt the recruitment process, is nicely calculated to interfere \u2014 if at all \u2014 only with those practices which are found to be unlawful. We do not think it is barred by Section 10(b) (3).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>II. The Case or Controversy Requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Since this suit does not challenge the \u201cclassification or processing of any registrant,\u201d there is some doubt as to whether it presents a justiciable case or controversy within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution. Having scaled the statutory barrier, appellants find themselves obliged to argue that the chilling effect of the Hershey directive and the delinquency regulations on the exercise of their First Amendment rights in itself renders their suit justiciable. Accordingly, we must determine whether (A) a suit by persons claiming only that they are subject to such a chill can ever be justiciable, and (B) whether, if so, we may adjudicate such a suit against the Hershey directive and the delinquency regulations. If we may, there will then remain the question of (C) whether the present appellants are in fact vulnerable to the chill they complain of.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">A. <em>A Chilling Effect as Giving Rise to a Case or Controversy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">As the Supreme Court has only recently reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-7\">\u201cThe federal courts established pursuant to Article III of the Constitution do not render advisory opinions. For adjudication of constitutional issues, \u2018concrete legal issues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions,\u2019 are requisite. * * *\u201d * * * \u201cThe difference between an abstract question and a \u2018controversy\u2019 contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 108, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">Two general principles relevant in determining whether a dispute asserted in a declaratory judgment action has \u201csufficient immediacy and reality\u201d are reasonably clear. The first is that a plaintiff need not invariably wait until he has been successfully prosecuted, dismissed, denied a license, or otherwise directly subjected to the force of a law or policy before he may challenge it in court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The second is that the mere existence of a statute, regulation, or articulated policy is ordinarily not enough to sustain a judicial challenge, even by one who reasonably believes that the law applies to him and will be enforced against him according to its terms.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>The leading ease applying these two principles is United Public Workers v. Mitchell<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in which various federal employees requested the Court to declare unconstitutional the provision of the Hatch Act forbidding them to take \u201cany active part in political management or in political campaigns.\u201d 330 U.S. 75, 78, 67 S.Ct. 556, 558 (1947). The Court spread the justiciability question along a continuum ranging between \u201ca general threat by officials to enforce those laws which they are charged to administer\u201d and a \u201cdirect threat of punishment against a named [party] * * * for a completed act.\u201d Suits predicated on threats nearer the \u201cgeneral\u201d pole are not justiciable; suits nearer the direct pole are. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 67 S.Ct. at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Accordingly, the Court refused to entertain the suits of employees who alleged only that they wished to engage in political activities of the kind clearly prohibited by the terms of the Act, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-6\">As these appellants are classified employees, they have a right superior to the generality of citizens * * *, but the facts of their personal interest in their civil rights, of the general threat of possible interference with those rights by the Civil Service Commission under its rules, if specified things are done by appellants, does not make [sic] a justiciable case or controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 89, 67 S.Ct. at 564. In contrast, the Court found a justiciable controversy in the complaint of an employee who had engaged in the prohibited conduct and who had pending against him an order of removal for this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-14\">At first blush appellants\u2019 suit appears to rely on a prototype of the \u201cgeneral threat\u201d for which <em>Mitchell </em>denies justi-ciability. The question is to what extent the fact that the mere existence of the challenged policies may exert a First Amendment chilling effect makes this case an exception to the <em>Mitchell </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-15\">It is noteworthy that a suit brought before a challenged law has actually been applied to the plaintiff potentially involves two contingencies: whether the plaintiff will in fact act contrary to the apparent command of the law, and whether the law will be applied to him if he does. In some eases, \u201cgeneral threats\u201d do not confer justiciability because it is not clear that the law\u2019s threat actually applies to the plaintiff or his conduct.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In others, however, as in <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>the generality of the threat does not significantly detract from its certainty. There, the difficulty must be the possibility that, for all his protestations, the plaintiff may not break the law after all.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the typical case, federal courts ignore statements of intent and wait for the accomplished fact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-16\">The peculiar feature of suits alleging a First Amendment chilling effect, however, is that if the allegation is correct, immediate and real injury is done to the plaintiff\u2019s interests if he <em>does not </em>speak or act as he says he wants to. In addition, this injury may result from the threat of enforcement itself, even if that threat never materializes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is possible that in such cases courts may rely on a credible threat of enforcement and plausible allegations of intent or desire to engage in the threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>activities as sufficient predicates for justiciability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">The potential chilling effect of vague and overbroad statutes has overcome many of the discretionary rules of judicial abstention which fortify the case or controversy requirement,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> including the federal abstention doctrine, Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); the exhaustion of remedies doctrine, Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, <em>supra; </em>and the denial of standing to raise the rights of third parties, United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21-22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 432-433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97-98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940); <em>cf. </em>Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Although the Supreme Court has yet to trace the implications of these decisions for the case or controversy requirement, in <em>Wolff </em>the Second Circuit Court of Appeals invoked <em>Dombrowski </em>to support its finding of a justiciable controversy predicated on a First Amendment chill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">In <em>Dombrowski, </em>the Supreme Court enjoined a state criminal prosecution because the threat of prosecution impaired the appellants\u2019 freedom of expression. The Wolff appellants contested the validity of their reclassification by a local draft board. The court said that ordinarily such a claim would not be ripe for adjudication until a registrant had received and responded to an induction order, since reclassification itself is not a sufficient injury.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, it held this rule inapplicable where the reclassification resulted from the registrants\u2019 protest activity, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-10\">there can be no doubt that the threat of receiving a I-A classification upon voicing dissent from our national policies has an immediate impact on the behavior of appellants and others similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">372 F.2d at 823. Since the appellants had in fact been reclassified, and since the court found that \u201cno purpose would be served by relegating [them] * * * to their administrative remedies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 825, <em>Wolff </em>does not stand for the broad proposition that any established governmental policy which has a chilling effect may without more create a justiciable controversy. But its language and its express reliance on the <em>Dombrowski </em>rationale would, if carried to their logical conclusion, sustain that contention.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>Thus, it appears that suits alleging injury in the form of a chilling effect may be more readily justiciable than comparable suits not so affected with a First Amendment interest<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Nonetheless, for a number of reasons we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>persuaded that every plaintiff who alleges a First Amendment chilling effect and shivers in court has thereby established a case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">(1) The <em>Mitchell </em>case is itself a formidable barrier to any such conclusion. The employees who were not allowed to challenge the Hatch Act had plausibly complained of a veritable freezing effect on some of their political activities, which lie at the very core of the First Amendment\u2019s intended protection.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell </em>does, of course, antedate the discovery and development of the chilling effect doctrine, and it has almost certainly been undermined to some extent by changing philosophies of the judicial function.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is fair to say that in First Amendment cases <em>Mitchell </em>cannot now be read as an absolute bar to adjudication based on \u201cgeneral threats of enforcement.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But it is difficult to say in the teeth of <em>Mitchell </em>that <em>any </em>First Amendment chilling effect will do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">(2) Appellant\u2019s proposition that every official chill is a justiciable controversy would do considerable violence to the long-accepted allocation of roles among the several branches of the federal government. In view of the range of statutes, regulations, and policies which arguably chill protected expression, it would convert the courts into de facto Councils of Revision over a substantial body of legislative and executive rules, ensuring immediate judicial review without regard to the actual application of the rules in practice. A Council of Revision might or might not be inherently a bad idea, and in the First Amendment area there are at least some things to be said in its favor, but it is well-settled that in general the federal courts are not such councils.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This principle is so venerable as to suggest caution in carving out an apparent major exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">(3) Moreover, First Amendment chills may be disembodied from any identifiable legal context. The Hershey directive has enough of the trappings of formality, specificity, normative content, and apparent authoritativeness to remove the need for searching inquiries as to its precise legal standing. But the facts that it is contained only in a letter and made public only through a press release, and that it is not promulgated through any established rule-making procedure, illustrate the potential consequences of allowing complaints against every official breath of cold air. A speech or an announcement by General Hershey, or a personal plea from him urging local boards to reclassify war protesters, could cast nearly as heavy a pall over dissent as the issuance of the directive itself; but a court would pause long and searchingly before taking such chilling remarks as a sufficient predicate for a declaratory judgment that he had misstated the law or that the law he had correctly stated is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">(4) One result of adjudicating where-ever there is a chill may well be to require resolution of complex questions without the beneficial focus afforded by adversary argument trained upon a concrete factual dispute. To permit adjudication of a legal question or dispute solely on account of its chill is in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>to concede that the substantive issues apart from the chill are themselves not ripe for adjudication. It follows that early vindication of First Amendment rights, however desirable in principle, is not without its costs in terms of the wisdom of the adjudications made incident thereto.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Unquestionably, some such costs are the inescapable price of effectively protecting the right to dissent. But we think the justiciability of public policies which chill protected expression must still depend to some extent upon a cost-benefit analysis addressed to the particular controversy before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">In sum, we must reconcile the newly recognized urgency of prompt protection for frail First Amendment interests with the traditional policies underlying the case or controversy requirement. We must do so in uncharted waters, certain only that where there is only a \u201cgeneral threat of enforcement,\u201d not every chilling effect on protected expression resulting from the threat creates a justiciable controversy. Cognizant of the Supreme Court\u2019s expressed reluctance to adopt any \u201cprecise test\u201d for a case or controversy,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> we conclude that we should decide the justiciability of suits predicated on alleged chilling effects on a case-by-case basis. In determining whether a given chilling effect is sufficient, it would seem relevant to consider <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the severity and scope of the alleged chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms, (2) the likelihood of other opportunities to vindicate such First Amendment rights as may be infringed with reasonable promptness, and (3) the nature of the issues which a full adjudication on the merits must resolve, and the need for factual referents in order properly to define and narrow the issues. These considerations become relevant, of course, only if the plaintiffs plausibly allege that they are in fact vulnerable to the alleged chilling effect. Assuming that the present appellants meet this threshold requirement, we turn now to examine their challenge to the Hershey directive and the delinquency regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">B. <em>The Hershey Directive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">In considering whether the complaint against the Hershey directive is justiciable, we need not determine the precise legal status of the directive. General Hershey is authorized by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.1 (1968) both</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-10\">(a) To prescribe such rules and regulations as he shall deem necessary for the administration of the Selective Service System. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-12\">(b) To issue such public notices, orders, and instructions as shall be necessary for carrying out the functions of the Selective Service System.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">It matters little whether his directive is a \u201crule,\u201d an \u201corder,\u201d a set of \u201cinstructions,\u201d or only a sui generis \u201cdirective.\u201d Whatever it is in law, it purports to be an authoritative declaration of policy issued for the guidance of the System\u2019s line officers. Neither they nor the average would-be war protester whose destinies they control are likely to suspect that, for all its official pretensions, it is really only a reflective letter from an interested citizen, and that its exhortation to \u201cexpedite responsive classification,\u201d is nothing but the personal prayer of a venerable patriarch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-14\">The substance of the directive is divisible into three parts: one part defining the authority of local draft boards under the delinquency regulations, another part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>(Local Board Memorandum No. 85) specifically applying the delinquency procedure to registrants who mutilate or abandon their draft cards, and a third part asserting the draft boards\u2019 authority independently of the delinquency regulations to deny defendants to otherwise eligible registrants who engage in various illegal anti-war activities. Since the considerations governing the justiciability of these three parts are not identical, we discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">1. <em>The delinquency regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">With respect to the delinquency regulations in general, the directive states that \u201cif evidence of violation of the act and regulations is established,\u201d a local board may \u201cdeclare the registrant a delinquent and * * * process him accordingly.\u201d This statement amplifies the provision of the delinquency regulations authorizing draft boards to declare delinquent a registrant who \u201chas failed to perform any duty * * * required of him under the selective service law. * * * \u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1642.4 (a) (1968).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Appellants attack the delinquency regulations both as written and as authoritatively construed by the directive. Either way, however, their attack prima facie alleges</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-6\">no threat of interference * * * with [their] rights * * * beyond that implied by the existence of the law and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">United Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra, 330 U.S. at 91, 67 S.Ct. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">We think the alleged chilling effect of these regulations is insufficient to render them justiciable without a more specific threat of enforcement. The delinquency regulations do not themselves regulate expression. What chilling effect they may have derives from the provisions of the selective service law they are applied to enforce, and at least some of these provisions apparently do not in any way inhibit protected expression.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> If, upon scanning the draft law, we should find a provision that does raise First Amendment problems, the chill attributable to the threat of its enforcement through the delinquency regulations would be barely noticeable beside the frigid blast from the severe criminal penalties attached to the offending provisions.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The mere possibility that more prosecutors than draft boards will abstain from enforcement is thin ice on which to rest the kind of chill that hardens general threats into justiciable controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">We think appellants\u2019 complaint against the delinquency regulations lies rather\u2014 if at all \u2014 against particular provisions of the draft law which threaten First Amendment injury. The added chill of anticipated enforcement through the delinquency regulations would be a factor to be considered in determining the jus-ticiability of a challenge to such a provision. The delinquency portion of the present complaint, however, neither demonstrates a grave chill nor focuses on a narrowly-defined legal question. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>ingly, it does not present a justiciable case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">2. <em>Local Board Memorandum No. 85</em></p>\n<p id=\"AeBa\">In Local Board Memorandum No. 85, the Hershey directive specifically endorses invocation of the delinquency regulations against registrants who abandon or mutilate their draft cards, and the affidavits attached to appellants\u2019 complaint indicate that the regulations are in fact being so applied. Mutilation is prohibited by Section 462(b) of the Act, and abandonment results in a violation of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1617.1 (1968), which requires a registrant to have his draft card in his personal possession at all times. Appellants\u2019 complaint against the Local Board Memorandum may reasonably be construed as a First Amendment challenge to these two provisions and specifically to their enforcement by means of the delinquency regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">The substantive provisions barring mutilation and requiring possession might on their face be thought to pose substantial First Amendment questions, for burning up and turning in draft cards are now time-honored gestures of dissent from official policy. However, in United States v. O\u2019Brien,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the Supreme Court upheld a severe sentence for incendiary mutilation. It follows that the threat to enforce the mutilation provision by a declaration of delinquency does not infringe First Amendment rights: the threatened conduct is clearly defined,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and severe punishment of conduct so defined is constitutional; ergo, General Hershey\u2019s intent to punish it in his own way, even if illegal for other reasons, works no First Amendment injury. While <em>O\u2019Brien </em>was not specifically concerned with the possession regulation, the Court\u2019s rationale plainly protects the First Amendment flanks of that regulation as well.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Since Local Board Memorandum No. 85 thus does not chill <em>protected </em>conduct, the asserted predicate for justiciability disappears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">3. <em>The deferment policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"acm-dedup-0\">The remaining portion of the Hershey directive apparently announces a policy of denying relief from the obligation of military service to those who engaged in illegal conduct which does not violate the Selective Service Act or regulations. The relevant text states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-12\">the military obligation for liable age groups is universal and * * * deferments are given only when they serve the national interest * * *. It follows that * * * illegal activity which interferes with recruiting or causes refusal of duty in the military or naval forces could not by any stretch of the imagination be construed as being in support of the national interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aur-dedup-2\">It goes on to say that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-14\">demonstrations, when they become illegal, have produced and will continue to produce much evidence that relates to the basis for classification. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-15\">A local board, upon receipt of [such evidence] * * * may reopen the classification of the registrant and classify him anew * * *, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>shall, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, provide for the deferment * * * of persons satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college [or] university,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arv-dedup-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>and concludes with an injunction to \u201cexpedite responsive classification * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>to the greatest possible extent consistent with sound procedure.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">For all that appears, this declaration of war against anti-war protesters springs full-grown from the head of General Hershey, without benefit of reference to any provision of the Act or regulations. In this sense, it may be something more than a general threat to enforce the law. In addition, each of the considerations which bear on the appropriateness of an exception to the <em>Mitchell </em>rule point toward the \u201cimmediacy and reality,\u201d and also the specificity of the First Amendment interests at stake. Golden v. Zwickler, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">(a) The deferment policy is expressly directed only at \u201cillegal\u201d demonstrations and interference, although at least one local board has apparently failed to notice that limitation.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> A complaint that illegal and unprotected conduct is being chilled has, of course, no special claim to prompt adjudication.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But the Hershey directive neither said nor meant that war protesters were to be reclassified only after a conviction for violation of a statute which the courts have found to be consistent with the First Amendment. Thus, it may deter not merely validly proscribed conduct, but any protest activity which a registrant could plausibly expect his draft board to think unprotected or illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">It is no reflection on the competence or integrity of selective service personnel to observe that they are ill-equipped to determine questions of law as delicate and complex as those commonly raised by anti-war protest activity. Draft boards do not employ judicial procedures, and their members often have no legal training. Rightly or not, registrants are also likely to have less confidence in the constitutional sensitivity of their draft board, especially in the area of war dissent, than in that of the prosecutor and the courts. These considerations loom particularly large in the light of the frequent vagueness and overbreadth of the myriad local laws and ordinances which are susceptible of application against protest activities and which cannot conceivably all be subjected to judicial review in the foreseeable future. As the cases arising out of civil rights demonstrations have shown, some of these hitherto untested laws may well be unconstitutional on their face. Many others undoubtedly require a judicious exercise of prosecutorial discretion or a narrowing construction before they can survive First Amendment scrutiny. The resultant uncertainty concerning the legality of various forms of dissent imposes some chill on protected protest even without the Hershey directive. But by entrusting to draft boards effective power to decide the hard legal and constitutional questions for themselves, the directive seriously compounds this chilling effect on protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">The directive\u2019s deferment policy also adds to the deterrents to legal protest by raising the price of a wrong guess as to the legality of particular protest activity or of a failure to foresee the course an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>initially legal demonstration may take. Participation in most lawful demonstrations unavoidably involves at least some risk that the protest will in fact get out of hand or that the authorities will decide that it has done so; innocent participants may then be penalized along with the rest. The directive adds a new and\u2014 at least in the eyes of many protesters\u2014 a more severe penalty for such unintentional illegality. Draft eligible males who are willing to run the risk of prosecution for a misdemeanor in order to make a protest might still be intimidated by the threat of a I-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Accordingly, we think the deferment policy works a pronounced chilling effect on legal or protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">(b) If draft boards in fact effectuate the Hershey directive, it may be exceedingly difficult to challenge the legality of their action. The breadth of the draft board\u2019s unreviewable discretion is legendary. While the law may be narrower than the legend, both Congress and the courts have forbidden judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a classification decision. Thus, Section 10(b) (3) provides that even in a prosecution for refusal of induction, the court\u2019s inquiry shall extend to the draft board\u2019s jurisdiction \u201conly when there is no basis in fact for the classification assigned.\u201d <em>See also </em>Estep v. United States, <em>supra. </em>This provision raises the possibility that a classification assigned for an illicit reason is unreviewable whenever the draft board can point to some other possible supporting ground under the general language of the classification provisions. Furthermore, even if the statute is not \u00e1 bar to review of such classifications, a registrant may have serious difficulty in discovering or proving the actual basis of his draft board\u2019s action. Thus, if a complaint such as that of appellants does not lie, the chill of the Hershey directive\u2019s deferment policy may spread indefinitely without any judicial determination of its legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">(c) Unlike the directive\u2019s threat of delinquency proceedings, which applies even-handedly to all violations of the Selective Service law, the deferment policy expressly singles out from the infinite range of illegal conduct specific kinds of illegal acts \u2014 namely those commonly performed by war protesters \u2014 for special treatment. The result is both to impart an element of specificity to the threat of enforcement and to accentuate its potential chilling effect on protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">(d) Finally, the issues raised by this aspect of appellant\u2019s complaint are narrow and clearly defined. Appellants question the authority for and the constitutionality on its face of a simple and specific policy. Neither of these issues turns on the way in which the policy is applied. Thus, a delay in adjudication holds no promise of \u201ca better case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">For these reasons, we hold that, given a complaining party whose First Amendment rights are chilled, a suit against that portion of the Hershey directive which purports to authorize denial of deferments for illegal activity not covered by the delinquency regulations presents a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">C. <em>Standing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">To establish that there is a case or controversy <em>as to them, </em>appellants must be vulnerable to the chilling effect of the justiciable portion of the Hershey directive.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The individual appellants sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>for themselves and for fellow students \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d The appellant organizations also assert both their own interests and those of their members. And one of these organizations (the National Student Association) purports to speak for \u201call students in institutions of higher learning in America.\u201d Nonetheless, ap-pellee earnestly contends that not a single member of this vast legion of plaintiffs has standing to sue because none has alleged that he or those he represents are liable to be drafted.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">It is true that a particular male student might be physically unfit or might already have fulfilled his military obligation. But it is hardly open to dispute that most male college students are draft-eligible. Since the appellant organizations are all associations of college students, their memberships include vast numbers of men who are both subject to the draft and presently deferred from immediate service. Nor is it any secret that the bulk of the nation\u2019s war protesters come from the ranks of college students. College students are in fact the segment of the population most obviously vulnerable to General Hershey\u2019s threat of reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">The appellant organizations are all student political associations. As organizations, they have been critical of the draft, or the war in Vietnam, or both; and they have been substantially involved in protest activity. With respect to the Hershey directive, their organizational interests and those of at least many of their members coincide. Any chilling effect on the protected protests of their members is at the same time a damper on their organizational protest activities.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We think they have standing to assert both their own First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>Amendment interests<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and those of their members.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">We find it unnecessary to consider whether the individual appellants have standing to represent their fellow students \u2014 especially because, as we conclude hereafter, injunctive relief is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">III. Legality of the Hershey Directive\u2019s Deferment Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AZkX\">Although appellants, who moved for summary judgment below, now seek reversal on the merits, appellee has chosen to rest on procedural contentions; and he does not suggest that any disputed issues of fact make summary judgment inappropriate. Nonetheless, we would be reluctant to decide the merits if the legal question were complex or uncertain. It is neither. And since its resolution does not turn on any issue of fact, no purpose would be served by remanding to permit initial consideration by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Insofar as the individual classification decisions of the Selective Service System are unreviewable in theory or in practice, the Hershey directive\u2019s deferment policy establishes the System as the final arbiter of the legality of protest activities under the law and the validity of laws regulating protest under the Constitution. Such authority vested in draft boards could itself survive First Amendment challenge only if required by an imperious public interest that could be served by no means which would sweep less broadly over legitimate dissent.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Since prosecution of illegal and unprotected conduct under the criminal laws, subject to traditional procedural safeguards and to judicial scrutiny of the laws themselves, is a narrower alternative means to the ends served by the Hershey policy, that policy appears to be constitutionally unsound. In any event, the constitutional doubts are sufficiently grave that it could be authorized only by the most explicit statutory language. And far from containing such language, the Selective Service Act appears to exclude protest activity as a relevant basis for classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-17\">The exemption and deferment provisions of the Act vary in the breadth of discretion they accord the President and, through him, the Selective Service System. In some cases, they make no mention of any presidential discretion. For example, the statute provides unequivocally that ordained ministers \u201cshall be exempt.\u201d 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(g) (1964). Similarly, it directs that nothing in it \u201cshall be construed\u201d to require military service by conscientious objectors. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(j) (Supp. III, 1965-67). In other cases, the President is required to defer a specified class of registrants, but is expressly given discretion to implement this requirement by prescribing \u201crules and regulations.\u201d Thus, Section 456(h) (1) says that he</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>and declares that such student deferments, once granted, \u201cshall continue\u201d until the student graduates, backslides academically, or grows too old, or until the President makes a finding that the needs of the Armed Forces require their terminaton. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(h) (1) (Supp. III, 1965-67). Still other provisions define classes of registrants the President may, but need not, defer according to \u201csuch rules and regulations as he may prescribe,\u201d if he finds their designated activities to be \u201cnecessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest.\u201d 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456 (h) (2) (Supp. III, 1965-67).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The justiciable portion of the Hershey directive purports to authorize reclassification, independently of the delinquency regulations, of any registrant who engages in illegal protest activity. We have denominated this portion the \u201cdeferment policy\u201d in order to distinguish it from the policy of reclassification pursuant to the delinquency regulations. There is, however, no reason to believe that the \u201cdeferment policy\u201d intends any distinction between \u201cdeferments\u201d and \u201cexemptions.\u201d It asserts without qualification that, upon receipt of evidence relating to the basis of \u201cclassification\u201d arising out of illegal demonstrations, a local board \u201cmay reopen the classification of the registrant and classify him anew. * * <em>*\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>52</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This policy is in blatant conflict with the statutory language prescribing mandatory relief from military obligation for ministers and conscientious objectors.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">The conflict is only somewhat less apparent where the President is specifically given discretion to prescribe \u201crules and regulations,\u201d or to deny deferments to an entire class.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The clear pattern of the Act is to define classes of persons whose deferment or \u201cexemption\u201d Congress has concluded either is in fact, or may be, in the national interest, and to allow the President more or less discretion to decide who falls within each designated class. It would do extreme violence to this pattern to hold that the President by regulation \u2014 much less the Selective Service Director by \u201cdirec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>tive\u201d \u2014 may exclude from the statutory class persons who plainly fall within the contours Congress has defined. Such a holding would license the Selective Service System to defeat rather than to implement the apparent Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Nor does the fact that local boards are given \u201cfinal\u201d authority to determine a registrant\u2019s eligibility for a class which Congress has directed the President to defer mean that such boards may use any criteria of membership that they or their Director may think proper. So construed, the statute would make the boards \u201cfreewheeling agencies meting out their [own] brand of justice * *, \u201d and would raise \u201cserious questions\u201d as to whether Congress could delegate such power without setting any limiting standards. Oestereich v. Selective Service System, <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at 237, 89 S.Ct. 414. We think the test of eligibility for any deferment or exemption to be applied by the local boards is the definition of the deferrable class prescribed by Congress, as supplemented by regulations reasonably and consistently lending precision to that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">General Hershey\u2019s asserted authority rests on the following syllogism: \u201cdeferments are given only when they serve the national interest\u201d; \u201cillegal activity which interferes with recruiting or causes refusal of duty * * * \u201d is not in the national interest; therefore \u201cit follows that\u201d such activity may deprive a registrant of his deferment. Even if both premises were conceded, the conclusion does not \u201cfollow.\u201d That some of a man\u2019s activities are contrary to the national interest has no necessary bearing on the value to the nation of the activities or pursuits for which he was deferred. The research activities of a doctor or atomic scientist are no less in the national interest because he also cheats on his income tax, distributes pornography, beats his wife, or marches for peace. Until Congress says that deferments are conditioned on good behavior we must assume that it meant to defer those who engage in the activities it declared to be in the national interest, and not only those whose general deportment is above a draft board\u2019s reproach.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">Accordingly, we hold that the deferment policy announced in the Hershey directive is unauthorized and contrary to the law. <em>Cf. </em>Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, <em>supra. </em>Aside from violations covered by the delinquency regulations \u2014 the legality of which is not properly before us \u2014 a registrant\u2019s protest activities are not to be considered in determining his selective service classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">For many reasons we do not, however, grant the requested injunction to accompany this declaratory judgment. The practical problems of enforcing an injunction against every local and appellate draft board are staggering. In view of the wide and largely \u201cfinal\u201d discretion enjoyed by these boards, it will often be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>impossible to detect any use of illicit criteria. Indeed, we do not even know that the offending portion of the directive is in fact being widely applied. Moreover, respect for the integrity of a coordinate branch of government argues for judicial restraint. Finally, we have no reason to believe that draft board members would act contrary to the law as judicially declared.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">We remand to the District Court for entry of a declaratory judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">.

The invalidation of a particular draft board practice would, of course, interfere with subsequent processing under that practice. While we do not suppose that Congress wished to perpetuate unlawful practices, it might conceivably have been concerned about possible disruptions of lawful practices caused by mistaken lower court judgments. Pending reversal on appeal, such erroneous judicial invalidations could interfere with the processing of registrants. However, to preclude this possibility, Congress would have to bar <em>post-</em>induction review of selective service policies as well as pre-induction challenges, since an invalidation made in a post-induction suit will have precisely the same effect as if it were made prior to induction. Congress did not and almost certainly could not forbid all review of the legality of official classification criteria. Thus, it seems clear that the proscribed \u201clitigious interruptions\u201d are those which threaten delay of inductions pending review of challenges to presumptively valid individual classifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1165-18\">.

Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). It may be, as appellants contend, that the delinquency regulations themselves \u2014 held lawless under <em>Oestereich </em>when in conflict with express statutory provisions \u2014 are likewise completely unauthorized and thus subject to challenge under the <em>Oestereich </em>rationale.

Tlie Supreme Court has found the policies underlying the case or controversy requirement so salutary that it has implemented them by numerous additional non-constitutional rules of justiciability \u25a0which guard the approaches to the constitutional citadel. <em>See </em>Flast v.

It is unclear whether the court thought this rule involved constitutional considerations, or a discretionary ripeness doctrine, or only the peculiar provisions of the Selective Service Act. It discusses the rule under the general heading of \u201cjusticiability,\u201d 372 F.2d at 823-825, and refers on one occasion to the presence vel non of a \u201cjusticiable controversy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 823, but does not mention Article III. Arguably, the constitutional requirements have been satisfied when a complaining registrant has been reclassified, and the remaining requirements of exhaustion of administrative remedies result from a judicial policy of encouraging administrative bodies to correct their own errors and from the finality provision of the Selective Service Act, <em>supra </em>note 8. Such discretionary rules might be readily displaced by First Amendment considerations. The thrust of the court\u2019s opinion, however, is that reclassification is not a sufficient injury to confer justiciability, but that a First Amendment chilling effect is.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1168-13\">. In <em>Dombrowshi, </em>where the appellants had been subjected to arrest, searches and seizures, and destruction of records, where there had been repeated official announce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>ments of intent to apply the statute to them, and where a grand jury had been summoned to return indictments, no issue was raised as to the presence of a justi-ciable controversy under Article III. The issue was rather whether the federal courts had to abstain pending the results of a state court criminal prosecution which might have narrowed the statute so as not to apply to the appellants. However, the <em>Wolff </em>court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avv-dedup-1\">It has been held repeatedly that the mere threat of the imposition of unconstitutional sanctions will cause immediate and irreparable injury to the free exercise of rights as fragile and sensitive to suppression as the freedoms of speech and assembly and the right to vote. * * * Since it is the mere threat of unconstitutional sanctions which precipitates the injury, the courts must intervene at once to vindicate the threatened liberties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKb7\">Dombrowski v.

Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 89 S.Ct. 956 (1969), is not to the contrary. There, the appellant sought to void on First Amendment grounds a statute forbidding distribution of anonymous political pamphlets in connection with public elections. He had been convicted of violating this statute during the 1964 congressional election campaign, but his conviction was subsequently overturned in the state court on non-constitutional grounds. The court read his complaint as alleging only that he wished to distribute such literature in any future campaign of the particular Congressman he had attacked in 1964. Since that Congressman had since been appointed to a 14-year term on the New York Supreme Court, the Court held that the appellant\u2019s complaint no longer alleged a \u201clive grievance\u201d and therefore did not present a justiciable controversy. The Court did not suggest that a First Amendment chilling effect could not present a justiciable controversy. Rather it held, in effect, that the complaint showed no likelihood of any chilling effect on the plaintiff at bar. And since he had no substantial interest of his own in obtaining an adjudication of the constitutionality of the statute, he had no standing to raise the interests of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-14\">That Golden v. Zwickler was intended to stand for no more than its exceedingly narrow holding is confirmed by the Court\u2019s decision in Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1, barely two months later. There, persons who had unsuccessfully sought a place on the ballot as independent presidential electors from the State of Illinois in the 1968 presidential election challenged the statute under which they had been denied certification. There was no allegation that the plaintiffs intended to try again in any future election. Since the 1968 election had been held, it was urged that no justiciable controversy remained. <em>See id. </em>at 89 S.Ct. 1493 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart). But the Court summarily dismissed this argument, saying only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtS\">[Wjhile the 1968 election is over, the burden which MacDougall v.

The problem is therefore \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d * * *. The need for its resolution thus reflects a continuing controversy in the federal-state area where our \u201cone man-one vote\u201d decisions have thrust.

Constitutional standing is an aspect of the case or controversy requirement. Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra </em>note 26, 392 U.S. at 98-99, 88 S.Ct. 1942. The standing question, insofar as it rises to constitutional dimensions, is whether the plaintiff has at stake a sufficient interest so as to create a case or controversy <em>as to Mm. </em>Thus, a chilling effect which amounts to a justiciable injury confers standing to challenge the source of the chill on any person who plausibly alleges that he is chilled. We think non-constitutional standing doctrines must yield to the policy of prompt vindication of First Amendment rights. <em>Cf. </em>Dombrowski v.

An affidavit attached to appellants\u2019 brief does indicate incidentally that one appellant, Reverend Bruce Tischler, is eligible for the draft and has, in the past, engaged in active protest against the war in Vietnam. However, Tischler\u2019s induction was stayed pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, <em>supra </em>note 18. Though <em>Oestereich </em>dealt specifically with the delinquency regulations, its holding that a ministerial exemption such as Tischler previously enjoyed may not be removed by draft boards for reasons unrelated to the registrant\u2019s ministerial status applies <em>a fortiori </em>to reclassification under the Hershey directive. Thus, <em>Oest-ereieh </em>effectively removes the threat to Tischler of reclassification for future protest activity and casts considerable doubt on his standing to challenge the Hershey directive. Standing is apparently to be determined as of the date of decision, not as of the date on which the suit was instituted. <em>See </em>Golden v.

The National Student Association (NSA) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) both contend that, because their anti-draft and anti-war protest activities are well known, their members may fear reclassification under the Hershey directive simply on account of their membership. As a result, they say, the directive may cause them to lose present or prospective members. That this fear is not wholly illusory is demonstrated by a letter, attached as an exhibit to appellant\u2019s brief, in which an Oklahoma draft board announced its reclassification (to I-A) of a previously deferred student because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5M\">the local board did not feel that your activity as a member of SDS is to the best interest of the U.

On the other hand, the directive does assert that \u201cdeferments are given only when they serve the national interest.\u201d Especially in view of the action of the Oklahoma local board, an SDS member\u2019s fear that his draft board would seize upon this assertion as grounds for denying him deferment cannot be said to be wholly unreasonable. And it is ultimately the appearance to members, not the actuality, of the threat which determines its chilling effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">. <em>See </em>NAACP v.

When the directive does use the word \u201cdeferment,\u201d it appears to mean by it any relief from the obligation of military service. Thus, the directive explains that \u201cthe military obligation for liable age groups is universal and * * * deferments are given only when they serve the national interest.\u201d The directive also speaks of denying \u201cdeferments\u201d under the delinquency regulations, but those regulations are not limited in terms to deferments, as opposed to exemptions, and they have not been so limited in practice\u2014 witness Oestereich v. Selective Service Local Board No. 11, <em>supra </em>note 18, and the case of Plaintiff Tischler in this action (see note 47, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">. It is for the local board to determine whether a registrant qualifies as a conscientious objector. Clark v. Gabriel, <em>supra </em>note 14. But Congress has defined in some detail the necessary qualifications, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(j) (Supp. III, 1965-67), and they have nothing whatever to do with whether, in addition to being \u201cconscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form,\u201d a registrant conscientiously avoids all illegal protest activity. The Section says simply that those who are conscientiously opposed as defined shall not be required to do military service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">. The conflict may be enough less apparent to be insufficient in itself to justify pre-induction review of a classification in the face of Section 10(b) (3) of the Act <em>(see </em>text <em>supra, </em>Part I).

Accord, Anderson v. Hershey, 410 F.2d 492 (6 Cir. 1969); <em>but see </em>the contrary implication of Kolden v. Selective Service Board No. 4, <em>supra </em>note 54. The <em>Breen </em>and <em>Anderson </em>courts cited the concluding sentence of the undergraduate deferment provision, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(h) (1) (Supp. III, 1965-67), which describes the so-called prime age group as those who are to be inducted first \u201cafter delinquents.\u201d Even if this reference to delinquents is to be construed as a retroactive congressional authorization of the delinquency regulations, it does not supply any authority for reclassification according to non-statutory criteria outside the delinquency regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">In United States v.

None of the parties to this litigation has requested that a three-judge court be convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 (1964). That Section does not apply to suits seeking injunctions against \u201cadministrative orders,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cActs of Congress.\u201d William Jameson &amp; Co. v. Morgenthau, 307 U.S. 171, 173-174, 59 S.Ct. 804, 83 L.Ed. 1189 (1939). The Supreme Court has been less than lucid in indicating how this distinction is to be made in practice. <em>See </em>D. Currie, The Three-Judge District Court in Constitutional Litigation, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 51-55 (1964). However, it has been held that \u201cthe cumbersome three-judge procedure\u201d is not required where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axa-dedup-0\">an Act of Congress confers authority on an administrator in general terms which could be read either to embrace or to exclude the challenged action, and application of the statute is clearly constitutional in certain cases but arguably not so in the administrative scheme under attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-20\">Sardino v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 361 F.2d 106, 115 (2 Cir. 1966). In such cases, the injunction sought would not threaten \u201cto paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme,\u201d Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 154, 83 S.Ct. 554, 560, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), but only to restrain an administrator who has \u201cacted with too heavy a hand.\u201d Sardino v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, <em>supra </em>at 115-116. The <em>Sordino </em>holding applies <em>a fortiori </em>to the instant case, where the challenged directive does not even recite any statutory authority and where the sought injunction would accordingly leave the statute wholly intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
