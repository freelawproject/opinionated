See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">Wallace Dean Cline appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate judgment and sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">Cline is attacking a judgment of conviction for a Dyer Act violation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312, based upon his plea of guilty entered nearly twenty five years ago, September 6, 1944. Moreover, the sentence was completely served more than twenty years prior to the filing of this \u00a7 2255 motion. Cline is presently serving several life sentences at Folsom Prison in California, but he did not allege in his \u00a7 2255 motion that these sentences were in any way enhanced by the Dyer Act conviction.-</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">The District Court denied \u00a7 2255 relief without an evidentiary hearing, on grounds that the appellant was not in federal custody. This was undoubtedly correct. The Supreme Court has recently held that an application for habeas corpus is not rendered moot by the unconditional release of the prisoner. Car-afas v. LaVallee, 1968, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554. There, however, the prisoner was <em>in custody at the time the petition was filed. </em>Section 2255, however, expressly requires that the applicant be confined by authority of the judgment and sentence of which he complains. Heflin v. United States, 1959, 358 U.S. 415, 420-422, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">The denial of \u00a7 2255 relief is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">We do not have properly before us and thus do not decide whether Cline might have been entitled to coram nobis relief if, as a fact, the California sentences were enhanced because of the fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>eral conviction, see United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954); Marcello v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 961, cert. denied 377 U.S. 992, 84 S.Ct. 1916, 12 L.Ed.2d 1045; Azzone v. United States, 8 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 417, cert. denied 381 U.S. 943, 85 S.Ct. 1782, 14 L.Ed.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
