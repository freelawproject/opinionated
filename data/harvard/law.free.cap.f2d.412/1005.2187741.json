The second count jointly charged Major Becton and his brother, Roosevelt Becton, then age 25, with a like offense on or about February 9, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">With retained counsel, the defendants entered pleas of not guilty. Their motion for a severance was denied. At the ensuing jury trial in June 1967 both defendants testified. Major\u2019s defense on the first count was entrapment (he conceded making the sale) and on the second count was non-possession. Roosevelt\u2019s defense was mistaken identity and an alibi, with the intimation that it was a third brother, Stanley, who was in the bar-restaurant at the time of the February incident. However, each was convicted on the counts or count on which he was charged. The district court gave Major a 3-year sentence on each of the counts, the sentences to run concurrently. It gave Roosevelt a 2-year sentence. Both defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">The Bectons have been at large on bonds pending their appeal. Within a month after the case was argued orally to us the Supreme Court, 392 U.S. 903, 88 S.Ct. 2058, 20 L.Ed.2d 1362 (1968), granted certiorari as to certain constitutional issues present in Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851 (5 Cir. 1967) [and 392 F.2d 220 (5 Cir. 1968)]. Later, it noted probable jurisdiction in United States v. Covington, 282 F.Supp. 886 (S.D.Ohio 1968), and set that case for argument immediately following <em>Leary. </em>393 U.S. 910, 89 S.Ct. 238, 21 L.Ed.2d 197 (1958). Because of the identity of the constitutional issue which the Bectons argue to us with a constitutional issue present in both <em>Leary </em>and <em>Covington, </em>we deferred decision here until the Supreme Court had heard and decided the <em>Leary </em>and <em>Covington </em>eases. Those eases have now come down, Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), and United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>Covington, 395 U.S. 57, 89 S.Ct. 1559, 13 L.Ed.2d 94 (1969), and we are in a position to rule upon the Bectons\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The defense here urges (1) entrapment with respect to Major Beeton and the first count; (2) the insufficiency of the evidence with respect to Major and the second count; (3) the deprival of a fair trial on stated procedural, non-witness-producing, court comment, and instructional grounds; and (4), because of self-incrimination aspects, the Fifth Amendment unconstitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 4741(a) and 4744(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">We turn at once to the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">The defense concedes that unconstitutionality was not urged in the trial court. This immediately raises the question of waiver. Inasmuch as there is no factual dispute about the issue\u2019s being ignored at the trial level, \u201cthe question whether the privilege [against self-incrimination] has been waived * * * is one of law * * United States v. Cov-ington, supra (395 U.S. at 60, 89 S.Ct. p. 1561).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">The government, commendably, states in its brief, \u201cwe do not here press a contention that appellants\u2019 failure to raise or preserve any objection to the constitutionality of either the indictment or their conviction bars further consideration of the questions raised by\u201d Mar-chetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 716, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968), and Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), all decided after the Bectons\u2019 trial had been concluded. Of course, as <em>Grosso, </em>390 U.S. at 70-71, 88 S.Ct. 716, Leary v. United States, supra, and United States v. Cov-ington, supra, all clearly indicate, a defendant may waive his privilege against self-incrimination. However, so far as the constitutional questions raised by <em>Marchetti, Grosso </em>and <em>Haynes </em>are concerned, our own holdings subsequent thereto clearly entitle the defense here to press those constitutional grounds upon us despite a failure so to do in the trial court. Harris v. United States, 390 F.2d 616 (8 Cir. 1968); Segal v. United States, 391 F.2d 266 (8 Cir. 1968); Drennon v. United States, 393 F.2d 342, 343-344 (8 Cir. 1968); Mower v. United States, 402 F.2d 982, 984-985 (8 Cir. 1968). See Moodyes v. United States, 400 F.2d 360, 361 n. 2 (8 Cir. 1968). Our rulings to this effect followed Gros-so, 390 U.S. at 70-71, 88 S.Ct. 716, and were based upon the \u201cunique situation\u201d presented by <em>Marchetti, Grosso, </em>and <em>Haynes </em>in the light of earlier contrary court rulings in the wagering and firearms area, and upon the \u201cjust under the circumstances\u201d language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. If there was any question that this same approach was applicable with respect to the marijuana statutes under which the Bectons have been charged, it is set at rest by United States v. Coving-ton, supra. As the Supreme Court said there, 395 U.S. at 61, 89 S.Ct. at 1561, we may say here, \u201cThere is in this * * record no indication that [either appellant] waived his privilege, and the Government has never alleged the existence of a factual controversy on that score.\u201d Hence we hold that, under all the circumstances, the Bectons, by their inaction in the trial court, did not waive the constitutional question and that it is entirely appropriate and \u201cjust under the circumstances\u201d that we pass upon the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Having reached this point, it is equally clear that the attempted application of the statutes in question to the Bectons, and each of them, is unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The indictment\u2019s reference in each count to unlawful acquisition is obviously directed to \u00a7 4744(a) (1) rather than to \u00a7 4744(a) (2). It is \u00a7 4744(a) (1) which was under challenge in United States v. Covington, supra, although the Court observed 395 U.S. at 60, 89 S.Ct. at 1561, n. 3, \u201cthat there is no significant distinction between the statutes for purposes of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Covington </em>and <em>Leary </em>are thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>controlling here. The connection with possible jeopardy under state law lies in the facts that the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act was, and is, in effect in Missouri, V.A.M.S. \u00a7\u00a7 195.010 through 195.210, and that, under that Act, unauthorized possession of marijuana is unlawful and specified penalties are imposed. V.A.M.S. \u00a7 195.020, \u00a7 195.010(5) and (17), and \u00a7 195.200; State v. Thompson, 425 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Mo.Sup. 1968); State v. Page, 395 S.W.2d 146 (Mo.Sup.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Upon the conclusive authority of <em>Covington, Leary, Marchetti, Grosso, </em>and <em>Haynes </em>and in line with the rulings in our <em>Harris </em>and succeeding cases, cited above, the Bectons\u2019 convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the other issues raised by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The judgments of conviction are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
