The state of Arizona and the federal court were concurrently passing Tisnado back and forth in 1967 for criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-21\">It seems to be Tisnado\u2019s argument that the federal court should have kept him when it had him or should have made the sentence concurrent with the state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-22\">The argument is made as well as it could be. But we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-23\">In our view Strand v. Schmittroth, 9 Cir., 251 F.2d 590, cited by both parties, indicates the district court proceeded quite properly. Tisnado had no two-for-one right and the courts should lean to avoiding conflicts with co-ordinate criminal jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">The points are rejected and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
