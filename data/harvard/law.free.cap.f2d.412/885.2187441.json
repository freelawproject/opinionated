See, Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Appellant, Michael Lynn Clark, appeals to this court from a conviction for bail jumping under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150 (Supp., 1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse because we find that the conduct for which Clark was convicted was not an indictable offense under \u00a7 3150.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-19\">The circumstances leading up to Clark\u2019s conviction are as follows. On May 24, 1967, appellant pleaded guilty in a United States district court to the offense of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312. The court adjudged appellant guilty and deferred sentence to await receipt of a presentence report, but no fixed date was set for sentencing. The United States Attorney then notified the court that the appellant was being held in jail in lieu of $750.00 bond and the court decided to continue the bond at that figure. It agreed, however, to release appellant on his own recognizance. Appellant signed the appearance bond which conditioned his release on not departing from Hinds or Rankin County, Mississippi, and the judge advised him of the penalties he might incur for violating the conditions of his bond, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(e). Thereafter the court apparently directed appellant to report to Charles Raggio, the probation officer, for completion of the presentence report. The record does not reflect whether this directive was made a condition of release or whether it was included in the written appearance bond that appellant signed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record is also unclear as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>to the terms upon which Clark was to report to the probation officer, whether for one day only, or until the presentence report was complete, or on such terms as the probation officer might thereafter impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Appellant did report to Mr. Raggio as directed. Approximately 45 minutes later, however, he requested permission to go to the home of his grandparents. The probation officer granted his request upon condition that Clark return to the probation office the following morning at 8:00 a. m., to help him complete the presentence report. Appellant failed to appear in Mr. Raggio\u2019s office as promised and later that same day a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was taken into custody on June 7, 1967 and sentence was imposed for transportation of a stolen motor vehicle on July 24, 1967. At that time appellant was 19 years old and a first offender. He received a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In March of 1968, while appellant was serving his sentence in the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a federal grand jury indicted appellant for bail jumping. The indictment charged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150, the enforcement provision of the Bail Reform Act, and alleged a willful failure to appear before a United States probation officer as required by a condition of his bail bond. Appellant was brought to trial on August 12, 1968, and a jury found him guilty as charged. The judge sentenced him to another maximum sentence of five years, such sentence to run consecutively with the five year sentence he was already serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">On this appeal appellant alleges two grounds for reversal. He claims that the government failed to prove a prima facie case on the crime alleged in the indictment because 1) his failure to appear before the probation officer was not a violation of his appearance bond (apparently because the bond made no mention of such a condition), and 2) his failure to appear before the probation officer was not willful. Appellant also observes that at no time did appellant violate the travel restrictions set forth in his appearance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We find it unnecessary to consider these specifications of error because we find that the indictment against Clark did not state a criminal offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Although this point was not brought to the attention of the district court, or argued in appellant\u2019s brief, the failure of the indictment, and of the evidence which followed it, to disclose a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150, constitutes plain error within the meaning of F.R.Crim.P. 52 (b) and warrants reversal by a reviewing court. See, Chappell v. United States, 9 Cir. 1959, 270 F.2d 274, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150 under which appellant was convicted provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">\u201cWhoever, having been released pursuant to this chapter, wilfully fails to appear before any court or judicial officer as required, shall, * * * if he was released in connection with a charge of felony, or while awaiting sentence or pending appeal or certio-rari after conviction of any offense, be fined not more than $5000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">It should be noted that the statute by its terms imposes penalties only for the willful failure to appear before any \u201ccourt or judicial officer,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Clark was both indicted and convicted for failure to report to a probation officer. Throughout appellant\u2019s trial, the government attempted to show that a probation officer was a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The trial court adopted this theory as an accurate statement of the law in its charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">\u201cNow Section 3150 of Title 18, United States Code, provides this: Whoever having been released pursuant to this chapter wilfully fails to appear before any Court or judicial officer, and Mr. Raggio is a judicial officer, he is an officer of this Court, he is an agent and representative of this Court and he was on this occasion, as required shall subject to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure incur a forfeiture of any security which was given or pledged for his release, and in addition if he was released in connection with a charge of a felony or while awaiting sentence and pending appeal or certiorari after conviction of an offense shall be punished and so forth and I don\u2019t need to read that because the jury is not concerned with what the punishment is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>I don\u2019t know what the punishment is. That\u2019s the reason I get these presen-tence reports and that is what I was trying to do in this case. Anyway that is the law, members of the jury, and its up to you to decide as to whether or not on or about May 25, 1967, if this defendant did or did not appear before Mr. Raggio on that morning to let Mr. Raggio complete his pre-sentence report which he was trying to make for this Court and that is just all there is to it and there is no room for any sympathy of any kind, there is no extenuating circumstances of any kind, you are just confronted with the question in this case of deciding under your oaths and that\u2019s not a light thing, members of the jury, but deciding on your oaths as to whether or not this man did or did not do just what I have said. If he did do that its your sworn duty under your oaths regardless of any feeling or any kind of impulse that you may have to want to be gentle with this fellow or turn him a loose or give him something else that congress didn\u2019t give him or forgive him for what congress said he should be punished for it would be your duty under those circumstances to say that he is guilty. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t believe those things then it would be your sworn duty to say he is not guilty. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Appellant did not object to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the ground that a probation officer was not a judicial officer within the meaning of the statute. But it is well-established that a court\u2019s instructions cannot \u201cincrease the effect of the statute.\u201d Wilkerson v. United States, 7 Cir. 1930, 41 F.2d 654, 656, cert. denied, 282 U.S. 894, 51 S.Ct. 179, 75 L.Ed. 788. If in fact a probation officer is not a judicial officer within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150, then the indictment against Clark was defective, Chappell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and the effect of the court\u2019s erroneous instruction would be to authorize the jury to convict appellant for an act that was not a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The government argues in its brief that a probation officer is a court assistant or judicial officer because he is appointed by the court, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3654, and because he must perform such duties as the court may direct. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3655. Nowhere in its brief, however, does the government make mention of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3152 which expressly defines the term \u201cjudicial officer\u201d as that term was intended to be used in the Bail Reform Act. The statutory definition is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-8\">\u201cAs used in sections 3146-3150 of this chapter- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">(1) The term \u2018judicial officer\u2019 means, unless otherwise indicated, any person or court authorized pursuant to section 3041 of this title, or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to bail or otherwise release a person before trial or sentencing or pending appeal in a court of the United States, and any judge of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Reference to \u00a7 3041 of title 18 and to the Rules of Criminal Procedure reveals no mention of a probation officer in connection with the authority \u201cto bail or otherwise release a person before trial or sentencing or pending appeal * The sections of the United States Code relied on by the government cannot remedy this deficiency. They may indicate that a probation officer is an arm of the court and under its supervision, but they do not make him a judicial officer as that term is expressly defined by the Bail Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">An additional reason for holding that a probation officer is not a judicial officer as that term is used in the Bail Reform Act is the havoc which a contrary ruling would create in other provisions of the Act. Not only would acceptance of the government\u2019s position permit probation officers to release an accused on bail pursuant to \u00a7 3146(a), but if a probation officer is a judicial officer then he would also be required to issue or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>ders containing the conditions of release, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(c), to entertain motions to modify the conditions of release, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(d), to amend his orders at any time to impose additional conditions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(e), and to detain or release material witnesses in a criminal proceeding, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3149. Such an expansive concept of a probation officer's duties not only seems novel in the extreme, it runs contrary to the avowed Congressional purpose expressed in the history of the Bail Reform Act not to subject probation officers to \u201cadditional duties [that] might require additional personnel.\u201d See 1966 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm.News, p. 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\"> In reaching this conclusion we do not of course disparage the importance of the probation officer in the scheme of criminal justice. He is a valued; helpful and important arm of the court and his services are essential to our contemporary criminal procedure. But an arm of the court is not the body of the court and we find no statutory vestments which endow a probation officer with judicial functions. Where, in addition, we are confronted with a statute which contains its own restrictive definition of a \u201cjudicial officer,\u201d and must interpret that term within the framework of the statute, we are not at liberty to disregard the statutory definition. We here interpret a criminal statute. A criminal statute must be strictly construed and \u201ccannot be enlarged by analogy or expanded beyond the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d Chappell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>270 F.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The inapplicability of \u00a7 3150 to appellant\u2019s conduct does not, of course, mean that the court was powerless to punish for disobedience of its order. Where a condition of an appearance bond is violated <em>other than non-appearance before a court or judicial officer, </em>the court still has at its disposal the power to declare a forfeiture of the bond, Brown v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 212 to revoke bail, United States ex rel. Brown v. Fogel, 4 Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 291, 294, to issue a warrant of arrest, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(c), and in extreme cases, to declare the violator in contempt of court. United States v. Penn, 2 Crim.L.Rep. 3159 (D.C.Ct. of Gen.Sess.1968). The last is a sanction which \u201cmust be used sparingly, and only against deliberate or wilful contemptuous conduct toward the Court.\u201d United States v. Penn, <em>supra, </em>at 3141. But it is not unavailable. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1351 of the Bail Reform Act expressly reserves to the court its traditional powers to punish for contempt. As stated in that section: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall interfere with or prevent the exercise by any court of the United States of its power to punish for contempt.\u201d The presence of this section in the Bail Reform Act makes it unnecessary to attribute to \u00a7 3150 a broader enforcement power than its plain language permits. When an accused willfully violates a condition of release, he necessarily violates' the court order containing these conditions. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(c). If the circumstances of the violation are extreme enough, see United States v. Green, 1958, 356 U.S. 165, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672, the violator\u2019s conduct is punishable under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">This relationship between the contempt power and the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 3150 was noted in United States ex rel. Brown v. Fogel, <em>supra. </em>The court there pointed out that \u00a7 3150 does not punish the violation of all conditions of release, but only those conditions which involve a failure to appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">\u201c * * * It is true that the Act provides <em>specific </em>penalties only for a wilful failure to appear, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150; and these are forfeiture of se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>curity and criminal penalties. But, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3151 expressly preserves, unaffected by the Act, the power of any court of the United States to punish for contempt. Violation of a condition of release constitutes contempt, and for contempt the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments are the only limitation of the punishment which may be imposed, short of the Court\u2019s sound discretion. Surely, the Act\u2019s silence of a specific remedy to assure appearance after demonstrated breach of a condition of admission to bail under the Act indicates the extent of the Court\u2019s power under \u00a7 3151. The \u2018spirit\u2019 of the Act is thus not to limit or to prescribe exclusive remedies for breach of a condition of release, other than appearance in appropriate cases. For breach of condition other than appearance, the Court when proceeding under the Act or under the inherent power may do all that is appropriate to the orderly progress of the trial and the fair administration of justice. Cf. Fernandez v. United States, 81 S.Ct. 642, 5 L.Ed.2d 683 (1961) (per Harlan, J., as Circuit Justice).\u201d 395 F.2d at 293.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Clark\u2019s failure to appear before a probation officer as ordered may have constituted a breach of a condition of his release, but certainly did not constitute a failure to appear before a court or judicial officer. His action may have warranted revocation of bail, arrest, and the institution of contempt proceedings for disobedience of a lawful court order, see Yates v. United States, 10 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 718, but his presence had not been required at any judicial proceedings, and his failure to keep an appointment with a probation officer did not therefore constitute the kind of non-appearance which \u00a7 3150 of the Bail Reform Act was designed to discourage.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">We have considered the possibility that the indictment against appellant may have been specific enough to constitute a charge of criminal contempt. It indicated that he had been required to appear before a United States probation officer and it charged that he had knowingly and willfully failed to appear as required. While the indictment alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150, and not 18 U.S.C.A. 401(3), this fact alone would not render the indictment insufficient in regard to the latter offense. See, Paz Morales v. United States, 1 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 598, 599-600.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxHX\">\u201cThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could have been made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet, and, in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\u201d Hewitt v. United States, 8 Cir. 1940, 110 F.2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 310 U.S. 641, 60 S.Ct. 1089, 84 L.Ed. 1409; Anderson v. United States, 8 Cir. 1959, 262 F.2d 764, 769, cert. denied, 360 U.S. 929, 79 S.Ct. 1446, 3 L.Ed.2d 1543.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Despite this liberal construction of indictments, we are persuaded that the indictment against Clark failed to state a criminal offense even if considered as an indictment for criminal contempt. See, Chappell v. United States, <em>supra. </em>\u201c * * <em>* </em>knowledge or notice of the order in question on the part of appellant and a willful disobedience of that order are essential elements of criminal contempt.\u201d Yates v. United States, 10 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 718, 723. The indictment against Clark failed to mention any court order and failed to allege that he had knowledge or notice of that order. While it did state that he knowingly and willfully failed to appear before a United States probation officer as \u201crequired,\u201d this would not, especially in light of what transpired at his trial, put him on sufficient notice that he was being tried for criminal contempt and not for bail jumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Had appellant known that he was being tried for contempt, the entire posture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>of his defense might have shifted. Instead of taking the position that he lacked the requisite willfulness in not appearing before the probation officer, he might have argued that he had substantially complied with the court\u2019s order in reporting to the probation officer immediately following his hearing (even if he did not report back the next day), or that the probation officer did not have power to amend the court\u2019s order by granting him permission to visit his grandparents, and ordering his return the next day. Indeed, a contempt conviction on the evidence before us would require us to find that a probation officer has the power to amend a court order, and that such order, <em>as amended, </em>would support a contempt proceeding. This we may not do. Under the circumstances of this case we are therefore unprepared to say that a citation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150 in a prosecution that was in reality for criminal contempt would \u201cnot mislead a defendant to his prejudice.\u201d F.R.Crim.P. 7(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Since the evidence did not show an offense under \u00a7 3150, and since appellant could not have known that he was being tried for criminal contempt and not bail jumping, the conviction below must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-10\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150. Penalties for failure to appear</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-12\">Whoever, having been released pursuant to this chapter, willfully fails to appear before any court or judicial officer as required, shall, subject to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, incur a forfeiture of any security which was given or pledged for his release, and, in addition, shall (1) if he was released in connection with a charge of felony, or while awaiting sentence or pending appeal or cer-tiorari after conviction of any offense, be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, or (2) if he was released in connection with a charge of misdemeanor, be fined not more than the maximum provided for such misdemeanor or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, or (3) if he was released for appearance as a material witness, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-21\">. The government indicates in its brief that Clark was released pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(a), but the record does not show which provisions of \u00a7 3146(a) (1)\u2014(5) were invoked and made express conditions of Clark\u2019s release. The fact that Clark\u2019s appearance bond restricted his travel within named counties in Mississippi would indicate that the court invoked \u00a7 3146(a) (2). But there is no indication which part of the statute was invoked to condition Clark\u2019s release on his reporting to the probation officer. There are statements in the legislative history of the Act which suggest that the invocation of \u00a7 3146(a) (1) would not have been proper for this purpose. See 1966 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm.News, p. 2293. The only other possibility would be \u00a7 3146(a) (5), but it is difficult to understand how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>reporting to a probation officer for completion of a presentence report is a \u201ccondition deemed reasonably necessary to assure appearance as required.\u201d Indeed, the record before us is singularly inadequate concerning the precise conditions upon which Clark <em>was </em>released. The record contains no order expressly setting forth the conditions of his release as required by \u00a7 3146(c). Even testimony from the proceedings at which Clark pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a motor vehicle does not indicate the precise nature of the court\u2019s instructions to Clark. While the testimony can be read to show that the judge orally instructed Clark to report to the probation officer, it does not show that reporting was ever made an express condition of his bond. This ambiguity appears to have resulted from the informal release procedures adopted by the trial court. As to the undesirability of such practices, see United States v. Egan, 2 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 262:</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\u201cThe present case arose in part because of the less than satisfactory procedures adopted with respect to the restrictions added by order of the court to the standard form. These were simply typewritten on an unsigned slip of paper stapled to the bond, which did not incorporate them by reference. Restrictions or conditions not within the express conditions of the standard form and changes in the bail limits to places within or beyond the court\u2019s own district, should be recited in the body of the bond itself or, if on a separate paper, they should be referred to in the bond as an attached schedule or supplement, or the supplement should describe itself as an amendment to the bond, designated by case name, docket number, name of defendant bonded and date and should be executed and acknowledged by the same parties so that the attachment or supplement is an instrument of the same dignity and formality as the bond itself. Likewise, subsequent modifications of the terms of the bond (including a change in bond limits) ordered by the court should be set out 'in such an attachment or rider or in a newly written bond, executed and acknowledged in the same fashion as the original bond.\u201d 394 F.2d at 267.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. The statute as it now reads is substantially different from its predecessor, \u00a7 3146, which imposed criminal penalties for the willful failure to surrender within 30 days after the forfeiture of bail. As Judge Wisdom has pointed out in Brown v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 212, p. 216: \u201cSection 3150 was enacted specifically to amend the [old] bail jumping penalty provision.\u201d This earlier statute imposed its penalties for failure to \u201csurrender\u201d after forfeiture of bail and not, as the present statute, for failure to \u201cappear before any court or judicial officer.\u201d The thrust of the two statutes was therefore quite different. As the Justice Department itself has stated, Memo No. 484, September 8, 1966, in referring to Section 3150;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">\u201cThe Act does not provide penalties for a violation of a condition of release short of failing to appear before a judicial officer or court as required. * * * For example, a person may be required to live at a specified address; however if he lives elsewhere but appears as required before the judicial officer or court he is not subject to the penalties herein provided.\u201d Cited in Brown v. United States, 410 F.2d at 212.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Compare the stated purposes of the new \u00a7 3150 to the enforcement provision which it superseded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-13\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146.
