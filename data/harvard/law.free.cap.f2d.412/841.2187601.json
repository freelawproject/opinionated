See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I [dated March 11, 1969],</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">The appellant was convicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida of assaulting a postal employee and putting his life in jeopardy with the intent to rob, steal or purloin in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>2114 (1964). He entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial court charged the jury with respect to insanity in accordance with the law of this circuit at the time of trial, but while this case was pending on direct appeal the case of Blake v. United States, 407 F.2d 908 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc) [February 12, 1969] was decided. The charge as given does not'meet the <em>Blake </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial in light of the <em>Blake </em>decision. United States v. Lepiscopo, 409 F.2d 843 (5th Cir. 1969) [April 16, 1969]; Theriault v. United States, 409 F.2d 1313 (5th Cir. 1969) [April 18, 1969]; Hodges v.
