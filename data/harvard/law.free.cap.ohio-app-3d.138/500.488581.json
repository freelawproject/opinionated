This code section states that \u201cthe inmate shall file with the court an affidavit that contains a description of each civil action * * * filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">In a prior mandamus action before this court by the relator, we noted that relator had filed at least thirty-nine federal lawsuits against various government entities and officials. See <em>State ex rel. Bristow v. Ritz </em>(Aug. 14, 2000), Mahoning App. No. 00 C.A. 114, unreported, 2000 WL 1262454. In the instant case, relator has listed only eleven cases or appeals that he has filed against a government entity or employee. In their motion to dismiss, respondents have identified at least twelve cases filed by the relator that relator has failed to include among those cases listed in this case. Thus, relator has violated the provisions of R.C. 2969.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">The provisions of R.C. 2969.25(A) are mandatory and failure to comply are grounds for dismissal. See <em>State ex rel. Alford v. Winters </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 285, 685 N.E.2d 1242. Relator has materially misstated the number of civil actions in the affidavit he has filed pursuant to R.C. 2969.25. For the reasons cited above, relator\u2019s request for writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Costs taxed against relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Final order.
