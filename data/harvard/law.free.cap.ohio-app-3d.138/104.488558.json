FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">On April 16, 1981, three-year-old Stacey Daniel was admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center with a high fever and labored breathing. Doctors diagnosed Stacey as having pneumonia and administered both an antibiotic and Somophyllin Oral Liquid, a theophylline-based drug manufactured by Fisons that was intended to ease her breathing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fisons\u2019s package insert for the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>informed doctors that theophylline levels above the therapeutic-serum range of 10 mcg/ml to 20 mcg/ml might produce toxic effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or even seizures; that adverse reactions to theophylline increased when serum levels exceeded 20 mcg/ml; that the great variation from patient to patient in theophylline metabolism required individualized dosing and monitoring of serum-theophylline levels; that prolonged high fever might reduce the rate of theophylline elimination; that no patient was to be maintained on any dosage that was not tolerated; and that, even absent adverse reactions, serum-theophylline levels in excess of the therapeutic range required a ten-percent reduction in dosage.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Despite the treatment she was receiving, Stacey remained extremely ill after several days of hospitalization; she continued to run a high fever, and she also began vomiting and having diarrhea. At the time, doctors noted that her pneumonia was most likely viral in nature. In addition, the serum-theophylline level in her blood began to fluctuate greatly and, on several occasions, exceeded the therapeutic range. Despite this, her doctors continued to treat her with theophylline. Then, five days into her treatment, Stacey suffered a prolonged seizure that caused irreversible brain damage. As a result of the seizure, Stacey, who is now an adult, is incapable of living independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In 1998, Stacey\u2019s parents filed a complaint alleging that Stacey\u2019s seizure and resulting injuries were caused by toxic levels of theophylline in her blood. Although the Daniels\u2019 complaint initially included medical-malpractice claims against Stacey\u2019s pediatricians and Children\u2019s Hospital, as well as products-liability claims against Fisons and two other manufacturers of intravenous theophylline, the other drug companies were eventually dismissed from the action, and the medical-malpractice claims against the doctors and the hospital were settled. Thereafter, Fisons, the only remaining defendant, moved for summary judgment on the two products-liability claims asserted against it by the Daniels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing arguments, the trial court granted Fisons\u2019s motion on the following grounds: (1) Fisons was entitled to summary judgment on the Daniels\u2019 failure-to-warn claim given that the warnings contained in Fisons\u2019s package insert were adequate as a matter of law, and that even if the Daniels had provided sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue as to the adequacy of the warnings, they had failed to demonstrate that the addition of a warning regarding viral illness would have altered the doctors\u2019 course of treatment; and (2) Fisons was entitled to summary judgment on the Daniels\u2019 claim for punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>given the absence of any evidence that Fisons withheld information from, or made misrepresentations to, the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In this timely appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the Daniels bring two assignment of error. In these assignments, they challenge the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Fisons on their products-liability claims for (1) failure-to-warn and (2) punitive damages pursuant to R.C. 2307.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">II. SUMMARY-JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Summary judgment is a procedural device to terminate litigation and to avoid a formal trial where there is nothing to try. It must be awarded with caution by resolving doubt and construing evidence against the moving party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment shall be granted only if the court, upon viewing the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts set forth in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, and affidavits in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, determines that (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party opposing the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In reviewing the propriety of summary judgment, an appellate court independently examines the record to determine whether the trial court was entitled to enter judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision in answering this legal question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In their first assignment of error, the Daniels assert that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment on their products-liability claim for failure to warn. While the Daniels concede that Fisons\u2019s theophylline package insert warned doctors that high prolonged fever might reduce the rate at which theophylline was eliminated from the blood, they assert that Fisons\u2019 failure to include a warning relative to a viral infection\u2019s effect on theophylline clearance rendered the drug defective and unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Although many prescription drugs such as theophylline are incapable of being made completely safe for their intended use, these drugs are not consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ered defective or unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law so long as their manufacturer provides proper warnings and instructions to the prescribing doctor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a manufacturer may be held strictly liable for injuries caused by a drug where the manufacturer has failed to provide an adequate warning and where it is proven that (1) the lack of adequate warning was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs ingestion of the drug, and (2) that the ingestion of the drug was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In satisfying the first branch of the proximate-cause burden, a plaintiff is aided by a rebuttable presumption that the failure to adequately warn was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs ingestion of the drug.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">A warning is said to be \u201cadequate\u201d where, under all the circumstances, it reasonably discloses to the medical professional all known or reasonably discoverable risks inherent in the use of the drug.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, a reasonable warning not only conveys a fair indication of the nature of the dangers involved, but also warns with the degree of intensity demanded by the nature of the risk.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, although a causal relationship between use of a product and resulting injury may not be clearly established, a manufacturer may not ignore or discount scientific or medical evidence tending to show that a certain danger is associated with use of the drug solely because the manufacturer finds such information unconvincing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Daniels assert that, notwithstanding Fisons\u2019s warning regarding fever\u2019s reduction of theophylline clearance, Fisons\u2019s failure to include a warning regarding the degree to which a viral infection might reduce theophylline clearance rendered the package-insert warning inadequate. In support of this assertion, the Daniels put forth the opinion of their medical expert, Dr. W. Leigh Thompson, that Fisons\u2019s warning was inadequate given that it failed to warn of \u201cthe variability of theophylline kinetics in children with viral infections or the potential of doubling or more of serum theophylline concentrations during such infections.\u201d Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Daniels, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>we must, we conclude that it raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Fisons\u2019s failure to include a viral warning rendered the existing warning inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Because we conclude that the Daniels presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the adequacy of the warning, they are entitled to the benefit of the rebuttable presumption that the allegedly inadequate warning was a proximate cause of Stacey\u2019s theophylline ingestion. Given the facts of this case, however, we are led to conclude that Fisons rebutted this presumption as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The record demonstrates that Fisons\u2019s package insert cautioned that symptoms of toxicity included vomiting and diarrhea and that no patient was to be maintained on any dosage that was not tolerated. Moreover, the package insert specifically instructed that a theophylline dosage was to be reduced by ten percent when a patient\u2019s serum level exceeded the therapeutic range, regardless of whether adverse reactions had become manifest. Despite these instructions, and despite Stacey\u2019s manifestation of signs of toxicity, Stacey\u2019s doctors maintained her on theophylline. Furthermore, her doctors failed to reduce her dosage even when her serum-theophylline level exceeded the therapeutic range and reached as high as 25 mcg/ml.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Given that Fisons\u2019s package insert cautioned that Stacey\u2019s fever presented an increased risk of toxicity, and that, despite this, her doctors completely failed to heed the package insert\u2019s clear instruction to reduce the dosage, it cannot be said that the addition of a viral warning would have had any impact on the determination to continue administering theophylline to Stacey. Or, put another way, the evidence that the doctors ignored the dosaging instructions served to defeat the presumption that the allegedly inadequate warning was a proximate cause of Stacey\u2019s ingestion of theophylline. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly entered summary judgment on the Daniels\u2019 failure-to-warn claim. Accordingly, we overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In light of our conclusion that the Daniels\u2019 failure-to-warn claim failed as a matter of law, there is no basis to support their claim for statutory punitive damages. Accordingly, we overrule their second assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Fisons on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-12\">Gorman, P.J., Sundermann, and Winkler, JJ.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\">.
