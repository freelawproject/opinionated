In 1999, this court affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later that year, Rowland filed a <em>pro se </em>application for reopening the appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B), arguing that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to raise errors in the sentence imposed by the trial court. Noting that the trial court had erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>in failing to provide, under R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.19(B)(2)(d), an appropriate reason for imposing the maximum sentence, this court determined that there was a genuine issue as to the effectiveness of Rowland\u2019s appellate counsel. As a result, we granted his application to reopen the appeal and appointed counsel to assist him. Rowland now raises five assignments of error, all pertaining to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Rowland\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error are dispositive of this appeal. In the fourth assignment, Rowland contends that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because his original appellate counsel failed to raise as error the trial court\u2019s failure to make the requisite findings under R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.19(B)(2)(d) to support its imposition of the maximum prison term. In the first assignment, he contends that the failure to make the findings itself constitutes reversible error. We agree in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">A criminal defendant is entitled to effective assistance of appellate counsel on a first appeal as of right.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To determine whether a defendant has received effective assistance of appellate counsel, the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is used.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under <em>Strickland, </em>a court must determine (1) whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) whether that deficient performance resulted in prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Because Rowland was sentenced to the maximum prison term for a single felony offense, he was entitled to appeal the imposition of that sentence as a matter of right under R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(a). Moreover, Rowland is correct in his assertion that the trial court\u2019s failure to make the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.19(B)(2)(d) to support its imposition of the maximum sentence amounted to error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had this error been brought to our attention by original appellate counsel, we would have vacated Rowland\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Accordingly, the failure to raise the issue originally rendered counsel\u2019s performance deficient and resulted in prejudice to Rowland. We therefore conclude that Rowland was denied effective assistance by his original appellate counsel and that he erroneously received the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>sentence in the trial court. The first and fourth assignments of error are sustained. The remaining assignments are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The part of our judgment affirming Rowland\u2019s sentence is hereby vacated, the sentence itself is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the court of common pleas for resentencing in accordance with law. We do not otherwise disturb our previous affirmance of that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment entering a finding of guilt pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-7\">Doan, P.J., Gorman and Sundermann, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-13\">.
