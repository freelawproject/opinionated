Corrigan, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">This case is before this court on remand from the United States Supreme Court for further consideration in light of the court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Florida v. J.L. </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254. Finding the Court\u2019s holding in that case to be squarely on point with the facts in the instant case, we hereby reverse our earlier decision in this matter and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The facts of this case are detailed in this court\u2019s prior opinion, <em>State v. Morrison </em>(June 17, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74184, unreported, 1999 WL 401554, wherein we held that a reasonable suspicion existed for a police officer to initiate an investigatory stop of the appellant based upon information provided by an anonymous informant where the informant stated that the appellant was carrying a firearm and the informant correctly predicted the appellant\u2019s race, sex, and direction of travel, and gave a detailed description of the appellant\u2019s clothing. The Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction to review this court\u2019s decision on October 20, 1999. 87 Ohio St.3d 1418, 717 N.E.2d 1105. On April 5, 2000, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this court and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Florida v. J.L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">In <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>the Supreme Court was presented with a fact pattern that was very similar to the one presented in the instant case. In <em>Florida, </em>an anonymous informant called the Miami-Dade Police Department and reported that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun. Officers responded to the bus stop and found three young black males, one of whom was wearing a plaid shirt. The officers searched all three of the individuals and in the process confirmed that the individual in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>plaid shirt was, in fact, carrying a concealed weapon without a license. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the use of the gun as evidence as the fruit of an unlawful search. Although the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court of Florida held that the trial court had properly granted the motion to suppress as the search was invalid under the Fourth Amendment. In affirming the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court stated that an investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person. Specifically, the court held that \u201can anonymous tip lacking indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in <em>Adams </em>and <em>White </em>does not justify a stop and frisk whenever and however it alleges the illegal possession of a firearm.\u201d The court also declined to carve out a \u201cfirearm exception\u201d to the general rule whereby a tip alleging the illegal possession of a firearm would be presumed to possess sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error herein states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cI. The trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized as the product of his unlawful detention in violation of his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article One, Section Fourteen of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Based on the holding of <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>the appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken. The Supreme Court has clearly chosen to limit the situations where an investigatory stop may be premised on information received by an anonymous informant. We do note, however, Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion, wherein he noted that the court\u2019s opinion does not apply to all tips received by informants, such as where the informant \u201cplaces his anonymity at risk\u201d or where the identity of the informant is confirmed through caller identification or voice recording. Therefore, cases involving investigatory stops occasioned by an anonymous police informant will still need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in order to determine whether such tips lack sufficient indicia of reliability so as to render the search invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">This case is hereby remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-10\">Karpinski, P.J., and Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
