Smack and Coca-Cola Bottling Company. The bill alleges in substance that:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">By a lease dated May 3, 1940, one Hondroulis let to appellees \u201cthe property known as No. 220 North Eutaw Street,\u201d in Baltimore, \u201cto be used for the purposes of retailing and manufacturing of electric lamps and appliances,\u201d for a term of five years from June 1, 1940, with an option to renew the term for an additional five years after the expiration of the original term. The option to renew was exercised on January 5, 1945. On July\u201931, 1945, Hondroulis conveyed the property to appellant. Appellees then were and now are \u201cthe tenants in possession of said premises in its entirety.\u201d Appellant on August 1, 1945, notified them to pay, and has continued to accept from them, the rental under the lease. On October 10, 1945, appellant, without appellees\u2019 \u2022 consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>demised \u201cthe exterior south wall of the said premises\u201d to Smack, and Smack then sublet \u201cthe said wall space\u201d to the Coca-Cola Company. Smack caused \u201cto be painted on said wall a large advertising sign\u201d which advertises Coca-Cola. When the painters began, appellees \u201cobjected strenuously\u201d and \u201crequested that they cease and desist from their destructive trespass\u201d on appellees\u2019 property and \u201cthe said interference with their possession.\u201d In spite of appellees\u2019 protests to the respondents, the respondents \u201ccompleted the erecting and painting of said sign\u201d and have refused to remove it and restore the wall to its previous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Appellees aver that by reason of their lease they are entitled to \u201cthe entire possession of the interior and the exterior of the demised premises,\u201d and to the use of the south wall \u201cfor any use consistent with their authorized use of the premises,\u201d or, if they choose, to have the space remain unused; they \u201chave been, pursuant to said lease, in complete and uninterrupted possession of said entire premises\u201d since July 1, 1940, \u201chave been injured and damaged by their being unlawfully deprived of the use and possession of said wall, have been deprived of the use of same for advertising in connection with their own business,\u201d and have suffered other injuries and damages consequent upon having, on the exterior of their premises, a \u201clarge, conspicuous and unsightly\u201d sign advertising a product entirely disconnected with their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The bill prays (1) that the respondents be required by mandatory injunction to remove any and all advertising signs which they have caused to be painted on the south wall and to restore the wall to its previous condition and (2) be enjoined from placing any other signs on the wall until May 31, 1950; and (3) for general relief. #</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Smack and the Coca-Cola Company answered the bill. Smack says he agreed to rent the south wall from appellant for $300 a year for the purpose of painting a Coca-Cola advertisement on it; he paid the occupant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>adjoining parking lot \u00a739 for space required while the advertisement was being painted; he was to receive a rental of \u00a7850 a year from the Coca-Cola Company for the sign. Appellant correctly says that Smack\u2019s answer is not before us on appellant\u2019s demurrer. But it may be assumed from the bill (until denied by appellant by answer) that Coca-Cola Company paid for the sign, that appellant, Smack and the adjoining occupant were paid for use of space and for the painting, and that consent to undo the trespass can as readily be obtained from the adjoining occupant as consent to commit the trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Appellant contends, not that he had a right to paint a- sign on appellees\u2019 wall, but (1) that the bill is deficient in not stating sufficient facts to warrant granting the relief prayed and (2) that appellees have a full, complete and adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appellant\u2019s grounds of demurrer are without merit. The first is on its face untenable. The lease (filed as an exhibit) and the bill described the property by street and number, a customary method of description in Baltimore and elsewhere. <em>Brager v. Bigham, </em>127 Md. 148, 149, 151, 152, 96 A. 277; <em>Riddle v. Littlefield, </em>53 N. H. 503, 16 Am. Rep. 388; <em>Goldfoot v. Welch, </em>1914, 1 Ch. 213, 217. It is not necessary (as appellant contends) to allege \u201cthe kind or character\u201d of the building, \u201cwhether it is permanent or temporary, its height, construction or dimensions, whether or not it extends over the whole lot, what it adjoins or abuts on the south,\u201d or who owns the adjoining property. It is sufficient that without authority a Coca-Cola sign has been painted on appellee\u2019s wall. If it should not be possible (by getting the adjoining occupant\u2019s consent or by making him a party, as a participant in the trespass) to give appellees adequate relief by painting out the sign, the court could give them inadequate pecuniary relief. Such relief may in any event be necessary for the period until the sign is removed. There is no material conflict between appellees\u2019 averments that they are in possession and have been deprived of possession; both are substantially true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>as they would be if a bomb, instead of a Coca-Cola sign, had been put on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Apart from anything in the lease itself to limit it, a lease of a building includes the external walls. Apparently this has never been disputed, but with respect to a lease of part of a building, <em>e. g., </em>a room or a floor, contentions to the contrary have often been made. In most cases the same rule has been held applicable to a lease of part of a building or an entire building. <em>Lowell v. Strahan, </em>145 Mass. 1, 12 N. E. 401, 1 Am. St. Rep. 422; <em>Riddle v. Littlefield, supra; Goldfoot v. Welch, supra. </em>Without so holding, the New York Court of Appeals has held that the tenant of a floor may enjoin his landlord from putting an advertisement on the outside wall of the tenant\u2019s floor. Judge Cardozo said: \u201cThe defendant would have us hold that, without redress, the space occupied by a lawyer may be advertised by signs as devoted to the promotion of a gold mine, and an institute of learning as a wareroom for a proprietary medicine. We are unwilling to believe that the tenant is so helpless.\u201d <em>Stahl &amp; Jaeger v. Satenstein, </em>233 N. Y. 196, 135 N. E. 242, 243, 22 A. L. R. 798. See also note, and cases cited, 22 <em>A. L. R. 800.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In the case at bar it is not necessary to construe the lease and decide whether appellees are entitled to paint or otherwise put advertising on the south wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention against jurisdiction in equity is equally untenable, though it might have been arguable a century ago. <em>Amelung v. Seekamp, </em>1838, 9 Gill &amp; J. 468. Appellees are not required to paint out the sign and sue for damages, and to that end to obtain the consent of the adjoining occupant. It has long been recognized that, though a \u201cfugitive and temporary\u201d trespass will not be enjoined, a continuing trespass will be enjoined if it \u201cwould be ruinous or irreparable, or would impair the just enjoyment of the property.\u201d <em>Story, Equity Jurisprudence </em>(1835; 13th Ed., 1886), Sec. 928; <em>White v. Flannigain, </em>1852, 1 Md. 525, 54 Am. Dec. 668; <em>Chesapeake Brewing Co. v. Mt. Vernon Brewing Co., </em>107 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>528, 68 A. 1046 (tenant against landlord and another),; <em>Baltimore Butchers Abattoir &amp; Live Stock Co. v. Union Rendering Co., </em>179 Md. 117, 120, 17 A. 2d 130 (tenant against landlord). As Judge Cardozo\u2019s words indicate, there is no adequate remedy at law for making an electrical appliance building a Coca-Cola advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
