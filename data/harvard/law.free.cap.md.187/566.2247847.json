The bill was filed by the purchaser against the vendors. The demurrer was sustained on the ground that \u201cthe contract is too vague and indefinite to be enforced and no amendment of the bill could remedy this defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The contract was prepared on a printed form of \u201csales contract\u2014Maryland\u201d supplied by a Washington printer, said by plaintiff at the argument to have been \u201cdrafted over a long period of time, with many changes from time to time,\u201d and to have been filled in by defendants\u2019 agent. On its face the form was prepared for real estate brokers. Whatever the merits or demerits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the printed form, in this instance it was not filled in very carefully. The contract, dated January 16, 1946, was signed by plaintiff\u2019s agent and \u201caccepted\u201d and countersigned by plaintiff and defendants as their \u201ccontract.\u201d It acknowledges receipt from plaintiff of a \u201cdeposit\u201d of $500, \u201cto be applied as part payment of the purchase\u201d of specified property at Landover Hills, Md., \u201cupon the following terms of sale:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">. \u201cTotal price of property <em>Eight Thousand Four Hundred </em>. . . Dollars <em>($8400.00).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201cThe purchaser agrees to pay <em>Three Thousand Four Hundred . . . </em>Dollars <em>($8400.00) </em>cash at the date of conveyance, of which sum this deposit shall be a part.</p>\n<p id=\"ASef\">\u201cThe purchaser is to [assume, give,] place, [take] title subject to, a first deed of trust secured on the premises of <em>same as above Five Thousand and 00/100 . . . </em>Dollars <em>($5,000.) </em>due <em>Monthly, </em>1946, bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, payable-.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">\u201cThe balance, of deferred purchase money is to be secured by a XXXXXXXX deed of trust on said property, to be paid in monthly installments of XXXXXXXX Dollars ($XXXXX) or more, including interest at the rate of XXXX per cent per annum, each installment when so paid to be applied, first to the payment of interest on the amount of principal remaining unpaid and the balance thereof credited to principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\u00abI\u00bb *|\u00bb H\u00bb \u00abH</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201cWithin <em>day of settlement </em>days from the date of acceptance hereof by the owner, or as soon thereafter as a report on the title can be secured if promptly ordered, the seller and purchaser are required and agree to make full settlement in accordance with the terms hereof.\u201d * * * (Printed words stricken out shown in brackets, and matter filled in italicized.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">The full \u201cterms of sale\u201d in the printed form cover a familiar method of finance, which was effective in stimulating real estate \u201cbooms\u201d before 1929 and in impoverishing \u201cdevelopers\u201d after the booms collapsed. The purchase money was provided for in three unequal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>parts, (1) cash, in an amount inadequate to make the balance secure, (2) a first mortgage (e.g., to a savings bank or insurance company), believed to be adequately secured, which furnished additional cash for the vendor, and (3) a junior purchase-money mortgage for the balance, which was not adequately secured. This printed form contains a separate paragraph for each of these three elements. <em>Supra. </em>If the purchaser \u201cassumes\u201d or \u201ctakes title subject to\u201d such a first mortgage, the vendor in effect receives the amount of the mortgage. If the purchaser \u201cgives\u201d or \u201cplaces\u201d such a mortgage to a third person, it is not in terms stated that the proceeds shall be paid to the vendor, but this is clearly implied when the sum of items (1), (2) and (3) is the amount of the \u201ctotal price of property.\u201d If the terms are part cash with a purchase-money mortgage for the entire balance, the second paragraph should be stricken out and the third filled in\u2014or the third might be stricken out and the second filled in as a mortgage to be given to the vendor. If the terms are all cash, the second and third paragraphs should be stricken out, since the vendor is not then interested in where the purchaser gets the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In the instant case we think the terms are all cash, but plaintiff expected to obtain part of the money by \u201cplacing\u201d a mortgage on the property. The draftsman of the contract stated this irrelevant fact by filling in the second paragraph for $5,000 and the first for $3,400 (leaving the third blank), instead of filling in the first for $8,400. Filling in the second paragraph was unnecessary but innocuous. Perhaps \u201cgive\u201d a mortgage might suggest giving it to the vendors, but \u201cplace\u201d a mortgage normally means merely to obtain a loan on mortgage. This is the meaning of the second paragraph when the third is filled in; we think it has the same meaning when the third is left blank. It is, therefore, immaterial whether a contract to \u201cgive\u201d the vendors a mortgage for $5,000, \u201cdue monthly, 1946,\u201d bearing interest at 5 per cent per annum, would be too indefinite to enforce; we do not mean to suggest that it would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The lower court held the contract unenforceable because of indefiniteness of the terms of payment, viz., that under the contract plaintiff, having paid $3,400 and \u201cplaced\u201d a $5,000 first mortgage, is \u201cat liberty to pay the proceeds to the vendors or use them for any other purpose.\u201d For reasons already stated, we think this is not the true construction of the contract. The proceeds of the $5,000 mortgage, plus the $3,400, amount to the full purchase price. If the proceeds are not to be paid to the vendors, then there is no provision at all for payment of the purchase price and the purchaser pays nothing but receives $1,600 from the mortgage. If the proceeds are to be paid to the vendors, then the purchase price is to be paid in full and the paragraph in question, the one preceding and the one following (left blank) all bear a consistent relation to one subject, payment of the purchase price. If the words of the contract were susceptible of two constructions, one of which would produce an absurd result and the other would carry out the purpose of the contract, the latter construction should be adopted. To be specifically enforced, a contract must be definite and certain in all its terms and free from all ambiguity\u2014but need not be worded with logical precision or in grammatical and rhetorical construction. <em>Trotter v. Lewis, </em>185 Md. 528, 45 A. 2d 329, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The lower court cited <em>Bond v. Weller, </em>141 Md. 8, 118 A. 142, and <em>Tarses v. Miller Fruit &amp; Produce Co., </em>155 Md. 448, 142 A. 522, in which contracts were held too indefinite to be specifically enforced. In <em>Bond v. Weller </em>the contract, after stating the purchase price and specifying that it was to be paid in certain instalments, provided that \u201cA building association loan\u201d was to be \u201csecured\u201d by the vendee and the balance was to be \u201ccarried\u201d by the vendor \u201con a second mortgage with interest.\u201d The court said this was \u201ca distinct undertaking on the part of the vendee to pay part of the purchase money by a loan to be obtained by him from a building association, and a like undertaking on the part of the vendor to accept a second mortgage.\u201d 141 Md. 11, 118 A. 143. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>contract was held indefinite and uncertain only because it failed to state the respective amounts of the building association mortgage and the second mortgage. In <em>Tarses v. Miller Fruit &amp; Produce Co. </em>the contract provided: \u201cVendor agrees to take back a second mortgage of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars for one year,\u201d to bear interest at 6%, payable quarterly, \u201cat and for the price of ninety-two hundred dollars ($9,200.00)\u201d, of which $500 had been paid and the balance was to be paid, \u201cCash within sixty (60) days.\u201d The contract was held uncertain in failing to indicate (1) the property on which the second mortgage was to be given, <em>i.e., </em>whether the property purchased or other property, and (2) if the former, the amount of the first mortgage, <em>i.e., </em>whether limited to the balance of the purchase money ($7,700). Moreover, the decision was based not only on indefiniteness but also on long delay in seeking enforcement. In the instant case the contract leaves no uncertainty as to the amount of the mortgage or the property to be subject to it\u2014though both are irrelevant, since the sale is a cash sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\n<em>Decree reversed, with costs, and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
