Y. Supp. 780, and five like, cases, at special term, by Mr. Justice BEACH, and his determination was announced in a single opinion, which is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b792-11\">Prior to the act of 1892, and under section 292 of the Penal Code, the written consent of the mayor could be given to the employment of a child in certain ways mentioned. By the act of 1892, entitled \u201cAn act to amend section 292 of the Penal Code, relative to the licensing of children in theatrical exhibitions,\u201d the consent of the mayor was extended to include such exhibitions. The third subdivision of section 292 specifies certain of the prohibited acts in these words: \u201cThird.\u2014In singing or dancing, or playing upon a musical instrument, or in a theatrical exhibition, or in any wandering occupation.\u201d The question raised in these proceedings is whether or not the mayor can grant a consent for a \u201ctheatrical exhibition\u201d which includes \u201csinging\u201d or \u201cdancing\" by the child. I am of the opinion that he cannot. The intent of the legislature is to be ascertained, and, when settled, followed by the cotut, in construing the enactment. But this intent is not to be gathered from the shifting uncertainties of outside opinion or circumstances, likely to be modified or wholly changed when subjected to proof and judicial examination, but rather from the signs and indications furnished by legislation upon the particular subject then under legislative consideration. Judicial construction is seldom assisted by that applied to other enactments, which is always influenced or controlled by particular verbiage. Such are the cases of Society v. Diers, 10 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 216; Bell v. Mahn, 121 Pa. St. 225, 15 Atl. Rep. 523. There is no doubt that the court can disregard the exact and literal wording of a legislative act, if, upon a survey of the whole act, and the purpose to be accomplished or the wrong to be remedied, 'it is plain that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>exact, or literal rendering of tlie wording would not carry out the intent of the legislature. Bell v. Mayor, 105 N. Y. 139, 144, 11 N. E. Rep. 495. This principle is not directly applicable to the question at bar, because exact and literal wording is not opposed to plain intent. The point involved here relates to the inclusive power of the term \u201ctheatrical exhibition,\u201d relative to \u201csinging\" or \u201cdancing.\u201d These terms are used in the act under review, and the court, to ascertain the legislative intent, is remitted to the use by the legislature of those terms, and the legal effect of that use. The original act, and the act as amended, contained specified prohibited acts. These under the present section, and included in paragraph three, are plainly five in number-. First, \u201csinging;\u201d second, \u201cdancing;\u201d third, \u201cplaying upon a musical instrument;\u201d fourth, \u201cin a theatrical exhibition;\u201d fifth, \u201cin any wandering occupation.\u201d The answer to parts of the argument urged by learned counsel for the defendant and relators is the obvious deduction from the particular specifications that each has a distinct and separate significance, and therefore no one is inclusive of any other. The final clause of the amendment, \u201cbut no such consent shall he deemed to authorize any violation of the first, second, fourth or fifth subdivisions of this section,\u201d is of little aid to judicial construction. The third subdivision is not named, but the reason for its omission is that a violation of its parts was authorized when consent of the mayor was obtained. This applies only to the term \u201ctheatrical exhibition,\u201d leaving singing, dancing, playing upon a musical instrument, and wandering occupation in the same status as the other subdivisions. The substitution of the word \u201cdancing\u201d for \u201cdancer\" seems to indicate an intention to enlarge the scope of a prohibition beyond a signification applicable only to a professional. It is also apparent that the third subdivision was properly omitted, because it includes what is subject to a consent by the mayor, to wit, playing on a musical instrument at a concert, and theatrical exhibitions. The court is of opinion that the tenor of the act, its title, and specific designations, by explicit words, will not permit the inclusion of singing and dancing by the words \u201ctheatrical exhibition.\u201d There are under the latter term many acts not harmful or inappropriate, within the limit of children\u2019s efforts, and such may be permitted. Those of singing and of dancing are excluded, in the wisdom of supreme legislative authority, which cannot and should not be overruled by the courts, especially when exercised with the humanitarian object of protecting those who, from youth and consequent inexperience, are unable to guard and protect themselves. The motions for a mandamus are denied, the writs of habeas corpus and certiorari discharged, and the prisoner remanded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b793-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The opinion of Mr. Justice BEACH at the special term fully answers all the questions sought to he raised upon this appeal, and, concurring, as I do, in the views expressed by him, I am of the opinion that the order denying the motion of the relator for a writ of peremptory mandamus should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b793-9\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1C\">In concurring with the opinion of Mr. Justice LAWRENCE herein, I think it is proper that a word or two should be said in respect to some points which have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>made upon this appeal, and which do not appear to have been discussed in the opinion o\u00ed the court below. Section 292 of the .Penal Code reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cSec. 292. A person, who employs or causes to be employed, or who exhibits, uses, or has In custody tor the purpose of exhibiting or employing, a female child apparently or actually under the age of fourteen years, or a male child apparently or actually under the age of sixteen years, or who having the care, custody, or control of such a child as parent, relative, guardian, employer or otherwise, sells, lets out, gives away, or in any way \u25a0procures or consents to the employment or exhibition of such a child, either (1) as a rope or wire walker, dancer, gymnast, contortionist, rider, or acrobat; or (2) in begging or receiving alms, or in any mendicant occupation; or (3) in peddling, singing or playing upon a musical instrument or in a theatrical exhibition, or in any wandering occupation; or (4) in any indecent or immoral exhibition or practice; or (5) in any practice or exhibition dangerous or injurious to the life, limb, health or morals of the child; is guilty of a misdemeanor. But this section does not apply to the employment of any child as a singer or musician in a church, school, or academy, or in teaching or learning the science or practice of music, or as a musician in any concert with the written consent of the mayor of the city, or the president of the board of trustees of the village, where such concert takes place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In 1892 this section of the Penal Code was amended so as to -read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cAn act to amend section two hundred and ninety-two of the Penal Code, relative to the licensing of children in theatrical exhibitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">\u201cApproved by the governor April 15, 1892. Passed, three-fifths being present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cThe people of the state of New York, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">\u201cSection 1. Section two hundred and ninety-two of the Penal Code is hereby amended so as to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\">\u201c \u2018See. 292. A person who employs or causes to be employed, or who exhibits, \u2022uses, or has in custody, or <em>trains </em>for the purpose of <em>the. exhibition, use or employment of,, any child </em>actually or apparently under the age of <em>sixteen </em>years; or who having the care, custody or control of such a child as parent, relative, guardian, employer, or otherwise, sells, lets out, gives away, so trains, or in any way procures or consents to the employment, <em>or to such training, or use, </em>or exhibition of such child; <em>or who neglects or refuses to restrain such child from such training, or from engaging or acting, </em>either (1) as a rope or wire walker, gymnast, <em>wrestler, </em>contortionist, rider or acrobat; <em>or upon any bicycle or similar mechanical vehicle or contrivance; </em>or (2) in begging or receiving <em>or soliciting </em>alms <em>in any manner or under any pretense, </em>or in any mendicant occupation; <em>or in gathering or picking rags, or collecting cigar stumps, bones or refuse from marks's; </em>or in peddling: or (3) in \u25a0singing; <em>or dancing; </em>or playing upon a musical instrument; or in a theatrical exhibition ; or in any wandering occupation ; or, (4) in any <em>illegal, </em>indecent or immoral exhibition or practice ; <em>or in the exhibition of any such child when insane, idiotic, or when presenting the appearance of any deformity or unnatural physical formation or development; </em>or (5) in an.y practice or exhibition or place dangerous or injurious to the life, limb, health or morals of the.child, is guilty of a misdemeanor. But this section does not apply to the employment of any child as a singer or musician in a church, school or academy; or in teaching or learning the science or practice of -music; er as a musician in any concert, <em>or in a theatrical exMb'tion. </em>with the written consent of the mayor of the city, or the president of the board of trustees of the village where such concert <em>or exhibition </em>takes place. <em>Such consint shall not be gimen unless forty-eight hours\u2019 previous notice of the application shall have \u2022 been served in writing upon the society mentioned in section two hundred and ninety-three of the Penal Code, if there be one within the county, and a hearing had thereon if requested, and shall be revocable at the will of the authority giving it. It shall specify the name of the child, its age, the names and residence of its parents or guardians, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number><em>\u25a0the nature, time, duration and number of performances permitted, together with the place and character of the exhibition. But no such consent shall be deemed to authorize any violation of this section.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cSec. 2. This act shall take effect on the first day of September, eighteen hundred and ninety-two.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The changes in the phraseology are few, and are shown by the italics in the Code as cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">It is claimed upon the part of the appellants that under the .act in question the mayor has a right to license children to sing and dance in theatrical entertainments; and our attention is called, for the purpose of aiding us in the construction of the act under consideration, to what are called notorious facts in connection with the emendation of the section of the Code in question. It may be a misfortune that the court is entirely unfamiliar with these notorious facts, and hence cannot seize upon them to aid it in the construction of the act. If it is true that this amendment was the result of a compromise between the advocates of different Views in reference to the propriety of the employment of children to sing and dance in theatrical entertainments, as - claimed by the appellants, and that it was understood that under this amendment such employment, as long 'as sanctioned by the mayor or president of the trustees of the village where such entertainment should take place, was permissible, it would seem that the advocates of the restricted right had been more expert in the use of language than were the advocates of the more liberal views, because a very brief consideration of the section as amended will show that there is no room for the construction claimed by the \u2022appellants. As has been seen, by section 292, as amended, any person who\u2014First, employes or consents to the employment of a child under the age of 16 years as a rope or wire walker, etc.; second, employs\u2019 or consents to the employment of such child in begging, etc.; third, employs or consents to the employment of such child \u201c\u2019in singing; or dancing; or playing upon a musical instrument; or in a theatrical exhibition; or in any wandering occupation;\u201d or, fourth, employs or consents to the employment of such child \u201cin any illegal, indecent or immoral exhibition or practice,\u201d etc.; or, fifth, employs or consents to the employment of such child \u201cin any practice or exhibition or place dangerous or injurious to the life,\u201d etc.,\u2014shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The section then goes on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">\u201cBut this section does not apply to the employment of any child as a singer or musician in a church, school or academy; or in teaching or learning the science or practice of music, or as a musician in any concert or in a theatrical exhibition, with the written consent of the mayor of the city,\u201d- etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Under the third subdivision above spoken of, the employment of such child in singing or dancing, or playing upon a musical instrument, or in a theatrical exhibition, or in any wandering occupation, is an offense against the statute. \u00a1Now, when the child, is to be permitted to appear in certain classes of entertainments, and in a certain capacity 'in such entertainments, the connection -of the phrases is entirely different, although the same words are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>used, to some extent. For example, in the permissive part of the fifth clause it states, \u201cBut this section does not apply to the employment of any child * * * as a musician in any concert or in a theatrical exhibition;\u201d the word \u201cmusician\u201d qualifying both the subsequent clauses of the sentence. But, when they desire to separate the different classes of doings, they use the proper signs. For example, Avhen they desire to separate singing from dancing, they place a semicolon between the two phrases, and, when they desire to separate playing upon a musical instrument from appearing in a theatrical exhibition, they put a semicolon between them, in order to show that they are independent phrases, having no relation, the one to the other. But in the fifth clause, when they come to determine the cases in which the child may be exempt from the general prohibition contained in the previous part of the section, they specify the name and character of the performanc\u00e9 which it was the intention of the legislature to exempt, viz. \u201cas a singer or musician in a church, school or academy; or \u2018in teaching or learning the science and practice of music; or as a musician,\u201d\u2014where? \u201cIn any concert, or in a theatrical exhibition.\u201d This seems to show clearly what was the intention of the legislature, and that .the whole permissive part of subdiidsion 5 related to the musical question, and nothing else; and therefore the word \u201cmusician,\u201d in the phrase under consideration, qualified both concert and theatrical exhibition. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">O\u2019BRIEN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
