It appeared that a married couple, named N., had visited the hotel, and, with the help of some wine, projected a visit to the state fair. Complainant went there, driving with Mrs. N. Defendant and N. drove together, and they met in the city at an hotel, where defendant registered a fictitious name. After a good deal of wine at the hotel and elsewhere, N. proposed that they all sleep together. While the men were talking aside, Mrs. N. took complainant to a bedroom, and told her to go to bed. After she had gone to sleep, defendant came in and spent the .night with her. Complainant testified that she had never had connection with a man before. Defendant bought her a dress, and the next night they went to bed in like manner, more or less drunk, without having been to the fair. Next day they went home, staying over at N.\u2019s house, where they drank whisky. Complainant returned to defendant\u2019s hotel the following day. Defendant admitted voluntary connection, and the purchase of the dress and other things, for which he said complainant asked him. There was some conflicting evidence as to previous misconduct between the parties. <em>Held </em>sufficient evidence to support a conviction under Pen.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhbA\">In August, 1891, the defendant kept an hotel in the village of Bridgeport. He sent for Lilly Long to come to his hotel, and employed her, and she commenced her services on the 17th of August. In the month of September, Nunn and his wife visited the hotel, and, while spending an evening there, some wine was procured, and a conversation held in respect to going to the city of Syracuse to attend the state fair, which was to be held there in September. Mrs. Nunn suggested that they could stop at her cousin\u2019s, on Bear street. On Monday, the week of the fair, Mrs. Nunn sent word by the defendant, Brown, that she would be ready to start Tuesday morning. On that morning, September 15th, Lilly Long went to Mrs. Nunn\u2019s, and joined her, and they started for the city of Syracuse', driving a horse. Brown and Nunn started together, and overtook them, and passed them. When Mrs. Nunn and Lilly reached the city, they drove to the Clarendon Hotel, and found Nunn standing out in front. They alighted, and went up into the sitting room, and Brown and Nunn followed, taking some wine, and they all four of them partook thereof, and had dinner shortly after. Free use was made of wine thereafter by the parties while they were together for some three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>days in the city of Syracuse. Apparently, Lilly first protested against the use of wine, but was assured by Mrs. Nunn that it would do her no harm. During the afternoon, Nunn made some solicitation or proposition to Lilly which she rejected, and they went to Gang\u2019s saloon, and obtained a meal, and were supplied with more wine. Apparently, they remained there until near 11 o\u2019clock at night, when the four went back to the Clarendon Hotel, and from there to another saloon, kept by a woman, at which they had more to drink. Then they returned to the hotel, and Nunn made some proposition that they all sleep together. After some conversation had between the two men one side, Mrs. Nunn took the complainant into a bedroom, and told her to go to bed, and left her there. The complainant undressed, and went to bed, and, shortly after she had gotten to sleep, the defendant Brown approached her room, opened the door, \u201cand that woke\u201d her up. The complainant testified, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-5\">\u201cBrown spent the night with me there, and had sexual intercourse with me that night. I had never had intercourse with any other person before that night. In the morning Brown said, T wonder if Nunn has gone home yet\u2019 He said if he got me in trouble, that I could asli Mrs. Nunn, and she would see about getting me out. He said he wondered if Arthur had signed his right name; and I says, \u2018Why, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 and he said, \u2018IP. B. Baker.\u2019 I saw Mrs. Nunn that morning in her bedroom. She occupied room 26 on the second, flight. That was on the floor above number 6.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">It appears also by her testimony that the four parties stayed at the hotel, partaking of wine, and that the defendant would get it sometimes, and sometimes Nunn, and that they remained at the hotel until dinner time. They went out onto the streets Wednesday after dinner, and the defendant bought a dress for Lilly, and then the four went back to the hotel, and the defendant hitched up his horse, and took Mrs. Nunn and Lilly to a saloon, where they remained until evening. When they returned to the Clarendon, they went into the sitting room, and apparently they were all somewhat intoxicated. After the complainant went to bed, the appellant visited her room, and occupied the room with her that night. \u201cNunn and Mrs. Nunn stayed in' number 1, on the same floor with number 6, that night.\u201d None of the parties visited the fair. They started to return to Bridgeport Thursday, and the complainant and Brown rode together until they approached the village, and just beyond Messina; Springs, when they all went to Mrs. Nunn\u2019s house, some time after midnight, where they were supplied with whisky. The complainant remained there all night, and she returned to Brown\u2019s hotel on Friday afternoon, and worked that afternoon. In the course of defendant\u2019s testimony, he admits occupying a room with the complainant on Tuesday night. He states, however, that when he reached her room\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-7\">\u201cShe got up and unlocked the door, and I went in, and went to bed, and stayed there all night. When I got in the room the girl was getting into bed. She was disrobed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">And, in referring to the second night, he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>\u201cI got the key of my room at the office, and the girl went to bed first. In \u25a0twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards, I went to bed. When I got up to the room, Miss Long was in the room. She had her clothes off, and must \u25a0have been in bed. The door was locked that night, and I knocked. She wanted to know who was there, and I told her, and she got up and unlocked it. After I got in there was nothing of any account said between us that I remember. * * * After we went to bed that night, she told me that Nunn had been to the room, and that she wouldn\u2019t let him in. She said that Arthur had been to the room, but he couldn\u2019t get in while I was around there. I remained all night with her, and got up perhaps eight o\u2019clock the next morning. We all four had breakfast there at the hotel. We was around the city as usual that day.. * * * I bought her a dress there. She asked me for some money at the Clarendon. She said she wanted while here to get a dress and some things, and I told her to go to Dey\u2019s and get what she wanted, and I would happen around there, and pay for it, and she and Mrs. Nunn went up th\u00e9re, and before they came out I went up, and they had got their \u25a0stuff, whatever it was, and I paid for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\">The defense made to the charge contained in the indictment seems to have been upon the. theory that the complainant was not \u2022 of previous \u201cchaste character,\u201d and, to substantiate it, the defendant testified that, previous to the occasion of being at Syracuse with her, he had perpetrated several acts of sexual intercourse with her in his hotel, and he called witnesses who gave evidence tending to show she had allowed sexual int\u00e9rcourse prior to the excursion to Syracuse. Such evidence was contradicted. The complainant testified that defendant had intercourse with her Tuesday night in the Clarendon Hotel, and that she \u201chad never had intercourse with any other person before that night.\u201d After seeing the witnesses and hearing all the evidence, the jury have found a verdict of guilty. There was such a conflict in the evidence that \"it was for the jury to ascertain where the truth was, and to determine the questions of fact presented at the trial. We cannot \u25a0say the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence. It was natural that the jury should distrust and disbelieve the evidence \u25a0given by the defendant and his witnesses as to the acts of sexual intercourse alleged against her, and a want of chastity of the complainant prior to the occasion of the defendant\u2019s intimacy and intercourse with her at the Clarendon Hotel. We.are not inclined to disturb the verdict upon the questions of fact presented to the jury by asserting our belief of the defendant\u2019s testimony, instead \u25a0 of the evidence furnished by the prosecution. Section 282 of the Penal Code provides that \u201ca person who * * * (2) inveigles or entices an unmarried female of previous chaste character into a house of ill fame, or of assignation, or elsewhere, for the purpose \u2022 of prostitution or sexual intercourse, is guilty ,of abduction.\u201d As already intimated, we think there was evidence before the jury which warranted them in finding all the material facts required to bring the defendant\u2019s case within the provisions of the statute. People v. De Leon, 109 N. Y. 226, 16 N. E. Rep. 46. We think there \u25a0 was sufficient evidence given tending to corroborate the complainant, and that the trial judge was warranted in saying, as he did, in the course of his charge: \u201cIt is for you to say whether this ..girl has been corroborated, or, in the language of the statute, sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>ported.\u201d People v. Brooks, 131 N. Y. 321, 30 N. E. Rep. 189; Pen. Code, \u00a7 283; People v. Brandt, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 419; People v. Everhardt, 104 N. Y. 594, 11 N. E. Rep. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The appellant insists that a new trial should be had because of alleged errors committed upon the trial by the court, and we must consider the exceptions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">1. It was not error to allow the complainant to state the interview she had with Mrs. Nunn, in the presence of the defendant, when talk was had as to the excursion to be made to Syracuse or the fair, and that on that occasion all four of the parties drank together. Nor was it prejudicial to the defendant to allow the complainant to state that, when she and Mrs. Nunn reached the city, she inquired where they were to stop. It was the theory of the prosecution that Nunn and his wife were acting in concert with the defendant, and it was proper to show the acts and doings when carrying forward the plans to visit Syracuse, and what took place between them while acting together under a plan which the defendant had helped form, and facilitated the execution thereof. The remark of Nunn, in the absence of the defendant, to the complainant, tended to show the relations he held to her; and, though it be said to have been improperly received, it did not prejudice the defendant. People v. Gonzalez, 35 N. Y. 49; People v. Brooks, supra; Code Crim. Proc. \u00a7 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">2. The complainant testified that Wednesday evening, after the four returned to the Clarendon Hotel, some one of them spoke about going to bed. She was then asked, \u201cWho spoke about going to bed?\u201d This was objected to by the defendant, and the objection overruled, and the defendant excepted. She answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-8\">\u201cNunn did. He wanted us all to sleep together again, and then that Brown . said he wouldn\u2019t. * * * I sat down in a chair, because I was so dizzy, and sick to my stomach, and then in a little while she told me to go to bed, and shut the door, and went out. I was intoxicated then. Mr. Brown came in the room that night, and occupied the room with me that night. Nunn and Mrs. Nunn stayed in number 1, on the same floor with number 6, that night.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">The evidence was properly received, as it bore upon the conduct of the defendant, and tended to establish the important elements of the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">3. Defendant testified that he registered at the Clarendon as \u201cF. OB. Baker.\u201d His counsel asked him, \u201cWhy did you register that way?\u201d It was objected to, and the objection sustained. In his cross-examination he testified, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-11\">\u201cAt -the time I registered, I had concluded that I would have sexual intercourse with this girl, and wanted to stay over night. I registered under the name of Baker because I didn\u2019t want to do anything to hurt myself or the reputation of the girl. I didn\u2019t want everybody to know I was there, and on account of my wife. I thought of my wife a good many times. It first occurred to me that I wanted to put Baker down on account of my wife when I signed my name. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to hurt anybody\u2019s reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">It would seem that he was allowed to and did sufficiently elaborate upon the reason why he registered \u201cthat way,\u201d and the exception ought not to avail the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>4. The acts and declarations of defendant testified to by Eva Fox in her cross-examination tended to show defendant\u2019s intimacy with and. relations to the complainant, and to some extent bore upon the witness herself unfavorably, and were not improper on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">Some other rulings are referred to in the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant. We have looked at them, and are of the opinion that they do not present prejudicial error, and that, under the rule laid down in section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we ought not to disturb the verdict by reason thereof. People v. Burns, 33 Hun, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">In the course of the charge delivered by the trial judge, he referred to section 282 of the Penal Code, repeating its language to the jury, and also informing them that the indictment charged the defendant with having enticed Lilly Long to visit Syracuse and the Clarendon Hotel for the purpose of sexual intercourse, \u201cshe then being an unmarried female, of previous chaste character.\u201d He then repeated the issues for the jury to consider, and he defined a portion of the statute by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-7\">_ \u201cTo inveigle, entice, persuade, induce,\u2014they all have a meaning of about a similar character; all those words have. And you readily apprehend what the language of the statute means when it states that a person who inveigles or entices another, an unmarried female of previous chaste character. Now, chastity, in law, has a plain, simple meaning. It relates to the question whether a woman has improper sexual relations with a man or not. In the case of an unmarried woman, it relates to the question whether she has had sexual intercourse with any man or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">He then further commented upon the evidence, informing the jury that it was for them to say whether the girl was corroborated, and in that connection he called their attention to section 283 of the Penal Code, and while commenting upon that he very properly observed, as we think, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-9\">\u201cAs to that particular branch of \"the case, the defendant himself corroborates her,\u2014that he did have sexual intercourse with her. But that is not the offense charged; it is only a fact in the case from which you may draw such conclusions as may logically follow as to the purpose of her being taken to that hotel. Now, as to whether there is any supporting evidence or not upon the question of her being enticed or inveigled to come here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">Then he somewhat in extenso referred to other evidence tending to corroborate the testimony of the complainant, and left the question to the jury to determine whether she was corroborated or supported by other evidence. In that respect his charge was in accordance with the rule laid down in People v. Everhardt, supra. We think no error was committed in refusing to charge the jury that they must find that there was a conspiracy between the defendant and Nunn and Ms wife \u201cby which the girl Long was to be inveigled into the hotel or some other place for the purpose of sexual intercourse or prostitution.\u201d The court understood the request to be that he was requested to charge: \u201cIf Brown is not shown to have enticed her, then, in older to convict, they mus\u00ed show a conspiracy.\u201d It is to be borne in mind he had already Charged the jury that, if Brown had inveigled or enticed the girl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>for the purposes of prostitution or sexual intercourse, the offense was made out as to him. We think the position taken by the trial judge was sufficiently favorable to the defendant, and that the judge properly refused to charge \u201cthat the jury would not have the right to find from the evidence that the defendant personally and alone induced the girl, or enticed and inveigled the girl, Long, into the hotel for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse.\u201d It was for the jury to determine the questions of fact involved in the request. We think the defendant failed to obtain an exception to any refusal to charge, or to any part of the charge as delivered, which requires us to interfere with the verdict. The great trouble with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the jury believed the complainant, and such evidence as was brought tending to support her version of the matters referred to and involved in the charges contained in the indictment, and failed to believe the testimony of the defendant and of such witnesses as he called tending to support his theory of the case. Conviction, order, and judgment of the court of sessions of Onondaga county affirmed, and the clerk directed to enter judgment, and certify a copy of the entry to the clerk of Onondaga county, pursuant to section 549 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
