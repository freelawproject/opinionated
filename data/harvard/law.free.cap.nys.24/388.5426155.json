This is a test case to determine whether members of the Manhattan Athletic Club are liable in law for their semiannual dues, payable in advance, January 1, 1893, the club having suspended in February, 1893, because of insolvency, and gone into the hands of a receiver. The Manhattan Athletic Club was organized in 1878, under the authority of chapter 267 of the Laws of 1875, entitled \u201cAn act for the incorporation of societies or clubs for certain lawful purposes.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aet8\">Judgment for plaintiff.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b404-11\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
