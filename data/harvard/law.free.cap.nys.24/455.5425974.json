I will and direct that all my just debts and funeral expenses be paid by my executors so soon as conveniently may be done after my decease. Second. I give and bequeath to my dearly beloved wife, Matilda Anne Withers, all my wines, liquors, and family stores which may be in the possession and use of myself and my family at the time of my decease, forever. Third. I bequeath to my son Alfred D. Withers the interest now accrued, and which shall hereafter accrue during the residue of his natural life, upon the two bonds and mortgages,\u2014one made by Caleb La Grange (his wife uniting in the mortgage) to John B. Montgomery, to secure the payment of five thousand dollars and interest, dated the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, by said Montgomery assigned to the Poughkeepsie Savings Bank, and by said bank to me; and the other made by my said son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Alfred. D. Withers (his wife uniting in the mortgage) to George W. Berrian, Junior, of the city of New York, to secure the payment of eight thousand dollars and interest, and by the said Berrian assigned to me; said mortgages being upon the farm now occupied by my said son in the town of Vestal, in Broome county, in this state. And it is my wish that no step shall be taken by my executors for the collection of the principal of said mortgages during the life of my said son, so long as he shall continue to occupy the said farm, and shall execute'such papers as may be advised by counsel, and required by my said executors, to prevent the debts from being barred by any statute of limitations; and, In the case of the collection of said principal sums during the life of my said son, I give him the interest accruing thereon during his lifetime, such principal to be invested by my executors, and the interest collected and applied to his use by them. From and after the death of said son, I give and bequeath the said principal sums to his descendants then living, in equal shares, per stirpes, and not per capita, to them, their executors and administrators, forever. Fourth. I give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real and personal, which I am now seised or possessed of, or entitled to, or which I may be seised or possessed of, or entitled to, at the time of my decease, to my executors hereinafter named, to have and to hold to them as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common, upon the trusts and with the powers following, that is to say: Fifth.

Sixth.

Fifteenth. I hereby declare that the reasons why -no provision is made for my son David Dunham Withers, and no greater provision for my son Alfred D. Withers, are that my son said David Dunham Withers is already wealthy in his own right,\u2019and that 1 have already made large advances to my son Alfred D. Withers. Sixteenth. I hereby constitute and appoint my son David Dunham Withers, and my friends James M. Waterbury, of the city of Brooklyn, and George R. J. Bow\u2022doin, of the city of New York, executors of, and trustees under, this, my will. Lastly. I hereby revoke and annul all former and other wills by me at any time heretofore made, declaring this, and none other, to be my last will and testament.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b475-4\">The following is the opinion of Mr. Justice- PATTERSON at special term:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">The main question, and the only one requiring special consideration, in this cause, relates to the construction to be given to that clause of the will of Mr. Reuben Withers by which the trusts for three of his daughters, and the descendants of a fourth, are created. They date from the death of the testator\u2019s widow, which occurred in 1879. Notwithstanding the ingenious argument of the counsel for the New York Security &amp; Trust Company, I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>persuaded .that under the ninth and subsequent clauses of the will, and from the structure of the whole instrument, it was the intention of the testator to have each of these four trusts consist of a specific sum of twenty thousand dollars, in money value only, and that the executor would have performed his whole duty had he so established those several trusts by investing the amount of each in any authorized court security, and that had he done otherwise, and a loss resulted, he might well have been held to accountability for it. The residuary estate, for the purposes of these trusts, was to be diminished by $80,000. If, to constitute them, it was necessary to realize that sum, even at the cost of the whole of such residuary applicable under the will, the executor would have been protected in doing so. A specific gift of the securities of the estate as they might stand in executors\u2019 hands at the death of Mrs. Withers could not have been contemplated, for there was a power of sale; and it is impossible that the testator could have imagined, even, how the estate would be invested at the death of his widow. These four amounts were fixed capital sums, to be securely invested, without reference to the preservation intact, or the actual allotment in specie, of securities held by the executor. Nothing contrary to this, however, is to be inferred from the retention by the executor of the securities in the same form of investment in which they existed at the time of Mr. Withers\u2019 death; and he took the risk of that, and, by assent of all, paid interest for years to the beneficiaries on the several sums, without reference to what each class of securities earned. I am convinced that these trust sums are not to be augmented by any increase in value of the particular securities of the whole estate on the theory that portions of those precise securities should have been devoted to constitute the investment of each separate trust fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b476-5\">Argued before YAH BRUHT, P.
