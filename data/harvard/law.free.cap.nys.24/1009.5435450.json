J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfB\">Plaintiff\u2019s 10-acre lot was in part flooded by the wrongful acts of the defendant in opening a ditch, and letting the water therefrom onto the lands of the plaintiff. There was ample evidence to sustain the allegations in the complaint as to the wrongful acts of the defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was amply supported by evidence given before the jury. Alter a careful inspection of the evidence, it is difficult to discover proof indicative that more than 4 acres of the plaintiff\u2019s 10-acre lot were flooded. Charles Reichert, a son of.the plaintiff, was sworn in his behalf, and testified, viz.: \u201cThe water was let in onto the oat field, and flooded about half of the lot.\u201d Again he says: \u201cThere was probably a third of the ten acres covered with water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\">2. When the plaintiff was upon the stand as a witness he was allowed to testify, viz.: \u201cIf land had not had the water turned onto it, it would be worth $14 or $15 an acre. I seeded it and sowed it. It would not be worth enough to pay for the labor, with the water turned on through the ditches.\u201d The appeal book states, viz.: \u201cThe above testimony was received under the defendant\u2019s objection to each and every part thereof, duly taken, as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and not the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>rule or measure of damages.\u201d Thereafter, in the course of the cross-examination of the plaintiff, he stated: \u201cThe rental value of land is five- or six dollars an acre. This land is like the rest of the farm; worth no more per acre.\u201d Anthony Ball was called by the plaintiff, and allowed to testify, against the objection of the defendant, in answer to the following question: \u201cWhat would the rental value of this land be, per acre, if it was fitted for crops for the year 1890, provided it was dry, and not flooded?\u201d His answer was, \u201cNine dollars per acre.\u201d And then he was allowed to answer the following question: \u201cAssuming that the land was fitted on the 27th of April, and was flooded, and flooded May 6th and 10th so as to be covered with water so a crop could not be sown until May 26, 1890, what would be the rental value, under those conditions?\u201d The question was objected to and overruled, and the witness answered, viz.: \u201cThe land would not be worth anything. You cannot raise a crop of oats upon land which has been flooded, sowed at that time of the year. Oats should be sown in April, as early as you can get them in.\u201d Lambert Barton testified in behalf of the plaintiff, viz.: \u201cThe rental value of this land, after being fitted, would be worth $9 per acre.\u201d Then the following question was put to him: \u201cAssuming this land was flooded April 27th, May 6th and 10th, what would be the rental value?\u201d Against the defendant\u2019s objection, he was allowed to answer, and said: \u201cThe part that was flooded would not be worth anything. This land is loam, with clay subsoil. Flooding of such land makes it hard, and unfit for taking the seed. It will dry and crack. Oats should be sown in April. Oats sown after May 20th would be a failure.\u201d The witness Joh testified that it was worth to fill up-the ditches, each time, a dollar. In Easterbrook v. Railway Co., 51 Barb. 94, an action was brought for injuries done to the plaintiff\u2019s premises by water, in consequence of a diversion of a stream from its channel by the defendants in constructing a culvert; and in that case Smith, J., said: \u201cThe measure of damages, in that class of cases is the depreciation in the value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, occasioned by the injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d In Chase v. Railroad Co., 24 Barb. 273, which was an action brought to recover damages for injuries done to plaintiff\u2019s grounds by water alleged to have been turned onto the plaintiff\u2019s land, it was said: \u201cIt is proper to charge the jury that the rule of damages in that class of cases is the difference between the value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises before the injury happened and the value immediately after the injury, taking into the account only the damages which have resulted from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d In Argotsinger v. Vines, 82 N. Y. 309, which was an action for trespass for cutting and removing timber, it was held \u201cthat evidence was properly received as to the value of the farm with the timber, and its value after it was cut, and that this difference furnished a proper measure of damages.\u201d In section 937 of Sedgwick on Damages, it is said: \u201cIn estimating the value of a crop, the prevailing rule seems to be to take its ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>tuai value at the time of trespass, not its probable value, assuming that it would have matured.\u201d 8th Ed., vol. 3, p. 50. If it be assumed, upon all the evidence, that a fair value of the use of the land for the year 1890, which was lost to the plaintiff by reason of the flooding thereof, amounted to $9 per acre, then the evidence, that indicates that not more than five acres, at most, were flooded, would give as a result of that item, estimated in that mode, $45. If to that be added a dollar each time the ditch was filled up,\u2014say three times,\u2014the damages would be, apparently, $48. It is quite apparent that by reason of the rulings complained of the verdict was excessive. Upon the argument before us the learned counsel for the plaintiff admitteu the force of the foregoing view of the case, and proffered a stipulation to reduce the damages. In section 3063 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that \u201cthe appellate court must render judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors or defects, which do not affect the merits. It may affirm or reverse the judgment of the justice, in whole or in part, and as to any or all of the parties, and for errors of law or of fact.\u201d And in section 3066 a rule for the award of costs is regulated, and in the fifth subdivision of that section it is provided: \u201cIf the judgment is affirmed only in part, the costs or such a part thereof, as to the appellate court seems just, not exceeding $10, besides disbursements, may be awarded to either party.\u201d Under all the circumstances of the case, it seems reasonable to modify the judgment of the county court and of the justice\u2019s court so that there shall be awarded a recovery of only $48 damages to the plaintiff, with $10 costs and disbursements in the county court, with costs of the appeal to this court to the appellant. Judgment of the county court modified as stated in the opinion, and as so modified affirmed, without costs to either party of appeal to this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
