Afterwards, some of the tenants moved out, and defendant, with notice of plaintiff\u2019s claim, relet the apartments, with the mirrors in them, to other tenants. <em>Held, </em>that it was error to dismiss the complaint on the ground that plaintiff did not show that defendant was in actual possession of the mirrors.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-11\">Appeal from jury term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-12\">Action by James G.

A review of the whole case has satisfied me, however, that the complaint should not have been dismissed at all. Under the chattel mortgage, plaintiff\u2019s title and right to immediate possession of the mirrors were complete. The mirrors were simple chattels, and the foreclosure sale of the real ^property to the defendant conveyed to him no right to or interest in the said mirrors. McKeage v. Insurance Co., 81 N. Y. 38. Moreover, the plaintiff gave public notice of his claim at the foreclosure sale. Now, it may be conceded that the defendant did not become liable for a conversion of the mirrors simply because he purchased the premises, and subsequently refused to deliver up the mirrors on plaintiff\u2019s demand. Plaintiff was bound to prove, as part of his case, that, prior to the demand made, the mirrors, or so many of them as he sought to recover for; had come into the possession of the defendant, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the defendant had wrongfully taken them prior to the commencement of the action. At the time' the defendant acquired title to the premises the mirrors were in- different apartments in the building, occupied by tenants to whom the apartments had been let by defendant\u2019s predecessor in title together with the mirrors, and these-tenants attorned to the defendant as their landlord. As long as-these tenants remained in possession during their respective unexpired terms, the defendant could not, and in fact did not, acquire-possession of the mirrors. If, therefore, the proof ended here, there would be no liability on the part of the defendant. But there was evidence to the effect that some of these tenants shortly thereafter removed from their apartments, and that thereupon the defendant, through an agent, relet the said apartments to other tenants, together with the mirrors in them. Further evidence which plaintiff desired to give upon this point was excluded by the trial judge, against plaintiff\u2019s exception. It must therefore be assumed that, if he had been permitted, the plaintiff would have fully established the point. The proof would then have been sufficient to show that the defendant took possession of the mirrors of these particular-apartments, and assumed and exercised control and dominion over-them, to the exclusion of plaintiff\u2019s rights, although he had notice-of them, and to this extent a conversion would have been established, within the authorities, irrespective of the demand which was made-upon the defendant. The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant, to abide the event..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
