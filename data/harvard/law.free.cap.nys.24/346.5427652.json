Huntley.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-17\">The note was transferred by Huntley to, and is now the property of, Esther -A. Bentley. On May 1, 1887, Byron L. Huntley died intestate, leaving a widow and several minor children. On December 19, 1887, letters of administration were issued to Josephine B. Huntley, the widow of the intestate, and Vose W. Palmer. The administrators advertised for claims against the estate of decedent for six months, commencing November 29, 1888. On the 24th day of June, 1889, Vose W. Palmer, one of the administrators, filed a petition for a final settlement of the accounts of the administrators, and such accounting was thereafter had, the account having been filed November 6, 1890; and a decree settling the accounts of the administrators was filed and entered in the surrogate\u2019s office on that day. By the account, \u2022 and decree made thereon, it appears that the administrators received, in assets, the sum of $980: that claims of creditors had been presented and allowed, Including the claim of Esther A. Bentley, to the amount of $1,850.09; .and that there was $241,73 in their hands, which by said decree was ordered ;paid to said creditors ratably. This proceeding, for the disposition of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>property of the deceased for the payment of debts, was commenced November 10, 1890, by the administrators, by filing a petition in this court, which alleged, among other things, that the deceased was the owner, in his lifetime, of certain real estate, upon which was a mortgage, which subsequent to his death was foreclosed, and a surplus arising therefrom, amounting to $1,101.41, paid to the county treasurer of this county; that the debts of decedent amounted to $1,608.36, exclusive of interest, and that the personal property of decedent was insufficient to pay his debts: that the decedent left a widow, one of the petitioners, and three minor children, his heirs, named Lee Huntley, Adell Huntley, and Estella Huntley. Upon the hearing for the proof of claims in this proceeding, Esther A. Bentley appeared, and, upon offering proof of her claim, the special guardian of the infant heirs filed and interposed an answer pleading the statute of limitations, viz. \u201cthat the cause of action and claim now presented as aforesaid arose and accrued more than six years before the commencement of these proceedings.\u201d Proof was given of the making and ownership of the note; that it had been presented to the administrators, and admitted by them to be a valid claim; and that upon the final accounting they had paid upon the note $232.29.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-5\">Charles D.

The statute of limitations affects only the remedy. Kincaid v. Richardson, 25 Hun, 237; Rogers v. Murdock, 45 Hun, 30; Rose v. Henry, 37 Hun, 397; Johnson v. Railroad Co., 54 N. Y. 416. In the cases of Kincaid v. Richardson and Rose v. Henry it is held that the statute of limitation only affects the remedy by action, and that execution may issue on a judgment, although an action thereon would be barred by the statute. It is also held in Rose v. Henry that statutes of limitation must be strictly construed, and it would seem to be the duty of the court to save the claim from the bar of the statute, unless it appears that the clear and necessary construction of the various provisions applicable forbids. Section'.382, Code Civil Proc., provides that an action upon a contract obligation or liability, or an action to recover upon a liability created by statute, must be brought within six years, and \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d may be read for \u201caction,\u201d in the same provision. Section 415, Code Civil Proc., provides that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cThe periods of limitation prescribed by this chapter, except as otherwise specially prescribed therein, must be computed from the time of the accruing of the right to relief by action, special proceeding, defense, or otherwise, as the case requires, to the time when the claim to that relief is actually interposed by the party as a plaintiff or defendant in the particular action or proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">In this case a right to maintain an action (not a special proceeding) arose April 4, 1893, against the decedent; and, had he lived, that right of action would have existed six full years, and have been as perfect the last day of the six years as the first. Huntley died May 1, 1887, and personal representatives were appointed, who took title to his personal property, and who were liable to be sued, in the place of decedent, upon the cause of action against him. The right to that relief was based simply on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tlie fact that Huntley had not performed what he had contracted to do, and the relief to be sought was the judgment of the court that the plaintiff recover the sum which Huntley had contracted to pay. It did not become necessary in this case for the creditor to obtain a judgment against the administrators, in order to exhaust the personal property of decedent in payment of his claim, for the claim, on presentation, was admitted, and the creditor\u2019s share of the personal estate afterwards paid to her, in due course of administration. The statute of limitations commenced running-against an action on April 4, 1883, because an action might then have been brought. When did the statute of limitations commence running against this special proceeding? When did the right to relief by this proceeding accrue to this creditor? In considering-the question of when the \u201cright to relief\u201d by this special proceeding accrued, the nature of the relief may well be examined. The relief is equitable in its nature, and very comprehensive. It comprises the tailing and sale, under the direction of the court, of all the real estate of which the decedent was seised at his death, whether in the hands of his heirs or devisees, or their grantees, and the equitable distribution of the money derived from such sale, in payment of the claims existing against the decedent at the time-of, and which survived, his death, and among all parties equitably entitled thereto. The proceeding is against the land. The necessary parties are the creditors, all persons interested in the land,, and the personal representatives of the decedent. The facts which must exist, and be established, in order to entitle a party to the-relief, are the death; the appointment of personal representatives,-. the existence of claims against decedent, valid at the time of his death, to an amount that the personal assets applicable will be-insufficient to pay; and \u201cthat all the personal property of the decedent which could have been applied to payment of the decedent\u2019s debts and funeral expenses has been so applied, or that the executors or administrators have proceeded with reasonable diligence-in converting the personal property into money, and applying it to-the payment of those debts and funeral expenses, and that it is insufficient for the payment of the same; \u201d -and that the decedent was the owner, at the time of his death, of the land sought to be taken. The existence of these facts gives the right to relief. Can the right to relief be said to have accrued until these facts all exist?' Did the statute of limitations commence running, as against this, right of relief, until these facts existed?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In Mead v. Jenkins, 95 N. Y. 31, the facts were as follows: The claim was due February 11, 1871, and the intestate died March 19, 1871. Letters of administration were granted April 14, 1871. The proceedings in question were commenced February 6, 1880. The administrators accounted on the 17th day of October, 1877. The court, upon these facts, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cThe proceedings here could net he commenced until after the accounting, and hence the statute did not commence to run until the accounting, in 1877. The proceeding was commenced February 0, 1880, about two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>after the accounting, and the statute had not then run-, so as*to constitute a bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">The case of Merritt v. Reid, 13 N. Y. Wkly. Dig. 453, was an action on a note for six months, dated August 7, 1872. The action was commenced October 14, 1879. The note was made by a corporation called the Manhattan Sewing-Machine Company, and the defendant was a stockholder of that company. By the provisions of the statute a stockholder could not be made liable for .a debt of the company unless an action to recover the debt should be brought against the company within a year from the time the debt became due, and judgment recovered in such action, and execution issued upon such judgment returned unsatisfied. Execution was returned unsatisfied October 23, 1873, upon the judgment against the company. The defense was the six-years statute of limitations, and in the trial court it was sustained. The court, on appeal, held that, as the return of execution unsatisfied against the corporation was a prerequisite to an action against a stockholder, the right of action against him did not accrue, and the statute did not commence to run, until the return of the execution, and that the action was brought in time. It would follow from this case that, if the claim was a valid and enforceable one at the time when the new right of relief arose upon it, the new right of relief would not be lost at the expiration of six years from the time when the note was due. The same doctrine is stated in' Duckworth v. Roach, 81 N. Y. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Upon the foregoing considerations, and the authority of Mead v. Jenkins, I should be of opinion that the claim of Esther A. Bentley is not barred by any statute of limitations, were it not for the case of Church v. Olendorf, 49 Hun, 440, 3 N. Y. Supp. 557, which was decided in this department in 1888. The case of Mead v. Jenkins, 95 N. Y. 31, is cited and recognized as authority for the proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cAs the law stood prior to September 1, 1880, the respondent could not have \u25a0commenced such a proceeding as this until after the executor or administrator had rendered his account, and thus such a proceeding was stayed, by statutory prohibition, until September 1, 1880.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">It seems difficult to distinguish, as to statutory prohibition, between the requirement that an accounting shall be had before this proceeding be commenced and the requirement, as the law stands now, that letters of administration shall have been granted, .and the further requirement that the personal estate shall have been applied to the payment of the claims, or that in effect. It may be claimed that the case of the issuing of letters as a prerequisite differs from the case of an accounting, because the creditor can himself apply for letters. But so could the creditor, as the law stood prior to 1880, apply, after 18 months, for an accounting; and in the case of Mead v. Jenkins the accounting was more than six years and six months after letters were issued. It seems clear, therefore, that the question of whether or not the rimming of the statute of limitations is suspended by statutory prohib\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tian is not t\u00f3 be determined by the diligence or loches, or, in truth,, any action, of the creditor. Why, then, should the running of the statute in Olendorf\u2019s. Case have been suspended until September 1,. 1880, and not after that, and until letters of administration were issued? Were it not for the decision in the Olendorf Case, it would seem to me more reasonable to say, in view of section 415,. that the running of the statute is not suspended, but that the statute, as against this relief and remedy, does not commence-to run until, at least, after letters are issued. But controlled, as I am, by the authority of the Olendorf Case, I must hold that the claim of Esther A. Bentley is barred, in this proceeding, by the-statute of limitations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
