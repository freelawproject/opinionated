Such was the fact, and a new note of issue and a new notice of trial were necessary to bring on for trial the issue presented by the amended pleadings.' Ostrander v. Conkey, 20 Hun, 421. But the point was made on the motion, and is renewed here, that the usual practice had been waived, by stipulating that the date of issue should be December 29, 1891. We do not so understand the stipulation. At the time it was made the complaint had been served, and in extending defendants\u2019 time to plead plaintiff\u2019s attorneys inserted therein, \u201cDate of issue to be of this date.\u201d The issue referred to was, of course, the issue to be joined by the service of the pleading which the defendants were obtaining time to prepare. Subsequently the issue was joined by the service of a demurrer. It was afterwards tried, and the trial resulted in favor of the defendants. That issue, which was the one appearing on the calendar, was therefore at an end. It was with reference to it, and not to the issue subsequently created, that the parties stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-18\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
