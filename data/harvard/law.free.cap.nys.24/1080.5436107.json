Y. Supp. 696, followed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1096-10\">Appeal from special term, Onondaga county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1096-11\">Action by Alfred Higgins against Jacob Crouse to rescind a sale of corporate stock, and to recover the price thereof.

I will deny the motion.\u201d The defendant took an exception. A similar motion was made at the close of the evidence, and an exception taken. Several requests to find were refused by the trial judge, and exceptions to the refusals, and also to the findings as made, were filed. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendant perpetrated a fraud upon him in 1865, in making representations as to 150 shares of the capital stock of the Shaffer Farm Oil Creek Company of Pennsylvania, sold by the defendant to the plaintiff for the sum of $1,200, and seeks to have that sale set aside and canceled, and to recover of the defendant the $1,200, and interest thereon. The answer contained denials, and a defense of the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1096-13\">Argued before HARDIN\", P.

Y. Supp. 696. Ho additional evidence, sufficient to take the case away from the principle laid down in the decision made upon the former appeal, was given. It is therefore the duty of this court to adhere to the decision made then, and, applying it to the case before us, it leads to a new trial. See Higgins v. Crouse, 63 Hun, 134, 17 N. Y. Supp. 696; Foot v. Farrington, 41 N. Y. 164; Weaver v. Haviland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>68 Hun, 376, 22 N. Y. Supp. 1012; Corn v. Rosenthal, (Com. Pl. N.
