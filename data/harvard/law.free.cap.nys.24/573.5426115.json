Stetson &amp; Go., with an authorized capital of $2,700,000, and for as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sociating the defendants with the enterprise, out of which they realized large profits upon the sale of the stock, from which profits the $59,000 became payable. In other words, the defendants became a sort of syndicate' to float the stock, and the moneys the members made were largely the result of the plaintiff's introduction, influence, and efforts. The defendants want an itemized bill of the various services rendered,\u2014how, when, to whom;, of the different requests made by the defendants, and which of them; whether-oral or in writing, etc. The evident object of the bill is to limit the plaintiff\u2019s proofs at the trial. The action being on a special contract to pay a specific sum for particular services rendered, the items would not seem to be necessary. Their performance required successive acts, all contributing' to a completion, and the plaintiff cannot be required to particularize each service so contributing. Johnson v. Mallory, 2 Rob. (N. Y.) 683; Betts v. Betts, 4 Abb. N. C. 324; Cady v. Potter, 55 Barb. 464. A party should never be required to make specification of matters which from their inherent character are not capable of exactitude, or\" which constitute evidence rather than substantiate facts. Another consideration is that the ordering of bills of particulars must be cautiously exercised, that the plaintiff may not be unreasonably embarrassed at the trial by being limited to the identical particulars stated. Many instances of this kind have occurred lately, wh: re the parties had to be remitted to special term for relief. It is proper, therefore, to raise the danger signal. The motion will be granted so far as to require the plaintiff to specify whether any of the agreements or requests are in writing, and, if so, their date, tenor, and effect, and by whom signed. This-is almost transcending the border line. In other respects the motion will be denied. No costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b590-5\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.
