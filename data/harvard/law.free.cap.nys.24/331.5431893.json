It decided, upon the entire proofs, that the attachment should be vacated, and committed no error in reaching that \u25a0conclusion. The order made by the supreme court January 26,1893, -appointing a temporary receiver of the defendant\u2019s property in proceedings for a voluntary dissolution of the corporation, did not disable the defendant from moving to vacate the attachment. See Parry v. Opera Co., 12 Civil Proc. R. 194; Button Co. v. Sylvester, (Sup.) 22 N. Y. Supp. 891. This upon the ground that a corporation so \u00a1situated is like a debtor who makes a general assignment before \u25a0or after the attachment,\u2014either may make a motion to vacate be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>cause of the residuary interest in the proceeds of the attached property after the creditors are paid.
