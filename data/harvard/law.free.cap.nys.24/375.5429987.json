In the case at bar the decision filed contained no such explicit directions, and certainly did not state that any judgment should be entered dismissing the complaint in this action on the merits, whatever might have been the intention of the learned judge who tried the cause. We think, therefore, that the motion should have been granted, striking out from the judgment the words, \u201cupon the merits.\u201d The order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion granted, with $10 costs of appeal and disbursements, and $10 costs of motion and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
