Contract to Produce Opera\u2014Action for Breach.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbCb\">Xu such action it appeared that defendant agreed to produce at his theater at a certain time an opera, of which plaintiffs were proprietors, and pay them a certain royalty. Plaintiffs were to furnish certain neces- \u25a0 sary material by a specified time, previous to its production. For part of such materials, defendant was to \u201cadvance\u201d a sum stated. The popularity of an opera on exhibition when such a contract was made, and! which plaintiffs\u2019 was to follow, exceeded the expectations of all parties, and it was kept on exhibition by defendant much longer than originally-contemplated. Defendant did not \u201cadvance\u201d such sum, and plaintiffs did not furnish such material at the time agreed on, but they all treated the contract as a continuing one. <em>Held, </em>that defendant could not avoid damages for final refusal to produce the opera on the ground that time was of the essence of the contract, and plaintiffs had failed to furnish the materials at the time specified.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b711-6\">3.

From a judgment refusing to grant the injunction, but awarding damages to plaintiffs, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ADin\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b711-10\">The opinion of McADAM, J., at the equity term, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-11\">The plaintiffs are the owners of the opera entitled \u201cThe Maid of Plymouth;\u201d Thome being the composer of the music, and Greene the author of the libretto. On June 19, 1891, the parties agreed that the defendant should have and acquire all acting rights in the opera for the United States and Canada during a specified time. That this gave the defendant the exclusive right, is clear, and no negative clause was required to effectuate that purpose. The agreement provides that the defendant shall produce the opera at the Garden Theater, of which he was manager, following the opera then on exhibition there, entitled \u201cLa Oigale,\u201d which ran until February 13, 1892. Instead of producing the plaintiffs\u2019 opera, after February 13, 1892, the defendant permitted Richard Mansfield to produce a repertoire of plays under the defendants\u2019 management The ostensible object of the action, as shown by the bill of complaint, was to obtain an injunction enjoining the defendant from continuing the use of his theater contrary to the covenant with the plaintiffs. It prays for injunctive relief, and damages as well. The defendant, in his answer, objects to the remedy invoked, upon the ground that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law, and an objection of like purport was again taken in limine, at the trial, by a demand that the issues be tried by a jury. While satisfied that the action is not one in which injunctive relief should be granted, that conclusion, not self-evident, was reached only after judicial investigation and consideration. No&gt; motion to dismiss was made, either at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, or at the conclusion of the trial. The question now is whether the court at equity-term should retain the action, and award damages, in such a controversy, or must remand it to that part of the court wherein issues of fact are triable by a jury, or, of its own motion, dismiss the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-12\">In Van Rensselaer v. Van Rensselaer, 113 N. Y., at page 213, 21 N. E. Rep. 75, the court said: \u201cThe case was tried at special term. At the outset the defendants objected to the tribunal as an improper one for the trial of any question involving a personal judgment against either of the defendants, and demanded that if such question was to be tried it should be by a jury trial. The objection was not that the case, as disclosed by the pleadings, was only triable by a jury. It looked not to the case as presented by the complaint., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>hut as it might possibly be decided at tbe end. Such an objection is wholly unsound. It' conceded that the action, as it came into court, was of an equitable character, as it certainly was, but insisted that, If the final relief 'was to be a personal judgment, the case was one for a jury. A court of equity does not in that manner lose its jurisdiction, and, having once acquired it, retains it to the end, even though it may turn out that adequate relief is reached by a merely personal judgment. That is not uncommon occurrence.\u201d See, also, Lynch v. Railroad Co., 129 N. Y., at page 280, 29 N. E. Rep. 315.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-5\">Assuming that the principle declared in the cases cited is applicable here, and that this branch of the court may retain the action, and determine the issues, we proceed to consider the facts: The plaintiffs were to have for their labor certain royalties after the opera was produced, and the agreement provides that it on the 1st day of February, 1892, the defendant shall not have already produced said opera, he shall pay to the' plaintiffs the sum of $2,000, which shall be in full payment for the first fifty performances to he given by him. The bill as to injunctive relief is, not insisted upon, and the contention has finally resolved itself into an effort to recover the specific sum. The main defense is that the contract called for the delivery by September 1st of the materials to produce the opera viz.: Band parts, leader\u2019s score, twenty or more vocal scores, also diagrams of both scenes, and the plates of all costumes for principals and chorus; also, cuts, drawings, or designs of all properties. The plaintiffs failed to perform this provision of the contract, and it is claimed that, as a consequence, no action by them will lie for a breach of the defendant\u2019s agreement to pay. But strict performance of this provision was waived by the defendant. For the drawings, the defendant was to advance $200, which was to he deducted from the first fees due to the plaintiffs under the contract</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-6\">The meaning of the term \u201cadvance\" is that the defendant was to pay $200 before it would otherwise have become due. Webster\u2019s Dictionary. The defendant never paid or advanced any part of this money. It was a condition precedent on Ms part, and the plaintiffs could not be put in default until such sum was first advanced. Mansfield v. Railroad Co., 102 N. Y. 205, 6 N. E. Rep. 386; Dannat v. Fuller, 120 N. Y. 554, 558, 24 N. E. Rep. 815. The band parts, leader\u2019s score, and a number of the vocal scores had been prepared, and were ready for delivery, and libretto was complete. Indeed, they were used at rehearsals even before the date of the contract. The additional material involved merely the mechanical work of copying and designing, which would have taken but a few days to complete. Conceding that time was of the essence of the contract, and there was no waiver in respect thereto, the defendant had the right (1) to elect to rescind the contract for failure to deliver the materials on or before September 1, 1891; or, (2) to elect to continue the contract in force. The plaintiffs, by their simple, failure to deliver the materials, did not put an end to the contract, although their default might have given the right to the defendant to elect to rescind. If he elected to rescind, it was incumbent on him to make, Ms choice promptly. See Lawrence v. Dale, 3 Johns. Ch. 23, 42; McNevin v. Livingston, 17 Johns. 437; Hunt v. Singer, 1 Daly, 209, affirmed 41 N. Y. 620; Meyer v. Hallock, 2 Rob. (N. Y.) 284; Starbird v. Barrons, 38 N. Y. 230, 237; Hennessy v. Bacon, 137 U. S. 78, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17. The defendant did not elect to rescind, however, but determined to continue the contract in' force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-7\">The opera of \u201cLa Oigale\" had proved a great success, and defendant was in no hurry to withdraw it from the public; and, as the \u201cMaid of Plymouth\u201d was to be produced at the same theater, it could not be accommodated until \u201cLa Oigale\u201d had been withdrawn, and hence there was seemingly no hurry on either side in asserting rights, making demands, or pressing tenders. Feeling this way, and acting accordingly, the defendant wrote Mr. Thorne, under date of September 5, 1892, (five days after the alleged default:) \u201cYour favor of September 3d to hand. I shall be glad to see you when you get here, wMch will he in ample time for the band parts.\u201d The defendant\u2019s letter refers only to the \u201cband parts,\u201d and it is urged that the waiver applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>nothing, else. The contract was entire and indivisible, and the defendant thus knew of the failure to deliver the other material. He did not complain of delay, take the. position that the plaintiffs were in default, or that the contract was at an end. On the contrary, there was, as he expressed it, \u201cample time.\u201d Conversations were had between the parties after this,\u2014one as late as January, 1892, in which the defendant said that the plaintiffs had better read their contract; they would get their $2,000, but he expected the material. By electing to continue the contract in force, the defendant retained his rights under it until September 1, 1893. He evidently intended to regard the contract as a subsisting obligation, and one that might ultimately prove beneficial to him. A defendant is not bound to take advantage of a delay or forfeiture, and there may be a waiver, if there be conduct indicating an intention to waive a condition as to time, \u201calthough there are no new considerations, and although there may be no technical estoppel.\u201d Prentice v. Insurance Co., 77 N. Y. 483, 488; Goodwin v. Insurance Co., 73 N. Y. 480, 493; Titus v. Insurance Co., 81 N. Y. 410; Sinclair v. Tallmadge, 35 Barb. 602, 606. Where time is waived a party is not put in default until he has demanded performance, and thus restored time as an element of the contract. Lawson v. Hogan, 93 N. Y. 39, 41; Wallman v. Society, 45 N. Y. 485; Leaird v. Smith, 44 N. Y. 618; Owen v. Evans, (N. Y. App.) 31 N. E. Rep. 999; Dillon v. Masterson, 42 N. Y. Super. Ct. Rep. 176. When the parties entered into the agreement they contemplated that \u201cLa Oigale\u201d would soon come to a close, and \u201cThe Maid of Plymouth\u201d follow it, and it, in turn, was to be followed by Richard Mansfield. The defendant was at this time anxious to secure the plaintiffs\u2019 opera. The agreement so recites, and all the circumstances point to the same fact. But \u201cLa Oigale\u201d continued its hold on the favor of the public much longer than was expected. The success continued until the advertised time for Richard Mansfield to make his appearance came around, and there was no longer room for the \u201cMaid of Plymouth.\u201d The play was not then wanted; it had been crowded out by the circumstance stated; and thus it was that the defendant in January, 1892, finally announced his determination not to produce it at all. This was a complete change of front on the part of the defendant, and a surprise to the plaintiffs. That the plaintiffs were anxious to carry out their part of the contract is apparent all through the case. They did not want to crowd the defendant, or even appear to do so, but they never intended to abandon their contract, or relieve the defendant from its obligations. There was substantial performance on the part of the plaintiffs, and, but for the acts of the defendant, there would have been literal performance. Certain legal results follow the defendant\u2019s acts: (1) Where a party gives a reason for his conduct or decision touching anything involved in a controversy, he cannot, after litigation has begun, change his ground, and put his conduct upon another and different consideration. He is not permitted to mend his hold. He is estopped from doing it by a settled principle of law. Railroad Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U. S. 258, 267. And see Gould v. Banks, 8 Wend. 562; Holbrook v. Wight, 24 Wend. 169; Everett v. Saltus, 15 Wend. 474; Wright v. Reed, 3 Term R. 554; Duffy v. O\u2019Donovan, 46 N. Y. 223; Winter v. Coit, 7 N. Y. 288. Next, when the defendant finally announced that he would not produce the opera at any time, the plaintiffs were absolved from the necessity of any formal tender or offer of performance on them part. Shaw v. Insurance Co., 69 N. Y. 286; Gray v. Green, 9 Hun, 334; Carter v. Scargill, L. R. 10 Q. B. 564, 567. That the defendant was not put in default promptly by a formal tender was no doubt owing to the fact that the plaintiffs wanted their opera produced, and by the defendant at his theater. These were paramount considerations. They preferred this to a forfeiture of any kind. It was understood by the parties (all professional men) that, until \u201cLa Cigale\u201d was formally announced to be withdrawn after a certain date, there was no hurry about the plaintiffs\u2019 opera, or its accompaniments. Time was not, therefore, regarded by either party as of the essence of the contract. Indeed, viewed in the light of the circumstances all the parties knew that it was not and could not be so regarded; and they acted on this interpretation of the agreement until the defendant formally announced his intention not to perform any portion of it oh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Ms part, except that, perhaps, relating to his obligation to pay the $2,000 specified in it. In actions at law, though not in equity, time is regarded as of the essence of the contract, (Schmidt v. Reed, 132 N. Y., at page 113, 30 N. E. Rep. 373; Chit. Cont. [lltti Amer. Ed.] 433,) yet' where time does not go to the root of the matter, and the acts of the parties evidence, as they do here, the fact that it is not to be regarded as of the essence of the contract, it will violate no legal principle to give effect to the evident intention of the parties,\u2014a feature that controls the interpretation of all contracts. TMs principle was carried to great lengths in Bettini v. Gye, 1 Q. B. Div. 183, in which the contract provided that Bettini, a singer, should be in London, \u201cwithout fail,\u201d at least six days before the commencement of his engagement, for the purpose of rehearsals. The plaintiff did not arrive in London until two days before the engagement. The defendant, Gye, an opera manager, sought to escape liability under the contract upon the plea that time was of the essence, but Mr. Justice Blackburn ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment. The decision in this case is not put on that ground, but upon the more substantial one of waiver by the defendant, which, under the evidence and the authoritative adjudications on the subject, relieve the plaintiffs from all imputation of neglect or default. The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for $2,000, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b714-5\">Argued before FREEDMAFT and GILDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b714-6\">Dittenhoefer &amp; Gerber, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b714-7\">Seward, Guthrie, Morawetz &amp; Steele, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b714-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A6t\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, upon the opinion of the learned judge at the equity term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
