She demanded an examination, upon which the charge was fully sustained, and she was thereupon held to await the action of the grand jury in default of $500 bail. Immediately, writs of habeas corpus- and certiorari were issued out of this court. The warden returned the body of the prisoner with th\u00e9 commitment, and the magistrate returned the complaint, warrant of arrest, and testimony taken on the hearing. Thereupon the appellant demurred specially to the returns, alleging that\u2019 the statute was unconstitutional, and that, upon the conceded facts, no offense had been committed. After hearing argument, Justice Andrews dismissed the writs, and remanded the prisoner, upon the grounds stated in his opinion. \u00bb</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b516-14\">Argued before VAN BBUNT, P.

The opinion of Mr. Justice Andrews, at the special term, fully covers the case, and it is unnecessary to add anything to the reasoning therein contained. It therefore results that the orders appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
