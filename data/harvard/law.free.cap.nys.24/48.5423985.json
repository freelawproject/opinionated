Since 1884 the plaintiff has been a manufacturer and dealer in cigars in the city of New York. In 1876 the defendant was incorporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut for the purpose of conducting a mercantile agency and collecting and disseminating information in respect to the standing and condition of persons engaged in business within the United Statqs and dominion of Canada. In the course of its business, the defendant for many years has published printed volumes containing the names of persons, firms, and corporations engaged in. business, the kind of business in which engaged, and their place of business, and also showing their supposed financial standing and business reputation. The defendant, in the course of its business, delivers a copy of this book to every one of its subscribers. On the 12th of January, 1885, the litigants entered into a written contract, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-17\">\u201c(129) Original.

Cigars. Michigan, Detroit. 163 Grand River Ave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">\u201cUpon a close investigation of this case it is found that such a party, who-is described as a light-complexioned man, aged about 35 or seven years, rented a small space in front room at above location during the latter part of Sept, last of Geo. R. McDonald, who occupies the place as a plumbing shop and dwelling, at a rental of $2 per month. He paid his rent as agreed upon, but said very little about himself, except that he admitted that he was a married man, and claimed to be making $10 or more a day. No information was, however, volunteered as to his previous abiding place or business. Was in and out every day or so, looking for mail or other matter, and replenishing his satchel from the occasional packages of goods which came to the store for him, the last one of which he emptied about six weeks ago, since which time nothing has been seen or heard of him.- He left no directions as to his mail matter either with McD. or with P. O. authorities. The Cartage Co. who delivered the goods looked for him first at No. 63 Grand River, the mdse, having been billed out to that number, but, not finding him, were referred to the one above. The different packages were receipted for and charges paid by Mrs. McDonald at B.\u2019s request, he having exhibited bills of lading to the Cartage Co., who eventually got his acknowledgment on all of the receipts except the last one, in which instance they deemed to have neglected the matter. The last delivered to the above address was one case of cigars via. Blue Line, way bill 3351, Canada Southern Line. Car No. 15,099. Left N. Y. Oct. 16th, arrived here Oct 20th, and was delivered same day. A comparison of signature on copy of letter inclosed with that of Herman Brinker, 573 Russel St., shows no similarity. Over 200 of these were carefully examined at his. bank, where a savings account has been kept ever since 1876. Aside from this, he is not a man who would become a party to any such transaction as above named.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">\u201cDec. 24, 1885.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">\u201c60, 12-24-1885. 27-3.

Xiques: The correctness of this report is not guarantied, but, having been obtained by us in good faith, from authorities deemed reliable, it is transmitted to you in strict confidence, for your exclusive use and benefit, and in accordance with the terms of the contract existing between us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-18\">\u201cRespectfully, The Bradstreet Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">This action was brought to recover the value of the samples first shipped, and of the cigars shipped pursuant to the order of October 5, 1885. On the trial the plaintiff failed to show that it made any inquiry of the defendant before the shipment of the samples, and he abandoned all claim to recover on account of them. The gravamen of the complaint is that \u201cthe defendant, without any invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>gation or inquiry, and without having any knowledge or information concerning any man of the name inquired after, carelessly and negligently reported that Herman Brinker of Bussell street was worthy of credit.\u201d It is to be observed that by the terms of the contract entered into between the litigants it was expressly stipulated \u201cthat said company shall not be liable for any loss or injury caused by the neglect or other act of any officer or agent of the company in procuring, collecting, and communicating said information.\u201d Under this stipulation the defendant cannot be held liable for the consequences of misinformation, unless it is so grossly negligent in acquiring or communicating it that its conduct in effect amounts to a fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The first question presented for consideration is, ewas the evidence sufficient to raise an issue of fact for the jury as to whether the defendant was grossly negligent in answering the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry? The plaintiff, by his letter of October 7th asked for a report in respect to Herman Brinker, grocer, 63 Grand Biver avenue, Detroit. The defendant\u2019s reply of October 12th related to Herman Brinker, grocer and saloon, 573 Bussell, comer Ohio, Detroit, Michigan. The letters written to the plaintiff by Brinker do not purport to come from a person engaged in business as a grocer, nor, indeed, do they show that the writer was engaged in any business other than as a dealer in cigars. The communication of the defendant did not purport to relate to Herman Brinker of 63 Grand Biver avenue, but distinctly referred to Herman Brinker, a grocer, engaged in business at 573 Bussell street. The plaintiff offered no evidence tending to show that the defendant did not make proper inquiries of its correspondents at Detroit, and the allegation in the complaint that it did not was entirely unsupported by the evidence. It is very plain upon the face of the defendant\u2019s communications that it did not assume to give any information in regard to the financial standing of Herman Brinker of 63 Grand Biver avenue; and, the plaintiff having failed to show that the defendant did not make inquiries, we are unable to see how it can be successfully maintained that he established that the defendant was negligent either in the inquiry which it made or in communicating the information. The nature of the business in which the defendant is engaged is such that reliable information as to the wealth and integrity of persons engaged in business cannot be guarantied. Dealers are often honestly mistaken as to their own financial situations, and the means of others for learning their exact condition are limited, and often uncertain. If the truth could in all cases be learned and reported, those giving credit would seldom, if ever, sustain a loss. All that can be demanded of such a corporation is that it shall make due and diligent inquiries, and furnish the results to its customers. It seems to us that the evidence in this case shows that the defendant made such inquiry in respect to the business standing of the person inquired after, and, failing to find the person described engaged in business at the place designated by the plaintiff\u2019s letter, made a report about another person, engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in a similar business at another place in the same city. The defendant did not guaranty that the person reported was the person inquired after, which appears upon the face of the communications which it sent to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Did the plaintiff, by his negligence, contribute to the loss of his goods? After having received the defendant\u2019s communication, which related solely to a person doing business at No. 573 Bussell street, without making further inquiries, he shipped his goods to a person of the same name, purporting to be engaged in business at No. 63 G-rand Biver avenue. The evidence shows that a man by the name of Herman Brinker was at the time engaged in business at No. 573 Bussell street; that he was in good credit, worth from three to five thousand dollars, and that the information furnished in respect to this person was correct. Whatever of negligence there was in the case was the plaintiff\u2019s in shipping goods to a person at a street and number about whom no information had been given by the defendant. The plaintiff having received reliable information in respect to the standing of Herman Brinker of Bussell street, negligently shipped his goods to a Herman Brinker of 163 Grand Biver avenue, at which place no person by that name was engaged in business. They were delivered by the carrier to some person who called himself Herman Brinker, at No. 163 G-rand Biver avenue. This negligence was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s loss. We think that the trial court correctly ruled that there was no question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b70-7\">VAN BBUNT, P.
