Requests by plaintiffs and by the referee to permit such accountant to examine such books at defendant\u2019s office were refused. Plaintiffs claimed that such examination would show an improper appropriation of defendant\u2019s property and money, and defendant, on an order to show cause, failed to show why discovery should not be made. <em>Held, </em>that an order requiring defendant to permit plaintiffs or their accountant <em>to </em>inspect its books at its place of business was proper.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b231-10\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-11\">Action by Robert Rutter and others against the Germicide Company of New York. From an order directing defendant to produce its books of account and other books containing entries relating to the transaction of its business at its place of business for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the inspection of plaintiffs\u2019 accountant, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A9y\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-3\">The action was brought by the plaintiffs in behalf of themselves and the other holders of defendant\u2019s preferred capital stock to obtain a specific performance of defendant\u2019s contract to pay its preferred stockholders a 6 per cent annual dividend quarterly, and to secure such dividends by the deposit in the defendant company of 15 per cent, of its monthly earnings, and for an accounting. The answer admitted all the material allegations of the complaint, except the allegations that defendant\u2019s net earnings had been sufficient to pay the passed dividends, and that its earnings had habitually been illegally diverted. On the joinder of issue the action was referred to William M. Hoes, Esq., as sole referee, to hear and determine the same, and witnesses were examined before him at four hearings, some of defendant\u2019s books of account being produced by its treasurer, in whose custody they were under subpoena duces tecum. No bookkeeper designated by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was allowed by defendant\u2019s treasurer or by its attorney to examine defendant\u2019s books, although permission to make such examination was repeatedly requested, both by the referee and by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney; and finally the learned referee suggested to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney that he should apply to the court for an order of inspection, and furnished his certificate for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\">Plaintiffs thereupon filed a petition setting forth the importance to them of an examination of the books in question, and containing, in substance, the facts set forth in the following affidavit of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney filed in support thereof:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">\u201cP. H. Vernon, being duly sworn, says that he is attorney for the plaintiffs in the above-entitled action, which is now on trial before William M. Hoes, referee, and that the defendant appeared by Joseph <em>G. </em>Mathews, Esq., its attorney, but has recently been represented on the trial by L. J. Morrison, Esq., as counsel. That in deponent\u2019s opinion it is very important for the interests of plaintiffs that defendant\u2019s books of account and papers should be thoroughly examined by a competent bookkeeper, so that not only its receipts and disbursements, but also the results of its business, and the amounts' of profits realized therefrom from quarter to quarter, may be definitely ascertained; and that in deponent\u2019s opinion a thorough examination of defendant\u2019s books and papers is material and necessary to the proper presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 case to the referee. That on various occasions during the progress of the trial deponent has requested Albert L. Cohn, Esq., the treasurer of defendant, who has the custody of its books and papers, to allow deponent\u2019s representative to examine them, but said Colin has persistently refused deponent\u2019s requests for such examination, and has also refused the request of said referee, that he would allow the representative of deponent to examine said books. That on or about the seventh day of April, 1893, deponent gave to Mr. Otto J. Frickel, a bookkeeper in the employ of Messrs. Sweester, Pembroke &amp; Co., Nos. 374, 376, 378, Broadway, in the city of New York, a letter a copy of which is hereto- annexed, marked 'Exhibit B,\u2019 and that deponent is informed by said Otto J. Frickel, mentioned in said letter, he, said Frickel, took the same to defendant\u2019s office, No. 13 East 17th St., in the city of New York, and delivered the same, in the absence of said treasurer, to Mr. William Law, defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, who was in charge of its office; and that the said Law informed him that he had been instructed to allow nobody to see the books. That afterwards, and on the 12th day of April, 1893, the said referee wrote to said Cohn, and sent to deponent, for delivery to him, a letter, of which a copy is hereunto annexed, marked \u2018Exhibit D,\u2019 by his assistant, Mr. F. N. H. Greaves, to said Cohn, at his law office, No. 280 Broadway, in said city; and that said Cohn informed deponent\u2019s said assistant that he would send a written answer to said letter, but that said Cohn never did so. That on the 19th day of April, 1893, some of defendant\u2019s books of account were produced at referee\u2019s office under a subpoena duces tecum, served upon said Cohn, but that, the referee being inadvertently absent from his office, said Cohn and defendant\u2019s said counsel would not allow said books to be examined by said Frickel, who was present; and, as the referee did not appear within three-quarters of an hour of the hour appointed for the hearing, said Cohn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>had said books immediately removed from said referee\u2019s office. That deponent has examined said William Law, defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, as a witness-before said referee, and that from his testimony it appears that said Coin? owes defendant several thousand dollars for moneys drawn from its funds, and that his brother, Caspar L. Cohn, who was president of defendant in July, 1891, but who went abroad about the end of said July on business in which the said defendant is not interested, and who has remained abroad ever-since, is also indebted to defendant in $800 or $900, at least, for overdrafts of moneys; and that large amounts of merchandise, amounting to several thousand dollars, have been bought and paid for by defendant,. and sent to germicide companies in Boston and Philadelphia, in which said companies-said Caspar L. Cohn is largely interested, and to said Caspar L. Cohn himself' in England, and that defendant has never received payment therefor. That deponent verily believes, from the testimony of said Law, and from such cursory examination of defendant\u2019s books of account as deponent has been, able to make during the progress of the trial, that the profits of defendant\u2019s-business during the periods mentioned in the complaint have been sufficient to -warrant and require the payment of dividends to its preferred stockholders, in pursuance of the terms and conditions under which said stock was sold to plaintiffs by defendant; and that an examination of defendant\u2019s books and papers by a competent bookkeeper will furnish full evidence of the allegations in the complaint, and entitle plaintiffs to a specific performance by-defendant of its contract, according to the prayer of the complaint; and that there are entries in said books of all the matters of which plaintiffs seek a recovery; and that without an examination of said entries plaintiffs cannot,in deponent\u2019s opinion, safely rest their case. That no previous application has-been made for an order to show cause herein, and that, as a hearing in said action has been appointed for the lGth day of May, deponent fears that iff he gives an eight-days\u2019 notice of motion there will not be time for an adequate examination of said books before said hearing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">\u201cExhibit B.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">\u201cDear Sir: The bearer, Mr. Otto J.

That I was detained from my office on April 19th, and did not arrive there until about eleven o\u2019clock, when 1 was informed by a representative at my office that both parties to this action had appeared, and that no stipulation had been made by counsel in regard to any adjourned day. That I thereupon mailed to each of the counsel in this action a letter, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">\u201c\u2018Gentlemen: I was absent from my office yesterday, and was under the impression that the hearing in the above action was set down for eleven A.

That at a quarter after eleven o\u2019clock this day a representative from Mr. Morrison\u2019s office called and was informed by me that if said Albert L. Cohn did not appear and have said books produced before eleven and one-half o\u2019clock this day, that I should give a certificate to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, upon which he might apply to this court-.
