Defendants filed a verified answer, in which the allegations of paragraph 2 of the complaint are denied. Afterwards, plaintiff moved for the examination of defendant Wainwright before trial, the moving affidavit being made by her attorney. After reciting the nature of the action, and the substance of the allegations of the complaint and answer, the affidavit states that deponent further says that the testimony of defendant Wainwright is material and necessary to prove what interest or control of such razzie dazzle defendant had at the time of the injuries aforesaid, and deponent deems it material and necessary to examine defendant -Wainwright in advance of the trial of this action, for the purpose of obtaining admissions of said facts in issue, and to dispense with the necessity of procuring witnesses to establish facts which may be admitted by defendant on such examination. Deponent alleges, on information and belief, that all the facts above alleged are within the personal knowledge of defendants, and that it is material and necessary for plaintiff to ascertain what control defendant had of the razzie dazzle mentioned in the complaint; that the testimony of defendant Wainwright is therefore necessary and material to the plaintiff, for use at the trial of this action. Plaintiff desires and intends to use the said testimony at the trial for the purpose of proving that defendants Wainwright and Barnes had possession and control of the razzie dazzle at the time alleged in the complaint, and were the owners thereof.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b634-5\">Argued before BARNARD, P.

The motion was made on certain grounds particularly specified in defendants\u2019 notice of motion. It is unnecessary to refer to but two of them,\u2014the third (that \u201cthe sources of the affiant\u2019s information are not disclosed\u201d) and the fourth, (that \u201cthe allegations as to plaintiff\u2019s intentions and allegations are not corroborated by the plaintiff.\u201d) The answer to both of these grounds is that the order for defendant\u2019s examination is based on the pleadings, as well as the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Every allegation in the affidavit that is alleged on information and belief is contained in the complaint. In our opinion, the papers on which the order was granted were sufficient, and the motion to set aside the order was properly denied. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
