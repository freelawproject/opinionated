Principal and Agent\u2014Authority of Agent\u2014Sufficiency of Evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-7\">In an action to recover for goods sold to a corporation at the instance of its agent, plaintiff need not show express authority in the agent to purchase goods on defendant\u2019s credit, but it is sufficient to show such a course of dealing between the parties as justified the inference that he had such authority.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-8\">2. Same\u2014Denial of Agency.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-9\">The denial of the agency, in such case, by defendant\u2019s president and by the alleged agent, and the assertion that he was the agent of another corporation, of a similar name, is not conclusive, since such denial is by persons in interest.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-10\">Appeal from eighth district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-11\">Action by William Wilson, Jr., against the Wyandance Springs Improvement Company to recover for goods sold and delivered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>defendant at the instance of its agent.

Express authority to Bosenfeld to purchase-merchandise upon defendant\u2019s credit was not indispensable to plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. It was sufficient that there had been a course of dealing between plaintiff and defendant, from which Rosenfeld\u2019s authority could be inferred. Lamb v. Hirschberg, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 20 N. Y. Supp. 678. Such a course of dealing appeared in evidence from the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, which was to the effect that the assumed agent had on former occasions purchased merchandise of like kind on defendant\u2019s credit, and that these purchases were in each instance ratified by defendant, by acknowledgment of its indebtedness, and payment thereof. The evidence as to such a course of dealing may be slight, if considered without reference to other facts which appear, but its effect is intensified when it is kept in mind that defendant and another corporation, of nearly the same name, had the same officers, and occupied the same office, to which the bills for merchandise were directed to be sent, and that this office bore the sign, only, of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The denials of defendant\u2019s president, and of Bosenfeld, the assumed agent, that the latter was the agent of the defendant, and the assertions that he was the agent of the Wyandance Mineral Water Company, were not conclusive, because they were those of persons in interest. See cases cited in Lamb v. Hirschberg, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
