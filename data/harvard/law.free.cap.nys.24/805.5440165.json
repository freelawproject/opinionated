A week prior to his injury he had been assigned to a local train which ran through the side tunnels. On these trains he was obliged to take up and punch tickets while the train was in the tunnel. In these side tunnels, especially on damp days, the reflection from the lights in the cars made it appear from the inside of the rear car as if there was still another car in the rear, and, when passing over the platform from one car to another, it was, owing to the darkness, smoke, and cinders, impossible to see. Plaintiff claimed to be ignorant of this reflection, and that defendant had notice of it. Plaintiff fell from the rear of the train while passing back, thinking there was a car in the rear. It was claimed that defendant was negligent in failing to have a chain across the end of the rear platform.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b822-5\">Argued \"before BARNARD, P.

Probably the court might have properly refused the various requests to charge thereafter made by defendant, on the ground that the charge already made sufficiently set forth their respective duties. But the court did not take that course, but received the requests, and restated the law in defendant\u2019s favor, so far as could be done consistently with the law. The objection to the charge most strenuously urged was to the request to charge that, if plaintiff knew there were but three cars in the train, he could not recover. We think that request was properly refused. The plaintiff might know that fact, and yet the various duties to which his attention must be addressed might so occupy his mind that he might forget it for a moment, without being guilty of negligence that would bar his recovery. The care of a prudent man was the measure of his duty. Such a man might for an instant forget a well-known fact, when fully occupied with pressing duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
