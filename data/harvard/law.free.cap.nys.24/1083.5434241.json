This is the nature of a direct trespass, not unlike a deposit of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>matter by hauling in wagons, and cannot be justified. Hooker v. City of Rochester, 37 Hun, 181. It constitutes a continuing trespass, and is a nuisance, which should be enjoined by the court. This is the common remedy. Townsend v. Bell, 62 Hun, 306, 17 N. Y. Supp. 210. The exercise of corporate powers under general legislative sanction does not relieve the defendant from responsibility in such a case. Noonan v. City of Albany, 79 N. Y. 470; Seifert v. City of Brooklyn, 101 N. Y. 136, 4 N. E. Rep. 321; Chapman v. City of Rochester, 110 N. Y. 273, 18 N. E. Rep. 88; Stoddard v. Village of Saratoga Springs, 127 N. Y. 261, 27 N. E. Rep. 1030; Beach v. City of Elmira, (Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 913; Bacon v. City of Boston, (Mass.) 28 N. E. Rep. 9. Nor do we think it defeats the plaintiff\u2019s rights to an injunction that he has himself contributed to or acquiesced in the pollution of the stream upon his land. If the defendant did nothing more than pollute this water, so as to impair or destroy the plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of the water as it was wont to flow over his land, we are inclined to think the fact of pollution by the plaintiff himself would be a complete answer to his complaint. He could hardly be heard in a court of equity to complain of the injury which the defendant was doing to him when it appeared that he was himself doing precisely the same injury to himself, as well as to all below him on the stream. It may be doubted whether this situation is strictly within the principle of the \u2018trade-mark cases\u2019 cited by the defendant. See, also, Hazard v. Caswell, 93 N. Y. 259; New York Con. Card Co. v. Union Playing Card Co., 39 Hun, 611. But, however this may be, it would seem sufficiently absurd to give one tort feasor an action against another for doing precisely the same thing. Certainly, there has been no contribution among wrongdoers since Merryweather v. Nixan, 8 Term. R. 186, unless within certain well-defined exceptions which do not touch the question; and equity will not interfere under such circumstances. But, notwithstanding this, we think the plaintiff suffers injury from the wrongful acts of the defendant to which he does not contribute, and from such injury he should have relief. The true principle is well stated by the supreme court of Iowa, in a recent case: \u2018Acts of plaintiff sufficient to defeat his recovery would be such as . contributed to cause those things of which he complains. If he has sustained damage from the wrongful acts of the defendant to which he did not contribute, then he should recover therefor.\u2019 Ferguson v. Manufacturing Co., 77 Iowa, 576, 42 N. W. Rep. 448. This appears to be an action at law, but we think the rule is the same in equity. Wood, Nuis. p. 533, \u00a7 484; Jackman v. Arlington Mills, 137 Mass. 277. There can hardly be a question that this is so in the case of a defendant who brings onto the premises of the plaintiff large quantities of solid matter, lessening the capacity of his pond, and interfering with his business in other ways. The waters of this pond had been condemned to secondary uses before any sewers were built by the defendant, and the plaintiff himself had contributed to that result. I have no hesitation in deciding that this water had become entirely unfit for domestic use from causes for which the defendant is not responsible, and that the plaintiff is entitled to no damages for depreciation in the value of the enjoyment of the water for primary uses, including the ice formed thereon. His damages, occasioned by the defendant, are difficult of measurement,. and, indeed, the evidence does not furnish means for ascertaining them with precision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1100-5\">\u201cAs to the expense of removing from the plaintiff\u2019s premises any deposit of matter brought there by the defendant, the evidence gives no data for determining the amount of such deposit, and consequently this element of damages cannot be considered. We think the only measure of damages which can be used is depreciation of r\u00e9ntal value; and, as to this, it is very difficult to determine to what extent it is attributable to the defendant. The defendant can be charged only with that part of the injury occasioned by its own wrong. Chipman v. Palmer, 77 N. Y. 51. And here are several sources of this depreciation. The filling up of the pond is contributed to by much sand and other substances brought down by the current, by surface drainage, by bran and other refuse from the mills, etc. The filthy contents of the water interfering with plaintiff\u2019s business do not come wholly from sewers, but in part from privies, mills, surface drainage, etc., without connection with those sewers. A part of the depreciation in rental value is due to the pollution of the water, rendering it and the ice formed upon it unfit for domestic use, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>seen, and under circumstances which eliminate it from the case on the question of damages. Still, when it is reasonably certain that the defendant has caused injury to the plaintiff, it is the duty of the court to arrive at the amount of damages, although its judgment is an estimate, and certainty is impossible. - Drucker v. Railway Co., 106 N. Y. 157, 12 N. E. Rep. 568. The result of our examination of the question is that the total depreciation in rental value since the introduction of the sewers in 1882 may be fairly estimated at $600 per annum From this should be deducted for domestic purposes, ice, etc., $300, leaving $300 per annum. One-third of this may be regarded as due to causes for which the defendant is not responsible. Upon this basis we find the damages to be at the rate of $200 per annum, which, for the years elapsed since defendant introduced its sewers, gives a total of $2,000 damages against the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1101-5\">Argued before MAYHAM, I\u2019.

On competent and sufficient evidence, he has found that the defendant, in June, 1882, completed a permanent system of sewers and gutters in the streets of the village of Johnstown, through which the sewage of said village was collected and emptied into plaintiff\u2019s pond, not only polluting the water, but causing a large deposit of offensive matter therein; that, ever since said period, the flow of said sewage onto plaintiff\u2019s premises has continued. Such being the facts of the case, I think the plaintiff was \"entitled to the judgment awarded of a perpetual injunction, and to at least nominal damages. Noonan v. City of Albany, 79 N. Y. 470; Stoddard v. Village of Saratoga Springs, 127 N. Y. 261, 27 N. E. Rep. 1030. The only damages allowed by the referee are for the diminution of the storage capacity of plaintiff\u2019s pond, caused by the deposit therein of the contents of defendant\u2019s sewers, and the destruction of his machinery, and the consequent injury to his business. The referee determined that such deposit depreciated the rental value of plaintiff\u2019s premises $200 a year. The depreciation in the rental value of plaintiff\u2019s premises, however, was shown on the trial to be attributable to several causes. The pollution of the water, for which no damages were allowed by the referee, the natural surface drainage of the village of Johns-town, the drainage of other mills, the contents of private sewers, privies, etc., together with defendant\u2019s sewage, produced such depreciation. There is no evidence showing with any degree of certainty the amount of the deposit in plaintiff\u2019s pond caused by defendant\u2019s sewers, and the amount produced by other causes, or to what extent the rental value of plaintiff\u2019s premises is diminished by acts of defendant. As the referee very properly suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-9\">\u201cHis [plaintiff\u2019s] damages occasioned by the defendant are difficult of measurement, and, indeed, the evidence does not furnish means of ascertaining them with precisi\u00f3n.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The serious question of the case, and one on which I entertain considerable doubt, is whether the evidence was sufficient to justify the finding of the referee as to the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages. It is urged that without any evidence, showing the amount of deposit in the pond caused by defendant, and the quantity left there by other sewers, the conclusion of the referee as to the amount of the diminution of the rental value produced by defendant is founded on mere conjecture. It must be admitted that there is some plausibility in this position; but there are well-considered authorities which seem to sustain the view of the learned referee. Drucker v. Railway Co., 106 N. Y. 156, 12 N. E. Rep. 568, was an action brought against the defendant for damages for interfering with plaintiff\u2019s easement in a street. The damages allowed was the diminution of rental value of plaintiff\u2019s property. The evidence tended to show that such diminution was caused by defendant\u2019s road, and also by a tendency of the business to move \u201cup town.\u201d In the opinion the following language is used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-5\">\u201cIt is often the case that damages cannot he estimated with precision, and the basis of accurate calculation is wanting and inadequate. That is notably true in many cases of personal injuries. Such evidence as can be given should be given, and facts naturally tending to elucidate the extent of loss should not be withheld. But when all the proof which, in the nature of the case, is fairly possible is given, the good sense of a jury must provide the answer,, and it is no defense that such judgment involves more or less of estimate and opinion, having very little to guide it. That criticism has no force in the mouth of the wrongdoer when all reasonable data have been furnished for consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">The same doctrine is held in Tallman v. Railroad Co., (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 130, 131. In Van Steenburgh v. Tobias. 17 Wend. 562, 563, Judge Cowen, holding that a joint action does not lie against the separate owners of dogs by whom the sheep of a third person has been killed, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-7\">\u201cThe difficulty in accurately estimating the damage done by each dog is not an argument of sufficient strength to warrant the injustice of punishing a man who is innocent. The jury must in this, as in most cases of wrong,, get at the real damages in the best way they can.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">In a similar action (Buddington v. Shearer, 20 Pick. 477-479) it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-9\">\u201cThere may be some difficulty in ascertaining the quantum of damage done-by the dog of each, but the difficulty cannot be great. If it could be proved what damage was done by one dog, and what by the other, there would be no difficulty; and, on failure of such proof, each owner might be liable for an equal share of the damage, if it should appear that the dogs were of equal power to do mischief, and there were no circumstances to render it probable that greater damage was done by one dog than by the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">The same doctrine is held in Auchmuty v. Ham, 1 Denio, 495, and in Partenheimer v. Van Order, 20 Barb. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">It follows that in actions like the one we are considering, as\u00edn those for personal injuries, where all the evidence bearing on the question of damages, \u201cwhich, in the nature of the case, is fairly possible\u201d has been given, it is no defense to the wrongdoer that the-judgment against him must involve more or less estimate or opinion. In this case the evidence given on the trial was voluminous,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>and all the facts bearing on the question of damages, as far as-possible, seem to have been brought out; and I think, under the authorities cited, the conclusion of the referee was warranted by the evidence, and, therefore, that the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
