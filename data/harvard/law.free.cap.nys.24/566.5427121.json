While this negotiation was pending, and before the terms and conditions of crossing had been fixed, the plaintiff requested the defendant to disconnect the chain of its gate, and permit the plaintiff\u2019s wire to be strung, and its cars to be operated, across the defendant\u2019s tracks, temporarily, pending the settlement of the terms and conditions of crossing. The defendant complied with said request in or about the month of June, and the plaintiff operated its cars across the defendant\u2019s tracks, by the trolley overhead system, between about July 3 and November 27, 1893, under said temporary permission granted by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s gate, during that period, was useless, in consequence of the breaking of the chain. After the plaintiff had strung its wires, and begun to operate its cars, across the defendant\u2019s tracks, through the courtesy of the defendant, it broke off the said negotiation, and no agreement has ever been made between the parties to this action with reference to the terms and conditions of crossing.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b582-12\">Argued before BARNARD, P.

From that it follows that no agreement was reached between the companies as to the crossing. If plaintiff cannot make a satisfactory arrangement, 'it must apply under the railroad act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we believe to be applicable. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-16\"> The railroad act, (Laws 1890, c. 565,) \u00a7 12, is as follows: \u201cEvery railroad corporation whose road is or shall be intersected by any new railroad, shall unite with the corporation owning such new railroad in forming the necessary intersections and connections, and grant the requisite facilities therefor; and if the two corporations cannot agree upon the amount of compensation to be made therefor or upon the line or lines, grade or grades, points or manner of such intersections and connections, the same shall be ascertained and determined by commissioners, one of whom must be a practical civil engineer and surveyor, to be appointed by the court, as is provided in the condemnation of law; and such commissioners may determine whether the crossing or crossings of any railroad before constructed shall be beneath, at or above the existing grade of such railroad, and upon the route designated upon the map of the corporation seeking the crossing or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
