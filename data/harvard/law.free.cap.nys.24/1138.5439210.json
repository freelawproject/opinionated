The. trial minutes show that certain so-called bylaws were offered and received in evidence, and marked \u201cDeft\u2019s Exh. A;\u201d but this exhibit does not accompany the return, and we are thus left to conjecture respecting its contents. Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 10 seems to be confined to certain pages bearing written entries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>and contained in a book entitled \u201cArticles of Association of the North New York Building and Loan Association,\u201d and we cannot, therefore, consider the book for other purposes. Again, the corresponding provisions of the so-called articles of association, as they appear in the book referred to, are essentially different from those which are set out at length in appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s brief, yet the latter may be in harmony with defendant\u2019s Exhibit A, now omitted, and to which counsel refers. We think that, for the matter above alluded to, justice requires that the parties have opportunity to perfect the return, and we direct that this appeal be reheard at the next November general term, any amendment of the return on this appeal to be made meanwhile.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
