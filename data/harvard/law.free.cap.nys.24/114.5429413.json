By voluntarily appearing and submitting to the jurisdiction of the meeting, without protest, and litigating the issue on its merits, he precluded himself on the point he now seeks to raise. In this respect the case at bar is entirely different from People v. Musical Mutual Protective Union, 118 N. Y. 101, 23 N. E. Rep. 129. In the case last referred to the relator appeared, and denied the jurisdiction, and then: withdrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-17\">In the next place, the by-laws of the association do not require a vote of. two-thirds of all the members to an expulsion, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>two-thirds of the members. present at a meeting regularly constituted for the transaction of business. Twenty-five members present constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In this aspect the vote was sufficient. But, if it did not require two-thirds of all the members of the association at the time of the passage of the resolution, the relator failed to establish by competent proof that 12, the nuihber which voted for Ms expulsion, were insufficient to constitute such two-thirds.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
