And that the executors thereupon paid all the debts of the testator and all the specific legacies bequeathed by the said will, and received and held a large sum of money in their hands for a long space of time. And that the complainant and some of the other legatees frequently applied to the said executors and requested them to settle the said estate, and to pay to the complainant the amount of her share of the personal property in their hands; and that the complainant never could prevail on them to come to such settlement until about Feb. term, 1845, of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Passaic.

That thereupon they met once or twice, but did not and would not settle and pay the complainant according to said agreement; and she has never been able to get payment of the sum so agreed to be due to her; and it never has been paid to her. That the complainant, when the executors were all present, stated to them that, if they had not the money to pay her, she would take a bond and mortgage on good property for the amount so due her, and give time for the payment thereof, leaving said sum at interest. That thereupon the executors, or one of them, promised to give her such bond and mortgage ; but she has not been able to get such bond and mortgage, or any security for the said sum due her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5Z\">The bill states, .that, among other pretences, the executors pretend that in as much as they filed separate accounts they are not jointly responsible to the complainant, but only each for the amount so received by him, after deducting the amount due to his wife for her share of the estate: whereas the complainant charges, that the executors have jointly undertaken the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>trust, and have each received considerable sums of money and have handed over such sums to the other executor or executors; and that the said settlement so made by the said executors with the complainant was a joint and not a several settlement; and that they jointly and severally agreed to pay her the said amount so agreed to be due her, with legal interest on the same from said May 26, 1845; and that as such executors they had no right to retain in their hands the amount so due to their respective wives and leave the complainant unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">The bill prays, that the executors may be decreed to pay the complainant the said sum of f 1,351 43, with interest from May 26, 1845, out of their own estate; and that, if it shall appear that no such agreement and account has been made and taken, or that for any reason they shall not be held liable according to such accounting, then that they pay her the amount so ordered by the said Orphan\u2019s Court to bo paid to her, with interest thereon ; and that they account to her for the residue of the personal estate of said testator which was not embraced and included in the account taken by the said auditors on which the said order of distribution was made; and that they account for the amount so found due to the complainant; and be decreed to pay to her the amount wdiich on such accounting shall be found due to her; and for such other and further relief &amp;c.

He says that, some time before the death of testator, the defendant Mead had become the general agent of the testator, with the approbation of the complainant, and had managed his affairs for him, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>thus become much better acquainted with the situation of his property and the character and condition of the debts due to him than either of the other executors. That as said Mead was more conversant with the business of the testator than either of the other executors, though they all proved the will, yet it was understood between them, with the concurrence of the complainant, that the execution of the will should principally devolve on said Mead; and Mead, thereupon, from the beginning took the burthen thereof mainly upon himself, and possessed himself of a large bulk of the estate, and collected debts, and has paid large sums of money on account of the estate in debts and legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOzd\">He admits that all the executors were cited to render their acceptances before the Orphan\u2019s Court of Passaic, in' October term, 1844, and that they exhibited their accounts before said court; but he says that each executor accounted separately for the amounts he had received and expended; but he denies that he ever refused to come to an account of the moneys which had come to his hands; or that those were the first accounts rendered by the executors. He says that on the 4th October, 1843, each of the executors rendered a separate account, which was filed with the surrogate, to which no exceptions were then taken; and that each of the accounts afterwards' rendered under said citation commenced from the foot of each accountant\u2019s previous account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-4\">He admits that exceptions were subsequently filed to all the accounts by and in behalf of the children of Iddo Merselis; but says that no exception was made on the ground that the executors had accounted separately; nor was there any pretense made before the Orphan\u2019s Court, or before the auditors who re-stated those accounts, that the executors, or any two of them should be jointly chargeable for the whole estate; or that any one of them should be charged for more than had actually come to his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">He admits that the said accounts and exceptions were referred to auditors ; and says that the auditors examined both sets of the accounts, and re-stated the same separately for each executor, and reported them thus re-stated to the Orphan\u2019s Court for approval ; and that the said court on the 12th May, 1845, approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the separate accounts as re-stated, and decreed that the same should be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-3\">He says that in those accounts Mead was charged with the whole inventory, and was credited with such items thereof as had come through his hands into the possession of this defendant, and this defendant was charged therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">He denies that he has possession or intermedledwith any part of the estate except as appears in his said accounts as re-stated by the auditors ; or that he has received sums of money belonging to the estate and handed them over to either of the other executors; or that ho has in any way intermingled his accounts with those of either of the other executors ; or that ho has in any way made himself liable for the moneys and assets of the estate which have passed into the possession of the other executors or either of them; and insists that he is accountable only for the balance reported against him by the auditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">Ho admits that the Auditors reported \u00e1 balance in Mead\u2019s hands of $8263,66 after deducting his commissions ; and a balance in the hands of this defendant of $2020,15 after deducting his commissions; and a balance in Schuyler\u2019s hands of $182,32 after deducting his commissions; and admits that Mead was credited in Ins accounts with various assets that had boon charged in the inventory and which, at the said time of accounting remained uncollected ; and that the amount to be distributed ander the will will be increased, over the above stated balances, by the amounts which have been and may be collected from those assets ; but he says that many of those claims are doubtful and many others of them worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">He admits that the Orphan\u2019s court, on the same day on which they decreed the allowance of the separate accounts of the executors as aforesaid, after reciting the balance in the hands of each executor, also ordered that the said sums he distributed and paid as by the said will is directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">He says that he cannot with certainty answer how much the complainant has received out of the estate since the said order of distribution was made ; but he denies that he has paid her any thing, or contributed any thing towards any payments which she may have received from either of the other executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>He admits that after the said order of distribution was made, and at the time for that purpose stated in the bill, all the parties interested in the estate went together and examined into the nature and character of the bonds and other assets and securities that had been credited in the account of Mead remaining uncollected and lying in the hands of J. Hopper, Esq., for the purpose of determining on the best disposition to be made of them; but he denies that he then or at any other time agreed to be charged, either separately, or jointly with his co-executors, or either of them, with the said bonds, mortgages or other securities, or with any of them, or any part thereof; or that he assumed any liability on account of the same, or agreed that the balance reported against him by the auditors should in any wise be increased by those assets or in any other manner; or that he would be liable for or pay over to any of the parties interested any more money than the surplus of the amounts so decreed against him after deducting therefrom the distributive share coming to his wife, Caty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\">He denies that any such account as charged in the bill was stated between the executors on the one part and the complainant or any other persons or person on the other; or that the executors agreed to be charged with the sum of \u00a78019,09, or with any sum of money other than as they are charged in the accounts as they passed the Orphan\u2019s court; or that any settlement was made between the executors and the complainant showing that there was a balance of \u00a71468,81 coming to the complainant for her distributive share ; or that after deducting certain amounts from it there would be due the complainant \u00a71351,43 from the executors on the 26 May, 1845 ; or that he, either separately or jointly with the other executors or either of them, promised to pay the complainant any sum of money, or promised to give her a bond and mortgage, or any other security; or that he has done any act or entered into any engagement that can make him liable to pay the amount claimed by the complainant, or to respond jointly with the other defendants, or either of them, for the moneys and assets of the estate which have fallen into their or either of their hands; or that he can be compelled to assume the payment of any of the bonds, &amp;c. which are still uncollected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>He says that, the representatives of Iddo Marselis, legatees named in the will, being minor children, and on account of their situation, in his opinion entitled to priority in payment, ho, about June 4,1845, paid to them and those representing them $1488,15, out of the balance reported by the auditors as aforesaid to he in his hands; thereby leaving in his hands only $560 on account of the distributive share coming to his wife; but he denies that such payment was made on tho basis of any settlement between the executors and the legatees or persons interested in the residue of the estate, or upon any assumption on his part of the uncollected assets, or of any liability on account of moneys in the hands of either of tho other executors ; hut that the said advance was made by him because he thought he would ho better able than the said children could he to reimburse himself out of the uncollected assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">He says that he became a purchaser of some of the personal estate of the testator, to the amount of $22,11, with which amount he has been charged in his said account. That a part of the inventory consisted of two judgments obtained by tho testator against one John Marinus, which, with interest amounted to $1458,15; that the collection of those judgments was passed over by Mead to this defendant, and Mead was credited therewith in his account and this defendant was charged with them. That, considering the claim to ho quite doubtful, this defendant negotiated with Marinus for further security ; and, upon payment of the further sum of $461, he obtained, for the benefit of the estate, the assignment of a bond and mortgage of one Jarvis Grennel for the payment of $1850, or thereabouts, which is duly charged against him in his accounts. That he gave his individual note for the said $461, payable some time after date^1; and, having no moneys of the estate in his hands, he applied to Mead and received from him the said $461, with which'Jb.e paid his note; with which sum this defendant is charged and said Mead is credited in. the aforesaid accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">He denies that he bas received any other assets or moneys of the estate from Mead or Schuyler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">He admits that he afterwards received on two occasions, from the owner of the equity of redemption of the premises mortgaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>to secure the payment of the said Grennel bond $111 of interest on said bond and mortgage ; and that he has received payment of $28,'20 from one-Walker, the amount of a judgment recovered by the testator against him and not inventoried; and that he has twice received the rent of a house in Patterson belonging to the estate, which had been in his charge during the life of the testator, amounting together to $101; which said sums are charged against him in his aforesaid accounts ; and he says that he has not received any other moneys belonging to the estate, nor taken charge of any other property or effects of the estate, nor intermeddled with any of the claims that remained uncollected at the time the accounts of the executors were rendered as aforesaid. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">He denies that he has been unwilling to have the accounts of the estate settled and closed; or that he has deferred the same for want of time, or in any way delayed the same ; but s\u00e1ys that he has always been desirous that the legatees and persons interested should receive the moneys due them, respectively, and that for that porpose, after the said decree for distribution was made, he offered to his co-executors that, if they would assign to him individually a bond and mortgage belonging to the estate and remaining uncollected, given by one Hiram Gelal, for $1000 and interest, he would advance the amount due on the same, first deducting the balance due to his wife over and above the amount in his hands, that the same might be divided among the others according to the will; and that Mead was willing to accept the proposal, but that Schuyler objected to it and refused to execute or to sanction such proposed assumption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">He submits that he is not bound to pay over to the complainant or to any other person, the amount in his hands to which his wife is entitled, it being less than her distributive share <em>\u2022, </em>but that he has a right to retain the same towards the payment of her share and that thejcomplainant and others interested in the distribution of the estate must look to Mead for the payment of the moneys reported by the auditors to be in his hands; and that the effort on the part of the complainant to charge the executors jointly, and to make this defendant personally liable for more moneys and assets than have come to his hands is unjust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Mead, in Ms answer, admits that the executors, or some of them, took possession of all the personal effects and estate, as executors, and that the said estate and effects were more than sufficient to pay the debts and specific legacies ; and that the executors collected divers sums of money; and that the widow surrendered and gave up the legacy bequeathed to her and also her right to the personal estate during her widowhood, except a certain portion of said personal estate, amounting in value to $903 26, which was taken by her for the use of the family ; and that she has since died; and that, so far as he is informed and believes, all the specific legacies have been paid ; but that certain debts, amounting in all to about $380, remain unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">He says that considerable sums of money have come to the hands of these executors from time to time; but that such sums as came to his hands have been from time to time appropriated to the payment of debts or legacies, without being retained in his hands an unreasonable time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">He admits that all the executors, not having settled the estate, were cited before the Orphans\u2019 Court, and that they rendered separate accounts; and that exceptions wore filed and auditors appointed to audit as well the separate accounts as all other accounts theretofore filed by the executors. And that the auditors examined said accounts, and reported to the Orphans\u2019 Court. But he denies that by the said report it appears that he had, at the date of said report, in his hands as cash, $3,263 66, though he admits and states, that the said sum is the balance appearing against Mpi by said report; but that therein a large amount of bonds, notes, book accounts and judgments are charged against Mm, some of which have never been collected; and the whole inventory is therein charged against him ; on the sale of which personal property certain losses have unavoidably occurred which are not therein allowed to him; and that, in and by the said report, the moneys stated to have been actually received by him compose a small proportion of the whole amount charged against him; and that said bonds, notes, book accounts, judgments and personal property are a part of the account on wMch said balance is <em>struck; </em>and he prays leave to refer to the said report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>He admits the order of distribution stated in the bill; but avers that it is erroneous and unlawful, and ought not to be in-forced in equity, in that it directs the distribution of moneys which had not then and have n'ot since come to his hands, and which were not then and are not now chargeable to him, and in that the same is not in accordance with the said auditor\u2019s report on which it is manifestly based.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">He says he has heard and believes that, shortly after the date of the said order of distribution, $135 was paid to the complainant ; but that he has no knowledge by whom it was paid, though he believes it was by his co-executor Ward; but whether paid in pursuance of said order of distribution he has no knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">' He admits he has met together with his co-executors and the children of Iddo Merselis, or their representatives, for the purpose of settling said estate, about June 4,1845; but he denies that at said meeting, or at any other time, he, as one of the executors, either severally or jointly with them, agreed to be charged with all the bonds, mortgages and notes not before that time divided, being the whole of the personal estate of the testator not before then divided, except as in the bill excepted ; and that he did not at said meeting, or at any other time, either severally or jointly with his co-executors and the said devisees, agree that the said executors should be charged with $8,019 09 after deducting all their charges against said estate for debts, legacies, commissions and expenses and including the said sum of $5,411 25 as cash. On the contrary, he avers that he did not then, nor has he at any time made any agreement with the parties aforesaid, or with any other person or persons, that could bind him to pay and made good out of his individual estate any losses that might be incurred on any of the said bonds, mortgages, notes, judgments or accounts, or to pay any debts that might still remain due from said estate, or to release or abandon any just and lawful claim he then had or might thereafter have against said estate for or on any account whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">He denies that $1,341 43, or any other definite sum, has been agreed upon by him as a fixed balance due the complainant; and avers that the pretended facts stated in the bill, and which are the basis of the calculation which results in the said balance, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>(as they have been hereinbefore) denied; and that the complainant has no claim except for one-fifth of such residue as may remain after all the residue of said estate shall be converted into money and all debts, costs, expenses and liabilities shall be paid and discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">He admits that, since the date of the said decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, $1,800, as near as he can recollect the amount, has been paid or secured to the children of Iddo Merselis ; but he denies that by the said payment any agreement was recognized by which the defendants, or any or either of them, was bound to answer for any part of the assets of the estate out of their own personal property, or by which any bonds, judgments, notes or accounts then remaining uncollected should be charged to the defendants, or either of them, as cash, or by which any certain or fixed sum was ascertained as the amount due the complainant as residuary legatee; and avers that the said payment or security for payment was made and given in good faith, and under the belief that the same would not exceed the amount that would fall to the share of the said minor children on the final settlement of the said estate; and further, that such payment and security were made and given with the knowledge and concurrence of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">He admits that, after said payment or security to Iddo\u2019s children, the complainant called on these defendants to settle with her for her share, and that the said claim as stated in the complainant\u2019s bill has not been paid, to the best of this defendant\u2019s knowledge and belief; and as to the allegations of the complainant respecting an offer made by her to take a bond and mortgage on good property for the amount in her bill alleged to bo due to her, as said offer is stated in said bill, he says he has no knowledge of any promise by the executors, or either of them, to give the complainant such bond and mortgage; though he admits that, about the time in the bill stated as the time of said offer and promise, the complainant offered to take a mortgage on certain property of this defendant, by her designated, for an amount which this defendant does not recollect, but exceeding the amount by her claimed in her bill, and comprising as well a claim made hy her under the pretended agreement in her bill set forth as cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tain other pretended claims made by her against this defendant individually and not as executor ; but that this defendant refused to comply with said offer, and offered, on his part, to secure to her by mortgage an amount which he cannot now recollect, but less thian the sum then claimed by the complainant, and less than the amount claimed by her in her bill; but that the complainant refused to accept his said offer, and neither party was bound to abide by the offers then made, no agreement having been concluded between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-3\">He admits that Sophia is his wife ; and that Caty is the wife of Ward; and that Ann is the wife of Schuyler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\">The defendant Schuyler, in his answer, denies that he took into his possession any of the personal estate; and says that Ward and Mead took into their possession all the personal estate, and the whole burden of the settlement of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">He admits the citation of the executors before the Orphans\u2019 Court, and the proceedings thereon as stated in the bill; and says that, though he was charged in the report of the auditors and in the decree with $182 32 as cash, to which he did not object, yet that this sum was the amount of a bill of articles bought by him at the vendue, and which was -left unpaid by him to be deducted from his wife\u2019s distributive share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\">He says that, on or about June 4, 1845, Mead, Ward and himself and the five children of Iddo, or their representatives, and the complainant met together for the purpose of dividing all the bonds, mortgages, notes &amp;c., being the whole of the personal estate, and settling the estate. That thereupon an account was made out of the whole estate, except a few claims which, by consent of all parties, were to be left in the hands of John Hopper with directions to divide whatever should be recovered from them in five parts according to the will; and that on such accounting this defendant was to be charged with the said $182 32, being the amount charged against him, on account of his wife\u2019s share; and that the whole of the personal estate, ' except the amount so' left in Hopper\u2019s hands, after deducting all charges against said estate for debts, legacies, commissions and expenses, was $8,019 09, leaving for each share $1,603 81 over and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>above the amount in Hopper\u2019s hands. But, inasmuch as this defendant had not in his possession any of the moneys of the estate, the persons entitled to distributive shares were to be paid by Mead and Ward, they' having the whole estate in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-3\">That upon making th is statement, and all parties agreeing to it, Mead and Ward thereupon forthwith proceeded to settle with Iddo\u2019s children, or their representatives, and paid them their share of the estate, being the amount so fixed upon and agreed to as their share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-4\">That, after Iddo\u2019s children had been settled with, the complainant demanded that she should be paid ; but that they then adjourned; and that afterwards they had another meeting, all being present except Iddo\u2019s children and their representatives ; and this defendant believes that the complainant has never been paid the amount due her for her share ; but he insists that, as he never had the estate in his hands, he ought not to be charged therewith, but that the same ought to be paid by Mead and Ward, who held all the moneys and assets in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">Testimony was taken ; and the cause was heard on the pleadings and proofs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-6\"><em>A. 8.

The executors, in tho several partial accounts which had been exhibited to the Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>phans\u2019 Court and allowed, had accounted separately; and no objection was made to that mode of accounting, nor any effort to make the executors answerable jointly ; and there is no evidence to show that either of the separate accountants ever agreed to become liable for what had been received by either of the others ; nor any evidence sufficient to show that the executors assumed the uncollected securities and agreed to account to the residuary legatees for the amount of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\">By the last separate accounts of the executors settled before the Orphans\u2019 Court there was found to be in the hands of the executor Mead, $-; and in the hands of the executor Ward, $-; and in the hands of the executor Schuyler, |-- y and by the order-of that court the executors were ordered to distribute the amounts in their hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Another part of the prayer of the bill is, that if the executors cannot be held liable on the agreement set out in the bill, (the alleged agreement on which the first part of the prayer is founded) then that the executors may be decreed to pay to the complainant the amount so ordered by the Orphans\u2019 Court to be paid to her, with interest thereon, and that they account for the residue of the personal estate which was not included in the accounts allowed by the Orphans\u2019 Court; and that they may be decreed to pay to the complainant the amount which on such accounting shall be found due to her ; and for such further and other relief &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">No final account has ever been settled by the executors in the Orphans\u2019 Court. The partial accounts which have been exhibited to and allowed by the Orphans\u2019 Court cannot prevent the complainant\u2019s bringing the executors into this court for a final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">This is as far as it is necessary to go at present. It will be referred to a Master to take and state the accounts of the executors ; and all further equity and directions are reserved until the coming in of the Master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">It was argued on the part of the defendant Mead, that, inasmuch as the Orphans\u2019 Court had made an order for the distribution of the several amounts found in the hands of the respective executors by the partial accounts exhibited to and allowed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Orphans\u2019 Court, the complainant could ask no relief in this court in reference to those amounts ; for that the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court to compel the distribution was ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">The question here presented is, whether, when on partial settlements by executors the Orphans\u2019 Court order distribution of the moneys then in hand, and they are not distributed, and the complainant comes into this court for a final settlement, and the estate is finally settled here, this court cannot act in reference to the balances struck against the executors by the Orphans\u2019 Court on the partial settlements, and adopt its own measures to compel their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">It seems to me that, as long as the estate is not finally settled, this court may direct a statement of the whole account from the beginning, and take its own measures to compel the payment of the moneys found in the hands of the executors by such account, notwithstanding the Orphans\u2019 Court have, on partial accounts, directed the distribution of the balances thereby found to be in the hands of the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">It will be referred to a Master to take and state the accounts of the executors ; and all further equity and directions are reserved until the coming in of the Master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
