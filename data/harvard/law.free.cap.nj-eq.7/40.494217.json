DeHart procured all the interest by him so obtained to the said premises to be conveyed by the collector of arrears of taxes for the city of Newark to the said Thomas V. Johnson; and that the said Johnson therupon took possession of the said mortgaged premises, or of such part thereof as contained the said machinery ; that by an act of the Legislature, passed January 26, 1844, provision is made for the redemption, by the lawful owner, of property so sold for taxes, within one year after such sale, by paying or tendering to the purchaser at such tax sale the amount paid by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>for premises so sold for taxes, with an addition at the rate of 12 per cent, per annum thereon from the time of such sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">That the complainant, after he had received the said Sheriff\u2019s deed, and on the 6th of October, 1841, tendered to the said Thomas J.

That the said amount of taxes and interest was also tendered to the said Johnson, on the 28th of September, 1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">That the said Johnson, so having possession of the said premises, on the 4th of October, 1847, undertook to sell at public vendue, in Newark, the said machinery, and gave out at the said sale that he would, immediately on the said sale being made\u2019, deliver the said machinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">That the complainant apd the said Abraham Denman, who was then the assignee of the complainant\u2019s said mortgage, by F. T. F., their attorney, forbade the\u201d sale of the said machinery, because the said Johnson had no authority to sell the same <em>j </em>because 'the said machinery was so incorporated with the said buildings that it could not be separated therefrom without waste and injury to the said buildings and machinery, and because the mortgage now .the property of the complainant was the first lien thereupon; but that Johnson diregarded such notice and proceeded with the sale, and the machinery was struck off for $2,885, either to the said Johnson or to the said Xnness &amp; Rollinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">That the complainant and the attorney of the said Denman demanded efLJehnson some writing to show the sum for which the machinery was sold, and who was the purchaser thereof;

that the reason of Johnson\u2019s making such haste to extricate the said machinery was, that he expected and feared the injunction of thiii court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>arrest his progress, knowing that he was unlawfully employed; that Johnson has at this time a considerable part of the said machinery on the wharf in Newark, which, together with such machinery as remains in the building, he intends, unless restrained by the injunction of this court, to transport to the city of Now York; that, in consequence of said Johnson\u2019s so unlawfully selling the said machinery, it sold for a price far below its real value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5X\">That Johnson now holds on to the possession of a large parof the said buildings, without deriving any benefit therefrom, as the same is unoccupied ;

and that the defendants may be decreed to pay to the complainant, by a short day, what may be found to be due him on the said notes and mortgage ; and that, on failure thereof, they may be foreclosed of and from all right and equity of redemption of, in and to the said machinery so as aforesaid situated in the said Hope Buildings at the time of the delivery of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, and of all right and title to the said lands and premises so conveyed to the complainant by the said Sheriff', by reason of any pretended lien arising from the purchase of the same by the said DeHart, for taxes, as aforesaid, or from the conveyance by the said Collector to the said Johnson;

Thos. V. Johnson, Alfred Mead, Staats S. Morris, George Lewis, Edward S. Inness and Joseph R.

The decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>on the present motion is not founded on any ultimate conclusion on the main question. I go on the ground that the facts stated in the bill, present, in my judgment, a question within the jurisdiction of the Court, and .in reference to which a party to this controversy should not be permitted to act on his own construction of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, and remove the property claimed to be covered by it out of the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">To refuse the injunction now, would be to decide, that the complainant cannot, under the facts stated in the bill, or any proofs that may be made by him under the bill, have any lien on the machinery by virtue of his mortgage, because a denial of the injunction would be leaving Johnson at liberty to carry out his design of removing the property out of the State, and thus out of the reach of any decision the court might make on the question whether the complainant has such lien. It is no answer to this to say that Johnson is a man of responsibility. If the complainant has a lien on the machinery, no personal responsibility can bo substituted for such lien without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">As to the argument that Johnson Avas a mortgagee in possession of the machinery, and had, therefore, a right to sell it, this assumes that it was personal and not a part of the realty. It assumes, too, that by his purchase of the realty for taxes he was in possession of the machinery as personal property, and that after Johnson\u2019s right in the realty was extinguished by the tender of the amount paid at the tax sale, and the interest thereon, in compliance with the provisions of the statute for redeeming property sold for taxes, he remained in possession of the machinery as personal property; and assumes, that AA'here there are several mortgages on personal property, and one of the mortgagees is in possession, he may sell it at public auction on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">If the complainant\u2019s mortgage covered the machinery, it is a plain case for the interposition of the court to prevent its removal ; and if, nnder any proofs that may properly bo made under the bill, it may appear that the complainant is right in his construction of his mortgage, it is proper that the court should hold the property within its jurisdiction till the question involved can he satisfactorily decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>An injunction will be allowed. The mortgagors should be made parties defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\">Injunction allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
