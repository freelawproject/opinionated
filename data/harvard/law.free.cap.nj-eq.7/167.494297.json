These payments being made, we are willing that you shall, as our attorney, enter into a stipulation for us that, on the payment as follows of the further sum of $19,500, with interest semi-annually from the 1st of August last till paid, we will discharge him and release the property mortgaged to us.

That Ryerson then urged his inability to pay the $1,000 principal which he stipulated should he paid on the 1st of February, 1846, and asked for further time; and thereupon this defendant applied the sum of $1100 so received from Ryerson to the payment of the interest on $20,000 for eleven months, up to the 1st of January, 1846, and consented, by a letter written to Mr. Ogden, to receive $1,000 of the principal on the 1st of July, 1846; $1,000 on the 1st of January, 1847 ; $1,000 on the 1st of July following; $500 on each of \u25a0&amp;c., and the balance of the assumed principal of $20,000 on the 1st of July, 1850, and interest semi-annually on the 1st of .July and January in each year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">The defendants say that no agreement was ever entered into by them with Ryerson, nor by Mr. Ogden on thoir behalf, other than the letters of instruction before referred to.

Johnson, who has since that time had the control and direction thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">That after the property was re-advertised, Ryerson applied for postponements upon promises to make payments on account; but without pretending that he was entitled to have the decree opened or corrected, or that a part only of the mortgaged premieses should be sold to meet the payments he had neglected to make semi-annually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">That they are informed by the defendant J. T. Johnson, and believe, that Ryerson applied to him from time to time, after betook the management of the cp.se, for further adjournments, and that the sale was frequently postponed, with his consent, upon Ryerson\u2019s assurances that he would make payments on account of the execution ; but that he paid no money except $200 in March last; and that in the communications between Ryerson and the said Johnson, Ryerson did not pretend that there was any existing agreement between him and the defendants for a reduction of the decree, or for deferring the payments ; but on the contrary, that he made various and repeated new proposals' to said Johnson to obtain time to discharge the amount due on the said decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">They admit that, after the mortgaged premises had been correctly advertised in the newspaper for several insertions, by some-accident or mistake on the part of the printer, or through some other means, transpositions occurred whereby the descriptions of \u25a0some of the lots became intermixed with others and confused ; but they say they are credibly informed and believe that the advertisement from which the Sheriff read the descriptions at the day of sale was correct; and that there was no suggestion or complaint made by the complainant, or any other person, at the sale, that the advertisement in the newspaper was confused or unintelligible. That the complainant Ryerson and his counsel were both present when the said property was exposed for sale ;. that neither of them objected to the Sheriff\u2019s proceeding to sell,, or stated any irregularity in the advertisement in the newspaper; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>nor requested that the property should be put up in separate parcels, or that any part should be offered by itself; but, on the contrary, that either the said Ryerson or his counsel, in answer to a question propounded, distinctly stated that Ryerson had no objections to make against the Sheriff\u2019s proceeding with the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">That they are informed and believe that the Sheriff did not name any sum which was to be raised by the sale ; and that they did not instruct him to sell for the costs and payments that had been made by Ryerson; nor do they believe that the Sheriff told Ryerson that he intended to sell for the said costs and payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">That they believe the property to be more valuable together than if broken into parcels ; that it would be difficult to fix a proper and separate value on each parcel ; and that by such a sale the security of their debt would be greatly jeoparded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">On this answer, a motion was made to vacate the order staying the sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>F.
