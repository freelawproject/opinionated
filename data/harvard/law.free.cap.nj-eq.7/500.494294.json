The daughter died, leaving six children. On the 4th November, 1819, the daughter and her husband and the children made a deed of the land to G. M., some of the children beiDg under age; and P. S., the trustee, subscribed a writing under seal at the foot of the deed in the words following: <em>\" </em>X do hereby agree to the above conveyance in manner and form therein set forth.\u201d The consideration of this deed was a deed from G. M. for certain lands in Ohio. The bill stated that P. S. bad removed from the State; and prayed that a trustee be appointedjn his stead, to carry the trust into effect.

And he says he was informed and believes, that the solicitor of the complainants did communicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>by letter to the complainants, or some of them, the said proposition ; and he has several times since inquired for, but has received no reply thereto; and that by reason of the said understanding he has omitted to file his answer until this time; and that the omission to file his answer has not been for the purpose of delay, but with the desire and expectation of having some amicable arrangement of the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\">Testimony was taken on both sides.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>W.

If, by reason of such concurrence, Simmons could not maintain ejectment, a new trustee could not; and in this view the appointment of a new trustee would be useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">If there is any equity, at this late day, in any of the <em>cestuis, </em>it must arise from Mabee\u2019s having knowledge of the trust when he took the conveyance of 1819. But by this knowledge Mabee became trustee; and the trust would follow to his grantees, as far as they, respectively, had notice of the trust, or are chargeable with notice; and no further. In this view, also, I see no good reason for the appointment of a new trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">If the said concurrence of Simmons, the trustee, expressed as aforesaid, did not convey the legal estate out of him, yet Mabee is protected so far as respects the <em>cestuis que trust </em>who were of age and joined in the said conveyance to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">In reference to the rest of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>or all of them but one, a fact appears in the testimony of a witness residing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Ohio, taken under a commission, which does not appear in the pleadings, not being known, as I suppose, to the defendants until the return of the commission, and which should have an influence in favor of the defendants. It is, that the <em>cestuis que trust </em>after they were all of age, or their representatives, sold and conveyed their interest in the Ohio farm which was conveyed by Mabee in exchange for the lands in question in this suit. This testimony speaks as to all but one; and the defendants think they can show that that one also joined in the conveyance of the Ohio farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">I thi-nk that this act should, after so great a lapse of time, under a proper state of pleadings, be considered a confirmation of the deed to Mabee by all the <em>cestuis que trust </em>who joined in the conveyance of the Ohio farm. And I am willing, under the circumstances, that such course be taken in the cause, on the part of the defendants, as will give them the benefit of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">If, under these views, it is thought, on the part of the complainants, that either of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>is in a position <em>to </em>call for an execution of the trust so far as his or her interest is concerned, I have no objection to retain the bill. But these suggestions are made without prejudice, and without intending to give any decided conviction in favor of any <em>cestui que trust </em>though he or she may not have joined in the conveyance of the Ohio farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">A new trustee will not now be appointed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
