We conclude that the defendant did not properly preserve this claim and, accordingly, we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The testimony at trial revealed the following. On May 12,1984, officers from the Seymour police department were dispatched to a home to investigate a report that the defendant, a police officer, had taken his daughter there from her mother\u2019s home in Ansonia in violation of a court ordered visitation schedule. When they arrived at the Seymour home, the police, who had previously been informed that a gun might be involved, encountered the defendant, who was quite upset, his daughter, his mother and other family members. They were told by the defendant\u2019s mother that she had hidden his gun. One of the officers, who knew the defendant, talked to him and was able to calm him down substantially. A short time later, however, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>saw the defendant struggling with his mother for control of the weapon. He intervened and knocked the gun to the floor. During the incident, the gun made contact with the officer\u2019s stomach. Later, two police officers from the Ansonia police department arrived at the home and told the defendant that he was to be arrested for custodial interference and breach of peace. When the defendant questioned the officers\u2019 authority to arrest him, a struggle ensued which resulted in the defendant\u2019s being handcuffed, removed from the residence and placed in the patrol car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of this incident, the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant approximately four months later and was charged with the interfering and disorderly conduct offenses, the convictions for which he now challenges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim is that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on the interfering charge. While explaining the elements of the crime, the trial court informed the jurors that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-23, the use of physical force to resist arrest was not justified. The defendant now argues that this discussion of resisting arrest was inappropriate because the state filed a bill of particulars<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>in which it limited itself to proving that the interfering charge was based on the defendant\u2019s pushing the gun into an officer\u2019s stomach. He contends that the challenged instruction authorized the jurors to find that he committed the crime in another manner, by resisting arrest, and thereby encouraged a finding of guilty based on an uncharged theory of liability. The state claims that the defendant did not except to the charge on this basis and, accordingly, urges this court not to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Generally, this court will not consider error in a trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury unless the challenged matter was included in a written request to charge or an exception was taken after the charge was given. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 854 and 3063. \u201cAdditionally, the exception taken must \u2018state <em>distinctly </em>the matter objected to and the ground of the exception.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 854. This requirement is imposed so that the trial court will be made aware of claims of error in time to take appropriate remedial steps. <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 281, 439 A.2d 983 (1981). Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury will not be considered as error on appeal if the exception taken was \u2018insufficient adequately to apprise the court of the deficiency in the charge in a manner which would permit the court to make a correction.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 182, 405 A.2d 626 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 966, 99 S. Ct. 2417, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>5 Conn. App. 571, 573-74, 501 A.2d 764 (1985), cert. denied, 198 Conn. 804, 503 A.2d 1186 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">While the defendant did take an exception to the court\u2019s charge on resisting arrest, it was limited as follows: \u201cIf your honor please, I\u2019d like an exception to the charge on resisting arrest and there was no justification. Section 53a-23. There\u2019s no charge for resisting arrest here. I think that may have a <em>prejudicial influence because he\u2019s charged with disorderly conduct. </em>He's not charged with resisting arrest. And I think that the instruction on that statute may make the jury feel that, <em>with respect to the disorderly conduct, the fact that resisting arrest is an issue. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This exception was adequate to indicate to the trial court that the defendant believed that the instruction on resisting arrest might be <em>prejudicial </em>in light of the disorderly conduct charge. It was not, however, sufficient to \u201c \u2018bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ter\u2019 (emphasis in original) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396, 503 A.2d 576 (1986); <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>75 Conn. 679, 682, 55 A. 167 (1902); which the defendant now asserts as error: that by charging on resisting arrest, the trial court was allowing the jury to consider an uncharged theory for violation of the interfering statute. Because \u201c[t]he exception to the charge was inadequate to alert the trial court to the specific deficiency now claimed on appeal\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 396; we decline to review this ground of error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a provides in part: \u201cA person is guilty of interfering with an officer when he obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any peace officer or fireman in the performance of his duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-5\"> Apparently, the arrest made by the Ansonia police later was held to be illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> The defendant was also charged with reckless endangerment, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63 (a). He was acquitted of that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> The state later filed an amended information to conform to the bill of particulars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> Nor does this claim of error merit review under the fundamental rights-fair trial exception of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). \u201cUnder the <em>Evans </em>bypass rule \u2018we must first determine whether the charge raises a question of constitutional dimension and, if so, whether the claim has merit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 557, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>[supra, 70].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>1 Conn. App. 697, 702, 476 A.2d 598 (1984) (Torrence I), aff\u2019d, 196 Conn. 430, 493 A.2d 865 (1985) (Torrence II). If these two questions are answered affirmatively, we will then review the charge to see if there was error and if so, whether reversal is warranted. <em>Torrence I, </em>supra, 702-705.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>5 Conn. App. 571, 575, 501 A.2d 764 (1985), cert. denied, 198 Conn. 804, 503 A.2d 1186 (1986). Here, the defendant\u2019s claim arguably implicates a fundamental constitutional right: his right to notice of the nature of the charges against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986) (sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution guarantee a defendant a right to be specifically informed of the nature of the charges against him). The record, however, does not support a claim that the defendant was deprived of this right. A review of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury discloses that while the court did discuss the legality of the use of force to resist arrest, it repeatedly instructed the jury that the defendant was not charged with resisting arrest. Additionally, the trial court used the statutory language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a four times during its charge and each time confined the offense to the struggle over the gun. Under these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s claim does not warrant <em>Evans </em>review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
