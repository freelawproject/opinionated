We set aside the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial due to the state\u2019s lack of diligence in filing its brief. The Supreme Court denied certification. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>196 Conn. 804, 492 A.2d 1240 (1985). After the remand, the defendant was charged with a single count of failure to appear in the second degree, to which he filed a motion to dismiss claiming a violation of his constitutional rights. After the motion to dismiss was denied, the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere and, after his judgment of conviction, filed this appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The defendant initially claims that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-173<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was applied by the court in contravention of the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 19, as amended by article IV of the amendments to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>stitution of Connecticut, and in contravention of the fifth and sixth amendments to the United States constitution, because the statute improperly compelled the defendant to appear at a pretrial disposition conference after the defendant entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and elected to be tried by a jury. It appears that the defendant also challenges the constitutionality of Practice Book\u00a7\u00a7 687, 700 et seq.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record supplied to us on the appeal, however, is devoid of any challenge to those rules of practice which relate to pretrial disposition conferences and contains no court order requiring the defendant to appear at any pretrial conference pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The defendant has totally failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (c), which provides in relevant part that an appellant\u2019s brief shall contain the following: \u201cA statement of the nature of the proceedings and of the facts of the case. The statement of facts shall be in narrative form, and shall be supported by appropriate references to the page or pages of the record or transcript upon which the party relies. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Furthermore, it is incumbent upon an appellant to ensure that we are provided with an adequate record to review the claims of error. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. The defendant has totally failed to secure such an appellate record, and we are not ordinarily inclined to remand a case to correct a deficiency which the appellant should have remedied. <em>Holmes </em>v. Holmes, 2 Conn. App. 380, 383, 478 A.2d 1046 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We, therefore, have no basis on which to find error on his claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\"> The defendant, while appearing pro se, is a member of the Connecticut bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> The record incorrectly refers to General Statutes \u00a7 13-162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-164r provides: \u201cAny person charged with an infraction who fails to pay the fine and any additional fee imposed or send in his plea of not guilty by the answer date or to appear for any trial which may be required shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s . . . motion to dismiss, the defendant . . . may file an appeal . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-173 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Any person who, while charged with the commission of a misdemeanor and while out on bail or released under other procedure of law, wilfully fails to appear when legally called according to the terms of his bail bond or promise to appear, is guilty of failure to appear in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 687 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe prosecuting authority and counsel for the defendant . . . may engage in discussions at any time with a view towards disposition ....
