Accordingly, we have decided the appeal on the basis of the record and briefs. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">On October 7, 1983, the defendant, who was represented by private counsel, pleaded guilty under the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), to two separate substituted informations. Each information charged him with one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a). Both counts involved violent and repeated sexual assaults on teenage girls, one of whom was the babysitter for the defendant\u2019s children. The second assault occurred while the defendant was free on bond on the first set of charges. The state agreed to recommend an effective sentence of not more than thirty years, and the defendant reserved the right to argue for a lesser sentence. At the sentencing proceeding on November 10, 1983, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the defendant\u2019s counsel requested an effective sentence of twenty years. The court accepted the state\u2019s recommendation, and imposed consecutive sentences of fifteen years on each information, for a total effective sentence of thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On February 27, 1984, the defendant filed pro se motions to correct his sentences pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 935. After a hearing, at which the defendant was represented by the public defender, the court denied the motions. The defendant did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In December, 1984, the defendant filed new pro se motions for correction of his sentences. After a hearing, in which the defendant was represented by the public defender, the court denied his motion in each case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The common gist of the defendant\u2019s motions in the trial court was that the probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report after his pleas was biased against him and that certain of the information in the report was inaccurate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s principal claim of error is that the trial court denied him an evidentiary hearing on his motion. The record belies his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, the defendant\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>which he would introduce in support of the motion for correction of sentence. He suggested a procedure whereby the court would consider the offer of proof and, assuming its truth, would then set the matter down for an evidentiary hearing if the court determined that those asserted \u201cfacts\u201d would support vacating the defendant\u2019s sentences and resentencing him on the basis of a new presentence investigation report. The defendant, through his counsel, the state and the court, agreed to this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The court, in a thoughtful and detailed memorandum of decision, decided that, based on the defendant\u2019s own offer of proof the alleged inaccuracies in the report which resulted from the claimed bias of the probation officer were within the defendant\u2019s knowledge prior to the sentencing and should have been challenged at that time. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 919 (1) and 925; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>147 Conn. 125, 129, 157 A.2d 594 (1960). The court, being abundantly fair to the defendant, nonetheless examined the defendant\u2019s specific allegations of inaccuracies and determined that, even if established, they could not have reasonably affected the sentence which was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We have given the defendant\u2019s brief the full measure of leeway traditionally accorded to pro se parties, particularly criminal defendants. Moreover, we have fully examined the transcripts of the pleas, of the sentencing proceedings, of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions, and the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. A thorough examination of the entire record persuades us that the defendant\u2019s claims of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> The defendant filed one motion under two different docket numbers. We treat this single motion as separate motions filed in each case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 935 provides as follows: \u201cThe judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> The balance of his motion was based on claims of fact, outside the record in this case, which purported to show that his counsel at the time of his pleas was ineffective. We discovered, at the time this appeal was submitted for decision on the briefs, that the defendant also has pending in this court an appeal from the denial by the trial court, <em>Kline, J., </em>of a petition for habeas corpus based on that claim. The briefs have not yet been filed in that appeal. The trial court in this case, <em>DeMayo, J., </em>properly confined its inquiry to the claims of the defendant other than those relating to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which was being pursued by way of his habeas corpus petition. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541-42, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
