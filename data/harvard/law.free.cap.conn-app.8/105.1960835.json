A notice of such list was sent to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and it contained the direction that \u201cCOUNSEL ARE NOT REQUIRED TO APPEAR AT THE CALL OF CASES EXCEPT TO REQUEST AN EXEMPTION FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE . . . COURT ORDER,\u201d and a warning that these cases will be dismissed \u201cunless they are withdrawn, disposed of by final judgment, claimed to a trial list, or exempted for a good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The plaintiff did not appear at the call of the dormant cases on the assigned day to request an exemption. Nor did he request an exemption thereafter despite the fact that he had three months within which to do so. In addition, after the case was dismissed, he never moved to set aside the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Our review of the record and briefs indicates that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the court erred in dismissing this action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
