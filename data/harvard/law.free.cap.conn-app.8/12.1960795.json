That action authorized the removal of a liquor license from Darien to East Haven. The principal claim of the plaintiffs is that General Statutes \u00a7 30-52 bars the removal authorized here.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">In <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>2 Conn. App. 628, 481 A.2d 755 (1984) <em>(Breen I), </em>this court read General Statutes \u00a7 30-52 in accordance with the construction urged by the plaintiffs in this case. Thereafter, however, the Supreme Court granted certification to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>appeal from our decision and reversed our judgment in response to a motion filed on the ground that Public Acts 1985, No. 85-361, which became effective on June 27,1985, rendered the issues moot. See <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>5 Conn. App. 432, 499 A.2d 432 (1985) <em>(Breen II). </em>That public act clarified that the intent of General Statutes \u00a7 30-52 was to permit, under certain circumstances, the removal of a liquor license from one town to another, and it specifically-validated any prior action of the department authorizing such a removal. It is clear that the Supreme Court\u2019s action as reported in <em>Breen II </em>controls this case. We have considered the arguments of the plaintiffs attempting to distinguish this case from <em>Breen II, </em>and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
