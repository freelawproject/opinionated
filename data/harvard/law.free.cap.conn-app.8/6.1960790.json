J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">The plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment rendered pursuant to a directed verdict for the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this medical malpractice action. She claims that the trial court erred in excluding certain expert medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">The following facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Jerome Sochard, entered the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>emergency room suffering from what was diagnosed as a myocardial infarction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Emergency treatment resulted in the stabilization of the patient\u2019s condition, after which he was admitted to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit by Walter Lucia, the patient\u2019s cardiologist. The patient\u2019s condition remained stable until 3:30 a.m. when he experienced irregular heartbeats and a reduced heart rate. The attending nurse informed an intern on duty,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the patient\u2019s dosage of a medication was increased which stabilized his condition. Lucia visited the patient the following morning and, after speaking with him for several minutes, concluded that he was in a stable condition. Soon after the doctor left, the patient went into cardiac arrest and died despite efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the insertion of a pacemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">The plaintiff brought this action for wrongful death alleging that the defendant hospital, acting through its nurses and interns, failed to monitor the decedent properly and failed to communicate the decedent\u2019s difficulties to the attending cardiologist on a regular'basis. It is also alleged that the defendant failed to insert a pacemaker or to monitor the patient in a proper manner prior to cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">During the course of the trial, the plaintiff introduced evidence that the defendant failed to observe its duty of care by neglecting to insert a Swan-Ganz catheter at 3:30 a.m., when it became apparent that the patient was susceptible to further cardiac difficulty. The patient\u2019s expert witness, Norman Cagin, a physician specializing in cardiology, testified that the failure to employ this diagnostic device made it impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>determine whether the patient was suffering from hypovolemia,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which the plaintiff alleges may have caused the patient\u2019s death. The plaintiff\u2019s expert witness was then asked the following hypothetical question: \u201cDoctor, do you have an opinion, with reasonable medical probability, that St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, through its failure to use recognized and available diagnostic modalities and techniques, substantially increased the risk of Mr. Sochard\u2019s dying?\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the question for failure of the plaintiff to lay a proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">The defendant\u2019s objection focused on the lack of subordinate facts from which the expert witness could form an opinion as to what caused the patient\u2019s death, and the absence of any evidence demonstrating that the decedent died from a condition other than a contractile failure of the heart,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a condition which neither party alleged was treatable. The plaintiff argued that, had the defendant employed proper testing procedures, it might have been shown that the patient was suffering from hypovolemia, a treatable condition in approximately 80 percent of the cases. The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s allegedly negligent conduct precluded her from establishing the cause of the patient\u2019s death. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and disallowed the question because it was not based upon the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The facts assumed in a hypothetical question must have their basis in the evidence on the record. See <em>Engelke v. Wheatley, </em>148 Conn. 398, 410-11, 171 A.2d 402 (1961); see generally McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 14. Whether a proper foundation has been laid to support a hypothetical question is an issue of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>for the trial court. <em>Spoto </em>v. <em>Hayward Mfg. Co., </em>2 Conn. App. 663, 670, 482 A.2d 91 (1984). \u201cA hypothetical question may not be asked of an expert where it is so lacking in material, relevant and essential facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 509-10, 438 A.2d 749 (1980). \u201c \u2018[Wjhere the admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error.\u2019 <em>Engelke </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>[supra, 411].\u201d <em>Spoto </em>v. <em>Hayward Mfg. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">The plaintiff does not argue on appeal that there was any evidence of a cause of death other than contractile failure. She relies on \u00a7 323 (a) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and argues that once evidence has been introduced that a defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission increased the risk of harm to a person, and that harm was in fact sustained, it becomes a question for the jury as to whether that increased risk caused the harm. While this may be a proper interpretation of the Restatement, it does not apply to the facts of the present case because there was no evidence that the patient died from a condition which would have been detected by the use of the Swan-Ganz catheter. There was, therefore, no proof that the increased risk of harm of which the plaintiff complains, namely death due to hypovolemia, was in fact sustained.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>there are uncertainties of proof inherent in some medical malpractice cases which may warrant some relaxation of the quantum of evidence required for the basis of a hypothetical question, there must be some evidence that the allegedly negligent conduct caused the plaintiffs injury. In this case, to allow the jury to find that the defendant\u2019s conduct increased the risk of the decedent\u2019s death would be to impose liability based on mere speculation and conjecture. <em>See Ardoline </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>140 Conn. 552, 558-59, 102 A.2d 352 (1954); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Pommier, </em>5 Conn. App. 29, 32, 496 A.2d 975 (1985). The trial court\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to support the proposed hypothetical question was not clearly and manifestly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error is related to her first claim. She argues that the trial court erroneously directed the verdict for the defendant for lack of evidence to prove causation. The plaintiff concedes that the only evidence as to causation was that portion of her expert\u2019s testimony which was disallowed by the court. Since we hold that the trial court\u2019s prohibition of this testimony was proper, we find that the direction of the defendant\u2019s verdict was also proper. See <em>Souper Spud, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 579, 581-82, 501 A.2d 1214 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b17-11\"> The plaintiff brought this wrongful death action individually and as executrix of the decedent\u2019s estate. As used in this opinion, the plaintiff refers to Edythe Sochard individually and as executrix of the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b17-12\"> This action was commenced against Cardiovascular Associates, P.C., Walter Lucia, M.D., and St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center. A verdict was directed in favor of all three defendants. An appeal was taken but was subsequently withdrawn as to that portion of the judgment relating to Cardiovascular Associates, P.C., and Walter Lucia, M.D. As used in this opinion, the defendant refers to St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b18-7\"> A myocardial infarction is a \u201cregion of dead or dying tissue in the muscle of the heart which is the result of an obstruction to the blood circulation . . . . \u201d Schmidt, Attorney\u2019s Dictionary of Medicine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b18-8\"> It is disputed whether the intern visited the patient during the night.
