The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendant James A. Broadway, resulting in the dismissal of plaintiffs' and third-party defendants' claim for double damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-539.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-539.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2003). The trial court also denied the motion for partial summary judgment of the plaintiffs, Ed S. Mitchell, Jr., Hattie B. Mitchell, Evelyn M. Snead and Rosa M. Sutton, and Third-Party Defendants, Edna Mitchell Huggins, Ralph Mitchell and William M. Mitchell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"`A grant of partial summary judgment, because it does not completely dispose of the case, is an interlocutory order from which there is ordinarily no right of appeal.'\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Graham v.

In addition, the trial court's denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable as it is an interlocutory order.\n   <em>\n    Bockweg v.

The purpose of these rules is to \"prevent fragmentary, premature and unnecessary appeals\" by allowing the trial court to render a final judgment in the case before it is presented to the appellate courts for review.\n   <em>\n    Fraser v. Di Santi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526659\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/75/654/#p655\">\n    75 N.C.

There are two instances in which an interlocutory order is immediately appealable: (1) if the order is final as to some but not all of theclaims or parties, and the trial court certifies the case for appeal under Rule 54(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 54(b) (2004); and (2) when the order being challenged affects a \"substantial right\" of the appellant, which would be lost absent immediate appellate review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-277\">\n    N.C.

Furthermore, while appellants recite N.C. Gen.
