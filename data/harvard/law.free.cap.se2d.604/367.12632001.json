On appeal, Defendant argues the trial court erred by refusing to dismiss the charge for lack of sufficiency of the evidence. After a thorough review of the record, we reject this argument and hold Defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, the State's evidence tended to show that on 14 June 2002, the eight-year-old juvenile, along with her mother, visited the residence of Defendant, a family relative by marriage. While at the residence, juvenile began to play video games with Defendant. When it was time for juvenile and her mother to leave,Defendant told her mother that juvenile could remain and he would walk her home later. Defendant and juvenile continued to play video games in the living room, while Defendant's wife was in the next room. Defendant had been drinking Wild Irish Rose and beer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some time subsequent, Defendant told juvenile to \"Give me a kiss.\" Juvenile answered, \"No, you come get it.\" Defendant then leaned over, kissed juvenile on the lips, and forced his tongue into her mouth, despite juvenile's attempts to hold her teeth together to prevent such action. Juvenile testified she felt disgusted by Defendant's kiss. She went to the bathroom and washed her mouth out. Juvenile then informed Defendant's wife of Defendant's actions, whereupon Defendant's wife took juvenile home. Once there, Defendant's wife told juvenile's mother what had occurred. Juvenile was upset and crying when she arrived home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant presented no evidence. The trial court twice denied Defendant's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, and submitted the matter to the jury. The jury found Defendant guilty as charged, whereupon the trial court gave Defendant a suspended sentence and placed him on probation for thirty-six months upon the condition that he serve thirty days in New Hanover County jail. Defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's sole argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. Specifically, Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to show that his conduct, though \"clearly inappropriate,\" was initiated for the purpose of\"arousing or gratifying sexual desire,\" so as to be convicted of taking indecent liberties. Defendant's argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss, the trial court determines only \"`whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant's purpose for committing such act is the gravamen of this offense; the particular act performed is immaterial. It is important to note that the statute does not contain any language requiring a showing of intent to commit an unnatural sexual act.

We therefore conclude that the act and the attenuating circumstances here constitute evidence from which the reasonable fact-finder could infer that Defendant'sintent in tongue kissing the minor victim was for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having so concluded, we hold Defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judges TYSON and GEER concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
