Indictment alleging that the defendant \u201c on the 14th day of April, 1881, in Brazos county, Texas, did, with malice aforethought, kill Siddie Acco, a Mexican, by cutting him with a knife,\" is sufficient to charge the offense of murder.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b660-10\">2.

Same \u2014Charge of the Court.\u2014The court charged: \u201c The offense if any would not be reduced to an aggravated assault, if you believe from the evidence that the defendant assaulted Siddie Acco with a knife which was a deadly weapon, with intent to kill.\u201d <em>Held </em>error in the use of the word \u201ckill\u201d instead of the word \u201cmurder.\u201d See the opinion on the principle.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b660-13\">Appeal from the District Court of Brazos. Tried below before the Hon. W. E. Collard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-14\">The opinion states the nature and result of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-15\">Dr. Thomas Pugh testified for the State that about the time named in the indictment he was called in to see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Mexican Siddie Acco, and found him suffering with a flesh wound across the upper lip, which severed the lip from one corner of the mouth to the other. There was also a wound in the cheek, exposing the bone, but the. only wound requiring treatment was that on the lip. This wound had been filled by some one with spider web and soot. The witness saw the deceased on Sunday, the day after he was cut. He treated the wound until death ensued, which was on. the fourteenth day after it was inflicted. In the opinion of the witness the death of the deceased was occasioned by this wound on the lip.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aee\">On cross-examination the witness stated that the deceased died with erysipelas. The wound was doing well up to the following Saturday, when the deceased had a severe chill, followed by a fever. Symptoms of erysipelas made their appearance for the first time while this fever prevailed, in the wound and nostrils, and rapidly extended to the face and head, causing death in five or six days. Erysipelas is a specific disease, and often exists independent of wounds. It is often produced by miasma, and exhibits itself by rigors or chills. There is malaria in the Brazos bottom where the Mexican lived and died. The usual term of duration of erysipelas in fatal cases is from five to six days after the disease appears. The usual seat of the disease is the face, and it usually attacks the mouth, nose and ears of the patient. The usual form of the disease is \u201cfacial erysipelas,\u201d so called because it locates itself in the face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-7\">Re-examined he stated that the deceased was a small man, weighing from 90 to 100 pounds, but strong for his size. The defendant was a large woman and would weigh about 150 pounds. The witness supposed that she had greater strength than the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-8\">J. M. Pankey testified for the State that he lived on Col. Wilson\u2019s place and had charge of a convict camp. That as he was riding by Jack Murphy\u2019s place about eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>o\u2019clock at night he heard the defendant and the deceased talking in front of the house, the woman telling the deceased to pay or give her something. The witness rode some 75 or 100 yards when he heard the woman say several times to the Mexican to pay or give her something or she would kill him. The witness rode back, dismounted, approached the parties, took hold of the woman, who had the Mexican by the throat, and pulled her loose. She struck at the Mexican several times with a knife, saying she would cut his d\u2014d throat. It was quite dark and he could not see the knife well, but judged from the flash of the blade that it was three or four inches long. The witness heard the Mexican say several times \u201cturn me loose.\u201d After the parties were separated the witness went into Murphy\u2019s house and saw the cuts on the Mexican\u2019s lip and cheek. The lip was split under the nose, and the cheek was cut to the bone. After the Mexican\u2019s wounds were examined, the woman said, \u201c he struck me in the mouth.\u201d She showed her mouth,' which was swollen. She raised her lip, and the witness saw blood between the lip and teeth, and the whole appearance of the mouth indicated that she had received a blow. The Mexican was small and the woman large, \u201cThe woman 'could hold the man as still as a mouse.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-5\">The deceased on the Saturday following the difficulty \u2014 just one week \u2014 rode on horseback, a distance of two and a half miles, to the justice\u2019s court where the case was being investigated, remained about one hour, and then rode home. The defendant lived at the house of Jack Murphy, in front of which, and some six or eight steps off, the difficulty occurred. The deceased was a hand working on the place, but he lived in another house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-6\">Dr. J. W. Webb testified for the defense that he was a practicing physician and surgeon; that erysipelas is a disease which usually attacks the face, and that it exists independent of wounds or trausmatic influences. Mias-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>matie poison is of itself sufficient cause to produce the disease, and often does produce it. If the deceased was cut as described across the upper lip, and the wound did well for seven days, and the deceased rode a distance of two and a half miles and back, when a chill and fever ensued, and the eiysipelitic inflammation set up for the first time with the fever, then, in the opinion of the witness, death more likely resulted from the chill and fever than from the wounds. Erysipelas in fatal cases generally runs its course in four or five days. As the deceased had no symptoms of erysipelas until the fever set in, and as the latter was sufficient to produce the disease, it was more probable that the disease was thus caused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-4\">J. Murphy testified for the defense that the Mexican came to his house, where the defendant lived, about-o\u2019clock at night, and the woman several times asked him to pay her some money. She demanded pay several times, and finally she and the Mexican went out of the house together. After they got out of the house and about six or eight steps distant, the woman several times repeated her demand for payment of money. Finally the woman said, \u201c Siddie, don\u2019t you draw your knife on me. You give me my money, or d\u2014n you I will kill you.\u2019' The Mexican answered, \u201cDon\u2019t you curse me, or d\u2014n you I will kill you.\u201d Immediately a blow was struck. The witness was standing in his door when this occurred, and could see their backs but could not distinguish them from his position, though he could tell them from their voices. The witness was occupied during the difficulty, cooking his supper. Pankey came into the house with the Mexican and examined his wounds. He was cut across the upper lip, and on the cheek. After the Mexican left, the defendant came in and said that the deceased struck her in the mouth. Her mouth was swollen. She .raised her lip, and the witness saw blood about her mouth. On the next morning her lip was very much swollen.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>Beall &amp; Kemp, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At2x\">The appellant submits the following grounds, assigned as error in the judgment of the court below, and asks a reversal of this case:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-5\">I. The indictment does not charge an \u201cassault with intent to murder,\u201d and is not sufficient in law to support a conviction for that offense. The charging part of the indictment is as follows: \u201cThat about the 14th day of April, A. D. 1881, in Brazos county, Texas, Fannie Peterson did with malice aforethought kill Siddie Acco, a Mexican, by cutting him with a knife.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty of assault with intent to murder, and assessed her punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for five years. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Texas, 22; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Texas Ct.

Chilton, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b665-4\">Willson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7yT\">The indictment charges that the defendant, \u201con the 14th day of April, 1881, in Brazos county, Texas, did, with malice aforethought, kill Siddie Acco, a Mexican, by cutting him with a knife.\u201d Upon this indictment the defendant was convicted of an assault with intent to murder Siddie Acco, and her punishment was assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u2022 In the case of <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>State (ante, </em>p. 535), decided at the present term, we held that an indictment for the crime of murder in the above form was sufficient, as it alleges every act and fact constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">It is now further objected to this form of indictment that, notwithstanding it may be sufficient to charge murder, yet it will not be sufficient to support a conviction for assault with intent to commit murder. While the argument of counsel\" for defendant, in support <em>of </em>this contention, was very ingenious, we think it paradoxical. It is in effect a denial of the axiom that the greater includes the lesser. In murder there is always an assault to commit murder. When an indictment charges murder, it necessarily embraces an assault to commit murder. The Code of Criminal Procedure, art. 714, provides that murder includes all the lesser degrees of culpable homicide, and also an assault with intent to commit murder. It appears to us that this article of the Code is a conclusive answer to the position assumed by the learned counsel for defendant. We have carefully examined the authorities cited by them upon this question, and we do not think they conflict with the conclusion we have arrived at, and that is, that in charging murder all the elements which make the offense of assault with intent to murder are necessarily included.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The court, in its charge to the jury, when explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the difference between an assault with intent to murder, and an aggravated assault, uses this language: \u201cThe -offense, if any, would not be reduced to an aggravated assault, if you believe from the evidence that the defendant assaulted Siddie Acco with a knife, which was a deadly weapon, with intent to kill.\u201d The charge of the learned judge as a whole was a very able, clear and exhaustive embodiment of the law of the case, but we are of the opinion that the extract above quoted is erroneous; and, having direct reference to a most material issue in the case, it would be most likely to mislead the jury to the injury of the defendant\u2019s rights. The error in the paragraph quoted is this,\u2014it concludes with the word <em>kill </em>instead of the word <em>murder. </em>The defendant may have \u25a0assaulted Siddie Acco with a knife \u2014 a deadly weapon,\u2014 and with intent to kill him, and yet under circumstances which would, in case the death of Acco had ensued from the assault, have reduced the homicide to manslaughter. 'There exists an intention to <em>kill \u25a0 </em>in manslaughter, and therefore, notwithstanding the assault in this Case may have been made with the intent to <em>kill, </em>that would not necessarily make it an assault with intent to <em>murder. </em>The intent to kill may have existed without malice, and malice is as essential in the offense of an assault with intent to murder as it is in murder itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">It is clear, therefore, that, although the jury might have believed from the evidence that the assault was made with a deadly weapon, and with intent to <em>kill, </em>they might still very properly acquit the defendant of the charge of assault with intent to murder and find her guilty of an aggravated assault, provided the evidence did not satisfy their minds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the homicide, if accomplished, would have been murder. But the charge referred to instructs them plainly and positively to the contrary, and, while we do not doubt but that it was an accidental mistake in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>otherwise model charge of the learned judge, we think it was a most vital one to the defendant, and one which demands a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
