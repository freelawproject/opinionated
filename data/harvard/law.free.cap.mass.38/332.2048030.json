Now the notification which was left in this case was not signed, and so not to be considered as a written or printed order ; and the fact that the witness made some remark about training, it not appearing what that remark was, cannot be construed into a verbal notice, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We all think that a writ of certiorari should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
