He then proceeds thus : <em>\u201c </em>I also give and bequeath to my brother Isaiah Munroe, the balance of my estate, including a double-cased gold watch, my clothing, books., &amp;c. &amp;c., to be equally divided as follows, between Nathan Munroe, Solomon Munroe, Reuben Munroe, Dana Munroe, and Isaiah Munroe.

The petitioner contended that the will above described had been approved and allowed without notice to him ; that it purported to dispose of both real and persona] estate, and being attested by two witnesses only and so not being sufficient to pass real estate, it was void by the statute ; and that being thus void, the probate was a mere nullity, and the judge might and ought to treat it as such, and to grant original administration to the petitioner, in the same manner as if no .such will had been admitted to probate. The judge decreed that the petitioner should take nothing by his petition ; from which decree the present appeal was taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The case was argued in writing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-7\">Washburn, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av6\">referred to the provisions in <em>St. </em>1783, c. 24, \u00a7 2, that \u201c all devises and bequests of any lands,\u201d not attested by three witnesses, \u201c shall be utterly void and of no effect ; \u201d and in \u00a7 9, that any will \u201c which purports a disposition of both real and personal estate,\u201d that shall not be so attested, \u201c shall not be approved and allowed as a testament of personal estate only ; \u201d and to the point, that the will in question purported a disposition of both real and personal estate, he cited <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>17 Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzA\">delivered the opinion of the Court. By far the most important question in this case is, whether the will purports to pass real and personal estate, within the meaning of the statute. The Court are of opinion, that it does not purport to give both real and personal estate, and that taking the whole will together, there is nothing to pass real estate. All the legacies and every particular bequest is ' of personal property only. It depends upon the words, \u201c balance of my estate,\u201d in the residuary clause. Had there been any gift of real estate, in any other part of the will, then the words \u201c balance of my estate \u201d would naturally enough have applied to the remainder of the real estate. But the words in question are so associated and connected with gifts of personal estate only, that the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>applies, and limits their application to estate of the same kind. The will therefore was well attested by two witnesses, as the law then stood, although since altered by the Revised Statutes. Such being the opinion of the Court upon this question, it becomes unnecessary to inquire, whether if the will did purport to 'pass both real and personal estate, the probate of the will would have been conclusive upon the petitioner and others interested in establishing an intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">And whether the petitioner and others interested in the estate had notice of the probate of the will or not, is immaterial in this inquiry, because there being a will of personal property is decisive against the petitioner for a grant of administration. I have forborne to review the authorities applicable to the principal question, because they are very well stated in the argument for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
