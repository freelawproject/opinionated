He, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ever, held that in regard to the <em>name\u2014\u201c </em>Worcestershire Sauce\u201d\u2014\u201c it contains nothing but the name of the place where it is manufactured, and the word <em>\u2018 </em>sauce \u2019 as descriptive of the article sold,\u201d and that <em>\u201c </em>neither of these words can be used in such a manner as to give the exclusive use of them as a trade-mark.\u201d The learned judge referred to several decisions as authority upon the point. Among them is a case decided by himself <em>(Wolfe </em>agt. <em>Goulard, </em>18 <em>How. Pr. Rep., </em>64). That case has been cited with approbation in thirteen states of the Union. Perhaps the cases are so numerous as to establish a uniform current of authority in favor of the principle enunciated at special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">But we are not called upon to extend the principle to a case where it is not strictly applicable. For the purposes of this case it is not necessary to deny that the name of the place where an article is manufactured and the word which is descriptive of the article manufactured may not be used by any tradesman who there makes and vends the article. That is not this case. The defendants\u2019 preparation is not manufactured at \u201c Worcestershire; \u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 is and has been for more than thirty years.. The adoption, under such circumstances, of the very words contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark, and the imitation in colors, size, language and appearance of their labels and wrappers, are irresistible proof of an intention of the defendants to deceive the public and to lead purchasers to suppose that the defendants\u2019 preparation was the original Woreestershire sauce, so long manufactured by the plaintiffs. Where such an intention exists, the defendants should not be protected in their fraudulent imitation by the pretense that in the words employed the name of a place and the word descriptive of the article only are used. The defendants, doubtless, might, under proper circumstances, employ the name of a place where an article is manufactured, as well as the word descriptive of its character; but such words must be employed honestly and properly, and not with a design to imitate and deceive to the detriment of another. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Where words or names are in common use, no one person can claim a special appropriation of them to his peculiar use; but where words, and the allocation of words, have, by long use, become known as designating the article of a particular manufacturer, he acquires a right to them, as a trade-mark, which competing dealers cannot fraudulently invade. The essence of the wrong is the false representation and deceit. When the improper design is apparent, an injunction should be issued. In such cases injunctions have been sustained, though the name of a place, or of a celebrated person, were within the trade-mark protected by the injunction <em>(Messerole </em>agt. Tyneberg, 4 <em>Abbott, N. S., </em>410; <em>Matsell </em>agt. <em>Flanagan, </em>2 <em>Abbott, N. S., </em>459; <em>Amoskeag </em>agt. <em>Spear, </em>2 <em>Sandford, </em>599; <em>Caswell </em>agt. <em>Davis, </em>4 <em>Abbott, N. S., </em>6 ; <em>Newman </em>agt. <em>Alvord, </em>49 <em>Barbour, </em>588 ; <em>Wotherspoon </em>agt. <em>Currie, </em>27 <em>L. Times, R. N. S., </em>393).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In the last-mentioned case the plaintiff had purchased from Fulton &amp; Co., of Glenfield, near Paisley, the good-will and trade-mark of their business. They had for several years prior to 1847 manufactured powdered starch, principally from East India sago ; and was called <em>\u201c </em>Glenfield patent double refined powder starch,\u201d and commonly, <em>\u201c </em>Glenfield starch.\u201d The plaintiff had actually removed his manufactory from Glenfield to Maxwelton, where the starch was made and sold, when he applied for an injunction against John Currie, trading as Currie &amp; Co. Currie had rented a small building from Fulton <em>&amp; </em>Co., at Glenfield, where he manufactured starch, which was sold in packets similar in size and appearance to those of the plaintiff, and which he labeled \u201c the royal palace double refined patent powder starch, manufactured by Currie <em>&amp; </em>Co., Glenfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The plaintiff \u2019s case was that the defendant had taken the small building at Glenfield, and adopted the mark or label ' containing the name of that place, for the express purpose of inducing people to believe that his starch was the article made by the plaintiff. The vice-chancellor granted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>injunction, although the defendant was an actual resident at Glenfield and his manufactory was there. It was dissolved on appeal, but reinstated and affirmed by the house of lords. The vice-chancellor said \u201c That no man had a right to avail himself of a trade-mark, or to adopt any other means, whereby he should induce people to purchase his goods under the belief that they were purchasing the goods of another man and he was of opinion that \u201c the defendant had pursued that course with the deliberate and fraudulent intention of palming off his starch upon the public as the starch of the plaintiff, and acquiring a sale of his starch by means of the connection and reputation of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In <em>Newman </em>agt. <em>Alvord </em>(49 <em>Barb., </em>588) it appeared that the plaintiffs for thirteen years had carried on business at the village of Akron, in the county of Erie, where they manufactured and sold cement, or water-lime, which they designated as \u201c Akron cement,\u201d and \u201c Akron water-lime.\u201d The defendants manufactured an article in Onondaga county, which they labeled \u201c Alvord\u2019s Onondaga Akron cement or water-lime, manufactured at Syracuse, Hew York.\u201d They were perpetually enjoined from using the word \u201cAkron\u201d on their bills and labels, or in any other way in connection with the manufacture or sale of their cement or lime. The judgment awarding the injunction was affirmed at the general term, and also by the commission of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">As a general rule, geographical names cannot he appropriated as trade-marks, but the rule has its exception where the intention in the adoption of the descriptive word is not so much to indicate the place of manufacture as to intrench upon the previous use and popularity of another\u2019s trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The order appealed from should be modified and the injunction extended so as to prohibit the use of the words \u201cWorcestershire Sauce \u201d on the bills, labels and wrappers of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Beady, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
