The court has full power to compel all parties to do equity, and can, by its judgment or decree, protect the rights of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">It is urged, in support of the demurrer, that the plaintiffs have not been able to show any authority to support the position which they seek to maintain. _ This may be because the principle has been considered so well settled that no one has ever before raised the question; and that this is the true reason why such authorities cannot be found, is evidenced by the fact that, although the defendants have cited many authorities to show that tender must be made before suit brought, they are all cases, as I have before said, of actions at law, and they have been entirely unable to find a single case in equity where any such principle has ever been hinted at, much less decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The demurrer must be overruled, with costs. Defendants to be at liberty to withdraw demurrer and answer in twenty days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
