Wood and others, defendants, claiming that plaintiffs and defendants, except defendant Wood, as heirs-at-law and next of kin of one Benjamin Phelps, deceased, were tenants in common with defendant Wood in a house and lot in Camden village; and that said defendant Wood had received the rents of said premises, and they (said, plaintiffs and said other defendants) were entitled to one-half of said rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>The relief sought by this action was that defendant Wood account with plaintiffs and said other defendants, and pay over to them their shares of such rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-5\">The defendant Wood made answer, and the cause was referred to and tried before John F. Seymour, referee, who made his report, by which he found an amount due to each . of said plaintiffs and said other defendants, from defendant Wood, the aggregate of which is $125.50; and, as matters of law, found that said plaintiffs were entitled to receive and recover of defendant Wood the sum of twenty-five dollars and ten cents each, and said other defendants four dollars and eighteen cents each; but said referee did not, by his report, find or decide that said plaintiffs or any other party should recover costs in said suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-6\">Afterwards, and on the 12th day of April, 1873, Messrs. Adams <em>&amp; </em>Swan, claiming to act as plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, without any notice of application for judgment or any notice of taxation or adjustment of costs, entered a judgment upon said report, requiring said defendant Wood to pay said other defendants said sum of four dollars and eighteen- cents each, and to said plaintiffs said sum of twenty-five dollars and ten cents each, aggregating the sum of $125.50; and, also, that said plaintiffs recover of said defendant Wood the sum of $167.03, plaintiffs\u2019 costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-7\">Defendant Wood, by this his motion, seeks to set aside said judgment upon the grounds,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-8\">1st. That no notice of taxation of said costs was ever served upon his attorney; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-9\">2d. That this suit being in equity, and costs in the discretion of the court, and no costs being allowed or given plaintiffs by said referee\u2019s report, plaintiffs were not entitled to recover costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b8-10\">George K. Carroll, <em>attorney for defendant Wood.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b8-11\">I. Defendant Wood having duly appeared and answered, was entitled to notice of all proceedings, including notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>taxation of costs, and plaintiffs having omitted to give such notice, the judgment is irregular and will he set aside on motion <em>(Elson </em>agt. <em>N.

This was an equity suit; and the granting of costs to the prevailing party was in the discretion of the court; and no costs having been allowed by the court to the plaintiffs, costs were irregularly and improperly inserted in the judgment against the defendant Wood in favor of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b9-7\">This was not one of the actions enumerated in section 304 of the Code, in which plaintiff is entitled to recover costs as of course; but, under section 306, the costs were in the discretion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b9-8\">The right to give or withhold costs rests in the discretion of the court <em>(Staiger </em>agt. <em>Shultz, </em>3 <em>Keyes, </em>614); and the question of granting or withholding costs was properly in the discretion of the referee <em>(Platt </em>agt. <em>Styles, </em>17 <em>How., </em>211); and the referee\u2019s report not having granted costs to plaintiffs, costs were improperly included in the judgment entered in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b9-9\">The judgment should be set aside, with costs of motion to defendant, Wood.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b9-10\">J. R. Swan, Jr., <em>attorney for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b9-11\">This was an action brought under the provisions of section 9, page 39, 3d Revised Statutes, 5th ed., that \u201c one joint tenant or tenant in common may maintain an <em>action of account, </em>or for money had and received, against his cotenants, for receiving more than his just proportion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b10-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>I. The plaintiffs, having recovered more than fifty dollars, i are entitled to costs, as a matter of course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b10-5\">The defendants\u2019 counsel seems under the impression that an \u201caction of account\u201d and a \u201c suit for accounting\u201d are the same thing, which is an error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b10-6\">An \u201caction of account\u201d is an action for moneys had and received upon the law side of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b10-7\">Such an action will lie against a receiver for money had and received; also it will lie against a sheriff for money had and received; also it will lie against a bailiff for money had and received <em>(See forms of declarations in Humphrey's Precedents, for an action of account by one claimant against another, pp. </em>183 <em>to </em>192).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-8\">It is an action for money, not a suit for relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-9\"><em>(a.) </em>The act was passed giving this remedy to cotenants prior to 1813, when there was a distinction made between actions at law and suits in equity, and the words in the law an action of account,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>an action on the law side of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-10\"><em>(b.) </em>If an action was brought against a receiver to account for moneys had and received, or against a sheriff or bailiff, could any question be raised that it was not an action for money ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-11\"><em>(c.) </em>As to the nature and law of \u201c actions of account,\u201d see <em>Humphrey's </em>Precedents, 183 <em>and </em>184; 3 <em>Hill's R., </em>59; <em>Roll.

Humphrey\u2019s Precedents has the following form: <em>\u201c </em>Therefore, it is considered that the said defendant recover against the said plaintiff the sum or balance of-dollars and-cents, and also <em>the costs, </em>as in common cases of judgment final for defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>II. There is no motion here made for a retaxation of costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b11-5\">Hardin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Al\">The summons in this action asks for relief. The complaint states the respective estates of the respective parties in the premises described in the complaint, and asks in its prayer for a recovery by the <em>\u201c </em>plaintiffs, and all other persons who are tenants in common with defendant, Wood, in the proportions to which they are respectively entitled, and of the money and property received by Wood as the rents, issues and profits of said premises and interest\"thereon, * * * <em>and for such other or fm'ther relief </em>as to this court may seem meet, and that said defendant, Wood, be adjudged to pay the costs of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b11-6\">The referee finds the sum of money secured by the defendant Wood, and then states the respective interests of the parties, as well plaintiffs as well as some of the defendants therein, and orders judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-7\">The learned counsel for the plaintiffs insists that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover costs as of course in virtue of section 304 of the Code, and quotes subdivision 4 thereof in respect to <em>\u201c </em>actions for the recovery of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b11-8\">In <em>Buchanan </em>agt. <em>Morrell </em>(13 <em>How., </em>299), it was said that the nature of the action is to be determined by the allegations of the complaint and the relief it prays for <em>(See </em>\u00a7 275 ; <em>Davis </em>agt. <em>Landerston, </em>56 <em>Barb., </em>480).</p>\n<p id=\"b11-9\">By the Code, the distinction between legal and equitable remedies is abolished, and a uniform course of proceeding established. See preamble of the Code of 1848, and section 1 of said act, and if a party entitles himself to any remedy, either legal or equitable, his complaint is not to be dismissed because he has prayed for a judgment to which he is not entitled <em>(Emery </em>agt. <em>Pease, </em>20 <em>N. Y., </em>62; 30 <em>Barb., </em>9; 40 <em>N. Y., </em>504).</p>\n<p id=\"b11-10\">.The amount due in this case to each tenant or cotenant with Wood is a debt due severally to such tenant, not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>joint debt or demand. If this action be not regarded as an action for an accounting, and an action in equity, how can a judgment be upheld which awards to the several cotenants their several and respective rights <em>(Hall </em>agt. <em>Fisher, </em>20 <em>Barb., </em>466, 461)<em>?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b12-5\">But the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserts that the old action <em>\u201c of </em>account as for money had and received \u201d is given by the ninth section of the Revised Statutes, third volume, fifth edition, page 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-6\">True, that statute authorizes an action for money had and received by a tenant in common against his cotenant to render his just proportion, but the Code controls as to the form of action; besides, the complaint in this action with its prayer comes short of the old action <em>\u201c </em>of account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b12-7\">The history of that action is given <em>McNary </em>agt. <em>Rawson </em>(3 <em>Hill, </em>60). Bronson, J., in that case, declares the remedy obsolete. There is less need for that form of action now that legal and equitable remedies are blended and may be had in the same court.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-8\">Assuming, therefore, that this action was not solely and specially an action for the recovery of money, and that it must be classed as an equity action in order to give effect to the scope of the complaint and its prayer, the conclusion follows that the costs were within the discretion of the referee, and inasmuch as he has not awarded costs the plaintiffs were not authorized to tax and enter them in the judgment <em>(Staiger </em>agt. <em>Shultz, 3 Keyes, </em>614; <em>Pratt </em>agt. <em>Styles, 17 How., </em>211; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 306).</p>\n<p id=\"b12-9\">The motion must be granted without costs, as the question is novel, and without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs to move for directions to the referee to pass upon the question of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-10\">The defendant upon serving a copy of this opinion and a proposed order may have the order settled upon two days\u2019 notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
