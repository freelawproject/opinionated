It concedes the allegations of the complaint, and substantially claims that they require no defense; that, notwithstanding their truthfulness, they give the plaintiff no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">Under the Code, defenses are to be set up by answer (\u00a7 149, <em>subdivision </em>2; \u00a7 150, <em>latter part of subdivision </em>2), and if a defense, so set up, be sham, it may be stricken out under section 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">A defense applies to any facts which defeat the action wholly or partially <em>(Stewart </em>agt. <em>Travis, </em>10 <em>How., </em>148; <em>Houghton </em>agt. <em>Townsend, </em>8 <em>How., </em>441; <em>Foland </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>16 <em>Abb., </em>235).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">If there is no just ground for this demurrer, it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>treated as frivolous, and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is under section 247 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">He may move, on a notice of five days, for judgment thereon, and on such motion the sufficiency of the pleading may be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
