These answers were all amended March, 1868. Demurrers were interposed by the plaintiffs to these amended answers May, 1868, which were argued August, 1868, and sustained, and orders duly entered and served. From these orders the defendants jointly appealed to the general term, by their said' attorneys. The appeals were argued and decision rendered in March, 1870, in part affirming and in part reversing the orders of the special term, and orders entered and served accordingly by the plaintiffs July, 1870. Mr. Rathbun, one of the attorneys for the defendants, died in January, 1870, and service of the orders of the general term were served on Mr. Sittser, the surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>attorney. The general term orders allowed the defendants to amend such of their answers, as to which the demurrers were sustained, within twenty days, upon payment of costs of the demurrers to such answers, but they never amended those answers or paid costs, l\u00edo tice of trial in the several actions in the usual form, for the Cayuga October circuit, commencing October 3d, 1870, was served personally by the plaintiffs upon Mr. Sittser, the surviving attorney for the defendants, on the 19th day of September, 1870, Mr. Sittser retaining the copies served, and giving admission of service. Upon the back of each notice of trial so served was indorsed a notice, as follows: \u201c You will also take notice, that no personal claim is or will be made on the trial of this cause as against the defendants Dodge or Polhemus, either for damages or costs, and that judgment will be demanded only as against the defendant Stevenson for the amount of damages and costs for which he may be liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">These four causes were moved for trial by the plaintiffs October 13, 1870, counsel appearing in behalf of Stevenson only, and making a motion to put the causes over the term, Mr. Sittser being present. The motion was denied and the causes proceeded to trial in their order, and a jury empaneled. Mr. Sittser and the counsel who had made the motion in behalf of Stevenson appeared and were present. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case in each suit, the same counsel who had appeared for Stevenson only on the motion to postpone, stated \u201cthat he appeared simply for the purpose of objecting to the inquests, in behalf of Dodge and Polhemus,\u201d the other defendants, and put in evidence the plaintiffs\u2019 said notice of trial and the stipulation indorsed thereon, l\u00edo other evidence was introduced by the defendants, and the jury, under the instruction of the court, rendered their verdict in each case for the full amount claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">On the 13th day of October, 1870, judgments were entered upon the verdicts in each of the four actions, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>No. </em>1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">Damages.................... $4,987 82</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">Costs....................... 213 61</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">-- $5,201 43</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\"><em>No. </em>2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">Damages.......

Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG4\">The motion is based on an alleged irregularity in the proceedings on the part of the plaintiff, and is also addressed to the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The alleged irregularity is the want of due notice of trial. But the notice served on Mr. Sittser, the surviving attorney of the defendants, after the death of his partner, was regular and sufficient. The plaintiff\u2019s proceedings were regular, and, if they were not, the motion to set them aside for irregularity is too late, more than a year having elapsed since the payment was rendered, and the defendants had notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">So far as the motion is addressed to the discretion of the court, the principal ground urged for it is that the defendant ought to have an opportunity to set up in his answer the discharge of his copartners. To this there are insuperable objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">In the first place, it is not probable that the matter alleged wpuld constitute a defense if it were pleaded. The compromise between Saxton and Dodge, though made in the state of Ohio, was made in view of the laws of this state, and there can be no doubt, that in consideration of all the circumstances attending it, its effect is to be determined by the laws of this state. The papers read on this motion show very satisfactorily that when the compromise was made, the partnership had been dissolved. That .being the case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>compromise was valid under the laws of this state, and did not discharge Stevenson from his liability. <em>(Laws </em>1838, <em>chap. </em>257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">But waiving the question of the merits of the proposed defense, the delay and the conduct of the defendant with reference to the compromise, have been such that he ought not to be permitted to set it up at this late day, as matter of favor. His correspondence shows that he was informed of the compromise soon after it was made, and several months before the trial. Also, that he was informed of the trial and its result, in the fall of 1870. No satisfactory excuse is shown for his neglect to move in season. The claim that he was ignorant of the legal effect of the compromise, is no excuse. It appears very clearly, by his own letters, that when he was informed of the compromise, he acquiesced in it, and executed certain promissory notes with the intention of delivering them to Saxton for the purpose of carrying out the compromise. Afterwards he recalled the notes, and declined to deliver them, on the sole ground that he was unable to pay, and, as late as the 26th of September, 1870, he wrote to plaintiff, promising to pay him when able. That letter was written several days after- the causes were noticed for trial, and from its tenor and other circumstances, disclosed by the papers, it is apparent the defendant was informed of the fact that the causes had been noticed when he wrote the letter. In short, the case looks as if the defendant, having full knowledge of the compromise and of the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings in the action, made up his mind that it was useless to defend, as he was unable to pay, and the plaintiff would be unable to collect any judgment he might recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In addition to all this, is the circumstance that an action in equity has been commenced against Stevenson and others, to enforce the judgments, in which action Stevenson appeared and joined issue, as long ago as in November, 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Motion denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
