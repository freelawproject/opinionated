The action was originally commenced in the justice\u2019s court. The plaintiff claimed judgment for rent of house, fifty dollars; the defendant denying plaintiff\u2019s claim, demanded judgment in his own favor, by way of counter-claim, in the sum of fifty dollars and interest, for work and labor. The justice rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for fifty dollars and costs. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the county court for a new trial; no offer was made by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-11\">In the county court, the cause being tried with a jury, they rendered a verdict of no cause of action, whereupon, each party claimed costs. The clerk taxed the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>costs and judgment was entered accordingly, The plaintiff moved, in the county court, to strike the defendant\u2019s costs from the judgment, and insert his own in place thereof. The motion was granted by the county judge, and an order entered in accordance therewith.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-5\">Sharpe <em>&amp; </em>Winfield, <em>for respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-6\">B.

J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ayt\">The sole question presented is as to which party is entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The action was brought by plaintiff against defendant in a justice\u2019s court. The plaintiff asked a judgment for rent, and the defendant set up a counter-claim for work and labor. The defendant obtained judgment against the plaintiff for fifty dollars, besides costs. The plaintiff appealed, claiming a judgment in his favor of fifty dollars. The case was tried in the county court of Orange county, by a jury, and a verdict rendered of no cause of action. The county judge has, by order, given costs to the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals. The question of costs is to be determined without regard to any question of offer made or omitted to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The case, undisputedly, is one where the defendant was bound to make no offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The defendant was the prevailing party, and is entitled to costs by reason, thereof, unless he falls within an exception or limitation created under section 371 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">The learned county judge says the judgment was wholly reversed. I do not think it was. The justice\u2019s judgment established two things: 1st. That plaintiff had no claim against the defendant; and, 2d. That the defendant had a claim of fifty dollars against the plaintiff. The plaintiff appeals and claims what he claimed before the justice, namely, a judgment in his favor against the defendant, of fifty dollars or over. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">The new trial in the county court established two things: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>1st. That the plaintiff had no claim against the defendant; and, 2d. That defendant had none against the plaintiff. It was not an entire reversal of the justice\u2019s judgment; that part of it which destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s claim was upheld. If the justice\u2019s judgment had been simply for the defendant, destroying the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the plaintiff had appealed, there would be no question as to defendant\u2019s right to costs. When the defendant\u2019s rights are not affected by the question of offer, I cannot see how he ceases to be the prevailing party. He has not prevailed, it is true, to establish his own claim, but he has prevailed to destroy the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and, therefore, his judgment before the justice was not reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Order reversed, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
