The question raised upon the whole case is important and, substantially, uncontrolled by precedent in this state, and, to my mind, the position that upon default in such a continuing contract entire damages, extending beyond the commencement of the action, may be assessed, is opposed to the current of authorities within and without the state. In 8 <em>B., </em>412, it does not appear that any recovery was had beyond damages accrued at the time of bringing action <em>(vide </em>35 <em>Barb., </em>579), and the last case cited is principally as to the effect of the statute of frauds on such a contract. From the proposition that damages accruing after suit may be given, Mobg-ah, justice, dissents <em>(Dresser </em>agt. <em>Dresser, </em>35 <em>B., </em>578, 579). Hence I claim the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is not in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-10\">II. In the attempt to estimate future damages in a case like this, there is \u201c insuperable difficulty (2 <em>N. Y., </em>97; 35 <em>Barb., </em>579); a difficulty which has compelled the courts to arbitrarily exclude, from the consideration of juries, damages depending upon uncertain conjecture -and speculation as to the future operation of given causes or conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-11\"><em>(a.) </em>Profits, as such, are\" not allowed as damages, unless they can be <em>definitely </em>ascertained by reference to established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>rates; although the loss of them necessarily result from breach of the contract. The chief reason for disallowance being <em>\u201c </em>that they are too uncertain, and depend upon too many contingencies to be entitled to judicial sanction\u201d <em>(Rhodes </em>agt. <em>Baird, </em>16 <em>Ohio St., </em>573; <em>La Armistad, etc., </em>5 <em>Wheat., </em>389 ; <em>Griffin, </em>agt. <em>Colver, </em>16 <em>N. Y., </em>489; <em>Academy, etc., </em>agt. <em>Hackett, </em>2 <em>Hilt., </em>217).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">The same rule should control in any other case, where it is impossible to apply any definite rule of damages with certainty and precision (5 <em>Lans., </em>524).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">(5.) <em>\u201c </em>Actual compensation should only be allowed for actual loss.\u201d This has grown _into a maxim. A contrary rule is without equity. I submit that in this case this maxim has been subverted,\u2014was given no application except in <em>theory. </em>If plaintiff lives twenty years, does this verdict compensate her ? If she had died the day after the trial, what right had her estate to $1,000 for an actual loss of $325 <em>? </em>( <em>Weller </em>agt. <em>Eames, </em>2 <em>Am. Rpts., </em>150, <em>and cases cited; Gilbert </em>agt. <em>Wiman, </em>1 <em>Comst., </em>550; <em>Aberdeen </em>agt. <em>Blackman, </em>6 <em>Hill, </em>324; <em>Hayes </em>agt. <em>Moynihan, </em>52 <em>Ill., </em>423).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">III. The defendants should not suffer because plaintiff has brought her action in a form which renders an estimate of her damages impossible. Her remedy was adequate in equity. She could have compelled a literal performance, or got its yearly worth in money. This would be just to all. The verdict is totally unjust, because by no human power can it be known whether it is compensation or robbery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">The very ancient rule of allowing juries to guess at and conjecture damages in actions on contract is substantially overruled. The courts now seek to find a measure which can definitely appear from the terms of the contract, or from opinions of competent persons, as to values, or market rates, the legal measure being declared by the court. And arbitrary rules have been established in cases possessing the same uncertainty as this, and where before were only guess, conjecture and uncertainty <em>(Rhodes </em>agt. <em>Baird, </em>16 <em>Ohio St., </em>573; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>Bradley, </em>39 <em>N.

Much of the opinion is <em>obiter dietum; </em>and very clearly the declaration, that only one action would lie, that one recovery ended the contract, and final damages must be assessed, is contrary to the authorities (62 <em>Barb., </em>482).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">I submit, that this was a continuing contract; that the deceased could not terminate it alone, and that successive actions could be brought thereon by the plaintiff, <em>toties quoties, </em>in which by fixed and certain rules she could have recovered \u201cactual compensation for actual loss\u201d <em>(McConnell </em>agt. <em>Kibbe, </em>33 <em>Ill., 175; Ind.

An action for damages in eases of this kind affords no remedy, just or adequate, to plaintiff or defendant, unless held to be a continuing contract, with the right to successive actions <em>ioties quoties. </em>And the courts,' declaring that no proper measure of entire, damages can be applied, have in several cases decided that, for this reason, they will'not allow one party to such a contract to terminate it, but will compel the performance thereof by the exercise of equitable power, a remedy perfectly just, and which should exclude the attempt at impossible compensation by guessing at damages <em>(Rhodes </em>agt. <em>Rhodes, </em>3 <em>Sandf.

J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANH\">This action was brought for damages sustained by a breach of a contract made by the defendant\u2019s testator in his life for the support of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The main question to be determined is, whether an action for entire damages can be maintained for a breach of a contract of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">While the question is not entirely free from embarrassment, and there are difficulties in many cases in recovering for prospective damages, yet the rule is well settled that such damages may be allowed. In actions for personal injuries occasioned by another, such damages frequently constitute no inconsiderable portion of the amount to be recovered, and must be estimated somewhat upon evidence which forms no very certain basis for accurate and careful calculation. More reliable and satisfactory evidence is furnished in the case at bar than is usually presented, and I am unable to discover any valid reason why the plaintiff could not recover one entire amount instead of being compelled to bring separate actions from time to time for separate and distinct breaches of the contract, thus causing a multiplicity of suits, which it is the policy of the law to discourage. The value of the support of an aged person is not difficult to estimate, and in accordance with well established rules, which the courts have sanctioned, the value of the life itself can, without much difficulty, be computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">With evidence tending to show both these essential elements of the plaintiff\u2019s right to a recovery of damages, I do not think that it can be fairly claimed that the damages recovered in this case are so uncertain, speculative and conjectural as to be beyond any recognized rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">In <em>Shaffer </em>agt. <em>Lee </em>(8 <em>Barb., </em>412) an action was brought upon a bond to furnish to the obligee and his wife a support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>(luring their lives, and was held that it was an entire contract ; that a failure by the obligor to provide for the obligee and his wifej according to the substance and spirit of the covenant, amounted to a total breach, and that full damages might be recovered for the future as well as the past. The learned judge who wrote the opinion in the case last cited remarks that where the neglect or misconduct of the defendant is such that the plaintiff may consider it a total breach, entire damages may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The distinct question now considered was presented upon the trial, and it is an authority directly in point <em>(See also Dresser </em>agt. Dresser, 35 <em>Barb., </em>373).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">There was no error, I think, in introducing the Northampton tables as evidence, and of reading from them so much as showed the probabilities of life of a person of the age of plaintiff. These tables are used for the information and guidance of courts of justice in determining the probabilities of human life and the value thereof, and furnished to the jury some information which rendered material aid in forming a conclusion as to the amount of damages in the plaintiff\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">They are the result of careful inquiry and the closest calculations of experienced men, which have been adopted by the courts as the most accurate means of estimating the moneyed value of lives, and I see no objection to then,1 introduction as testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The evidence of Robinson to contradict Harris was, I I think, properly received. Harris\u2019 testimony tended to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to certain facts, and on cross-examination he denied that he had said that the plaintiff ought to have $1,000 out of the estate of the testator. Such a declaration would have been inconsistent with the testimony which he had given, and I think it was competent to contradict him in this respect by showing that he had made such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Hpon principle, without reference to authority, it seems to me it is very clear that it is proper to show that a witness has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>made a statement inconsistent and irreconcilable with the facts to which he testifies; and if he denies that he has made any such statement, then to show that he has. And it matters not whether it be a statement of fact or the expression of an opinion, if it be adverse to the story which he has narrated. If it be opinion in direct conflict with his evidence it would clearly tend to impair the credit of the witness to some extent, and in many cases as much perhaps as if it was a fact. I think the judge properly refused to <em>charge </em>as requested, that if the contract was to provide the plaintiff with a home in the family of the deceased, his death terminated the liability. The purport of the contract, if any was made, was to support the plaintiff during her life, and the general character of the evidence was ,to that effect. And even if it had been confined to his own family, as it was for the life of the plaintiff, I think that the testator\u2019s death would not terminate the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">There was no error in the charge or in any of the rulings upon the trial, and judgment must be ordered on the verdict for the plaintiff, with costs.. <em>r,</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
