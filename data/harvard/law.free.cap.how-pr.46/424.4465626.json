The complaint has been dismissed as to all the defendants except Yulee, and, it seems to me, very clear that this question of subrogation cannot now be litigated in this action, because Edward K\". Dickerson and associates are not now before the court, and they have the right to be heard upon that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>question, and it cannot be determined in their <em>absence; </em>and it is evident, from a reading of the opinion in the court of appeals, that in sending the case back as to the defendant Tulee, they had no idea that any question remained to be tried except the question of how much Tulee was liable for as indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It would appear, therefore, that as the question of subrogation cannot possibly be now tried in the action, that it is a proper case for the circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
