The arrest under the first of these executions, is a satisfaction of the judgment while the imprisonment continues; and the issuance of the second was in direct violation of the provisions of the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S., </em>364, \u00a7 7; 3 <em>R. S., 5th ed., </em>643, \u00a7 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The execution against defendant\u2019s person issued to the sheriff of Richmond county upon the judgment for $124.18, was, perhaps, properly issued, provided the action is one in which the jurisdiction of this court does not depend upon the personal service of the summons upon the defendant within the territorial limits of the city and county of New York <em>(See Landers </em>agt. <em>Staten Island R. R. Co., </em>14 <em>Abb. </em>[N. S.], 346), and provided an execution against the property of the defendant was first duly issued to said sheriff, and by him returned unsatisfied. Neither of these facts was made to appear or was claimed to exist, although it did appear that defendant at the time of his arrest in New York under the execution first above referred to, was a resident of the county of Richmond. For this reason the execution for $124.18 must also be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Motion granted and executions set aside with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
