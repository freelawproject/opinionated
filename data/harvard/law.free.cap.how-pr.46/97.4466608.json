The effect of this agreement was, upon the failure of the plaintiff to redeem within the specified time, to vest the legal title to the watch in the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-15\">This follows, unless the agreement amounted to nothing more than a simple pledge.

Failing to <em>redeem, </em>the title vested absolutely in the mortgagee, <em>by force of the agreement.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">The transaction cannot be called a contract of pledge, without ignoring entirely the <em>agreement itself, </em>and the <em>intent </em>of the parties, if <em>any </em>intent is to be gathered from the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">VII.

Blair; and while it was in Blair\u2019s possession plaintiff procured one Van Heusen to take it from pawn, he (Van Heusen) to advance eighty-two dollar's, and take the watch and hold it as security until payment of the sum advanced. After Van Heusen advanced the money and took the watch, plaintiff procured the defendant to advance the eighty-two dollars, and take the watch and hold it as security until repayment of the sum advanced, together with the sum of five dollars. This loan was to he repaid in thirty or sixty days. Before the expiration of the time agreed on, the plaintiff went to the defendant and procured him to agree to extend the time of payment for a few days. , The next day, after the extension was granted, plaintiff went and procured one Hayden to go with him to defendant and advance the money to take the watch out of pawn. The defendant was absent; upon his return the money was tendered, the watch demanded, and the defendant refused to accept the money or surrender the watch. The same money was kept and paid into court on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">The defendant gave evidence tending to show that he bought the watch absolutely, with an agreement, also, that plaintiff might repurchase within thirty days, and that plaintiff did not repurchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">The watch was agreed to he worth $125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-8\">Upon these facts the court declined to nonsuit the plaintiff, and submitted the case to the jury, with instructions that if they should find the transaction to have been a loan of money by defendant to plaintiff, and the taking of the watch as security for its repayment, then they should find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. .That if they should find the transaction between the plaintiff and defendant to have been an absolute sale of the watch, coupled with an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ment to resell, then they should find a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">Judgment having been suspended, with liberty to the plaintiff to move at special term for judgment, upon such application being made, judgment was ordered in favor of plaintiff; and from the judgment the defendant has appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">I. The transaction between the plaintiff and defendant was a pawn or pledge, and not a mortgage of the watch <em>(Brownell </em>agt. <em>Hawkins, </em>4 <em>Barb., </em>491; <em>Hasbrouck </em>agt. <em>Vandervoort, </em>4 <em>Sand., </em>74; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>Little, </em>2 <em>Coms., </em>443; <em>Reeves </em>agt. <em>Coppen, 5 Bing.

Even though there was a failure to pay within the time provided for by the agreement, still the defendant acquired no greater interest in the watch than he before had; and this was merely a special property to retain the goods for his security. There can be no forfeiture until the pawnor\u2019s rights are foreclosed <em>(Brownell </em>agt. <em>Hawkins, </em>4 <em>Barb., </em>492; <em>note Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, vol. </em>l, p. 360, <em>ed. of </em>1866).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-10\">IV.

But when, as in this case, the plaintiff only demands compensation in damages for a failure or refusal to deliver, the remedy at law is adequate <em>( Wilson </em>agt. <em>Little, </em>2 <em>Coms., </em>443; <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Dykers, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>593).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>By non-payment of a mortgage at the day, the mortgagee (of chattels) acquires the legal title.

The court instructed the jury that if the plaintiff sold the watch to the defendant, as testified to by the defendant, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; but if the watch was delivered to the defendant as security for the loan of money the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The jury found for the plaintiff, thus finding the transaction between the parties to be a pledge and not a sale of the watch. Upon this finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>plaintiff was entitled to a judgment on the verdict. It appears that the plaintiff had been examined in proceedings supplementary to execution, and testified that the watch was delivered to the defendant under an agreement to sell it to him, and for a repurchase of it on the expiration of thirty days, on payment of five dollars in addition to the sum paid for the watch by defendant. The plaintiff also testified that the watch was delivered to the defendant by way of pledge, redeemable in thirty days on payment of five dollars in addition to the sum borrowed. He admitted having testified in the supplementary proceedings as stated above and reaffirmed the truth of the statement, but yet insisted that there was no sale to defendant, and excused the discrepancy by saying that at the time of his examination in the supplementary proceedings he was hard pressed, and that he intended to prevent the creditors from getting the watch, but he did not intend to swear to a lie. The jury would have been justified in finding the facts as sworn to in the supplementary proceedings, and if they had their verdict should have been for the defendant. Exit they accepted the other version of the transaction, as they had the right to do, and taking it to be true their verdict was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that the plaintiff should have tendered the interest on the whole sum borrowed together with the eighty-seven dollars. I do not think so. Hone of the witnesses testify to an agreement to pay interest in addition to the five dollars bonus to be paid for the use of the money. In the absence of such an agreement the five dollars must be held to be in lieu of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The judgment mxxst be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
