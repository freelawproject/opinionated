The compensation to be paid was fixed by a resolution of the board at two dollars per day, and the bill or claim of the relator was audited and allowed May 13th, 1872, by the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>board at $416 for her services, extending from September 1st, 1871, to March 1st, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">A part of this sum was paid by the comptroller, but because of alleged absence from duty by the' relator, payment of the entire amount due was refused and audit denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">The moving papers also show that there were funds applicable to the relator\u2019s claim ; that she was a widow in destitute circumstances, and that the usual demands for audit and payment had been made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\">Abraham R.

She had been paid on account of it $104, leaving a balance of $312. For the period between September 1st, 1871, and March 1st, 1872, she has not been paid, although there is an appropriation for such purposes. I think the audit by the supervisors was sufficient, as the services for which the claim is made were rendered, to the county. It is very doubtful whether the auditor or even the comptroller can now disallow the claim where no fraud or mistake is alleged. Although the relator was disabled by an accident from personally performing all the services, it appears they were performed for her by her daughter and others. Ko injustice will be done the county by payment for services which were in good faith thus rendered. The claim is, moreover, legal and just. A mandamus must issue for the payment of the claim; and to obviate any technical difficulty in the way of the comptroller, the auditor must be directed, also by mandamus, to audit the claim for the amount of the balance due the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Perhaps such an order is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">Motions granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
