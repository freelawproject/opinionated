C.</author>\n<p id=\"Al5\">By these actions in lieu of the former prerogative writ of <em>certiorari, </em>several groups of taxpayers complain of the action of the Essex County Board of Taxation in revising assessments upon their respective properties for the tax year 1952, such action purporting to have been taken under sections of the statute vesting in the county board of taxation supervisory control for the purpose of examining, correcting, equalizing and revising assessments as first determined by the local assessors and listed and filed with it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Since these assessments are so subject to control by the county board, and since the collectors of the municipalities are bound by the corrections made in the assessment lists, final assessments responsive to the action of the county board herein complained of have been effected, and the respective municipalities have been joined with the county hoard as defendants. Assessments levied on property in the first instance by the assessors are not complete untiL the county hoard certifies the assessor\u2019s duplicate to the tax collector. <em>Middletown v. Ivins, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>36 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925); <em>Hackensack Wader Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals, 2 N. J. </em>157 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the several complaints essentially similar charges axe made of illegality of the action of the connty hoard, and unjust, unlawful and unconstitutional discrimination against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the taxpayers by the assessments revision so ordered. Before issue was joined on these allegations the complaint basic to the litigation, that filed in the case first above captioned, survived a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Law Division lacked jurisdiction <em>(Baldwin Const. Co. v. Essex County Bd. of Taxation, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>370 <em>(Law Div. </em>1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Defendants having answered in defense of the action complained of, now move for summary judgment on the pleadings, contending that the complaint evidences not only lack of jurisdiction in the court, but that any jurisdiction which may exist in the premises should not be exercised in view of the failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies available to them by appeal from the assessments to the county board<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thence to the Division of Tax Appeals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the legislative scheme being to provide a review of assessed valuations first in the county board of taxation and secondly in the Division of Tax Appeals. <em>Hackensack Water Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The exhaustion of such remedies is indeed required before proceedings in lieu of prerogative writ are maintainable, \u201cexcept where it is manifest that the interests of justice require otherwise.\u201d <em>(Rule </em>3:81\u201414) Plaintiffs insist on grounds to be noticed hereafter that they are not, on the basis of the pattern of grievance and claim for relief reflected in their complaints, remitted to exhaustion of such remedies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>From the judgment on appeal of the Division of Tax Appeals, an appeal goes to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, by force of <em>Rule </em>3:81\u20148. Such is the usual course of appeal litigation envisaged in the present practice, from the original assessment of the tax to the scrutiny of the appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The defendants further suggest on the instant motion that since the county board is a state administrative agency <em>(Warren v. Hudson County, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>178 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946)), and since plaintiffs characterize the assessments revision of the county board as an \u201corder\u201d and an \u201caction\u201d of finality, at least in the light of its immediate and allegedly unconstitutional infringement of their property rights, the matters complained of constitute a \u201cfinal decision or action\u201d of such board, subject to review on direct appeal to the Appellate Division under <em>Rule </em>3:81\u20148, <em>supra, </em>and that, accordingly, intervention by the Law Division in lieu of <em>certiorari </em>is_ inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Before reviewing the complaint in appraisal of its sufficiency to invoke the questioned jurisdiction of the court, it should be noticed that plaintiffs contend, in view of the identity of substance in the grounds urged in support of the instant motion and of that disposed of by the Law Division <em>(Baldwin Const. Co. v. Essex County Bd. of Taxation, supra), </em>that such conclusion, as the \u201claw of the case,\u201d is dispositive and binding on the court at present. There is considerable force to this argument for it must be conceded that the principal clash of view on that motion involved, as here, the impact of the rule of exhaustion of remedies on the asserted jurisdiction of the court. The adequacy of. the complaint was there examined to assess the manifest requirements of the interests of justice under <em>Rule </em>3 :81\u201414, <em>supra. </em>I do not believe defendants suggested there, at least with emphasis, the availability of direct appeal under <em>Rule </em>3 :81-8, <em>supra, </em>to the Appellate Division. Nor had there been then the joinder of factual issue, regarded by defendants at this juncture as significant on the question of \u201cwhether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the matter is ripe, as a matter of policy, for judicial determination.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Fitzpatrick, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>477 (1952). Moreover, new parties have come in, and although their interests and contentions reflect no widening of the issues then submitted, they were not heard thereon at that time. On the whole, and although I find myself in basic accord with the views of the learned judge who decided that motion, I feel that my decision should rest, independently thereof, on the broad merits of the motion now before me, which will have the incidental effect of entirety in determination, making complete review of my action available.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The complaints recount the progressive making of assessments in the statutory formula, in that assessments were made on plaintiffs\u2019 real, and in some instances their personal, property for the tax year 1952 by the local assessors and recorded in the statutory assessment lists and duplicates .filed on or about January 10, 1952 with the county board; that such board met with the assessors, conformably to the statute, on January 25, 1952 for the purpose of equalizing assessments of real property as among the several districts, no business of consequence as concerning the instant assessments having been considered. The complaint alleges that on March 10, 1952, the county board by telephone instructed the assessors to refrain from completing their tax records because the county board was contemplating changes in certain assessments, and shortly thereafter the assessors received memoranda from the county board as to various changes. On March 20, 1952, the board, issued an order purporting to correct and revise the tax lists of assessments and directing such changes in assessments to be made. The assessors, or certain of them, met again with the county board on a telegraphic summons from the board on March 24 and some of the assessors expressed disagreement with the order of the county board, and argued their reasons therefor, to the effect that the random (\u201cpicking out properties here and there\u201d) selection of properties for the increasing of assessments \u201cresulted in unfair and arbitrary treatment of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>taxpayers and required them to pay an unfair share of: the taxes of the municipality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">To a request that it disclose the basis for its changes in assessments, the county board demurred on the ground that such information was confidential, in which position, apparently, it could claim some justification, in view of the wide area of informational source approved by our courts in addition to the view and investigation directed by statute. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-15; <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:4-47; <em>Middletown v. Ivins, supra. </em>These objections, however, are said to have elicited an admission by the county board president that limitations of time, information and funds for full investigation made it impossible for the board fully to comply with its statutory obligation of revision, correction and equalization of assessments; that accordingly, the board had undertaken a partial adjustment of some of the assessments. The possibility, even the probability, of error under these circumstances was conceded and the assessors were reminded that dissatisfied taxpayers had their remedy for correction of any such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The motion for summary judgment under <em>Rule 3 </em>:56 searches the record of pleadings and pre-trial proofs for the real existence of a triable issue of material fact, for its granting depends upon a showing \u201cpalpably that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d On the other hand, the motion for judgment under <em>Rule 3 :12-3 </em>(if. made on purely legal grounds confined to the pleadings) measures the content of the complaint alone, to determine whether it fulfills the requirements of <em>Rule </em>3:8-l in setting forth a valid factual case entitling the pleader to relief. This motion discards legal conclusions, ambiguities of assertion and the like, and precipitates the material allegations of fact. This residue of well-pleaded fact is accepted as true under <em>Rule </em>3 :12~3, <em>supra,, </em>as it is under the federal rule which is its counterpart. <em>Federal Rules Civil Procedure, Rule </em>12(c), 28 <em>JJ. 8. C. A.; Hackensack </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Water Co. v. North Bergen Twp., </em>103 <em>F. Supp. </em>133 <em>(D. C. N. J. </em>1952). The movant admits not only the well-pleaded facts, but all legitimate inferences which they accommodate. <em>Kelly v. Hoffman, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>695 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). The power to exercise judgment on the pleadings is so drastic in result that it is exercised sparingly, and only in ease the pleading, liberally construed in favor of the pleader, is clearly and palpably insufficient in a legal sense. <em>Evangelista v. Public Service Coord. Transport, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>164 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">With these- standards in mind it remains to examine the complaints which are asserted to allege a purposeful and unjust discrimination against plaintiffs in the revising of assessments upon their properties;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> extensive documentation of these charges is set out in the complaints, some aspects of which are summarized in the brief of the plaintiffs Baldwin Construction Co., <em>et al., </em>filed herein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Crediting the complaints with the reasonable inferential breadth to which their factual allegations are entitled, it is obvious that they charge unjust, arbitrary and intentional discrimination in the revising of the assessments, which would bring such action within the condemnation of Section I of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as distinguished from mere errors of judgment having the possible effect, but not the apparent purpose, of discrimination in its commonly understood sense. <em>Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Twp. of Wakefield, </em>247 <em>U. S. </em>350, 38 <em>S. Ct. </em>495, 62 <em>L. Ed. </em>1154 (1918); <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co. v. City of Hoboken, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>543 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), reversed other grounds, <em>D. L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. City of Hoboken and State of New Jersey, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>418 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1952). It has been said that * * mere errors of judgment do not support a claim of discrimination, * * * there must be something more\u2014something -which in effect amounts to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity.\u201d <em>Sioux Oily Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, </em>260 <em>U. S. </em>441, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>S. Ct. </em>190, 193, 67 <em>L. Ed. </em>340 (1923). This classification of the cases pleaded, into the category of constitutionally unsound discrimination brings us to the focal question on the motion, that is whether the administrative relief available is such as to justify withholding the remedy in lieu of the former writ of <em>certiorari, </em>in the light of the manifest requirements of justice. <em>Rule </em>3 :81\u201414, <em>supra. </em>The motion thus invokes a judicial determination as to the nature and scope of that administrative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The taxpayers insist that neither the county board of taxation, nor the Division of Tax Appeals, as administrative tribunals, has or will exercise authority to reduce assessments below true value, even where unlawful (unconstitutional) discrimination exists. And it is undeniable that for many years conflict has existed between our courts, as well as our tax tribunals, on the one hand and the United States Supreme Court on the other, on the issue of relief from tax assessments discriminatory in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment. A landmark decision was that of our former Supreme Court in <em>Royal Mfg. Co. v. Board of Equalization </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>402 (1908), which held that in view of the statutory requirement that property be taxed at its true value,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the taxpayer discriminated against was remitted to a form of relief described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201c* * * so that the fact that the property of A. is assessed at its true value, and the property of other taxpayers within the same district is assessed below its true value, affords A. no ground for demanding a reduction of his valuation, though it does entitle him to apply for an increase in the valuation of the others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The United States Supreme Court has not hesitated to deny the adequacy of this relief to protect the taxpayer\u2019s rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>under the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, supra; Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, </em>284 <em>U. S. </em>239, 52 <em>S. Ct. </em>133, 76 <em>L. Ed. </em>265 (1931)), even where the more apt relief of reducing the faulty assessment would represent a departure from state law, on the principle \u201cthat where it is impossible to secure both the standard of the true value, and the uniformity and equality required by law, the latter requirement is to be preferred as the just and ultimate purpose of the law.\u201d <em>Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision, </em>284 <em>U. S. </em>23, 52 <em>S. Ct. </em>48, 50, 76 <em>L. Ed. </em>146 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In 1927 and again in 1934, long after the decision in <em>Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, supra, </em>had delineated so clearly the federal rule on the subject, our former Supreme Court withheld <em>certiorari </em>in deference to our constitutional and statutory formula of taxation at \u201ctrue Aralue\u201d <em>(Hackensack Water Co. v. State Board, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>48 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>Lehigh Valley Ry. Co. v. State Board, </em>12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>673 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934)), reemphasizing in the latter case the \u201cestablished law of this state that the fact that other property in a taxing district is assessed for valuation at less than its true value affords no ground for reducing the assessment placed upon the property of a complaining taxpayer below the true value thereof,\u201d citing <em>Royal Mfg. Co. v. Board of Equalization, supra, </em>and confirming that the \u201claw, on this point, is also settled and controlling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In this posture and as lately as 1946, the United States Supreme Court considered the <em>Royal </em>doctrine as established in a long line of Hew Jersey decisions, and held that there was \u201csuch uncertainty concerning the Hew Jersey remedy as to make it speculative whether the State affords full protection to the federal rights,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Hillsborough Twp. v. Cromwell, </em>326 <em>U. S. </em>620, 66 <em>S. Ct. </em>445, 449, 90 <em>L. Ed. </em>358.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">More recently, however, there appears persuasive evidence of a change in our judicial thinking, to the effect that even a constitutional or statutory mandate to assess at full value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>must yield to the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even before vindication of those rights in the federal courts becomes necessary. It may be that changes wrought by our 1947 Constitution account for this belated acceptance of the federal doctrine. Our constitutional concept of taxation has changed from \u201ctrue value\u201d to uniform standards of value.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So, too, judicial changes, such as the superseding of the ancient writ of <em>certiorari </em>by <em>Rule </em>3 :81\u20141, may be of significance. That writ, <em>inter </em>alia, was the vehicle of review of - judgments of the former State Board of Tax Appeals; its allowance was discretionary, and its denial not appealable to the former Court of Errors and Appeals <em>(Post v. </em>Anderson, 111 <em>N. J. L. </em>303 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933)); and this status left it so optional with those courts to enforce or to fail to enforce rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, as to justify acceptance of jurisdiction by the federal courts to protect those rights, even against the general jurisdictional rule immunizing state taxation from assault in the federal courts. <em>Matthews v. Rodgers, </em>284 <em>U. S. </em>521, 52 <em>S. Ct. </em>217, 76 <em>L. Ed. </em>447 (1932); <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, </em>319 <em>U. S. </em>293, 63 <em>S. Ct. </em>1070, 87 <em>L. Ed. </em>1407 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">For that appellate function of the superseded writ, there is substituted the appeal as of right from the final decision of the Division of Tax Appeals to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court. <em>Rule </em>3 :81-8, <em>supra. </em>The result is that since 1948 the taxpayer may obtain, as of right, the judgment of New Jersey appellate courts on the constitutional tax questions affecting his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, as distinguished from the \u201cuncertainty surrounding the state remedy\u201d commented upon in the <em>Hills-borough </em>case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>To whatever extent these or other developments are responsible, there have been authoritative pronouncements presaging the abandonment of the <em>Royal </em>doctrine. In <em>Jersey City v. Division of Tax Appeals, 5 N. J. Super. 315 (App. Div. </em>1949), onr Appellate Division held that in a case of disparity in valuation assessments representing unconstitutional discrimination under the <em>Sioux City </em>rule, <em>supra, </em>the taxpayers would \u201chave the opportunity to prove the fact before one or other of the tax boards.\u201d In <em>Hackensack Water Co. v. Twp. of North Bergen, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>139 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), the Appellate Division speaking through the same learned judge in reviewing and approving a denial of leave by the Division of Tax Appeals to permit a taxpayer to amend a petition of appeal to add a charge of discrimination in assessment, commented that in <em>Jersey City v. Division of Tax Appeals, supra: </em>\u201cWe said that a taxpayer may raise the question of discrimination and have relief before the County tax board or the Division of Tax Appeals.\u201d Although the court in neither instance specified in terms the type of relief it prophesied would be obtainable before the tax tribunals, whether that available under the <em>Royal </em>principle, or the relief designated by the <em>Hillsborough </em>decision as the only constitutionally satisfactory one, it is clear that it meant the latter, if only from the warmth of its approval of the principle of the <em>Sioux Gily </em>and <em>Hillsborough </em>cases. In <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co. v. City of Hoboken, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>543, <em>supra, </em>the same court again by the same learned spokesman, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cA discrimination between taxpayers, so that one is assessed upon the full value of his property and others are assessed upon only a fraction of full value, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. * * * It was formerly considered that the only remedy of the taxpayer who was the victim of the discrimination was a proceeding to increase the assessments of other taxpayers, but now we recognize that such a remedy is not enough and that he may rightfully demand that his own assessment be reduced to the common level. The constitutional mandate to assess at full value must yield to the even more fundamental requirement of relative equality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Insofar as these latter views affect the enforcement in the tax tribunals of rights of the general taxpayer, it is noticed that they were expressed in a case involving assessments of Class II railroad property under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:29A-1, <em>et seq., </em>under a somewhat elaborate formula adaptable uniquely to railroad property, the statute specifically empowering the appellate tax tribunal to correct, adjust and equalize the tax, <em>inter alia, </em>upon its finding \u201cthat there has been illegal discrimination in the assessment\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>54:29A-33), an authority which is not conferred either on the county board or the Division of Tax Appeals, on appeal of assessments made under the General Tax Act, as here. On the contrary, the county .board on such appeal is directed by statute to \u201crevise and correct the assessment in accordance with the true value of the taxable property\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-22, as most recently amended in 1946, <em>L. </em>1946, c. 161, <em>p. </em>730, \u00a7 17); and the Division of Tax Appeals on reviewing such determination has no more specific nor informative authority by statute than to \u201creview such action and proceedings and give such judgment therein as it may think proper.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:2-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On the basis of the views expressed by the Appellate Division in 1949, 1950 and 1951, as above noted, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey declined jurisdiction in a case in which such unconstitutional discrimination was well pleaded, on the theory that there exists presently in the courts of New Jersey a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, to the exhaustion of which the taxpayer was remitted in protection of his federal rights, before intervention by the federal courts would be justified. <em>Hackensack Water Co. v. North Bergen Twp., </em>103 <em>F. Supp. </em>133, <em>supra. </em>On November 28, 1952, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 200 <em>F. 2d </em>313, 316, affirmed this judgment, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cWith the present pertinent state law clearly allowing a taxpayer to raise the question of unlawful discrimination, the situation which called forth the Hillsborough decision of 1946 no longer exists in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>New Jersey. Appellant, as we see it, needs only to press its 1948 assessment appeal in order to have that issue passed upon and determined by the state courts. Having that course open to it appellant cannot use the Hillsborough principle to justify its suit in the district court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Neither of these latter opinions ventured, nor need they have, any prognostication of the impact of a taxpayer\u2019s charge of unconstitutional discrimination not in excess of \u201ctrue value\u201d on the tax tribunals of New Jersey as distinguished from its courts, for the denial of federal jurisdiction depends on the existence of ultimate legal remedy in the state courts and not on the adequacy of administrative relief, the denial of which would be appealable of right to those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">These opinions, considered in the light of the settled federal law on the subject, are projected, with some logic, as accomplishing the decisional doom of the <em>Royal </em>doctrine in the courts. They do seem to me, however, to leave unanswered the question as to whether the instant plaintiffs would not face legal frustration in the tax tribunals themselves, impaled as these bodies might feel themselves to be on the horns of a dilemma of confusing aspects. On the one hand, the statute directs them to correct assessments \u201cin accordance with the true value of the taxable property.\u201d As administrative tribunals, they have long forsworn the authority of deciding the constitutionality of a state statute. <em>Erie Railroad System v. Walsh, 25 N. J. Misc. </em>269 <em>(Div. Tax App. </em>1947); <em>Jamouneau v. Newark, </em>25 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>345 <em>(Div. Tax App. </em>1947). Regarding its own powers, the Division of Tax Appeals has described itself as a special statutory tribunal, strictly limited within the bounds of jurisdiction prescribed by the Legislature. <em>Hoboken v. Kelly, </em>21 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>193 <em>(St. Bd. Tax App. </em>1943); <em>North Bergen Twp. v. Hackensack Water Co., </em>26 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>6 <em>(Div. Tax App. </em>1947). It has considered the constitutional implications of discriminatory assessments as beyond its purview <em>(Duke Power Co. v. Hillsborough Twp., </em>20 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>240 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>(St. Bd. Tax App. </em>1942)), and this position, of course, has been supported by the courts, for determination of the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature rests with a judicial body alone. In <em>Schwartz v. Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>129 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942), affirmed 130 <em>N. J. L. </em>177 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943) our former Supreme Court, by Mr. Justice Colie, declared that the former State Board of Tax Appeals had no authority to weigh the constitutionality of a statute under the State Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was the duty of the administrative body to accept the statute as constitutional until such time as it had- been declared unconstitutional by a qualified judicial body. In that case, incidentally, prosecution of writ of <em>certiorari </em>direct to the county board of taxation, was approved against the rule of exhaustion of remedies for the very reason that the State Board of Tax Appeals could not be expected to decide the constitutionality of a statute on which the taxpayer\u2019s case depended.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">As against these impelling reasons to comply with the statute mentioned, the tax tribunals are faced with that concept of their duty expressed in the recent cases mentioned. These cases tell the administrative bodies, in effect, that they must afford relief against discrimination and that the taxpayer \u201cmay rightfully demand that his own assessment be reduced to the common level. The (constitutional) mandate to assess at full value must yield to the even more fundamental requirement of relative equality.\u201d (Parentheses supplied to suggest substitution of word \u201cstatutory.\u201d) But no case is suggested to me in which either (1) the administrative refusal of relief from a discriminatory assessment (if within \u201ctrue value\u201d) has been reversed by a state court, or (2) in which one of the administrative -agencies has relieved from a discriminatory assessment, within the boundary of \u201ctrue value,\u201d or (3) in which a court specifically, for purposes of decision, has determined that the \u201ctrue value\u201d delineation of the administrative body\u2019s duty on appeal is unconstitutional to the extent that it forestalls relief from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>discriminatory assessment not above \u201ctrue value.\u201d The federal courts had long pointed to the constitutional vice of discrimination, without perceptible affirmative effect on either our courts or tax tribunals, and although our courts, as stated, now have confirmed the constitutional superiority of relative equality to the concept of \u201ctrue value,\u201d and although our organic law of 1947 has recognized the principle, the statute, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:3-22, <em>supra, </em>remains as it was, and the \u201ctrue value\u201d theme guides the assessment, statute-wise, from its birth, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:L-1,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> through the course of its administrative examination, as noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">If the legislative pattern has lagged behind the developments of the law, it seems probable that transcendent uncertainty will haunt the course of this litigation if remanded now to the tax tribunals. Conceivably, after the most burdensome of litigations of these multiple appeals, the constitutional question will emerge into the sunlight of judicial scrutiny and a definitive rule, measuring the constitutionality of the \u201ctrue value\u201d concept in specific terms, will be forthcoming, reversing and remanding to the tax tribunals, so that the complaining taxpayers will face, in effect, two extensive litigations. In all deference to the recent pronouncements of our Appellate Division (and I am convinced of the soundness of their principle), I see no evidence to justify the hope that the tax bodies will abandon their adherence to what they (fortified by very respectable judicial authority in the recent past) conceive to be their duty to adhere to the statutory directive keyed to \u201ctrue value,\u201d and to that extent unmindful of discrimination within the confines of \u201ctrue value.\u201d A further impediment exists on the county board appeal level, for that body in its guosi-j udicial capacity is called upon io review on appeal that which it has done in its administrative capacity under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:4-46, 47, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and to consider with judicial impartiality an asserted wrong which it, administratively, had theretofore stoutly maintained, over substantial and identical objections, was right and just. Certainly, this dualism of function is the necessary legislative design, and there can be no doubt that the men of honor comprising this body would consciously exert themselves to objectivity, but the pattern of incongruity thus established adds little to the premise of clarity, sufficiency and adequacy of the administrative remedy pointed to as the alternative to immediate relief in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In this posture what are the \u201cmanifest requirements of the interests of justice\u201d presented by <em>Rule </em>3:81-14, <em>supra,, </em>as the guide to enforcement of the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedy? That standard must import the premise that to remit to the exhaustion of administrative remedy, such remedy must be certainly available, clearly effective and completely .adequate to right the wrong complained of. Traditionally, the former prerogative writs quickened.where justice pointed to the urgency of relief and the futility of the administrative process, as where the jurisdiction of the statutory tribunal was questioned short of final judgment <em>(Schwartz v. Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>177 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943)); where a constitutional question existed, insoluble in the administrative forum <em>(Schwartz v. Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>129, <em>supra); </em>where the facts and the applicable law were clear <em>(Lane v. Bigelow, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>195 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947)); where a pure legal question existed <em>(Conaway v. Atlantic City, </em>107 <em>N. J. L. </em>404 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931)); where the statutory remedy was not final and effective (as to accomplish an ouster from office) <em>(Koven v. Stanley, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>446 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913)); where \u201cimportant principles of law\u201d required a prompt \u201cjudicial construction\u201d <em>(State v. Betts, </em>24 <em>N. J. L. </em>555 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1854)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The absolutism of the rule of exhaustion of remedies was stoutly denied before the superseding of the former prerogative writs <em>(Lane v. </em>Bigelow, <em>supra; Redcay v. State Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>of Education, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>281 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942)) and has been no less rejected, where the interests of justice required, since 1948. In <em>Ward v. Keenan, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>298 (1949), it was emphasized that the existing substantive law surrounding the former prerogative writs survived the superseding of the writs and formed a field for scrutiny for purposes of guidance in the just application of <em>Rule </em>3:81-14, <em>supra, </em>the court recalling, <em>inter alia, </em>the grant of <em>certiorari </em>in cases involving jurisdiction, whereby \u201cthe parties would he spared the vexation of a useless hearing.\u201d In <em>Waldor v. Untermann, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), Justice Jacobs commented :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cIndeed, when <em>Rule </em>3:81-14 was adopted it was well recognized that there may be other situations in which the interests of justice will clearly dictate immediate judicial determination without awaiting the administrative process and the very purpose of its general and comprehensive phraseology was to permit these to be dealt with properly as they arise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Again, the Supreme Court recalled the motivation for including in <em>Rule </em>3 :81\u201414, <em>supra, </em>the saving clause \u201cexcept where it is manifest that the interests of justice require otherwise,\u201d adverting to the court\u2019s awareness of the \u201cinconvenience, expense and injustice that must necessarily flow from the arbitrary enforcement of the doctrine of the exhaustion of administrative remedies in each and every ease, regardless of the circumstances and the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Fitzpatrick, supra. </em>In carefully guarding the rule from the supposition that the exception to <em>Rule </em>3:81\u201414, <em>supra, </em>was limited to the classes of cases then being discussed, the court charted the duty of this court in the very type of case under consideration here, by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cIn overy ease the court should determine whether it is in the interest of justice to dispense with the requirement that the plaintiff exhaust other judicial or administrative remedies, bearing in mind, however, that <em>Rule </em>3:81-14 itself dictates that the interest of justice is ordinarily best served by requiring the plaintiff to first exhaust his other remedies and that it is only in special circumstances that the interest of justice will require otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Under these standards, I have no doubt that it is my duty to deny the motion and exercise the jurisdiction invoked by the complaints, for the conclusion seems inescapable to me that for the reasons previously discussed the administrative remedy is at best uncertain, if it is not, indeed, nonexistent in the practical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As to the suggestion that a direct appeal should go under <em>Rule </em>3 :81\u20148, <em>supra, </em>to the Appellate Division in lieu of intervention in the nature of the former writ of <em>certiorari, </em>I think that rule encompasses that portion of the <em>certiorari </em>function formerly available for purpose of appeal or review, which imported, if the agency had a reviewing capacity, a judicial trial and determination there, to be reviewed on <em>certiorari. </em>This is the \u201cfinal action\u201d or \u201cdecision\u201d (in cases where the machinery for such trial and determination exists, of course) envisaged by that rule. The review of the administrative act, although also by <em>certiorari </em>in the former practice, was not the same proceeding in substance, but was comparable to the issue advanced by the complaints in the instant case. The distinction was noted in <em>Middletown v. Ivins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The motion for judgment on the pleadings and to dismiss the complaints is denied. An appropriate order should bo presented by counsel on notice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> <em>N. J. S.
