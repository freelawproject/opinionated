Having waived indictment and trial by jury, two accusations were presented to the Passaic County Court charging him with the commission on September 4, 3.951, in the City of Passaic, of an atrocious assault and battery and of malicious mischief. He entered a plea of not guilty. Counsel was assigned to defend him. The trial was conducted on September 21, 1951, before a judge of the Passaic County Court, and the defendant was found guilty of the commission of both offenses. He was sentenced on October 11, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">On March 1, 1952, he filed a notice of appeal which, following a recital of his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, states: \u201cdo hereby give notice of appeal Lo be taken to the Appellate Division of the Honorable Superior Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>New Jersey. Appeal is from the denial of the Honorable Judge Alexander MacLeod on February 29, 1952, whereby \u25a0he denied relief of Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The .reqord does not reveal that any motion for a new trial was ever made afid the county prosecutor assures us that he never had any notice or knowledge of such an application. At most' it can only be conjectured that there may have been, as occasionally occurs in similar situations, some' correspondence between the prisoner and the judge concerning the subject of a reconsideration of the conviction. But see <em>In re Kershner, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>471 (1952). Moreover it is not evident that the motion for a new trial was timely. <em>Vide, Rule </em>2:7-11. .</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">^However, in the circumstances we have given the notice of appeal a liberal construction and we have reviewed the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In response to the defendant\u2019s stated reasons for appellate relief we need only indicate that obviously the defendant waived a trial by jury, was represented by counsel at the trial and voluntarily entrusted the determination of the evidential facts and their legitimately derivative inferences to the trial judge. There was some evidence to be found in the testimony of the witness Howard Mitchell that the defendant utilized some \u201cunknown instrument.\u201d \u201cIt looked liie he had something in his hand.\u201d Additionally, the characteristics of the scars alongside of the left eye of the witness were exhibited to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The defendant\u2019s defensive explanation was that he had no recollection of having committed the acts alleged in the accusations. The limitation of the scope and expansion of testimony is a matter within the discretionary province of the trial judge. <em>Bradley v. D. E. Cleary Co., </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>338, 341 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>Testa v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>9, 12 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947). We fail to discover in the record any mistaken exercise of that judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Failing to perceive any error in the transcript of the proceedings which prejudicially affected the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>rights of the defendant, the judgments of guilty rendered on both accusations are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b351-5\">Bigelow, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ApW\">(dissenting). One of the indictments charged Congro with an atrocious assault and battery committed upon Howard Mitchell, contrary to <em>R. S. </em>2:110-1. The learned trial judge, sitting without a jury, found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to imprisonment for not less than five nor more than seven years. My colleagues have determined that the judgment should be affirmed. I dissent. Accepting as true; the evidence presented by the State, it seems to me clear that the defendant was not guilty of an atrocious assault and battery, but only of a simple assault and battery, and that of a minor character, for which imprisonment for a month or so would be adequate punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The fracas occurred early in the morning, in front of Congro\u2019s house. He and one Edward Mitchell were fighting. Edward had Congro by the head \u201cso he eouLdn\u2019t hit me any more.\u201d At that moment, Edward\u2019s brother Howard\u2014the man named in the indictment\u2014arrived on the scene. He saw Edward and Congro and \u201cstarted to pry them apart.\u201d Congro \u201cyanked and got away\u201d from Edward and punched Howard in the face. Howard testified that \u201cIt looked like he had something in his hand. * * * I wouldn\u2019t swear what it was because it was dark.\u201d On cross-examination he said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t swear for sure\u201d that he had anything in his hand. Edward, in his testimony, did not mention anything in the nature of a weapon. Edward\u2019s wife, who was a bystander, testified that she did not see anything in Congro\u2019s hand. She did say that \u201cHe was kind of drunk\u201d but \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so drunk that ho couldn\u2019t stand on his feet.\u201d The skin beside Howard\u2019s left eye was broken by the blow and blood ran down his face. The scars were still visible at the trial two weeks after the assault. But it does not appear that Howard needed or received any medical care or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>incapacitated from following his usual occupations even for a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The crime of which Congro was convicted is described by the statute as \u201c'an atrocious assault and battery by maiming or wounding another.\u201d Atrocious means \u201csavagely brutal; outrageously cruel or wicked.\u201d In <em>State v. </em>Capawanna, 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>429 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>337 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938), an atrocious assault and battery was defined as \u201can assault and battery, savage and cruel in character, which results in a maiming or wounding.\u201d Mayhem is the most severe personal injury that may be inflicted on a person short of homicide. Since every maiming is also a wounding, the use of the former term in the statute adds nothing to the definition of the crime unless it be to lend color to the kind of wounding that the Legislature had in mind, namely, to indicate by an association of the two words that the wound must be serious and not a mere scratch. The fact that the offense is made a high misdemeanor also indicates that only a serious assault is within the condemnation of this section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The assault and battery of which Congro was guilty was not an atrocious assault and battery within the meaning of <em>B. S. </em>2: 110-1. In my opinion, the judgment should be modified so as to adjudge Congro guilty of simple assault and battery and to impose a punishment fitting the crime.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
