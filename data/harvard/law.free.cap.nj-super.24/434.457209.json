C.</author>\n<p id=\"AB7V\">(temporarily assigned). This is a workmen\u2019s compensation action in which an award of 50% of total permanent disability was granted in the bureau and affirmed in the County Court. The employer again appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">The record discloses that the workman, Jacob Kopitnikoff, sustained two cerebral hemorrhages as the result of which he became totally disabled. In addition to an incapacitating paralysis he lost the power of speech. However, he remained able to utter just one word, \u201cDa,\u201d which means \u201cYes\u201d in Eussian,</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>At the time of the hearing Kopitnikoff was confined to the Newark Convalescent Home and arrangements were made for the taking of his testimony there. The deputy director, the attorneys for the parties, Mrs. Kopitnikoff, the disabled man\u2019s wife, and the official reporter appeared at the home for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Prior to the examination the employer\u2019s attorney referred to Kopitnikoff\u2019s condition and his inability to speak, advised the deputy director that in the opinion of the employer\u2019s physicians the witness was mentally incompetent, and asked that the question of competency be determined as a preliminary matter. The deputy director indicated that the problem was one of fact and an effort was thereupon made to conduct an examination in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">This examination having proved infeasible, another patient, Samuel Margolis, who spoke Russian, was pressed into service as an interpreter. Margolis had known Kopitnikoff for about a year and a half, during which time they had been patients in the same ward. He said he had no interest in the case and had never discussed it with the Kopitnikoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Margolis further asserted that Kopitnikoff understood him when he talked to him. This understanding was indicated by a shaking of the head because \"he can\u2019t talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">An objection was interposed to the use of Margolis as an interpreter, but it was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">As the examination began counsel instructed the interpreter to repeat the question to the witness in the manner in which it was asked. The interpreter then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cI have difficulty hearing, medicine dopes you up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">This statement was followed by further inquiry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">\u201cMR. FOSS: Just a moment, one question. What do you mean when you just said, \u2018Dope me up,\u2019 have you had medicine this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\">MR. MARGOLIS: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">MR. FOSS: Do you know what it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-14\">The Interpreter: I don't know what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>MB. FOSS: What effect does it have on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">The Interpreter: It affects \u2022\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">The DEPUTY DIRECTOR: The hearing. He has been telling me he can\u2019t hear well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">The Interpreter: It affects hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">MR. FOSS: In what way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">The Interpreter: Hearing, can\u2019t hear so good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">MR. FOSS: Anything else, does it affect you in any other way? The Interpreter: Well, just the drums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">MR. FOSS: Does it affect your eyes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">The Interpreter: That\u2019s rigid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">MR. FOSS: How?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">The Interpreter: I don\u2019t know, when I get medicine I feel all dizzy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-15\">MR. FOSS: You feel dizzy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-16\">The Interpreter: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-17\">MR. FOSS: Do you feel dizzy right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-18\">The Interpreter: No, not much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-19\">The DEPUTY DIRECTOR: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-20\">The questioning of Kopitnikoff proceeded by a series of leading questions, all susceptible of a \u201cyes\u201d answer or a negative shaking of the head. Eive of these questions and answers are recited in the memorandum of the County Court as showing a compensable accident. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-21\">\u201cQ. Did you work for Lowenstein Brothers on October 11, 1948? (Whereupon the petitioner\u2019s testimony was given through the interpreter)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-22\">A. He worked there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-23\">Q. You got hurt and went home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-24\">A. (through the interpreter) Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-25\">Q. Did you stop working earlier that day because you got hurt? The Petitioner: Da, Da.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-26\">Q. When you got hurt, were you pushing something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-27\">The Deputy Director: He shakes his head in the affirmative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-28\">Q. Did the thing that you were pushing get stuck in the door? ***** * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-29\">The Petitioner: Da.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-30\">Q. After this thing got stuck in the door, did you feel pain in the right arm ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-31\">The Petitioner : Da, da, da.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The examination was attended by much confusion and informality. Kopitnikoff would say \u201cDa\u201d at times and shake his head in the negative; he even shook his head, yes and no, in answer to the same question. In fact, on the very matters covered by the questions set forth, he answered in the negative as well as the affirmative. Eor example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u201cQ. Did yon, on October 11, 1948, push a truck with a load of material on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">MR. BOSS: The man shakes his head, no. 5\u00a1? v v \u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Q. Were you pushing any sort of a thing with wheels on that day, with a load of material on it? * <em>tjt </em>* \u2756 # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">The Interpreter: He said he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">The DEPUTY DIRECTOR: He shakes his head sideways. a{t # *:? \u2756 * * * <em>'Jfi</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">Q. Did you get hurt on the morning of October-11, 1948? A *i* \u00a5 *\u00a1\u00ed \u00a5 \u2022]: \u00a5 \u2022i*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-14\">Q. The same day, October 11, 1948?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">MR. BOSS: The man shakes his head, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-16\">MR. GORDON: (one of petitioner\u2019s attorneys) I am sure he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-17\">doesn\u2019t know what he is doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-18\">MR. BOSS : Now, he shakes his head yes. Again I ask that the Court observe this conduct. Now, I again point out and say that has been the advice of my physician, that the man does not orient, and does not understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-19\">The DEPUTY DIRECTOR: All right, continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-20\">Q. Did you stop work earlier that day because you got hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-21\">The Interpreter: He went home in the morning, he got hurt, went home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-22\">Q. Did 3'ou stop tvorking earlier that day because you got hurt? The Petitioner: Da, Da.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-23\">The DEPUTY DIRECTOR: \u2018Da,\u2019 he is saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-24\">The Interpreter: He said he went home at eleven o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-25\">MR. KIERNAN: (Petitioner\u2019s attorney) Did he say eleven o\u2019clock? Off the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-26\">The Interpreter: Well, he didn\u2019t say eleven o\u2019clock, he said in the\u2019 morning when he got hurt he went home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-27\">At one point in the examination the deputy director said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-28\">T think the interpreter poses his own questions. Ask him again.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>One further illustration of the conduct of the interpreter throws additional light on the propriety of his use as such:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">\u201cQ. Did you work in December of 1948 for another company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">A. (Through the interpreter) No, he didn\u2019t work, that is the only place he worked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Q. Is that Mr. Herman Lowenstein that you are related to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">The Petitoner: Da, da, da, da.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">(Interpreter again converses in Russian with the petitioner.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">The Petitioner : Da, da.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">The Interpreter: He is a cousin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Later during the course of the hearing two physicians were produced who had examined Kopitnikoff on behalf of the appellant, less than 2% months before the testimony was taken at the convalescent home. One, Dr. Asher Yaguda, said that the disabled man was not mentally competent to testify at that time, that his condition was \u201cpretty stationary\u201d and would show no further Improvement. The other, Dr. Andrew 0. Ruoff, asserted that Kopitnikoff \u201cclearly did not comprehend what was going on\u201d and that his condition would not improve but \u201cwill retrogress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">No medical evidence was offered on the workman\u2019s behalf to demonstrate his competency or even that when he used the Russian word for \u201cyes,\u201d he had any rational comprehension of its use in relation to the questions put to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\"> Subsequently, at the close of appellant\u2019s proof, when a motion was made to strike Kopitnikoff\u2019s testimony on the ground of his incompetency, the deputy director said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">\u201cThere is some doubt in my mind as to the probative value of his testimony, but I will deny the motion at this timo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">The motion was not granted and in the determination and judgment it was said that, \u201cProof of a compensable accident (\u2022an he made out of petitioner\u2019s testimony by a sifting thereof.\u201d However, the deputy director decided that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>an accident had been established by other proof in the case. On appeal, the County Court felt that KopitnikofE\u2019s testimony was entitled to some weight and was worthy of consideration with all the other evidence in the case. We recognize that the exercise of discretion by the deputy director in permitting Margolis to act as interpreter ought to be viewed liberally in view of the unusual circumstances of the case. But its exercise must be examined with fair and reasonable regard to the substantial right of the employer to have the injured workman bear the burden of proof. And under all of the facts appearing in the record, we feel compelled to conclude that Margolis was not qualified to act as an interpreter, that his impartiality was questionable, and that his employment for that purpose constituted a mistaken use of discretion. We conclude further that the completely leading character of the questions put to Kopitnikoif, as well as the unreliable nature of his answers, render his testimony valueless as evidence. Thus, if no other evidence of a compensable accident appeared in the record, the judgment would have to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">There were no eye-witnesses to the accident. On the third day of the hearing it developed that the employee\u2019s attorney had served a notice to produce a written statement which the employer\u2019s representative had obtained from Kopitnikoif on November 10, 1948, one month after his first stroke, when he was only partially disabled and before he had lost the power of speech. The notice demanded the production also of a report of a medical examination made on the same day by a physician on behalf of respondent. These documents were produced and after some discussion and argument, employer\u2019s counsel, probably because of some admissions and facts contained therein which he deemed to be against Kopitnikoif\u2019s interest, consented to their use only on condition that they be marked in evidence as his adversary\u2019s exhibits. Accordingly this .was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Among other things the statement recited that on October 11, 1948, at about ten a. m., Kopitnikoff was pushing a box <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of rags through a doorway. As he was doing so the box bit the side of the door. He gave it another push and felt something snap in his right arm. Thereafter he had no grip in that hand or any feeling. He reported this to Mr. Lowenstein and was told to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The statement sets forth also that it was read to Kopitnikoff who said it was correct, but he could not sign it because of inability to hold a pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The record discloses that on October 25, 1948 the employer filed Form G, which is designated \u201cFirst Notice of Accident,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cEmployee claimed that while pushing a box of rags he felt a pain which resulted in a mild stroke.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The date of the accident was given as October .11, 1948 at 10 A. M. This form was evidential to establish that appellant had been notified of the accident and that the notice, was prior to the time the statement was taken from the injured man.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">According to the testimony of Mrs. Kopitnikoff, her husband was cheerful and seemingly in good health when he left for work on the morning of October 11, 1948. He had been working regularly, although he had been under the care of a Dr. Sidney B. Bawitz for high blood pressure for \u201ca couple of years.\u201d He returned home about 10 :30 A. m., appearing gray, nervous, dazed looking and excitable: he was not able to eat and when he tried to pick up a spoon it kept falling out of his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">He continuously rubbed his right arm; his wife soaked the arm in epsom salts and put a hot water bag under it. \u201cto bring a little life into it.\u201d She then put him to bed and about 6 p. m., with the aid of his son, he dressed and went to Dr. Bawitz\u2019 office. On returning he went to bed and remained there for three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">The doctor found about 75% loss of power in the right arm, some slurring of speech, noticed that he walked slowly and swayed as he did so, and lie made a diagnosis of a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Kopitnikoff was put to bed and treated for three weeks, with very little improvement. At the end of that period he was not able to undertake his regular work. Dr. Rawitz never saw the man again; he gave up his practice in December 1948 and went to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Thereafter, although respondent did a little light, part-time work for another employer, his condition seemed to continue deteriorating until on April 14, 1949 he suffered the final stroke which resulted in his complete incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">An expert medical witness, who had examined Kopitnikoff on January 17, 1951, fixed the permanent disability at 100%. In answer to a hypothetical question incorporating the facts recited in the statement referred to, he asserted that the strain of the employment incident was the producing cause of the stroke of October 11, 1948, as well as of the continued deterioration and final total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On the other hand, the two doctors who had examined on behalf of respondent denied-the existence of any such causal relation and maintained that the cerebral hemorrhages were the result of the ordinary progress of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">It is apparent that to sustain the award reliance must be placed on the statement of petitioner which was received in evidence under the circumstances already detailed. Appellant contends that it is self-serving, hearsay and must be disregarded. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">When appellant\u2019s attorney produced the statement in response to the notice to do so, under the long established practice, he was entitled, if he wished, to insist that upon examination thereof by his adversary, the document should go in evidence as his adversary\u2019s exhibit. <em>Ellison v. Cruser, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>444 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1878); <em>Decker v. George W. Smith &amp; Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>630 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915); <em>Bancone v. Drovan, </em>11 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>198 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933); <em>Buckley v. Laidlaw, </em>14 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>139 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Appellant deliberately chose to insist that it be admitted as substantive evidence in the employee\u2019s case; no qualifications or restrictions were imposed. There was no suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>that the statement should be admitted because under the siatute <em>(R. 8. </em>34:15-56) the rules of evidence are not binding on the deputy director. On the contrary, the language of counsel makes it obvious that he was demanding its admission as substantive proof. In this situation he cannot take advantage of the parts thereof which he deemed favorable to him and have the adverse parts disregarded as hearsay. <em>Cf. Link v. Eastern </em>Aircraft, 136 <em>N. J. L. </em>540 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Even if the statement were wholly unfavorable to appellant, the election to have it received in evidence without qualification, justified its consideration as substantive proof of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Under the conditions presented by this record, the status of the statement was the same as if evidence condemned by the ordinary rules were admitted in evidence without objection at a trial in a common law court. In such case ihe improper evidence may be given its full probative effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The rule is stated in <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cThe initiative in excluding improper evidence is left entirely to tlie opponent, \u2014so far at least as concerns Ms right to appeal on that ground to another tribunal. The judge may of his own motion deal with offered evidence; but for all subsequent purposes it must appear that the opponent invoked some rule of Evidence. A rule of Evidence not invoked is waived.\u201d <em>(Vol. </em>1, <em>seo. </em>18).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">To like effect is a note in 126 <em>A. L. R. </em>1130:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">\u201cIt has been held almost universally (apparently only four or five jurisdictions taking a contrary view) that when hearsay testimony is admitted without objection it may properly be considered and given its natural probative effect as if it were in law admissible, the only question being with regard to how much weight should be given thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">See also: <em>Katzman v. </em>Budden, 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>519 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940); <em>Smith v. Del. &amp; Atl. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>63 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>93 <em>(Ch. </em>1902), affirmed 64 N. <em>J. Eq. </em>770 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Iii view of the somewhat different views of the deputy director and the County Court as to the proof which required the award, we have made an independent study of the record. That study has convinced us that Kopitnikoff suffered the incident described in his statement, that the cerebral hemorrhage of October 11, 1948 resulted therefrom, and finally, that the incident and the resultant hemorrhage constituted a compensable accident. <em>Fox v. Plainfield, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>464 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
