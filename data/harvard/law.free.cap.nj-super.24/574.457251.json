J. Super. </em>49 (1952). We might add, with reference to the defense of laches, that <em>\u201c&amp; </em>present and continuing offense is * * * the basis of a decree for separate maintenance. Defendant still abandons his wife. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>continuance of the offense raises anew his obligation to support her.\u201d <em>Baumgarten v. Baumgarten, </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>274 <em>(Ch. </em>1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Considering all the factors in the situation, we find that the counsel fee allowed to the wife in the Chancery Division should be increased by the sum of $1,000. The wife\u2019s taxed costs on the appeals, including a counsel fee of $750, should be charged against her husband. Let there be a judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
