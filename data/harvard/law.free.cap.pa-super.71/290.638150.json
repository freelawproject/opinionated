The defendant contends that Joseph Ferrara was, at the time of the happening of this accident, not the husband of the woman who was injured. That is a question of fact for you to decide. The two plaintiffs have testified that they are husband and wife, and they told you when they were married and the circumstances under which they were married. They tell you they are living together and they have a child. The defendant produces certain records here before you and has also brought a witness, one of its. investigators, who testified to certain conversations. Of course, there may be people of the same or similar names.- You may have cases of that kind under your observation or within your knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>edge. I certainly have within my knowledge persons who have names that are similar if not identical, and you have the right to consider that. The defendant claims that the persons who are plaintiffs in this case are not legally married. If they are not legally married Joseph has no right to recover because he would then be what is known under the law as a volunteer. If he volunteered to expend money for the benefit of some third person it would be very laudable but it would not entitle him to bring an action against a third person for the recovery of the money which he had expended. So that if you conclude that Joseph Ferrara was not the husband of the woman who was injured, then you should return a verdict for defendant as to him, even if the defendant company was negligent and the two plaintiffs were entirely free from negligence.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AP9\">February 28, 1919:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-2\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were charge of the court, answers to points and refusal of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-3\"><em>Sharswood Brmton, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ady\">The plaintiff did not establish the negligence of the defendant: Herstine v.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">This action was brought to recover damages for injuries sustained by May Ferrara, wife of Joseph Ferrara, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>who was thrown from the platform of a train of the defendant, which \u00bfhe was entering as a passenger. Two cases were tried before a single jury, and separate verdicts were rendered in favor of the husband and the wife. Two appeals were taken and argued together before this court. Two questions are presented, the first being, the sufficiency of proof as to the relation of the parties as husband and wife, in regard to which there was considerable dispute in the evidence and of which the trial judge stated, \u201cI have already left to the jury the question, to be ascertained, as to whether or not there was a marriage between these two plaintiffs and directed them many times that if they conclude there was no marriage between them there can be no recovery on the part of Joseph Ferrara, and that it should be considered in no way in determining the weight to be given to the evidence of the other plaintiff.\u201d Which, in the light of the evidence, was as fair a presentation of that proposition as the defendant could expect. That issue was clearly defined. The testimony was conflicting, and the jury alone could dispose of the disputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">The other proposition was, that the testimony was not sufficient, in describing the sudden start of the train, to meet the requirements of our' decisions. Joseph Ferrara testified, \u201cI got my wife and put her on the last car and turned around to get my suit case. The conductor gave a signal to the engineer to go and he went, and as he started his engine, the jerk of the car threw my wife off. I cannot describe the jerk in any other way than just a jerk that threw her off.\u201d . The wife testified, \u201cI got up on the top step and the train seemed to go. The conductor started to holler \u2018hurry up. Get on here.\u2019 I did not want to walk in because I was on the top step and the train started to go. I turned around to see if my husband was coming in. It started with a jerk, it made an awful funny jerk. I do not know how it started. It just threw me off. It threw me to the platform. I did not start to go in the car. They did not give me any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to step in the car. I stood on the platform in the meantime. I think the conductor was pretty cranky with me. I have not got anything against him.\u201d While the words \u201ca sudden jerk\u201d and \u201cawful funny jerk\u201d standing alone would not be sufficient to warrant a recovery, yet, when used in describing the consequences of the jerk, which she says resulted in throwing her off from the top of the steps of the car to the station platform, would reasonably indicate that it was not only sudden, but so violent as not reasonably to be anticipated. The jury ascertained the severity of the jolt, by the result which followed, and thus gave to the general descriptive language proper interpretation and effect. If her testimony was believed, there was sufficient to warrant the finding that Mrs. Ferrara was thrown from the train as a direct result of this sudden, violent and unexpected start, and that, the defendant company was guilty of a negligent operation of its train. The defendant\u2019s testimony placed the duty of explanation and justification upon it, which burden it did not meet in the light of the verdict: Kleine v. Pittsburgh Ry., 252 Pa. 214; Diffenderfer v. Penna. R. R. Co., 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 187. Proof was adduced in positive denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony as to the manner of starting the car, and this controversy could only be disposed of by the jury: Goodhart v. C. &amp; M. E. Ry. Co., 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 441; Donnelly v. B. &amp; L. Traction Company, 40 Pa. Superior Ct. 110; Cahill v. P. R. T. Co., 52 Pa. Superior Ct. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">After a careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the case was fairly tried in the court below, and there is no such reversible error shown as to warrant a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
