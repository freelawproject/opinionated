Taking the wife\u2019s version of the affair, he not only told her to go but subsequently declared that he would not live with her because he did not like her. In Neagley v. Neagley, 59 Pa. Superior Ct. 565, Rice, P. J., states the law as follows: \u201cThe law on the subject is clear. \u2018Desertion is an actual abandonment of marital cohabitation, with an intent to desert, willfully and maliciously persisted in, without cause for two years. The guilty intent is manifested when, without cause or consent, either party withdraws from the residence of the other\u2019: Ingersoll v. Ingersoll, 49 Pa. 249. This clear and concise definition has been approved in many later cases, and has not been questioned. The guilty intent to desert is rebutted where the separation is encouraged by the other party or by mutual consent. What may have been desertion in its inception, but has become a separation with mutual consent within two years, is not ground for divorce: King v. King, 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 33; Pearce v. Pearce, 53 Pa. Superior Ct. 129. The mutual consent that will prevent a divorce upon the ground of desertion may be inferred from the conduct of the parties and need not be put in the form of a solemn written agreement: Olson v. Olson, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 128.\u201d See Reynolds v. Reynolds, 62 Pa. Superior Ct. 280; McCampbell v. McCampbell, 64 Pa. Superior Ct. 143; Reynolds v. Reynolds, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 465; Crandall v. Crandall, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">If we turn to the charge of the court we have no submission of the subject of consentable separation to the jury although the attention of the court was called to it by a point submitted by the respondent\u2019s counsel which was refused the point being \u201cIf the jury find that the libellant had ordered respondent to withdraw from their home, she is not guilty of willful and malicious desertion.\u201d Whether her story was to be believed was for the jury, but she was entitled to instructions to the effect that if her husband ordered her to go or consented to her going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>her desertion cannot be regarded as willful or malicious but by mutual consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">The decree of divorce is reversed with a venire facias de novo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
