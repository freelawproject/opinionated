L. 887, it is provided that, \u201cin all actions of ejectment hereafter to be brought, the plaintiff shall file a declaration, which shall consist of a concise statement of his cause of action, with an abstract of the title under which he claims the land in dispute, and, in addition to the plea of \u2018not guilty,\u2019 now required by law, the defendant shall file an answer in the nature of a special plea, in which he shall set forth his grounds of defense, with an abstract of the title by which he claims......Provided that the court may, on rule, enter such judgment on the pleadings, in favor of either party, as it may appear to the court the party is entitled to.\u201d In accordance with these provisions, the plaintiff filed his declaration and brief of title, and the defendant filed her answer and plea and an abstract of the title upon which she rests her defense. The plaintiff then secured this rule for judgment. The undisputed facts upon which the case now rests are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">On November 21, 1872, Philip Gossler and wife, by deed duly executed and recorded, conveyed the premises in dispute to Samuel T. Welsh. On November 8, 1912, Samuel T. Welsh, while a single man, for the sum of one dollar and other valuable considerations, conveyed it to Elsie I. Welsh, single woman. On November 4, 1916, Elsie I. Welsh, in consideration of the sum of $800, conveyed it to Taylor Weaver, .the plaintiff. The said Samuel T. Welsh and the defendant were married on November 9, 1912. After that date, they lived together on the premises, and the defendant still resides there. While they resided there together, he paid the taxes and water rent and made repairs. The defendant did not, until after proceedings for her dispossession, know of the deed to Elsie I. Welsh, and she never ratified it. She now claims that that deed was a fraud upon her rights. Under this state of facts, is her defense effective?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In Ellmaker v. Ellmaker, 4 W. 39, Gibso,n, C.' J., said: \u201cWho so ignorant as not to know that a husband may dispose of his chattels during the coverture without his wife\u2019s consent, and freed of every post mortem claim by her; or that he can dispose of his land freed of her dower but with her concurrence? The current transactions of life publish the former; and a knowledge of the latter is proved by experience to be universal.\u201d If, then a husband, after his marriage, even though thereby it is claimed he has attempted to defraud her? Though he makes a conveyance, having in view such a purpose, if she occupies the same position as she did' if he had not made his deed, and may claim her dower in case she survives, what harm has she suffered thereby?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\">In Lines v. Lines, 112 Pa. 149, it was held that \u201cit is the settled law of this State that, during his life, a man may exercise absolute power over his personal property, without his wife\u2019s consent; her rights attach thereto only at his death; and she cannot impeach as a fraud upon her a voluntary gift of personalty made by her husband in his lifetime.\u201d And in Potter v. Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company (No. 2), 199 Pa. 366, the very question here at issue came before the court. It appeared that George Van Hook Potter and Annie R. Potter were married on June 26, 1895. On that day, prior to the ceremony, and without the knowledge or consent of his wife, Mr. Potter executed a deed of trust to the defendant company, providing that the income should be paid to him during his life, and the principal should, upon his death, be transferred to such persons as he might nominate in his will. A bill in equity was filed for the purpose of setting aside the deed on the ground that, it having been made in anticipation of the marriage, it was a fraud on the marital rights of the wife, and should be declared inoperative. The bill was dismissed in an opinion by Willson, J., which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. The learned judge, inter alia, said: \u201cThere is no doubt that it is well settled that, when a woman, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>anticipation of an intended marriage, without the knowledge of her intended husband, executes a transfer or conveyance of her property in such a way as to deprive him of all benefit in it, and her of her control over it, such a transaction will be declared to be a legal fraud upon him,\u201d citing Duncan\u2019s App., 43 Pa. 67, and Robinson v. Buck, 71 Pa. 386. \u201cThere are other cases which can be found in the books in which the same doctrine is laid down. It undoubtedly, in the first instance, grew out of the more absolute dominion which a husband possessed over his wife\u2019s property than exists at the present <em>day; </em>but, as in the case already cited,'the doctrine still stands, notwithstanding the great enlargement which has come to a woman\u2019s rights over her own property, and the greater assimilation in those rights to the dominion which a man can exercise over his own estate. No case, however, has been cited, and we have not been able to find any, in which that doctrine has been applied to the same degree or with the same rigor to the case of a wife asking to have a conveyance made by her husband before marriage, and in anticipation of marriage, set aside.\u201d In Baird v. Stearne, 15 Philadelphia 339, Judge Thayer set aside a deed on this ground after the husband\u2019s death, and in commenting upon this decision, Judge Willson says: \u201cIt will be observed, however, that the relief which was given in that case was given, after the death of the husband. The question arises for consideration here whether the plaintiff, Mrs. Potter, is entitled to any other relief than that, or whether she is entitled to have the deed of trust made by her husband set aside and the property which was covered by it replaced in his hands for such uses as he may see fit to make of it. It is, of course, quite apparent that, if the possession and control of the property be again vested in him, he might the next day execute another deed of like terms, just as he might, in the exercise of the full dominion over his estate, which every man possesses, give it away.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>February 28, 1919:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-3\">\u201cIt, therefore, seems to me that the defendant has now no rights in this real estate and that she has no interests at this time which are entitled to protection at the hands of this court. If she survives her husband, she may have a right of dower therein; but the plaintiff has now the legal title, and is, therefore, entitled to judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-4\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-6\"><em>B.
