Lennig, and at the decease of any one of these three, the share that would have fallen to her or him to be equally divided amongst the survivor or survivors of them, and one-third of the undivided net income to be invested as residuary estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-8\">And upon the death of his wife, sons and daughter, and the payment of certain legacies (which have all been paid out of prior accounts) he directed the payment to the Academy of Natural Science of the City of Philadelphia semiannually the net income of his then residuary estate until such payments shall have amounted to a total sum of $150,000, by codicil reduced to $20,000 \u2014to be held as the Charles Lennig fund, and upon the completion of this bequest directed his trustee to pay to the trustees or faculty of the University of Pennsylvania of the City. of Philadelphia $500,000, the net income thereof to be used in connection with the John H. Town bequest and the fund to be called the Charles Lennig fund in aid of instruction in theoretical and practical mechanics, and the further sum of $200,000 to apply the net income therefrom to the institution of as many free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>scholarships (excluding scholarships in theology) as such income will maintain, the fund to be called the Charles Lennig beneficiary fund, any balance remaining upon the completion of the aforenamed devices to be paid over share and share alike amongst and to any of his legal descendants then living, the sons and daughters of his daughter, Williamina' Thudichum and Joyeuse Arnoys, his sons, Nicholas and John Boulinger Lennig, and none others, and in default of such claiming and proving their interest in manner specified then the balance to be divided and paid one-half to the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, for the use of the free scholarship fund aforenamed and the other half, one-half to the German Hospital and the balance to the Pennsylvania Hospital of Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">Testator\u2019s widow elected to take, as against his will, the shares of his estate to which she was entitled under the intestate law, which was accordingly paid to her out of the executors\u2019 account, and died September 15, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">Besides his widow, testator left him surviving his two sons, Nicholas and John B. Lennig; his daughter, Williamina Thudichum; his granddaughters, Joyeuse L. and Williamina Fullerton, children of a deceased daughter; and grandson, Alexander Arnoys, son of his deceased daughter, Joyeuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">Nicholas Lennig died January 24, 1906, without issue, and William O. Houston is the surviving executor of his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">John B. Lennig died November 5, 1913, leaving surviving three children, Maude A. Hawkes, Louise O. Rowland and Elsie McCaulay, and Francis F. Eastlack, Jr., and the Frankford Trust Company are executors of his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-9\">Williamina Thudichum is still living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-10\">The widow having elected to take against the will, the one-third of two-thirds of income remained undisposed of, and passed under the intestate laws to his sons, daughter and grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEe7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The present accounting is of testator\u2019s original residuary personal estate, increased by the addition thereto of proceeds of sale of real estate, and from time to time of one-third of the income of his so-called \u201cresiduary estate\u201d and the fund now amounts to $783,558. The legacies to be paid out of the fund at the time of distribution amount to $720,000. In his adjudication upon a prior account, Judge Penrose, whose adjudication was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Lennig\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 209, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">\u201cSo long as the accumulation does not swell the residue to an amount larger than the sum required for the charity, it is not forbidden; the act will apply only to a continuance of the accumulation after this purpose has been accomplished; and such excess will then go \u2018to and be received by such person or persons as would be entitled thereto if such accumulations had not been directed.\u2019 It is not alleged that the limit has yet been reached.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArV\">That limit has now been exceeded, although, as the duration of the trust is indefinite, it is impossible to foretell whether the securities at present composing the fund will, at the time of distribution, produce the amount necessary to pay the legacies. Temporary withholdings of illegal accumulations in the interest of judicious management have been sustained in Eberly\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 95; Hibb\u2019s Est., 143 Pa. 217; McIntosh\u2019s Est., 158 Pa. 528; and in King\u2019s Est., 210 Pa. 435, the excess beyond a proper contingent fund was distributed. Under these authorities and the circumstances in the present case, the auditing judge is of the opinion that temporarily and until events showed danger of depreciation below the amount necessary to pay the legacies, further additions of income may safely be discontinued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">The question then arises as to who is entitled to this one-third of income. It does not fall into residue (as did the accumulations in Weinmann\u2019s Est., 223 Pa. 508, and Wright\u2019s Est., 227 Pa. 69) and pass to the other persons entitled to income for life as that gift is of but two-thirds thereof (Wain\u2019s Est., 156 Pa. 194). Nor can it pass to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the persons who will be entitled to the principal of residuary estate at the termination of the trust as the gift of principal is contingent, depending upon there being legal descendants then living (Roney\u2019s Est., 227 Pa. 127; Sternbergh\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 167); who the parties entitled will be cannot now be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">This one-third of income is therefore undisposed of and passes to the persons entitled under the intestatelaws, and thus, the widow'having already received her full share of the estate, to his sons and daughter and his grandchildren living at the time of his death (Bell\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 389; McFillin\u2019s Est., 235 Pa. 175; Tatham\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 269).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-6\">The account and supplemental account filed at the audit show a balance of principal of $783,558, which composed as indicated in the account is awarded to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities upon the uses and trusts declared by the will of testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-7\">The supplemental account also shows a balance of income, after payment of her annuity to Williamina Thudichum to June 22, 1917, and their shares of income to the parties in interest including the transfer of one-third of income to principal, to July 2,1917, of $8,369.02 of which less allowance to Samuel K.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-9\">Phillips, agreed to 50.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-10\">Balance, $8,319.02</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-11\">$3.50, the cost of a certified c'opy. of this adjudication, is awarded to be paid to the clerk, her yearly sum of $2,500 to date of payment is awarded to Williamina Thudichum, and of the balance then remaining, five-ninths is awarded to Williamina Thudichum, one-ninth each to Nicholas Lennig, John S.

It will be noticed that the bequests to the University of Pennsylvania and Academy of Natural Sciences are to be paid after the decease of the wife and children and the \u201caforenamed devises\u201d must include those given to the latter as well as the gifts to the institutions named. The balance remaining is not given to the children of the testator but to such legal descendants as might be living at the time of final distribution. Such survivors were the direct takers under the residuary clause. The time to which the testator referred was that when the preceding provisions of his will were complied with and final distribution was to be made. There was no gift to a whole class but to the survivors at a particular period. The uncertain event of survivorship therefore is descriptive of the legatee. Survivors alone sustain the character and answer the description stated in the residuary clause. It cannot now be certainly known who will become the beneficiaries under the bequest. There is, therefore, no present residuary gift. It must be held to be contingent because of the description of the person intended to take. The decisions in Mulliken v. Earnshaw, 209 Pa. 226; Roney\u2019s Est., 227 Pa. 127; Day v. Thompson, 233 Pa. <em>550; </em>Sternberg\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 167; and numerous other cases sustain the conclusion of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
