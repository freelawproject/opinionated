Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-17\">On February 13, 1889, by agreement of the parties, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. A. Q. </em>Campbell, as referee, under the act of April 6, 1869, P. L. 725; and on January 14, 1890, the referee filed a report concluding:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-18\">The referee\u2019s findings of fact are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>1. That in the month of September or October, 1889, a contract was made between the plaintiff, F. D. McCarthy, and the defendants, Thomas Gaffey, George Reakes and Conrad Masters, for the opening and extension of Church street in the borough of Nanticokc, wherein the said McCarthy agreed to make an average, ordinary, fairly-constructed road or street, and for so doing was to receive from the defendants the sum of one hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\">2.

The amount of labor expended by McCarthy, in making the street as he did, was sixty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">4. The defendants have never paid the plaintiff anything for the work done by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The referee\u2019s conclusion of law is that the plaintiff is entitled to a quantum meruit, and the judgment should be in his favor against the defendants for the sum of sixty dollars. The prothonotary is therefore directed to enter judgment against the defendants, Conrad Masters, Thomas Gaffey, and George Reakes, for the sum of sixty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">\u2014To the referee\u2019s report the defendants filed twelve exceptions, of which some were to the admission or exclusion of offers of testimony, and others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">10. The referee erred in awarding to the plaintiff, not having found complete performance by the plaintiff, or a dispensation therewith by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-10\">11. Should the court sustain the referee in his award of quantum meruit, then the referee erred in awarding to the plaintiff full compensation for labor performed on his contract ; but the award should have been the contract price, less the amount required to put the work in that condition which the contract calls for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-11\">12.
