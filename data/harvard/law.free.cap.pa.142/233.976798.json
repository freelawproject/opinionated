In the first of these letters the writer stated that he might wish to get a saw-mill; in the second, that he wished to buy a sawmill, and the terms upon which he wished to buy it; and in the third, he stated that the mill was to be for himself. It was objected, that the letters were written prior to the execution of the written instruments, into which they were merged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-13\">By the court: Letters admitted; their effect to be considered hereafter; exception.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Furst, P. J., upon the construction of the two papers, the order and the \u201c lease,\u201d instructed the jury that the contract created thereby was a contract of conditional sale, and not of bailment, and directed that a verdict be returned for the defendant; exception.1</summary>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-15\">A rule for a new trial having been argued, the court, Furst, P. J., on January 21, 1891, filed an opinion in part as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-16\">The facts, therefore, are substantially these: 1. Hamer negotiated for the purchase of the mill, pro ut his letters. 2. The full price of the mill was $1,500. 3. The result of the arrangement was the paper or order without date, signed by Hamer, and the lease according to a form adopted by A. B. Farquhar. 4. There is no time fixed in the lease during which it is hired; it shall continue so long as he (Hamer) retains it. 5. There is no time fixed for the return of the property; the only con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>dition relates to the non-payment of instalments or judgment notes. 6. If the <em>hire </em>is paid, no return of the property is ever to be made. 7. The title is to remain in Farquhar until the hire or judgment notes are paid. 8. The only condition upon which Farquhar can reclaim the property is non-payment of the notes, to wit, $1,500. 9. Nearly one half of the price was paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">In Stephens v. Gifford, 137 Pa. 219, Mr. Justice Williams delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, citing Benjamin, on Sales, 6, says: \u201c It is of the essence of a contract of bailment that the article bailed be returned in its own or some altered form to the bailor, so that he may have his own again.\u201d In Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, 92 Pa. 53, Mr. Justice Paxson delivering the opinion of the court, pointed out with great clearness the distinction between a conditional sale and a bailment, in the line of cases commencing with Clow v. Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275, and ending with Enlow v. Klein, 79 Pa. 488. In Rowe v. Sharp, 51 Pa. 27, there was an express stipulation for the return to the bailor of the property at the termination of the bailment. In the case in hand there is no agreement or stipulation to return, but simply an agreement to reclaim the property if the fifteen hundred dollars, the full price of the sawmill, be not paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">Referring to Enlow v. Klein, in Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, the present Chief Justice says: \u201c An examination of the facts shows that it was a case of hiring; that $2 per week of the sum to be paid was for the use or hire of the horses.\u201d This was an important feature of the case, in the consideration of the court when that ease was before them. The Chief Justice, however, says \u201cthat Enlow v. Klein was justified by the authorities and we do not propose to disturb it. But we will not take one step beyond it. We stop just where it ends.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">Justice Woodward, in delivering the opinion of the court in Enlow v. Klein, speaking of the agreement of Enlow, which was to furnish Moritz a team of horses, etc., necessary for country peddling, he to pay $2 per week for their use, etc., says: \u201c The use of such a word as furnish, vague as it is in its signification, would leave the clause in which it occurs of ambiguous import, if there were nothing besides to indicate the sense in which it was employed. It might imply a sale, a lease, a loan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>a gift, or a delivery of a chattel in payment of a debt, in accordance with its context and its subject matter. As used here, it was the manifest intention of Enlow to place certain personal property belonging to him in the possession of Moritz, for the use of which weekly payments were tq be made by the latter, and the ownership of which was to vest in him when, and only when, those weekly payments should have been made two hundred times.\u201d No present interest was created in Moritz by this agreement, so as to make the property subject in his hands to the claims of execution creditors. Yet, as to the principle of this case, the Supreme Court say they will stop right where it ends; that it and Rowe v. Sharp stand on the border land, and are very close cases. We may accept this view and add, they are only to be followed upon like or similar facts. ' The principle of these cases is not to be extended beyond the domain of facts upon which they were decided and upon which alone they are to be considered authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">Edwards v. Ward, 105 Pa. 103, contains in the syllabus of the case this statement of the law: \u201c To constitute a bailment, neither payment for the use of the goods nor a promise to return them is essential.\u201d In this case there was a fixed period of bailment (five years) ; and it must be understood in reference to a case where the bailment is limited, in which case, if not returned, the bailor may resort to his legal remedies to recover the possession. If not so understood, then it is certainly in conflict with all the cases upon the law of bailment, which is predicated of a return of the property at the expiration of the term, and is so held in Stephens v. Gifford, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The case in hand is clearly a conditional sale and not a bailment. The price of the saw-mill was to be $1,500. \u201c According to the form adopted\u201d by A. B. Farquhar, this was to be paid in two payments of $750 each, first payment in six months, and second payment in twelve months, which is termed \u201c hire \u201d in the order and lease, but it is to bear interest from date of delivery of saw-mill, and to be. secured by judgment exemption bonds. Hamer was also to pay the freight from York, Pa., in \u201c addition to the price.\u201d The machinery was to be warranted as per manufacturers\u2019 warranty, a copy of which was sent with the papers. All these terms are inconsistent with a lease of the property. The whole transaction is consistent with a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tioual sale and with a sale only. The attempt to disguise it under the cloak of a bailment is too apparent, and it is as weak as apparent. There is no principle of law better settled in Pennsylvania than that a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase money is paid, enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the same for the payment of his debts: Brunswick Co. v. Hoover, 95 Pa. 508. This case rules the case under consideration. It is very much like it upon the facts, and in it the same attempt was made to cover up a conditional sale with the disguise of a bailment; a disguise, the court say, \u201c too clumsy to have the merit of being clever.\u201d Thus holding the law, it follows that the motion for a new trial must be overruled, which is accordingly now done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">\u2014Judgment having been entered, the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">1.

If we concede they were improperly received in evidence, they did the plaintiff no harm. The learned judge below ruled the case upon, the construction of the article of agreement, and not upon the letters. He held that the paper called a lease, by which Solomon Hamer agreed to hire the engine and boiler from A. B. Farquhar, the plaintiff, was a conditional sale, and subjected them to execution and sale on the part of Hamer\u2019s creditors. The construction of this paper was a question of law for the court, and the learned judge ruled it correctly. It is true, it was claimed to be a lease and the transaction a bailment, but it was not even so in form. It lacked the essential feature of a bailment, viz., a stipulation for a return of the property at the end of the term, in which respect the case differs from Rowe v. Sharp, 51 Pa. 26, where there was an express stipulation for the return to the bailor of the property at the termination of the bailment. It is of the essence of a contract of bailment that the article bailed be returned, in its own or some altered form, to the bailor, so that he may have his own again: Benjamin on Sales, 6; Stephens v. Gifford, 137 Pa. 219. Enlow v. Klein, 79 Pa. 488, stands upon its own peculiar facts, and to that extent is authority ; but, as remarked in Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, 92 Pa. 53, we will not go one step beyond it. The case in hand comes directly within the ruling of Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, and the agreement was clearly a conditional sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We notice that many of the Pennsylvania cases, referred to in the paper-book .of the appellee, are cited by the name of the reporter, in violation of the rule of court. Had this been observed upon the argument, the book would have been suppressed.- We regret to be obliged to call the attention of the Bar so frequently to the persistent violation of our rules in regard to the preparation of paper-books.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
