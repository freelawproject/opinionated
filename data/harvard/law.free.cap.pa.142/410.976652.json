Tarr, brought replevin for certain property, against Rose Eddy; property replevied and delivered to plaintiff. A statement of claim being filed, the defendant pleaded property in herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">At the trial, on October 22, 1890, the plaintiff showed title to the property by purchase of the same at sheriff\u2019s sale as the property of Robert G. Eddy, on May 11, 1889. The defendant claimed title by purchase of the property at a constable\u2019s sale, on May 6, 1889, as the property of said Robert G. Eddy. To support her title, the defendant put in evidence the record of a judgment before Simon Strouse, J. P. The record offered .set forth the case as an amicable action wherein Rose Eddy was plaintiff and R. G. Eddy was defendant, and proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">\u201cAnd now, April 18, 1889, R. G. Eddy in court, and confesses voluntarily judgment in favor of plaintiff, in the sum of one hundred and ninety-five dollars and twenty cents ($195.20), balance on judgment note dated October 10, 1887, given then to the order of the defendant, with interest, in which judgment note the defendant authorizes and empowers [here followed a warrant of attorney to enter judgment, waiving inquisition, condemnation, and exemption] ; with interest from April 18, 1889, and costs of suit; wherefore, judgment confessed voluntarily.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">The record showed also an execution issued on April 18, 1889, to Constable Megahey, and return thereon of a sale of the property in dispute to the plaintiff in the writ, on May 6, 1889. The property levied upon was in Troy township. Megahey was the constable of the Third ward in Titusville. The execution was upon a printed blank and directed thus: \u201c The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the Constable of ward, Titusville, Greeting; \u201d the blank space after the words, Constable of, having two perpendicular marks in ink much resembling the Roman numeral II. The defendant offered the execution in evidence, when the plaintiff objected because the process was directed to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville. The defendant then called the justice and asked, What does that character after \u201c Constable of\u201d mean? Objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>By the court: Objection overruled; offer admitted; exception.5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\">The witness testified that the perpendicular lines were made bj1- him to fill up the blank space, and not to designate a particular ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">The defendant again offered the execution in evidencq, Objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">By the court: Objection overruled; offer admitted, exception.6</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-7\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Henderson, P. J., after referring to the record evidence, and citing \u00a7 14, 'act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 168; \u00a7 7, act of March 22, 1814, 6 Sm. L. 183; act of February 18,1869, P. L. <em>208; </em>act of March 28, 1870, P. L. 586, charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">It follows, therefore, that justices of the peace in Crawford county have jurisdiction of subjects of controversy, or actions on contracts, express or implied, for sums not exceeding three hundred dollars; and, inasmuch as under the act of 1810, as amended by the act of 1814, it was competent for justices of the peace to entertain amicable actions and confessions of judgment by a defendant, where the sum in controversy was under one hundred dollars, the act of 1869, applicable to Erie county, as extended to Crawford county in 1870, gives justices of the peace the same authority to entertain amicable actions for sums in controversy under three hundred dollars, and that without the presence of the plaintiff. [You will consider, therefore, gentlemen, that the confession of judgment before \u2019Squire Strouse, on April 18,1889, for $195.20, was a lawful judgment, and that execution might issue upon it, for the collection thereof.] 8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-9\">It is contended, however, that, conceding the judgment to^ have been valid, the execution was irregular, in this, that it. was issued to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville for the collection of a debt, and that the debt was collected by levy upon and sale of property which was in Troy township, in Crawford county, and that b3^ the constable of the Third ward of Titusville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-10\">It is true, gentlemen, if this execution is directed to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville, and the writ was executed by the constable of the Third ward of Titusville, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>property in Troy township, no title passed by such sale. It becomes material, therefore, for you to determine whether the execution, offered in evidence, was directed by the magistrate, at the time of its delivery, to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville, or to constable Megahey, of the Third ward of Titusville; and it is in reference to this aspect of the case that it becomes material to determine what the meaning is of the marks entered by the magistrate on the execution, in the first line immediately preceding the words \u201c ward of Titusville; \u201d the marks to which reference has been made by the counsel for the defendant and by the counsel for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">[If those marks mean Second ward, if they were intended at the time the execution was made out and delivered by the magistrate, to mean the Second ward of Titusville, then a good title was not made by the constable of the Third ward in holding the sale of this property in Troy township. If the ward was not designated by the magistrate, if he did not put in those marks as indicative of a particular ward in Titusville, but left the ward blank, intending, as shown by the transcript in the case, to have the constable of the Third ward of Titusville execute the writ, then the sale by Constable Megahey, at the time shown by the transcript and by other evidence in <em>the case, </em>would pass a good title to the property.] 3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">[You have heard the testimony, you have examined or will examine the execution, gentlemen, and it will throw some light upon the question involved. You heard the testimony of \u2019Squire Strouse, the magistrate, who testifies that he did <em>not </em>insert those marks as indicating the Second ward of Titusville; that no ward was intended to be indicated. What he interprets the matter now to be, is not a matter of consequence, gentlemen; his evidence of what he did at that time is material. The witness\u2019s testimony seems to be that he did not at that time insert these marks for the purpose of indicating the First or Second ward, or any other ward in Titusville. His testimony is entitled to consideration with reference to that matter.] 4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-7\">We refer this question to you, gentlemen, whether the execution offered in evidence, was issued by the magistrate in blank as to the ward in Titusville. The act of assembly requires the magistrate to issue the execution to the constable of the district in which the defendant lives, or to the next constable most con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>venient to the defendant. Inasmuch as the constable of the Second ward and the constable of the Third ward both live in Titusville, and the property was in the same locality in the country, you would perhaps readily conclude, as the court doubtless would, that the question of convenience was complied with in issuing the execution to the Third ward or any other ward in Titusville. The provision doubtless was made for the purpose of saving costs to the defendant, and to avoid an unnecessary bill for mileage of the constable. The constables of the Second and Third wards of Titusville were convenient to the residence of the defendant, who seems to have lived in the city of Titusville.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. Judgment having been entered, the plaintiff took this appeal, assigning, for error, inter alia :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">2-4.

Gr. Eddy, and in favor of Rose Eddy, was void for want of jurisdiction, it may be that the defendant took no title to the goods in controversy by virtue of the constable\u2019s sale. We do not assent, however, to the proposition that the judgment was void. It was confessed by the defendant in person, in an amicable action before the justice. It was not entered, as was alleged, by virtue of a warrant of attorney. We are unable to see any reason why the judgment is void, or even voidable. Under such circumstances an execution might lawfully issue thereon. For an irregularity in the execution process the defendant therein would have a right to complain. The objection, in this instance, comes from a stranger, who assails its validity and that of the sale had thereupon. It is familiar law that no one can take advantage of a mere irregularity but the defendant himself. There is nothing upon the face of this record to show that the execution was void. It appears from the transcript of the justice that the writ was issued to Constable Megahey. Complaint is made that the court below permitted the justice to be examined as to the meaning of the marks II, on the face of the execution. Unexplained, they do not mean anything, and have no more significance than any other mark or scroll. The court below might well have disregarded it as irrelevant. Under the circumstances, the explanation was not error, and the evidence of the justice was properly admitted. It left the appellant without a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
