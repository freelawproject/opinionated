After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the jointly-tried appellants, Adrian McFadden and Anthony Miles, were convicted of the following offenses and sentenced to the terms specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>McFadden</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">1) first degree murder of Johnson: life without parole</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">2) four counts of use of a handgun: 80 years total, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">3) two counts of conspiracy to assault in the first degree: 10 years, consecutive, plus another 10 years, concurrent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">4) armed carjacking: 30 years, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">5) two counts of first degree assault: 50 years total, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">6) second degree assault: merged</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">7) attempted first degree murder of Ball: life, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-15\">\n<em>Miles</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-16\">1) two counts of conspiracy to assault in the first degree: 10 years, plus another 10 years, concurrent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-17\">2) first degree assault: 25 years, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-18\">3) attempted armed carjacking: 30 years, consecutive</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-19\">4) second degree assault: merged</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Questions Presented<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">1. If preserved, where the voir dire included an objectionable \u201cCSI\u201d question and appellants nonetheless accepted the jury as empaneled, have appellants waived their objection to the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">2. If preserved, did the trial court properly exercise its discretion when it overruled the Appellants\u2019 objections to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and rebuttal closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">3. To the extent that this issue is properly before this Court, did the trial court properly exercise its discretion when it determined that Appellant Miles\u2019s cross-examination of Avon Ball was not relevant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">4. Are appellants entitled to a merger of their separate sentences for two counts of conspiracy to assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">5. If preserved, was the evidence sufficient to sustain Appellants\u2019 convictions for attempted armed carjacking, conspiracy and first degree assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">6. Did the trial court properly exclude from evidence Avon Ball\u2019s prior conviction for assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">7. Did the trial court properly exercise its discretion when it permitted Avon Ball to testify that he understood Appellants\u2019 actions to mean that they intended to take his vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">8. If properly before this Court, did the trial court properly allow into evidence the out-of-court statements of Avon Ball, Shantia Benson, Trezline Burris, and Appellant McFadden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>9. If not waived, did the trial court properly decline to instruct the jury on self-defense and properly limit defense counsel\u2019s argument on mutual affray to the charges of assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">10. Was the trial court\u2019s conduct of the trial not plainly erroneous?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We conclude that appellants preserved the first two issues for our review. We answer both in the negative and, thus, reverse the judgments of the circuit court and remand the cases for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of our reversal based on the first two issues, we decline to address issues three through ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">During the trial, Avon Ball testified that, on the evening of July 6, 2007, he was riding as a passenger in a car with his foster brother, George Johnson, and Ball\u2019s seven-month-old son. Ball stated that he had just dropped off his six-year-old daughter at Preston and Cary Streets in Baltimore City, and he was on his way to another foster brother\u2019s house at 803 North Payson Street, to pick up Johnson\u2019s tennis shoes. As they arrived at the 800 block of North Payson Street, Johnson drove past their destination, then backed into an alley to turn around, so that they could approach 803 North Payson from the same side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Once they turned out of the alley, Ball heard \u201csome commotion,\u201d and Johnson stopped the car. Specifically, Ball stated that he heard appellant Miles \u201cswearing down towards us saying [ ] you almost hit my son.\u201d Ball, however, did not \u201csee a child in the area at that point.\u201d According to Ball, Miles was accompanied by a male and a female.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Ball testified that he exchanged words with Miles for approximately \u201ca minute, minute and a half\u2019 before Johnson pulled out of the alley and \u201cparked the car diagonally into 803 [North Payson].\u201d Ball remained in the vehicle with his son, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>while Johnson \u201cgot out of the car, ... and knock[ed] on the door to get his tennis shoes.\u201d While Johnson waited at the front door, Ball observed a group of about five males\u2014 including appellants Miles and McFadden\u2014walking in the middle of the street, approaching 803 North Payson. Ball told Johnson \u201cto pay attention because ... the dude ... was coming towards us\u201d but Johnson \u201cjust kept knocking on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Thereafter, three males \u201cjumped\u201d Johnson, and Ball exited the vehicle \u201cto help him out.\u201d Before he could reach Johnson, however, Ball stopped because he saw appellant McFadden pointing a black, six-shot revolver at him. Meanwhile, Miles was standing in the street, yelling: \u201cThis is my life, which one of you almost hit my son?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Ball then asked McFadden: \u201cWhat\u2019s the gun for?\u201d At that time, Johnson came over to Ball\u2019s side, and the two of them started \u201cbacking up in the middle of the street going towards Lafayette Street\u201d with their hands \u201cup in the air.\u201d Ball informed McFadden that he needed to get to the vehicle because \u201c[his] son\u2019s in that car.\u201d Appellants, however, stated that Ball was not getting to that car and \u201cthat\u2019s our car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Eventually, appellants \u201cstarted to calm down a little bit,\u201d turned around, and began \u201cwalking towards where the car was at.\u201d Ball and Johnson walked about 15-20 feet behind them in an attempt to go \u201cback towards the vehicle too.\u201d As they were walking, another heated exchange of words occurred between Johnson, Miles, and other individuals present. Appellants then turned back around towards Ball and Johnson. According to Ball, Miles \u201ctook off his shirt and ... start[ed] coming toward us\u201d while McFadden \u201cstarted shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Ball began running and heard about six shots fired. He was struck by two bullets before he rounded the corner at North Payson and Lafayette Streets. One bullet went through his abdomen and another grazed his side. When Ball went back to check on Johnson, who was \u201clying in the middle of the street,\u201d he saw McFadden \u201cwiping off the gun\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>asking whether Johnson was dead. One girl, 17-year-old Macy Wilson, was also struck by a bullet in her left thigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Approximately five minutes after Ball was shot, \u201cthe ambulance and stretcher came and got [him].\u201d When he reached the hospital, Ball learned that Johnson had died. Ball suffered a collapsed lung, had his spleen taken out, and his diaphragm reconstructed. He was in the hospital for eight or nine days. Ball testified that there was no doubt in his mind that McFadden was the person who fired the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On July 11, 2007, Ball selected McFadden, from a six-pack photographic array, as the person who \u201cpointed the gun ...[,] killed my brother [Johnson] and also shot me and other people that night.\u201d That same day, Ball identified Miles, from a photographic array, as the person who \u201cstarted the argument ... and ... swung at me and my brother at different times during the incident.\u201d In addition, Ball stated that Miles is \u201cthe reason why my brother George Johnson and I was shot and my brother killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">When the defense presented their case, several witnesses testified that the shots were fired from a darkened playground area some distance away, and not from the area of the fight. According to some of those witnesses, the shooter was another individual named Steffan Hawkins.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Additional facts will be provided as necessary, in the relevant sections, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">I. CSI Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Appellants argue that \u201cthe trial court erred by using specific non-neutral language in its voir dire question regarding \u2018CSI-type\u2019 evidence.\u201d Specifically, appellants aver that the question \u201csuggested to the jury that [a guilty finding] was the only option regardless of whether scientific evidence was presented in the case.\u201d Meanwhile, the State counters by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>arguing that appellants did not preserve this issue for our review, and in the alternative, that they have waived any appellate complaint \u201cbecause they accepted the jury as empaneled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u201cVoir dire is critical to the protection of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 395-96, 906 A.2d 374 (2006) (citations omitted). In Maryland, voir dire aids in ensuring \u201ca fair and impartial jury by determining the existence of cause for disqualification.\u201d <em>Logan, supra, </em>394 Md. at 396, 906 A.2d 374 (citation omitted). \u201cThe process entails examination of prospective jurors through questions propounded by the judge (or either of the parties, if allowed by the judge) to determine the existence of bias or prejudice and, literally translated, means \u2018to say the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles &amp; Drake v. State, </em>414 Md. 726, 733, 997 A.2d 154 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201c[0]ur tenets of voir dire favor inquiries tailored to the likely issues to be presented in the case, so juror biases directly related to the crime, the witnesses, or the defendant, may be uncovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 997 A.2d 154.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">The manner of voir dire is governed by Rule 4-312(d), which states: (1) <em>Examination. </em>The trial judge may permit the parties to conduct an examination of qualified jurors or may conduct the examination after considering questions proposed by the parties. If the judge conducts the examination, the judge may permit the parties to supplement the examination by further inquiry or may submit to the jurors additional questions proposed by the parties. The jurors\u2019 responses to any examination shall be under oath. On request of any party, the judge shall direct the clerk to call the roll of the array and to request each qualified juror to stand and be identified when called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">(2) <em>Challenges for cause. </em>A party may challenge an individual qualified juror for cause. A challenge for cause shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>made and determined before the jury is sworn, or thereafter for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u201cThe right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 21 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of [R]ights requires that judges refrain from making comments which potentially may improperly influence the jury or a specific juror or jurors.\u201d <em>Butler v. State, </em>392 Md. 169, 192, 896 A.2d 359 (2006). Thus, \u201c[a] judge\u2019s role during a jury trial makes his or her statements subject to a high level of scrutiny, when they may result in an unfair advantage to either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181, 896 A.2d 359. It has been held \u201cinappropriate to question the jury [during voir dire] as to whether or not they would be disposed to follow or apply stated rules of law because they are covered in subsequent instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 142, 882 A.2d 900 (2005) (citing <em>Tunning v. State, </em>234 Md. 97, 100, 198 A.2d 291 (1964)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA question designed to commit potential jurors to positions on a specific set of facts which will arise in the course of a trial is also improper.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>399 Md. 146, 163, 923 A.2d 44 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">At a bench conference during voir dire on October 21, 2008, the trial court in this case informed both defense attorneys that it would be asking the \u201cCSI instruction\u201d and noted that they could \u201ctake exception,\u201d which they did. Prior to asking the voir dire question, the court addressed defense counsel and stated: \u201cNow, counsel, I\u2019ve made a note of your views at the bench with regard to the question I\u2019m about to ask for the record.\u201d The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">I\u2019m going to assume, based on having done this before, that many of you watch way too much television, including the so-called realistic crime shows, like CSI, Miami, and CSI, New York, and CSI, Glen Burnie, Law and Order, and Illegal and Unwarranted and the rest of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Now, I trust you understand that these crime shows are fiction and fantasy. And for dramatic effect and for you to stay tuned in, they purport to rely upon \u201cscientific evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>dence.\u201d This is certainly entertainment, but you must not allow that entertainment to interfere with the high duty you will have in this case as a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">Therefore, if you are currently of the opinion or belief that you cannot convict a Defendant without \u201cscientific evidence,\u201d regardless of the other evidence in the case and regardless of the instruction I give you as to law, please rise. I see no responses. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">After a jury was not selected on that day, the venire panel was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">When a new venire panel was assembled on October 23, 2008, the court again asked the \u201cCSI\u201d question and received no responses. Thereafter, the court asked counsel to approach the bench and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">THE COURT: ... any further exceptions which were already stated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">[Miles\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, I did have an exception to the CSI question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">The State first contends that this issue is not preserved for our review because, on October 23, 2008, defense counsel objected to the CSI question <em>after </em>the voir dire question had been posed. We have previously held, however, that in order to preserve an objection, counsel need only \u201cmak[e] known to the trial court what he wanted done.\u201d <em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 610, 853 A.2d 796 (2004) (issue was preserved where \u201cappellant told the trial court that he objected to its failure to ask his requested voir dire questions\u201d) (citations and footnote omitted). Our decision was based on Maryland Rule 4-323(e), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-14\">[I]t is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court. The grounds for the objection need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>be stated unless these rules expressly provide otherwise or the court so directs. If a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection at that time does not constitute a waiver of the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In this case, counsel for both appellants noted their objection to the CSI question on October 21, 2008. When a new venire panel was assembled on October 23, 2008, the court immediately conducted voir dire and again asked the CSI question, and defense counsel was not required to object until after the question was posed. Because Miles\u2019s counsel noted his exception at the ensuing bench conference and made known to the court what he wanted done, this issue was properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Next, the State argues that this issue is \u201cnonetheless waived\u201d because \u201c[ajppellants accepted the jury as empaneled without qualification.\u201d Quoting <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 667 A.2d 876 (1995), the State notes that \u201ca defendant\u2019s claim of error in the inclusion or exclusion of a prospective juror or jurors is ordinarily abandoned when the defendant or his counsel indicates satisfaction with the jury at the conclusion of the jury selection process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 667 A.2d 876 (citations omitted). The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Gilchrist, </em>however, is misplaced, as appellants\u2019 claim of error does not lie upon the inclusion or exclusion of a prospective juror. Rather, appellants challenge the court\u2019s propriety in posing the CSI question.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 573, 701 A.2d 862 (1997), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">[W]here the objection was not directly aimed at the composition of the jury ultimately selected, we have taken the position that the objecting party\u2019s approval of the jury as ultimately selected ... did not explicitly or implicitly waive his previously asserted ... [objection, and his] objection was preserved for appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 701 A.2d 862 (citation omitted). In other words, when defense counsel objects to the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>a particular question during voir dire, not to the ultimate composition of the jury,\u201d he or she does not \u201cwaive the objection by approving the panel selected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 701 A.2d 862 (citing <em>Gilchrist, </em>supra, 340 Md. at 617, 667 A.2d 876). This is consistent with our decision in <em>Marquardt, </em>where we made clear that \u201caccepting the jury that is ultimately selected after the circuit court has refused to propound requested voir dire questions does not constitute acquiescence to the previous adverse ruling.\u201d <em>Marquardt, supra, </em>164 Md. App. at 143, 882 A.2d 900 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">We note that the decisions in <em>Fowlkes </em>and <em>Marquardt </em>dealt with objections to the court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction, whereas this case presents an objection to a question actually given. We treat these circumstances identically because in both, \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s acceptance of the jury was merely obedient to the court\u2019s ruling and obviously was not a withdrawal of the prior objection, timely made.\u201d <em>Fowlkes, supra, </em>117 Md.App. at 580, 701 A.2d 862 (citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Having concluded that appellants have preserved this issue for our review, we turn to determine whether the trial court erred in including the CSI question during voir dire. The State concedes that, if the issue is properly before this Court, then appellants are, \u201cunder <em>Charles and Drake, </em>entitled to a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In Claries <em>&amp; Drake, </em>the Court of Appeals rejected a voir dire question that was similar to the question at issue here. There, the trial court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">I\u2019m going to assume that many of you, from having done a few of these, watch way too much TV, including the so-called realistic crime shows like CSI and Law and Order. I trust that you understand that these crime shows are fiction and fantasy and are done for dramatic effect and for this dramatic effect they purport to rely upon, \u201cscientific evidence,\u201d to convict guilty persons. While this is certainly acceptable as entertainment you must not allow this entertainment experience to interfere with your duties as a juror. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Therefore, if you are currently of the opinion or belief that you cannot convict a defendant without \u201cscientific evidence,\u201d regardless of the other evidence in the case and regardless of the instructions that I will give you as to the law, please rise____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Charles &amp; Drake, supra, </em>414 Md. at 730, 997 A.2d 154 (emphasis and footnote omitted). On appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cthe judge abused his discretion by suggesting to the panel that \u2018convicting]\u2019 Drake and Charles was the only option.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 997 A.2d 154. According to the. Court, \u201cthis suggestive question poisoned the venire, thereby depriving Drake and Charles of a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the voir dire question in <em>Charles &amp; Drake </em>is nearly identical to the CSI question in this case, we likewise conclude that appellants were deprived of a fair and impartial jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II. The State\u2019s Improper Comments</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Next, appellants argue that the trial court erred when it allowed the State to make several \u201cimproper\u201d comments during its opening statement and closing argument. Preliminarily, the State counters by arguing that neither appellant objected to two of those comments and, therefore, \u201cthose appellate issues are not properly before this Court.\u201d In addition, the State contends that appellant Miles failed to object to three additional comments and, thus, failed to preserve those claims for our review. The State adds that, even if preserved, the trial court properly exercised its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>because \u201cthe record does not support [appellants\u2019] assertions that the arguments were ad hominem attacks upon [them] or their counsel, or that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments encouraged the jurors to convict them for any reason other than the fact that the evidence convinced the jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants were guilty of the offenses charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We agree with appellants that some of the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper. Although we reverse and remand both appellants\u2019 cases due to the court\u2019s error in asking the CSI question, we shall address some of appellants\u2019 contentions with regard to the State\u2019s comments in order to give guidance to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u201cThe regulation of argument rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 224, 670 A.2d 398 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>see also James v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 233, 258, 991 A.2d 122 (2010). Generally, \u201c \u2018[t]he prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whaley v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 429, 452, 974 A.2d 951 (2009) (quoting <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 152, 872 A.2d 25 (2005)). Further, counsel \u201c\u2018may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Spain, supra, </em>386 Md. at 153, 872 A.2d 25). Nonetheless, notwithstanding the \u201cgreat leeway\u201d given to counsel, \u201cnot all statements are permissible during closing arguments.\u201d <em>Donaldson v.

In <em>White, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">There is a difference between commenting harshly about a defendant and commenting harshly about a defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. It is perfectly acceptable to condemn in severe language the details of the cruel crime of which the defendant is accused. But when a prosecutor\u2019s argument asks the jury to scorn the defendant because of economic or social class, race, or appearance, those remarks stray from the roadway of permissible comment and cannot escape condemnation just because the law permits some vigorous advocacy. The opportunity during closing argument for attorneys to use eloquence, oratorical skills, illustrations, metaphors, anecdotes, and literary references does not provide a medium for the attorney improperly to arouse prejudice, intentionally or unintentionally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 705, 726 A.2d 858 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Even if we determine that counsel\u2019s comments were improper, we will not reverse a conviction \u201c \u2018unless there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>416 Md. at 496, 7 A.3d 84 (quoting <em>Henry v.

Mr. McFadden and Mr. Miles are both represented by very able counsel. You will hear from them now. And as you hear from them, keep in mind who has a reason to lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the last word. Who what ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[State]: I said, as you listen\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">THE COURT: I heard that. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[State]:\u2014has a reason to lie. To fabricate, to take you away from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">[State]:\u2014the truth, which will come from that witness stand (indicating). (Unintelligible) your collective wisdom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">During closing arguments, the State made the following comment, to which neither appellant objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">Some of you are way too young to remember, and I am too (laugh) the second world war. But I\u2019ve read about it. And what they did, the propaganda people in Nazi Germany, is their belief was to tell a he, tell a big lie and tell it enough times until somebody believes and thinks, huh, may be. It may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">Macy Wilson was taken to the hospital and ... one thing that is considered in the law and probably just in life experiences and common sense as very reliable is a statement made immediately after an event. A startling event, an event that suspends your facility to create a lie. And an example of that is a young woman in a hospital bed shot in her leg in pain ... depending on whether you believe the original testimony that she said [McFadden] shot me and then later maybe she said, I think he shot me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">The following day, the State began its rebuttal closing argument by commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>[State]: Yesterday, you heard some real sharp words about the State and about the detectives\u2019 investigation. And what I want you to know is, you know, prosecutors have a different ethical standard than defense attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">[Miles\u2019s counsel]: I\u2019m joining the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">THE COURT: I think you opened the door, Ms. Warner (McFadden\u2019s counsel). I\u2019m going to overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajq\">[State]: And a prosecutor is ethically prohibited from proceeding with evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">THE COURT: Now, wait a minute. Come on up. (Whereupon, counsel approached the bench and the following ensued:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">THE COURT: What if I see you making the\u2014opening the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">[State]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">THE COURT: What exactly do you think they said to open the door? Normally, I would agree with this, but, normally, it would not be admissible as evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">[State]: The attack on the State. \u201cThe shoddy investigation.\u201d \u201cThey just want a conviction.\u201d \u201cJust convict.\u201d \u201cJust do it.\u201d But I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">THE COURT: But [McFadden\u2019s counsel] might want to . speak to just that more than one conviction as the evidence shows you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">THE COURT: I think you should phrase it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">[State]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, can I make a record? At no time during my closing did I challenge the State\u2019s ethics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>THE COURT: I think, by implication, you did. But, anyway, your objection to the rebuttal comments are noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQ\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">[Miles\u2019s counsel]: Mine, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Shortly thereafter, the State continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">Similarly, the State does not just want a conviction. No prosecutor gets paid more if there\u2019s a conviction. I can tell you no homicide detective gets paid more if there\u2019s a conviction. They are doing jobs. Jobs that I can tell you are not really that well compensated. And their jobs are to investigate in an objective manner and to present evidence in a Court of law of the guilt of a criminal defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANz\">After McFadden\u2019s counsel noted an objection, the court overruled, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">It\u2019s argument. Counsel\u2019s argument and any conclusions that she chooses to draw will be up to the jury to decide whether that\u2019s the appropriate inference or not. Whether it was done or whether it was right or wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Later, the State commented on both appellants by stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEi\">[State]: ... And here\u2019s another thing I want you to think about on this issue. This Hawkins drama. I believe you can infer reasonably that the Defendants know how to work the system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">THE COURT: Overruled. You had free rein to argue; she gets free rein to argue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">[State]: This about this. Adrian McFadden didn\u2019t even have to be given his Miranda[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] rights. The detectives showed up to serve an arrest warrant. He looked at them and said, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you. I have a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>THE COURT: No. The issue of voluntariness of the statement was for the jury to consider and I assume that\u2019s what the argument is relevant to. So I\u2019ll overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">[State]: So the detectives walked away. But here is where Adrian McFadden ... displayed his attitude towards the police, towards the Courts, towards all of us, towards the fabric of our society that says, above all else, thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not kill. He couldn\u2019t resist----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Lastly, when discussing why Hawkins had not been called as a witness, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">[State]: ... That Stefan Hawkins, ... he\u2019s out playing basketball. He\u2019s not down here when this happens. He\u2019s not even here. That he suddenly comes rushing across and appears in a dark spot under a tree and randomly fires, randomly fired, into this group of people surrounded by spectators? Does that make any sense to anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">And, you know, I told you the other day about our constitution, our system, and American justice and all I mentioned how we have the burden of proof and they don\u2019t have to do anything, but they can confront witnesses. Well, they can also compel witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">[Miles\u2019s counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">THE COURT: No. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">[McFadden\u2019s counsel]: I join in the objection, Your Honor. THE COURT: Same ruling. You may continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">On appeal, appellants claim that the following comments made by the State were improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">1) During opening statement, the State asked the jurors to \u201ckeep in mind who has a reason to lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">2) During closing argument, the State referred to \u201cthe propaganda people in Nazi Germany.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">3) During rebuttal closing argument, the State alleged that \u201cprosecutors have a different ethical standard than defense attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>4) During rebuttal closing argument, the State alleged that \u201c[n]o prosecutor gets paid more if there\u2019s a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">5) During rebuttal closing argument, the State alleged that appellants \u201cknow how to work the system\u201d because McFadden \u201cdidn\u2019t even have to be given his Miranda rights.\u201d According to the State, when the detectives showed up to serve an arrest warrant, McFadden \u201clooked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m not talking to you. I have a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">6) During rebuttal closing argument, the State averred that, not only can appellants confront witnesses, \u201cthey can also compel witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At trial, both appellants objected to comment # 6 and, therefore, that issue is preserved for our review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In this case, the prosecutor alleged that not only can appellants confront witnesses, \u201cthey can also compel witnesses.\u201d This is \u201cbeyond the boundaries of fair comment,\u201d as the State presented no evidence to support such a statement\u2014 especially one that could improperly arouse prejudice. Without any discussion, however, the court overruled the objections raised by both defense counsel. It did not take \u201csteps to mitigate or eliminate the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705 (citation omitted). Therefore, the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Next, we turn to comments # 1 and # 5, to which McFadden objected at trial. Like comment # 6, discussed above, the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement asking the jurors to \u201ckeep in mind who has a reason to lie\u201d (comment # 1), was an attack on defendants\u2019 integrity and, therefore, impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">With regard to comment # 5, McFadden argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cabout Appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent and right to counsel ... were not directed at any evidence, voluntariness of any statement, or anything else that would make the comments permissible.\u201d We agree. Generally, \u201cpost-arrest silence [is] inadmissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense at trial.\u201d <em>Lupfer v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 216, 231, 4 A.3d 32 (citations omitted), <em>cert. granted, </em>417 Md. 384, 10 A.3d 199 (2010). However, \u201cthe State may introduce such evidence when it is introduced in fair response to an issue that is generated by the defense regarding the defendant\u2019s interaction with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 4 A.3d 32. For example, \u201c[w]hen a defendant creates the impression that he or she cooperated with the police, the State may introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to rebut that impression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Here, the State did not reference McFadden\u2019s silence to rebut an impression that McFadden created regarding his intent to cooperate with the police. Rather, the prosecutor urged the jury to \u201cinfer reasonably that the Defendants know how to work the system.\u201d By doing so, the State implied that McFadden\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent evidenced guilt on his part. The trial court abused its discretion in finding that the prosecutor made the comment so that the jury could consider the \u201cvoluntariness of the statement.\u201d Therefore, McFadden\u2019s objection should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Although neither McFadden nor Miles objected to comments # 2 and # 4, we will address appellants\u2019 arguments and caution the State that both statements were improper. In <em>White, </em>we stated that a final argument containing an appeal to prejudice \u201ccan be an overture to jurors to decide a case using preexisting favorable or unfavorable opinions about certain groups of people based on perceived generalities or stereotypes.\u201d <em>White, supra, </em>125 Md.App. at 704, 726 A.2d 858 (citing <em>Contee v. State, </em>223 Md. 575, 582-84, 165 A.2d 889 (1960)). \u201cAlthough it is highly likely that some or all of the jurors may entertain some of the prejudices that exist in their communities, there can be no justification for prosecutors ... to exploit those prejudices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 265, 268-69, 250 A.2d 904 (1969)). The prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cthe propaganda people in Nazi Germany,\u201d therefore, was not justified. <em>See, e.g., Sibiga v. State, </em>65 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>69, 79, 499 A.2d 484 (1985) (holding that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks comparing appellant to A1 Capone were \u201chighly improper\u201d and prejudicial, as \u201c[t]hey were not fair comment upon the substantive evidence in the case, nor on appellant\u2019s credibility as a witness,\u201d but \u201cwere designed solely to instill in the jury a general antipathy towards appellant\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Lastly, the State\u2019s argument that \u201c[n]o prosecutor gets paid more if there\u2019s a conviction\u201d was not based upon any facts entered into evidence, was not probative of guilt or innocence, and improperly bolstered the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the testimony of the lead detective, and the police officers who testified in the case. \u201cCourts consistently have deemed improper comments made during closing argument that invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial.\u201d <em>Spain, supra, </em>386 Md. at 156, 872 A.2d 25 (citations omitted). In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comment\u2014implying that there would be no favorable consequences to the prosecutor\u2019s or detective\u2019s career if the jury were to return guilty verdicts\u2014constituted facts that were not in evidence and improperly bolstered the credibility of the prosecution. As such, it was improper. <em>See Sivells, supra, </em>196 Md.App. at 279-80, 9 A.3d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We recognize that not \u201cevery remark made by counsel outside of the testimony [are] grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 169, 179, 259 A.2d 66 (1969). \u201c [W]hat exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends on the facts in each case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 430-31, 722 A.2d 887 (1999) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 415, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). As we previously noted, \u201c \u2018reversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 722 A.2d 887 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 580, 530 A.2d 743 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Here, even if no single error, by itself, deprived appellants of a fair trial, the sustained attack on the defense, cumulative<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ly, exposed the jury to improper considerations. The prosecutor\u2019s numerous unjustified comments appealed to the jury\u2019s passions, and the court\u2019s failure to take any action to overcome the likelihood of prejudice adversely affected both McFadden and Miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reverse appellants\u2019 convictions and remand their cases for a new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY ARE REVERSED AND THE CASES ARE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
