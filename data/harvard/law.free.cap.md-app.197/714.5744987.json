On October 16, 2008 and November 20, 2008, public hearings were held with regard to the proposed subdivision, at which testimony and documentary evidence were presented. Following the November 20 hearing, the Commission voted to deny the preliminary plat for the subdivision, \u201cwith findings of fact to be determined at a later date.\u201d Subsequently, on December 18, 2008, the Commission adopted a \u201cResolution of Decision and Findings of Fact,\u201d setting forth its reasoning for denying the Whiton subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">On or about December 31, 2008, appellant appealed the Commission\u2019s denial to the Wicomico County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The appeal was opposed by the Wicomico Environmental Trust, as well as several intervenors. On February 26, 2009, the Board held an \u201con the record\u201d hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>and reviewed the proceedings, testimony, and evidence from the Commission hearings, and affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. On April 13, 2009, the Board rendered written \u201cFindings of Fact and Resolution,\u201d adopting and incorporating by reference the Commission\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">On May 11, 2009, appellant petitioned to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for judicial review. Wicomico Environmental Trust, Ltd., Charles Shank, Jr., Mark and Lisa Wagner, and Audubon Maryland, DC, intervenors before the Board, as well as Wicomico County, Maryland, appellees, all responded to and indicated their intention to participate in and oppose appellant\u2019s petition. On October 9, 2009, the circuit court heard oral arguments, and on November 6, 2009, the court issued a written opinion and order affirming the Board\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On appeal, appellant contends<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that (1) a \u201ccluster subdivision\u201d such as it had proposed, is an \u201cinherently permitted use in the A-l zoning district\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as adopted by the County legislature pursuant to Wicomico County Code (\u201cCode\u201d) \u00a7 225-52, which section specifies \u201cclear, objective and unambiguous criteria for an A-l cluster subdivision\u201d; thus, (2) the Commission did not have the administrative authority to deny appellant\u2019s application for such use on the basis that the use did not comply with the \u201cgeneral purpose provisions\u201d in Code \u00a7\u00a7 225-27 A or 225-51 A, and the Commission \u201cmisconstrued and exceeded its authority\u201d by applying the \u201cgeneral purpose provisions\u201d in \u201corder to promote their personal bias against residential development\u201d on the Property; and, (3) the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>mission\u2019s findings were unsupported by \u201cany evidence,\u201d and, in any event, did not support its denial of appellant\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">1. <em>The proposed Whiton subdivision site</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The Property consists of a 519.12-acre tract located in the southeastern corner of Wicomico County abutting Worcester County to the south. It is situated on the west side of Whiton Road, a.k.a. Maryland Route 354, (hereinafter \u201cRoute 354\u201d) and the southwest side of Powell School Road. According to appellant, the Property is located near the village of Powell-ville and is approximately 7 miles from the town of Willards, 11 miles from the town of Berlin, and 15 miles from downtown Salisbury. The Property consists of two adjoining parcels, parcels 11 and 64. The parcels are completely forested, with the exception of a 25-acre cultivated field fronting on Route 354. Other than the 25-acre field, the Property is currently, and has been since at least 1929, used for timber growing.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Running through the southwesterly portion of the Property and constituting its southwesterly boundary is a ditch and/or stream called Davis Branch. The westerly portion of the tract consists of two ridges of high, dry, sandy soils on which logging roads exist. The remainder of the Property is at a lower elevation and is characterized by wetter, hydric soils, including areas of nontidal wetlands, making it unsuitable for development, but capable of supporting timber production.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">2. <em>Subdivision development regulations on the proposed Whiton site</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">a. <em>The Comprehensive Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Pursuant to the February 3, 1998 Wicomico County Comprehensive Plan (the \u201cComprehensive Plan\u201d or the \u201cPlan\u201d) land use map, the Property is located in what is designated as an Agricultural/Forest Resource Area and in the A-l Agriculture-Rural zoning district. The Plan is an \u201cofficial statement of the County Council setting forth policies concerning desir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>able future physical development\u201d in the County, \u201cserves as a general guide to public and private development decisions,\u201d and is \u201cthe basis for the preparation of specific legislation, such as zoning and subdivision regulations ... which implement the policies set forth in the Plan.\u201d The Comprehensive Plan envisions that development will be concentrated in suitable areas, that sensitive areas will be protected, and that growth will be directed to existing population centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Chapter 2 of the Comprehensive Plan, \u201cLand Use,\u201d sets forth the overall development concept principles and policies concerning Agriculture/Resource areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">The Agricultural/Resources Area designation is intended to prevent developments that require urban services, and to preserve the agricultural base and rural lifestyle of the County. Most land devoted to farming and nearly all public drainage associations, which are formed to drain agricultural land, are within the Agriculture/Resource area. The primary land uses in these areas should be agriculture, forestry and related activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">That section also indicates that \u201cfc]luster development is the preferred form of land subdivision to avoid land use conflicts and maintain or enhance rural character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">With respect to residential land, the policies section provides that in \u201ckeeping with the general development policies of the County,\u201d \u201c[a] variety of housing and development types and locations should be encouraged to provide a mixture of living environments,\u201d and specifically, \u201c[cjluster design and planned unit developments should be encouraged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">In chapter 9, \u201cImplementation,\u201d with respect to the Agriculture/rural District, the Plan provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\n<em>Agriculture/Rural (AR)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">The District is comprised mostfly] of that land previously describefd] as rural residential. The purpose of the Agriculture/Rural District is to preserve agricultural lands, forests, environmentally sensitive areas and open spaces while preserving the fundamental rights of landowners to utilize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>these lands for either resource-based uses or low-impact residential development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">The AR District will assist in preserving open areas of the County as areas for development of active or passive outdoor recreation use. Through carefully implemented design standards it will protect existing natural resources----This district includes areas naturally unsuited for intensive development adjacent to all of the County\u2019s waterways (generally coinciding with the limits of the 100-Year Floodplain or the natural floodplain of all waterways), streams and their buffers, the habitats of threatened and endangered species, designated \u201cgreenways,\u201d the Critical Area Buffer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">Landowners in AR districts are guaranteed choices about how to man[a]ge their land. The preferred use of land in the Agriculture/Rural District is for sustainable resource protection. However, other development is permitted in a manner that minimizes negative impacts on existing resources and allows a substantial economic return for the landowner. This is accomplished by the creation of cluster development densities and standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Because a primary design consideration in the Agriculture/Rural areas was \u201cretaining and/or enhancing rural character,\u201d the Plan also recommends that the zoning ordinance \u201cstrongly encourage cluster development in the rural district.\u201d Furthermore, the Plan recommends that as \u201can incentive for \u2018clustering\u2019 development to retain areas of open space ... a bonus or incentive density be established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">b. <em>The Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Article 25 A of the Maryland Annotated Code (1957), provides Wicomico County with the authority to establish rules and regulations regarding the subdivision of land in the County. Chapter 200 contains the subdivision provisions. Chapter 225 of the zoning Code sets forth the County zoning provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>sions. Of particular relevance here are the following provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Section 225-3, which is found in Article I, \u201cPurpose and Authority,\u201d defines the \u201cIntent\u201d of the zoning Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">A. The Zoning Regulations and Districts herein set forth and as identified upon the Zoning Map of Wicomico County are made for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety and general welfare and prescribing the most desirable use for which land in each zoning district may be adapted and those uses to be subjected to special regulations, while conserving the value of land throughout the county. The height, bulk and location of buildings and other structures, the area of yards, courts and setbacks and other open spaces, the density of population and intensity of use of buildings and land, the use and conservation of waterfront areas, and the use of structures and land for residential, commercial, industrial, institutional or other purposes, are hereby restricted and regulated as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">B. Such regulations have been designed to preserve open space, protect the Chesapeake Bay, lessen congestion in the streets and preserve agriculture. They have been made with reasonable regard, among other things, to the character of each zoning district and its suitability for particular uses as well as the preservation of the natural environment throughout Wicomico County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">C.

The Commission had previously reviewed sketch plats for the Property in January of 2005, June of 2006, and January of 2007. The April of 2007 sketch plat proposed a subdivision of 188 lots on 562 acres. In October of 2007, another sketch plat was reviewed for 143 lots on 527 acres, with the lots averaging approximately 1.2 acres each. The Commission noted that the Property in question was zoned A-l. After reviewing the proposal and Code \u00a7 225-51 A, the Commission concluded that \u201c[permitting a subdivision of this density will forever change the rural landscape and character of the region. By introducing this heavily populated subdivision, demands will likely be placed on the County to allow commercial, retail, medical and food service providers to the region.\u201d Thus, the Commission\u2019s consensus was that if appellant chose to submit a preliminary plat, \u201ca density of one unit per fifteen acres is preferable to use of the cluster provision in the manner proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In reaching its consensus, the Commission also cited to an enclosure, dated October 5, 2007, appended to an October 12, 2007 letter to the Commission from the Maryland Department of Planning (\u201cMDP\u201d) in which the MDP objected to the Whiton subdivision proposal stating that it \u201cis inconsistent with the County Zoning Code, the subdivision ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan and State Planning policy\u201d; thus, the Commission should reject the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Subsequently, the Department of Public Works (\u201cDPW\u201d) reviewed a \u201cpreliminary plat\u201d submitted by appellant. The preliminary plat proposed a subdivision of 147 lots on 166.82 acres. The plat provided for approximately 352.30 acres of open space, and 14.68 acres was to be dedicated for new roads. The total acreage of the Property was 519.2 acres. The DPW recommended Commission approval of the subdivision subject to certain proposed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The preliminary plat was reviewed by the Commission, and a \u201cCounty Subdivision Analysis\u201d was prepared by Commission staff. The information contained in that document and from the preliminary plat indicates that appellant contemplated that the subdivision would contain 147 lots on the 519.2 acre tract. All lots would front and have access on new interior streets consisting of 14.68 acres. The lots would average 1.04 acres in size, and 352.30 acres would remain undeveloped as forested set-aside and open space area. Furthermore, the agricultural area would remain in agricultural use. The access to the subdivision was proposed to connect to Powell School Road, a \u201cMinor Collector Road.\u201d The proposed entrance would require \u201csubstantial road improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The analysis also noted that \u201ca subdivision at a density of one unit per 15 acres (the Rural Base Density) would be preferred for this rural area.\u201d Further, the analysis noted that the site was within a \u201cGreen Infrastructure Hub,\u201d which was identified by the Department of Natural Resources (\u201cDNR\u201d) as \u201cone of the most ecologically sensitive Green Infrastructure areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The analysis included a review of the MDP\u2019s comments in its prior report, and observed that the MDP had noted \u201ca number of issues with this proposal,\u201d including that the proposal \u201cwill not help to preserve agricultural and forest lands and will further fragment lands available for farm and timber production,\u201d and the proposed development \u201cincreases the probability of conflict between rural resource-based activities (farming and forestry and their related activities) and residential enclaves.\u201d The Commission staff, noting that it shared the concerns previously noted by the Commission and the MDP for any development in \u201cthis isolated rural area,\u201d recommended preliminary plat approval for the Whiton subdivision, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The land area currently in active agricultural production is to remain in agricultural production. The proposed subdivision is located near the northeast border of the property and a portion of the lots are not within the Green Infrastructure area. The subdivision has been designed so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>68 percent of the property will remain in open space. Although a significant investment will be required for road improvements and road construction and there will be significant costs for future road maintenance and service delivery, the applicants have designed the subdivision to minimize these costs as much as possible. The location of the lots back from Powell School Road will minimize impacts on surrounding agricultural operations and will and will also minimize the visual impacts of those operations on the subdivision. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">4. <em>Commission proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aex\">a. <em>October 16, 2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">At the start of the proceedings, Gloria Smith, the Commission\u2019s staff planner, presented the proposed Whiton subdivision. She began by briefly reviewing the County Subdivision Analysis, which included comments submitted by the MDP in its October 5, 2007 staff report and October 12, 2007 letter to the Commission. We shall pause here to set forth portions of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In its October 12 letter, the MDP expressed its \u201cconcerns\u201d with the Whiton subdivision, repeatedly indicating that the proposal was contrary to the Comprehensive Plan and failed the \u201cpurpose test\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">About 341 acres of the site are to be preserved as open space and thereby protected from direct development activity. The open space will be divided into three somewhat discontinuous blocks of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">It appears that all of the currently farmed land will be converted to residential lots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alm-dedup-1\">[T]he proposal is inconsistent with the intent of both State and local plans and policies, and will compromise State and County investment in rural land and resource conservation easements in the surrounding area. The greatest concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>from among those discussed in the enclosure [i.e., the October 5, 2007 report] appear to be the apparent inconsistencies between the magnitude, location, and design of the development project on the one hand, and the goals and intent of the County Comprehensive Plan and zoning ordinance for the A-l Agricultural District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">With respect to magnitude and location, 143 dwellings seems a formidable residential presence in a part of the County\u2019s Agricultural-Rural District that is both fairly remote from County growth areas and adjacent to an analogous part of Worcester County\u2019s agricultural district. A development of this size appears incongruent with County objectives for working rural landscapes in the A-l District, an area whose primary land uses, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan, are agriculture and forestry. These proposed units will intrude severely upon rural land use and character, both on-site and in the surrounding area.... MDP is not able to provide any convincing rationale to suggest that these impacts, so contrary to the objectives of the County Plan, could be avoided for such a large development in such a location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">With respect to the design of the site, the project will not preserve a relatively large, contiguous land area with the best soils and woodland resource features, and more important, will not lend itself to future agricultural or forestry use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">... [T]he fragmentation of the property by residential enclaves will greatly compromise farm and forest uses for the remainder of the site.... This outcome, counter to the intent of the County\u2019s Plan and the purpose of the A-l zoning district, would seem difficult to avoid given the number of units proposed, no matter the site design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">Given the magnitude, location, and site considerations, it is not surprising that the proposal lacks the design features for cluster developments in the A-l District that are indicated in the purpose statement of the county zoning ordinance. Specifically, given the number of lots to be concen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>trated in a single development site, it would be difficult to design a project that would \u201c... protect agriculture from incompatible residential ... development,\u201d and which would qualify as a \u201csmall cluster development with significant open spaces\u201d compatible with the purposes of the A-l District articulated in the ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan. ... [The MDP] recommend[s] putting an emphasis on consistency with the intent of the County Plan and the zoning ordinance. [Consistency with county plans, State Planning Policy, and county intent for zoning districts ... should always play an over-arching role in local decision-making about development proposals. The intent articulated in these plans and ordinances represents publicly established purposes, and these are the purposes to be served through administration of development review and approval processes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The attachment, the October 5 report, provided more of the same sentiments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">[The proposed subdivision] is located in a portion of the A-1 District that is far from any County Priority Funding Area or planned development area ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">This district is designed to protect agriculture from incompatible residential, commercial, and industrial development. Where low-intensity residential development is allowed in the Agricultural-Rural District, density and design standards shall ensure natural resource protection and preservation of rural character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">It is our view that the proposed development is not consistent with the County\u2019s zoning guidelines for cluster development in the A-l District. Though much smaller in terms of the number of households and population than previously proposed for this site, and despite its label as a cluster development, the proposal is not a \u201clow intensity residential\u201d or \u201csmall cluster development with significant open spaces.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>[I]t does not concentrate a small enough number[ ] of lots to be un-intrusive upon surrounding rural land use and character, on a minimum amount of land; and does not preserve a relatively large, contiguous portion of the site with the best soils and other resource features in a configuration that lends itself to future agricultural or forestry use. It therefore does not meet the purpose-test of the County\u2019s zoning code for the A-l District, nor is it compatible with much of the intent of the zoning guidelines for cluster development. * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">In addition, the development plan does not preserve agricultural land and enhance rural atmosphere and visual character. Rather ... it will compromise the resource attributes of the site and its immediate surrounding, and serve as a shift in County procedure away from support for the two central visions of State Planning Policy,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] which are also objectives of the County Comprehensive Plan: to concentrate development in suitable areas and protect resource lands. Upholding these visions is part of the intent of the County\u2019s zoning code and the County\u2019s Subdivision Ordinance, and this development proposal does not do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">... [TJt is clear ... that the proposal is inconsistent with County zoning code, the subdivision ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and State Planning Policy, and that the County Planning Commission should reject the proposal accordingly. To be consistent on all of those counts, the developer would have to reduce the scope and nature of the project, and modify its configuration, so it would legitimately be a small cluster development that would not substantially change the land use and rural character in the area, and would leave the majority of the best soils and woodland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>acreage in a large, contiguous remainder capable of supporting farming or forestry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The following then transpired at the October 16 hearing, in relevant part. Appellant took the position that it was \u201centitled to a cluster development if [it] me[ ]t the criteria for a cluster development,\u201d which, in appellant\u2019s opinion, the proposed subdivision did. Appellant argued that it had changed the design on the development to comply with the MDP\u2019s concerns, including its concern that the agricultural land would not be developed, and that as long as the proposal was in compliance with the \u201ccluster code,\u201d it must be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Appellant\u2019s engineer, Brock Parker, explained that the proposed subdivision was \u201cone contiguous,\u201d albeit \u201clarge,\u201d development. He explained that the 147 lots were to be concentrated on the high, sandy, dry soil on the Property, and that approximately 65%\u2014which far exceeded the 50% requirement\u2014would be set aside for forest conservation. He stated that the soil that would be developed was not as good for timber growing as the set aside soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Appellant also opined that by \u201cpushing ... back\u201d the development to where it could not be seen from the road, the development preserves the \u201crural atmosphere\u201d and comports \u25a0with \u201cthe whole cluster idea.\u201d Appellant argued that there would necessarily be some fragmentation of the forested area, but that the majority of the woodlands were preserved. Appellant argued that 350 acres were being given to the County, and that it would not cost the County any money. The Commission Vice-Chair responded that it would cost the County money because the County would have to upgrade Powell School Road, and \u201cthat could be a big deal.\u201d Moreover, he stated that it would be a \u201cshame\u201d to lose \u201cthis beautiful tract of woods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The Commission Chair brought up the fact that there were two \u201cGreen Infrastructure\u201d hubs on the Property, which hubs \u201cplay a role in preservation of ... ecologically sensitive land,\u201d and that appellant did not know exactly where they were located. Appellant responded that the Property could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>developed without intruding upon the hubs, and that there was \u201cno requirement for any mitigation.\u201d A Commission member responded that perhaps the Commission could not refuse appellant the right to develop because of the hubs on that basis, but that it could refuse appellant the \u201cdensity bonus.\u201d The Commission member also stated that \u201cwe have a moral obligation to, if nothing else, to protect our environmental resources.\u201d Appellant maintained the position that it had \u201ca right to the one in three\u201d density bonus, \u201cif we meet the criteria.\u201d The Commission Chair proposed that the proposal be tabled until \u201csuch time that [appellant] can come back with this information,\u201d regarding the Green Infrastructure hubs, \u201cand any other questions\u201d and concerns from the MDP \u201cthat were left from the sketch plat that have not been answered.\u201d A Commission member stated that he \u201cthink[s] it\u2019s the wrong project in the wrong area for a lot of reasons,\u201d and stated that the proposal \u201cis a poster child for why ... a development shouldn\u2019t occur in a rural area.\u201d He also stated that \u201cit flies in the face of every good land use policy in the County and in the State of Maryland.\u201d Appellant responded that while \u201cthat\u2019s very philosophical ... we\u2019re dealing with a code .... [and] the zoning code is not a matter of philosophy, it\u2019s a matter of what you can do ... and ... what you can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">Also appearing at the hearing was an attorney for Wicomico Environmental Trust, certain adjacent property owners, and Audubon Maryland\u2014DC. He explained that the Audubon Society had done \u201csome serious research over the last year,\u201d and had declared the Property an \u201cIBA, an important bird area.\u201d Counsel put in the record the Audubon Society\u2019s report, which report indicated that the IBA, covering 180,878 acres in the Poeomoke-Nassawango area of the lower Eastern Shore, and encompassing the Property, \u201cis the largest bird area in the state,\u201d and is the \u201cpremier site for 12 at risk bird species.\u201d He continued that of \u201c24 species of ... forest dwelling species on Maryland\u2019s coastal plain, 21 of them are at this site.\u201d Counsel explained that the green infrastructure was meant to protect wildlife species by setting aside a sufficient area to allow the species to flourish. He reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>that \u201cthis is the worst place in the world to have this\u201d development, and would \u201copen up one of the last protected areas\u201d in the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">At the conclusion of the proceedings, a Commission member voted to deny approval, but ultimately the discussion was tabled \u201cto get the green infrastructure information together and to hear from Maryland State Planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">b. <em>November 20, 2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">On November 20, the tabled preliminary plat discussions were resumed. At the November 20 hearing, the following transpired, in relevant part.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Appellant stated that after the October 16 hearing, appellant retained Matt Hedger, an environmental consultant, to evaluate the area. Mr. Hedger testified that he did not observe any endangered or threatened species of birds \u201cwhile [he] was on-site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Appellant also presented the testimony of its land planner and engineer, Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker testified, again, that the proposed subdivision was to be built entirely on the \u201csandiest soils.\u201d He stated that the plan included \u201cadequate stream buffers as required by the code,\u201d and that the nearest lot would be \u201cprobably ... 350 feet away from the road and ... separated by a wooded buffer.\u201d The only entrance into the site would be a \u201cdual lane entrance road,\u201d i.e., \u201ctwo 15-foot wide travel lanes separated by a wooden median.\u201d He explained that the houses in the subdivision would not be seen from the entrance. Mr. Parker testified that the land with the most productive agricultural and timber-growing soil would not be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Mr. Parker testified that the plan included 50-foot wide vegetative stream buffers in the open space, on either side of Davis Branch. He also stated that the entire stream on the Property was within the set-aside, and that the total acreage of the open space comprised 68% of the site. One of the Commission members expressed concern regarding emergency services, stating, \u201c[w]hat\u2019s going to happen if you have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>fairly severe fire at that farthest point? ... [I]f you have a fire back there, it would be a problem. You got just the stream to draft water out.\u201d Mr. Parker responded that \u201cYeah. It\u2019s not much of a stream now....\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">Another Commission member stated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">... a development in this area is probably the worst example I can think of of allowing a subdivision in a rural area.... And as far as providing services to it, I don\u2019t ... think that we probably couldn\u2019t get anywhere further in the county away from schools, away from health care, away from shopping, all the necessary amenities that people normally use to do their business and to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">Again, I know it\u2019s been talked about regulation. I know [appellant] has been very adamant about that, about the green infrastructure ... right now it\u2019s for agricultural production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">And I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say, just because the regulations say that X, X and X, that means that it\u2019s the right thing to do. I, in good conscious [sic], don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right thing to do, and I\u2019m not going to support moving this forward....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">A representative from the MDP explained that the MDP had been \u201ccommenting on this particular subdivision since 2006,\u201d and that it was opposed to the development. The contents of a November 19, 2008 letter from Richard Hall, Secretary of the MDP, was presented. In that letter, Mr. Hall opined that the proposal continued to be inconsistent with the County Plan, with State planning policy, and with the County\u2019s intent for the A-l District. The MDP representative paraphrased Mr. Hall\u2019s letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">This area will not only compromise this particular site, but also state and county investment and rural land and the surrounding area. And as we mentioned before, even Worcester County, which this property borders ... has in their comprehensive plan a designation of green infrastructure bordering this property. So it\u2019s very clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>intent ... was, in Worcester, this would remain a very rural area. And that\u2019s what we believed was also the intent of Wicomico County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">Our greatest concerns are with the apparent inconsistencies between the magnitude of this development, its location and also the design of the development with respect to the goals and attempts of the county plan and county zoning and subdivision regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">MDP isn\u2019t able to provide any rationale that would be convincing that would say that you\u2019re not going to experience adverse impacts in this area as a result of this development ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">We think in particular this development is completely contrary to some of the stated visions ... of the state planning policy, number one\u2014vision one\u2014being that development is being concentrated in suitable areas. Vision two, that sensitive areas are protected. Vision three, that in rural areas, growth is directed to existing population centers and resource areas are protected. And vision seven ... that adequate public facilities and infrastructure under the control of the county are available or planned in areas where growth is to occur, not create the growth and then we\u2019ll pay for the infrastructure to follow it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">Also in Section 225-27 of the code ... this is the purpose section of A-l district. It states that this district is designed to protect agriculture from incompatible residential, commercial, industrial development. Key also, to allow low intensity residential development that ensures natural resource protection and preserves the rural character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">So ... if you can\u2019t use the intended purpose of the zoning ordinance in your consideration, we would ... then argue that .... even though ... there is a significant amount of open space for this development, it\u2019s been provided in this disaggregated manner which would not lend itself to any future use for our agricultural or forestry uses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>And we would offer that the Woodlands At Whiton is not defined as a small cluster development, but rather, it\u2019s three noncontiguous groupings of lots with about a third of those 147 lots designed in a linear fashion that\u2019s more akin to stip style development than it is cluster development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">... [T]he fragmentation of this property by residential enclaves will greatly compromise farm and forest uses for the remainder of the site. The design flaw is counter to the intent of the county plan, the A-l zoning district and the cluster provision of the subdivision regulations. And given the magnitude, location and site considerations, it is not surprising that the proposal lacks the design features and vision for cluster developments in the A-l district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">It is our hope that when you conduct this review that you\u2019ll exercise your discretionary authority to reject this proposal. And furthermore, if it was to be developed, that it be done so at the one per 15 density.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">And that our other recommendation would be that it seems as though there\u2019s no consideration being given between some range between one per 15 and one per three. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to look at a more appropriate design where you are considering length of roadways and lot configuration and the true clustering of lots and maybe come up with ... some other clustering density other than one per three and not try to max out the site necessarily?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Appellant responded that the question is only whether the proposal \u201csatisf[ies] your code, and it does.\u201d The Commission then denied the preliminary plat with findings of fact to be determined \u201cat a later date.\u201d One Commission member opposed the denial, stating that she thought \u201cit meets our current zoning code and our subdivision regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">5. <em>Commission decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">In its \u201cResolution of Decision and Findings of Fact,\u201d the Commission made the following nine findings, all of which are disputed by appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>\u201c1) The Commission is permitted to exercise its discretion in evaluating said Cluster Development criteria, in accordance with the principles and purposes set forth in Section 225-51.\u201d The Commission concluded that the subdivision did not meet the \u201cpurpose\u201d of a cluster development, finding that it \u201ccould more accurately be described as several clusters, rather than a single cluster subdivision,\u201d and that the lot and street arrangement would make future timber harvesting on some of the remaining undeveloped areas difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">\u201c2) The applicant had not adequately demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the proposed number and layout of lots and associated roadway, constitutes a Cluster Development, consistent with the principles, purposes, and criteria outlined in Sections 225-51, 225-52, and 225-27 A.\u201d The Commission found that the proposed layout would require a wider street right-of-way at the entrance, which would result in less efficient use of the land and increased costs. Furthermore, the single entrance onto Powell School Road would be a future hindrance to emergency workers. In addition, because the subdivision could be expected to house school-age children, increased transportation costs could be expected. The Commission also found that the proposal was not a \u201csmall\u201d cluster development within the meaning of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\u201c3) The plat does not address potential endangered species or habitats as identified by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\u201d The Commission found that a number of at-risk bird habitats may exist on the site, and that appellant\u2019s proposed plat did not address the protection of those at-risk species.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\u201c4) The Plat does not represent \u2018innovative and creative cluster design of residential development\u2019, as it is neither innovative nor creative.\u201d The Commission found that the proposed subdivision layout, a \u201clinear arrangement,\u201d did not make maximum use of the \u201climited developable soils,\u201d and that an innovative arrangement, which appellant\u2019s was not, would have grouped lots in \u201ca configuration that utilize[d] minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>forest land and create[d] access to the open space areas on which forest production could continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">\u201c5) The Plat does not represent \u2018efficient use of land and services in order to reduce construction and maintenance costs, reflect changes in technology in land development, and minimize the operating costs of service delivery and utility systems\u2019.\u201d The Commission found that road maintenance, service delivery, and school transportation would need to be provided to this \u201cremote area,\u201d and would create \u201ctraffic conflicts\u201d between residential and agricultural farming operations on a narrow rural roadway. Furthermore, it was not clear whether water would be available to the fire department in the event of a major fire in the subdivision. Additionally, because appellant was proposing \u201cone of the largest subdivision [\u2019s]\u201d in the county\u2019s history in one of the most rural areas of the county, there were no health services, school transportation, police protections, retail providers, food service providers, grocery stores, or general businesses in the area, which would result in additional costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201c6) The Plat does not \u2018preserve agricultural lands and enhance the rural atmosphere and visual character of the County\u2019.\u201d The Commission found that 166 acres of timber land would be converted to residential lots, fragmenting the forested lands, and that even though the nearest homes would be setback from the road, all subdivision traffic would enter and exit onto a narrow, rural road; thus, thus that a \u201csubdivision of this magnitude will not sufficiently preserved forested lands\u201d or the rural character of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\u201c7) The Plat does not assure that \u2018to the greatest extent possible cluster open space shall include the most productive agricultural land\u2019.\u201d The Commission found that as proposed, the subdivision would create further fragmentation of forested land in an especially sensitive area of the County. The Commission also noted that the property was located in an area where \u201cRight&gt;-to-Farm\u201d legislation was applicable, which legislation is intended to protect agricultural activities such as timber harvesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201c8) The Plat does not assure that \u2018to the greatest extent possible cluster open space shall include riparian forest buffers, measured 50\" from streams and watercourse\u2019.\u201d The Commission found that protection of steep slopes, protection of water quality, and protection of potential endangered species had not been guaranteed through site design.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">\u201c9) The Plat ... is not consistent with Local and State plans and policies.\u201d The Commission, citing to the November 19, 2008 letter from the MDP, found that the plat was inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">6. <em>Board decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On appeal, the Board did not conduct an evidentiary hearing or otherwise hear the appeal <em>de novo. See </em>Wicomico County Board of Zoning Appeals Rules of Procedure (January 2002), \u00a7 III. 1-5 (providing for the procedures to be followed for appeals to the Board \u201con the record\u201d); \u00a7 III.5.E (providing that the \u201cappellant shall have the burden of proving that the decision of the administrative agency was not supported by substantial evidence or was in error as a matter of law\u201d); \u00a7 I.l.M (providing that an \u201cappeal on the record\u201d includes an appeal from the Commission \u201cbased on the record created by the [Commission\u2019s] determination\u201d). Rather, and in addition to the testimony and evidence that had been presented to the Commission, as the minutes from the Board hearing indicate, the Board heard arguments from all parties. Pursuant to the minutes, the following transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Appellant argued that the Commission\u2019s findings, 1-9, were erroneous. With respect to (1), appellant argued that if a proposed cluster subdivision satisfies the criteria set forth in Code \u00a7 225-52, then it must be approved. With respect to (2), appellant argued that the Commission improperly \u201cresorted to the principles\u2019 and \u2018purposes\u2019 outlined in sections 225-51-A and 225-27-A to determine whether the ... cluster subdivision satisfies the requirements for approval, rather than focusing on the actual requirements for approval,\u201d as set forth in Code \u00a7 225-52. With respect to (3), appellant argued that the Commission improperly \u201cinsinuated into the zoning and subdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>vision codes a requirement that does not exist,\u201d by using the word \u201cpotentially\u201d as the standard rather than \u201cknown.\u201d With respect to (4), appellant asserted that \u201cinnovative and creative\u201d is not defined in the Code, and the Commission could not resort to the \u201cpurposes\u201d clauses to support its finding in that regard. With respect to (5), appellant argued that the Commission\u2019s findings, again, resorted to a statement of \u201cgeneral purpose,\u201d which the Commission does not have the authority to do. With respect to (6), appellant argued that the \u201creasoning and supporting facts recited for\u201d the finding were \u201cfaulty.\u201d With respect to (7), appellant asserted that the Code only requires that the \u201cRight-to-Farm\u201d law has no significance, and the Code does not require that all of the \u201c \u2018most productive agricultural land\u2019 \u201d must be included in the cluster open space. With respect to (8), appellant asserted that the record established that the condition had been met. With respect to (9), appellant argued that subdivision plat approval is governed by the zoning and subdivision codes, not the Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Appellees responded that the Commission had already \u201csent this applicant away several times,\u201d and that there were \u201cnegative reports dating back to 2005\u201d indicating that the \u201cproject was not favored.\u201d Appellees argued that appellant sought to have the Board believe that \u201cthe sole function of the commission is to process paperwork. When in fact this Commission is given broad discretion to grant requests; nowhere is it mandate[d] that the Commission \u2018must\u2019 approve an application even where all technical or paperwork requirements are met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In its written decision, the Board indicated that it reviewed and considered \u201call written evidence, transcripts of testimony, and both written and oral argument presented at or before the public hearing with regard to this appeal on February 26, 2009,\u201d and concluded that appellant failed to meet its burden of proof \u201c \u2018to show that the decision or ruling complained of was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or unsupported by any substantial evidence\u2019 \u201d; thus, the Board affirmed the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The Board concluded that the Commission\u2019s findings and decision were \u201cproper and best serves the public interest,\u201d and were \u201camply supported by the evidence.\u201d Thus, the Board adopted the Commission\u2019s findings, numbers one through nine above, in their entirety. The Board also rejected appellant\u2019s arguments with respect to the Commission\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of Sections 225-51 and 225-52\u201d of the Code, finding that the Commission had property applied those sections. The Board further rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Clarke v. County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County, </em>270 Md. 343, 311 A.2d 417 (1973), would direct that the criteria set forth in Code \u00a7 225-51, i.e., the \u201cpurpose provision,\u201d should not have been considered by the Commission in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">7. <em>Circuit court decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The circuit court affirmed the Board, noting that the issue was one of statutory interpretation, i.e., whether the Commission and, by extension, the Board, could lawfully consider \u00a7\u00a7 225-27 A and 225.51 A when deciding whether to approve an A-l cluster development under the Code. The court opined that the Commission (and the Board) could consider the purpose provisions in reaching its conclusion, and the \u201cmere fact that a residential cluster subdivision is an inherently permitted use in an A-l Agricultural-Rural zoning district does not preclude\u201d such an inquiry. The court likewise concluded that <em>Clarke </em>was inapposite and not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Appellant\u2019s arguments on this appeal are much the same as set forth above. Appellant argues that because an A-l \u201ccluster subdivision\u201d is a permitted use pursuant to the \u201cunambiguous criteria\u201d set forth in Code \u00a7 225-52, the Commission did not have the authority to deny an application for such use, especially by relying on the \u201cpurpose provisions\u201d of \u00a7\u00a7 225-27 A and 225-51 A. Appellant then asserts that, in any event, the Commission\u2019s findings were unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The County counters that the proposed subdivision did not meet the criteria for a cluster development, that the Commission was permitted to exercise its discretion in evaluating the proposal, and that the Commission had the authority to consider the \u201cpurpose provisions,\u201d because they are not preambles, but rather are part of the \u201cstatutes themselves.\u201d The County further asserts, obviously, that the decisions of both the Commission and the Board were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The remaining appellees respond that both the Code and the Comprehensive Plan empower the Commission to \u201cdetermine appropriate densities in the County\u2019s Agriculture-Rural Districts within the parameters laid down by the Code,\u201d and that contrary to appellant\u2019s contentions, there is no \u201c \u2018inherent permission\u2019 for a developer to claim the \u2018density bonus.\u2019 \u201d Appellees contend that the language of Code \u00a7 225-52, on which appellant relies, is permissive, not mandatory, that appellant bore the burden of persuasion before the Commission, and that the Commission has discretion to grant or deny subdivision approval. Appellees continue that the \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cpurposes\u201d of the Code are not meaningless legislative standards, but rather provide the basis for consideration of all zoning forms of action, as noted in Code \u00a7 225-3 E, and that neither the intent nor purpose sections of the Code conflicted with any other provisions in the Code. Appellees also assert that any one of the Commission\u2019s finding of fact could have served as a basis for its denial of appellant\u2019s application, and that the findings of fact were supported by ample evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Preliminarily, we observe that appellant proposes that we should review the decision of the Commission because the Board did not review the Commission\u2019s decision <em>de novo. </em>First, it is correct that the Board operated under a deferential standard of review, effectively a substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 200-24 D, which provides that at the Board level, a final subdivision decision of the Commission \u201cshall be presumed by the Board of Appeals to be proper and to best serve the public interest. The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant or appellants to show that the decision was arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>trary, capricious, discriminatory or unsupported by any substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 III of the Board\u2019s Rules of Procedure, <em>supra. </em>Nevertheless, we review the final administrative decision, in this case, the Board\u2019s, on the record as it existed before the Board. <em>See Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994), and <em>Hikmat v. Howard Co., </em>148 Md.App. 502, 813 A.2d 306 (2002) (in which case we reviewed the Board\u2019s decision which itself conducted a limited review of the underlying decision by the zoning administrator). Thus, the Board\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s decision was limited in nature, and our review is of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Judicial review of an administrative decision \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and ... determining] if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>See Lanzaron v. Anne Arundel County, </em>402 Md. 140, 147, 935 A.2d 689 (2007) (and cases cited therein). In doing so, we bypass the judgment of the circuit court and look directly at the administrative decision. <em>White v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n, </em>161 Md.App. 483, 487, 870 A.2d 1241 (2005); <em>see, e.g., Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495-96, 769 A.2d 912 (2001) (On appeal, \u201cwe reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court.\u201d). \u201cOrdinarily, we are constrained to affirm the agency decision only for the reasons given by the agency\u2014\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The scope of judicial review of administrative fact-finding is a narrow and highly deferential one. <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Loyola College in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166 (2008). Accordingly, we will affirm a decision on the facts if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 67, 956 A.2d 166. An agency\u2019s fact-finding is based on substantial evidence if \u201csupported by such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007) (quoting <em>Mayor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 398, 396 A.2d 1080 (1979)). If the issues before the agency were \u201cfairly debatable\u201d based on record evidence, we must refrain from substituting our own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. at 396, 396 A.2d 1080. When \u201ca pure question of law is involved, we may substitute our judgment for that of the administrative agency,\u201d <em>White, </em>161 Md.App. at 487, 870 A.2d 1241; nevertheless, we afford some weight to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the laws it is charged with administering, <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 682-83, 929 A.2d 899, and we must review the agency\u2019s decision in a light most favorable to it. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">We note that, unlike several of our recent land use decisions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the issue before us is not whether an agency, in granting an application for land use/development, erred because the requested activity was inconsistent with a land use plan. The issue arises out of the non-approval of a proposed subdivision in the A-l district. Appellant sought approval of a preliminary plat, to develop a cluster, presumably pursuant to Code \u00a7 200-7. The request was denied on the ground that it did not meet the terms of the Comprehensive Plan and the standards, including statement of purpose, in Code \u00a7\u00a7 225-27 A, 225-51, and 225-52. As set forth above, the first section pertains to the A-l district, and the latter two govern cluster developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In essence, set forth more comprehensively above, appellant argues that the proposed use is a permitted use in the A-l district, and that the plat complied with the specific statutory standards. Appellant argues it was entitled to approval, therefore, and the Board could not deny approval on the ground that the plat did not meet the purposes of the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>nances or the Plan. Appellant also argues the evidence was legally insufficient. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">First, we observe that the Board\u2019s findings, as adopted from the Commission\u2019s findings, go beyond just the purposes provisions of the Code and of the Comprehensive Plan. They relate, <em>e.g., </em>to \u00a7 <em>225-52 </em>E. (\u201c[t]o the greatest extent possible, cluster open space shall include ... (b) Known habitats of threatened and endangered species; (c) The most productive agriculture land; (d) Steep slopes; ... and (f) Riparian forest buffers.... \u201d). In any event, the Board was entitled to consider the purposes of the ordinances and the Comprehensive Plan as part of its analysis. The decision in <em>Clarke, supra, </em>relied on by appellant is not to the contrary. In that case, an unnumbered preamble to an ordinance stated the purpose of agriculture district in question was to provide for continued farming activity. Opponents of a proposed subdivision of single family homes argued that the subdivision was barred by that language. The body of the ordinance provided that single family dwellings were permitted in the district and land use was not limited to agriculture. The Court held that the body of the ordinance controlled and dwellings were a permitted use. 270 Md. at 349, 311 A.2d 417. In the case before us, as appellees assert, the purpose sections are part of the ordinances themselves, not a preamble to an ordinance, and there is no asserted internal inconsistency. In other words, the Board did not take the position that cluster developments are not a permitted use.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Relying primarily on <em>West Montgomery County Citizens Association v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission, </em>309 Md. 183, 522 A.2d 1328 (1987), and <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 376 A.2d 483 (1977), appellant argues that the Board exceeded its authority as an administrative body and acted legislatively when it relied on purposes and plans. Those cases are distinguishable. First, a legislative body can delegate the implementation of legislative policy to an administrative body, when the latter operates under specific guidelines. <em>West Montgomery, </em>309 Md. at 199, 522 A.2d 1328. This includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>delegation to an agency administering subdivision regulations when the maximum density is first set by the legislative body. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 522 A.2d 1328. In <em>West Montgomery, </em>the legislative body attempted to delegate to the planning body the authority to classify specific properties within the zone in question and to determine densities. The legislative body did not specify maximum densities. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 522 A.2d 1328. That is not the situation before us. The Board was given considerable latitude in determining the design of a cluster development consistent with the maximum density permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>the validity of a sectional map amendment was in question. There was an argument that the legislative body illegally delegated to the planning body the zoning power to determine density in newly created zones. 280 Md. at 716, 376 A.2d 483. The Court upheld the legislative action, stating that the legislative body had determined maximum allowable densities and could, subject to procedural requirements and site plan review, delegate to the planning body the right to determine the actual density for a specific property up the maximum permitted. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 376 A.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Importantly, in the case before us, in the context of approving subdivisions, the Commission and the Board were dealing with a specific design of a proposed subdivision. The language of the Code, emphasized above, is permissive, not mandatory, as appellant contends, While residential use is a permitted use, and a cluster form of development is permitted under certain circumstances, the design of a specific subdivision, including its location and density, is subject to approval. The Board did not deny the plat on the ground that cluster developments were not a permitted use, or that cluster developments generally were inconsistent with the purposes of the applicable ordinance, but rather on the ground that this particular subdivision, as designed, was inconsistent with the purposes. The density permitted in Code \u00a7 225-75 generally, and in cluster developments specifically, is the maximum permitted. The maximum density is not available as of right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Many of the findings made by the Board related to density and location (e.g., lack of roads and services).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">It is settled that an agency may deny approval of a proposed subdivision, even if it meets zoning requirements, when it does not comply with an applicable plan and the relevant jurisdiction requires compliance with the plan. <em>See Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Washington Business Park Associates, </em>294 Md. 302, 449 A.2d 414 (1982); <em>Coffey v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, </em>293 Md. 24, 441 A.2d 1041 (1982); and <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Gaster, </em>285 Md. 233, 401 A.2d 666 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Almost all of the Board\u2019s findings related to the size, location and design of the specific subdivision (e.g., findings related to size, street arrangement, entrances, linear arrangement, forest buffers, and slopes). Appellant\u2019s argument is that the Board could not consider and rely on legislative expressions of general purposes and general planning goals, regardless of whether legally binding, as distinguished from specific requirements. Our reading is that the Board considered the purposes of the applicable ordinances and consistency with the relevant Plan provisions in interpreting and applying the cluster development ordinances in their entirety. It had the power to do so as long as it did not violate specific legislative requirements. An agency\u2019s denial shall not be arbitrary, but here, there was substantial evidence to support the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. Appellant presents the questions as:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">I. May the Planning Commission apply nebulous vision and general purpose provisions to deny approval of a subdivision that meets the unambiguous statutory criteria for that inherently permitted use?</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">II.
