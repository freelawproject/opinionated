Piscatelli, appellant, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellees, Van Smith, a reporter for City Paper, and CEGW, Inc., the owner of City Paper. The complaint alleged one count of defamation and one count of invasion of privacy/false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>light. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted on February 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Piscatelli appeals the grant of that motion and presents the following question for review, which we have reworded:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment on the basis that there no were material facts in dispute? We answer the question in the negative and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">On or about April 11, 2003, Jason Convertino, a manager of Redwood Trust, a Baltimore nightclub, and a friend, Sean Wisniewski, were murdered at Convertino\u2019s home in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore. Piscatelli was a co-owner of the nightclub.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">After a police investigation, Anthony Jerome Miller, a former security guard at Redwood Trust, was charged with both murders. While the case against him was pending in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, on October 27, 2006, the State filed a supplemental discovery disclosure statement pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-263, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">1. Pam Morgan [Convertino\u2019s mother] has stated that an unknown man approached her at a benefit in Binghamton, New York held for her son\u2019s child shortly after his murder. The man advised her that Nick Piscatelli was behind her son\u2019s murder, he covered his tracks &amp; hired someone to Ml him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">2. Ms. Morgan advised that Van Smith, reporter for City Paper, told her someone told him that he had heard Nick threaten to kill Jason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Piscatelli was a witness at Miller\u2019s trial and was examined by defense counsel as to his own possible motives for murdering Convertino, namely, that Piscatelli suspected Convertino of stealing money from the club and that Convertino was planning to leave the Redwood Trust to work for a competitor. On March 15, 2007, Miller was convicted of both murders and sentenced to two consecutive thirty year prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Smith wrote a series of articles in City Paper regarding the murders, the police investigation and Miller\u2019s trial. Piscatelli alleges that two of the articles, one published on December 6, 2006 and one on June 20, 2007, republished false and defamatory accusations that Piscatelli had been involved in the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The December 6, 2006 article, headlined \u201cLate Discovery, A New Twist in the Redwood Trust Double-Murder Case\u201d (hereinafter \u201cthe December article\u201d), quoted Smith\u2019s interview with Piscatelli, in which he denied any involvement in the murders. It also included the following relating to Smith\u2019s interview of Ms. Morgan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">On Oct. 27, [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Sharon][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Holback disclosed in a memorandum to the defense that \u201cPam Morgan [Convertino\u2019s mother] has stated that an unknown man approached her at a benefit in Binghamton, New York, held for her son\u2019s child shortly after his murder. The man advised her that Nick Piscatelli was behind her son\u2019s murder, he covered his tracks and hired someone to kill him.\u201d The memo does not indicate when Morgan shared this information with investigators, but she told <em>City Paper </em>during a Nov. 30 phone interview that the event was held in May 2003, just weeks after the murders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cAt the benefit, this guy comes up to me and he says he knows who is behind my son\u2019s murder\u201d Morgan recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Nick [Piscatelli] at that point.\u201d Since then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>though, Morgan says she has kept in regular, friendly phone contact with Piscatelli.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cOh, boy! She said that?\u201d Piscatelli says when informed of Morgan\u2019s statement about the man\u2019s visit to the Bingham-ton gathering. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. I\u2019ve spoken to her several times, and she\u2019s never mentioned anything like that to me. That\u2019s certainly sad to hear. There has been no animosity between us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Over the phone from her home outside of Binghamton, Morgan describes the man who dropped Piscatelli\u2019s name at the benefit as white, in his 80s [sic], several inches shy of 6 feet, with \u201clightish, hair\u201d of \u201cmedium build,\u201d and \u201cwearing a long coat, like a trenchcoat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">He came in, talked, and left,\u201d she continues. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa!\u2019 And that\u2019s when I first started questioning the club, and had these theories [that Piscatelli might be involved]. And I also thought, did [the unknown man] do it purposefully, to throw it off someone else by naming Nick? Because there is no evidence against Nick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">Still, she says she\u2019s fearful of Piscatelli, and now that her suspicions have been made public in Miller\u2019s case file she says she will stop calling him. \u201cThat was my last call to him, probably in September,\u201d Morgan recalls, when she says she discussed with Piscatelli items still in his possession that belonged to her son. (The memo also discloses that Morgan told investigators that this reporter shared with her information about Piscatelli obtained through unnamed sources).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">After Miller was convicted of Convertino and Wisniewski\u2019s murders, Smith wrote another article on June 20, 2007, entitled \u201cThe Lonely Killer, Anthony Jerome Miller got Sixty (60) Years for a Double Murder, But Questions Still Remain Over Whether or Not He Acted Alone\u201d (hereinafter the \u201cJune article\u201d). The June article read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">For a long time, Pam Morgan suspected that Nick Pisca-telli had something to do with her son\u2019s death. Her radar went up early on, when she met with detective Blane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Vucci\u2014the first lead investigator on the case\u2014on her first visit to Baltimore, right after the murders in 2003. Morgan had thought of Piscatelli as nothing more than her son\u2019s employer prior to the murders. But she recalls that when she told Vucci that she thought that the murders must have something to do with Redwood Trust, \u201cbecause if Jay knew anybody, it would have been through the business,\u201d Vucci\u2019s heated reaction surprised her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cHe informed me that Nick did everything for my son, yelling at me,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cHe told me there was no evidence, that the case would never be solved, and made it seem like somehow Jay did something wrong. And I left feeling hopeless.\u201d (Attempts to reach Vucci for comment were unsuccessful.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Morgan went back to upstate New York, and began to investigate the case on her own. She went through her son\u2019s records that she had, calling any contacts she could find, and tried to share any information she developed with the Baltimore Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">One of the things she shared with the police had to do with Piscatelli. About a month after the killings, in May 2003, a benefit was held near Binghamton to raise money for Convertino\u2019s young daughter. About 500 people showed up, and while it was going on, Morgan says she was approached by a man she\u2019d never seen before and hasn\u2019t seen since. \u201cHe said that Nick Piscatelli was behind my son\u2019s murder,\u201d Morgan recalls, \u201cthat [Piscatelli had] hired someone to do it, and that he\u2019d covered his tracks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Since then, Morgan had kept Piscatelli close. She says she maintained a phone relationship with him, never letting on that she suspected his involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">Morgan was not present when Piscatelli testified at Miller\u2019s trial\u2014it was the first and only day of the trial she missed. Now that Miller\u2019s been convicted, she says she feels less certain about her suspicions than ever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cIf I knew Nick actually did it, if I actually had the proof\u2019 that he was somehow involved in Convertino\u2019s death, Morgan says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done differently. As long as I still had a doubt and could speak to this man, I did so. So many other things are surfacing, and sometimes we are led to believe one thing when it is the opposite. Now, I have doubts that Nick is responsible. Before, I could go either way on this whole thing. But right now, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">Don\u2019t forget, she continues, \u201c[the police] told me they felt two people were involved. And of course, I\u2019m thinking, <em>Well somebody came [to the benefit] and told me that. </em>Was he <em>the second person? </em>Now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">Or it might have been Miller, acting alone, killing two people simply to get a credit card and a laptop in order to pay for his honeymoon. If so, barring a successful appeal, Miller will be paying for that honeymoon for a long time to come.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Piscatelli filed a complaint against appellees, alleging that the December Article and the June Article were defamatory, invaded his privacy and cast him in a false light by suggesting that he was involved in the two murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the articles were not defamatory, that they did not misstate facts and that the articles were wholly privileged. Piscatelli filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The arguments advanced by the parties in support of, and in opposition to, the motion were essentially the same as those presented to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">A hearing on the motion and Piscatelli\u2019s opposition thereto was held on January 26, 2009. On February 17, 2009, the circuit court issued an order granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint. Piscatelli filed a timely appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Additional facts will be discussed as necessary in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Appellate courts review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Chesek v. Jones, </em>406 Md. 446, 458, 959 A.2d 795 (2008); <em>Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 163, 913 A.2d 10 (2006). When there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the entry of summary judgment is appropriate. Md. Rule 2\u2014501(f); <em>Pines Point Marina v. Rehak, </em>406 Md. 613, 618, 961 A.2d 574 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Our first step is to determine whether there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact. <em>Harford County v. Saks Fifth Ave. Distribution Co., </em>399 Md. 73, 82, 923 A.2d 1 (2007); <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 66, 899 A.2d 819 (2006). An issue of fact is material if its resolution will affect the outcome of the case in some way. <em>Riley, </em>393 Md. at 67, 899 A.2d 819; <em>Robb v. Wancowicz, </em>119 Md.App. 531, 536, 705 A.2d 125 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">If we find that there is a genuine dispute of a material fact, then we must reverse the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. If we find that there is no genuine dispute of a material fact, we must then determine whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520 (2006). Finally, in a defamation case such as this, we weigh the parties\u2019 contentions after making our own independent evaluation of the record in order to assure that a potential judgment against appellees would not infringe upon their right of free expression protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article Forty of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Chesapeake Publishing v. Williams, </em>339 Md. 285, 299, 661 A.2d 1169 (1995); <em>see Peroutka v. Streng, </em>116 Md.App. 301, 308, 695 A.2d 1287 (1997) (Article Forty is to be treated <em>in pari materia </em>with the First Amendment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">In the instant case, the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment stated \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>material fact and that [appellees] are entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d without further providing a basis for its reasoning. \u201cIn the absence of [a discussion of the trial court\u2019s reasoning as to why summary judgment was proper], we must assume that the circuit court carefully considered all of the asserted grounds and determined that all or at least enough of them as to merit the grant of summary judgment were meritorious.\u201d <em>Ross v. Am. Iron Works, </em>153 Md.App. 1, 10, 834 A.2d 962 (2003). Under such circumstances, we can affirm the court\u2019s judgment if the record indicates that the circuit court did not err. <em>Smigelski v. Potomac Insurance Co., </em>403 Md. 55, 61, 939 A.2d 189 (2008); <em>Phillips v. Allstate Indem. Co., </em>156 Md.App. 729, 740, 848 A.2d 681 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In order to place the parties\u2019 contentions in context, we will briefly review the most pertinent parts of Maryland\u2019s law of defamation. We begin with the elements of the cause of action. As Judge Andre Davis explained, in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A45\">[I]n order to make out a prima facie case of defamation the plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant made a defamatory communication, i.e., that he communicated a statement tending to expose the plaintiff to public scorn, hatred, contempt, or ridicule to a third person who reasonably recognized the statement to be defamatory; (2) that the statement was false; (3) that the defendant was at fault in communicating the statement; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Agora, Inc. v. Axxess, Inc., </em>90 F.Supp.2d 697, 701 (D.Md.2000) (citing <em>Peroutka, </em>116 Md.App. at 311, 695 A.2d 1287 and <em>Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 772, 661 A.2d 202, (1995)). In the context of defamation, a statement is false only when it is \u201c \u2018not substantially correct\u2019 \u201d <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 726, 602 A.2d 1191 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Moreover, a statement, \u201ceven if expressed in terms of an opinion, can be defamatory under certain circumstances regardless of whether the statement concerns a public figure or private person.\u201d <em>Agora, </em>90 F.Supp.2d at 701 (quoting <em>Peroutka, </em>116 Md.App. at 321, 695 A.2d 1287). The determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>nation whether a statement is defamatory is one of law and is to be made by the court. <em>Chesapeake Publishing v. Williams, </em>339 Md. 285, 295, 661 A.2d 1169 (1995). Piscatelli also asserts a claim for invasion of privacy/false light. However, such a claim \u201cmay not stand unless the claim also meets the standards of defamation.\u201d <em>Crowley v. Fox Broadcasting Co., </em>851 F.Supp. 700, 704 (D.Md.1994) (applying Maryland law).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">There are three defenses that, if applicable, bar recovery. The first is the qualified privilege to report upon judicial proceedings. <em>Chesapeake Publishing, </em>339 Md. at 296, 661 A.2d 1169 (\u201cIn Maryland, there exists a qualified privilege to report on legal proceedings, even if the story contains defamatory material, as long as the account is fair and substantially accurate.\u201d) This privilege is qualified and can be overcome upon a showing of actual malice. <em>Id. </em>There are two not necessarily inconsistent approaches to the meaning of \u201cmalice\u201d in this context. The first is drawn from the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark opinion in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Under this analysis, the privilege is not applicable if the reporter knew that the republished statements were false or acted with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity. <em>Rosenberg v. Helinski, </em>328 Md. 664, 677-78, 616 A.2d 866 (1992); <em>Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 134-35, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978). The second approach, based upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611, Comment a (1977), focuses upon the fairness and accuracy of the report. Under this approach, the privilege is applicable as long as the report is \u201c \u2018accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosenberg, </em>328 Md. at 678, 616 A.2d 866 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611). Maryland favors the latter approach. <em>See, e.g., Chesapeake Publishing, </em>339 Md. at 296-97, 302 n. 5, 661 A.2d 1169; <em>Rosenberg, </em>328 Md. at 678, 616 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The second defense is the fair comment privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">It is recognized that a newspaper like any member of the community may, without liability, honestly express a fair and reasonable opinion or comment on matters of legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>public interest. The reason given is that such discussion is in the furtherance of an interest of social importance, and therefore it is held entitled to protection even at the expense of uncompensated harm to the plaintiffs reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">The distinction between \u201cfact\u201d and \u201copinion,\u201d although theoretically and logically hard to draw, is usually reasonably determinable as a practical matter: Would an ordinary person, reading the matter complained of, be likely to understand it as an expression of the writer\u2019s opinion or as a declaration of an existing fact? An opinion may be so stated as to raise directly the inference of a factual basis, and the defense of fair comment usually has been held not to cover an opinion so stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>A.S. Abell Co. v. Kirby, </em>227 Md. 267, 272, 274, 176 A.2d 340 (1961) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The third defense at least arguably in play in the case is that a person is entitled to express an opinion without liability if \u201cthe facts from which a defendant forms his or her opinion are given or are readily available and those facts cannot be proved false....\u201d <em>Peroutka, </em>116 Md.App. at 320, 695 A.2d 1287. Elaborating on this principle, Judge Cathell identified four possible variations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201c(1) If the defendant bases his expression of a derogatory opinion of the plaintiff on his own statement of false and defamatory facts, he is subject to liability for the factual statement but not for the expression of opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(2) If the defendant bases his expression of a derogatory opinion of the plaintiff on his own statement of facts that are not defamatory, he is not subject to liability for the factual statement\u2014nor for the expression of opinion, so long as it does not reasonably indicate an assertion of the existence of other, defamatory, facts that would justify the forming of the opinion. The same result is reached if the statement of facts is defamatory but the facts are true ... or if the defendant is not shown to be guilty of the requisite fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>regarding the truth or defamatory character of the statement of facts....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">(3) If the defendant bases his expression of a derogatory opinion on the existence of \u2018facts\u2019 that he does not state but that are assumed to be true by both parties to the communication, and if the communication does not give rise to the reasonable inference that it is also based on other facts that are defamatory, he is not subject to liability, whether the assumed facts are defamatory or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">(4) If the defendant expresses a derogatory opinion without disclosing the facts on which it is based, he is subject to liability if the comment creates the reasonable inference that the opinion is justified by the existence of unexpressed defamatory facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 Comment c (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">During discovery, Piscatelli was asked to identify the specific portions in each of the articles that was defamatory. He did so and we will discuss each passage later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">With this as background, Piscatelli asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Had the City Paper merely reported in the December 6, 2006 article that the court file indicated that Piscatelli was implicated by an unknown person as reported by Pam Morgan and Van Smith[,] then ... the fair reporting privilege survives. Had the City Paper in the June 20, 2007 article reported on the testimony of Piscatelli and the argument of defense counsel in attempting to create reasonable doubt that Piscatelli had a motive to kill Jason Conver-tino and fairly and accurately reported that other promoters were implicated as potentially having a motive to kill Jason Convertino and fully reported that the jury did not accept these arguments and found Anthony Jerome Miller guilty of the murders, than [sic] the fair reporting privilege would\u2019ve applied. Contrary to fully, fairly and accurately reporting on the criminal trial, the City Paper has first injected itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>into the controversy by Van Smith disclosing that someone told him that the other person heard Piscatelli threatened to kill Jason Convertino. Moreover, in the June 20, 2007 article the City Paper headline and the entire tenor of the article is that the police and the State\u2019s Attorney were incorrect in assuming that ... Miller acted alone and that based upon the unsubstantiated hearsay from an unknown source contained in discovery material that was never introduced at trial that Piscatelli had hired someone to kill Jason Convertino. By placing its own theory on the case that someone other than [Miller] was involved in the murder is defamatory and at least raises a factual question to be determined by a jury and not on summary judgment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Piscatelli\u2019s contention has merit only if one or more of the relevant passages in the newspaper articles were defamatory. If this condition is satisfied, he can recover only if appellees are not protected by one or more of the defenses described above. In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion for summary judgment, we interpret the facts in a light most favorable to Piscatelli. Nonetheless, he is still required to \u201cidentify with particularity each material fact as to which it is contended that there is a material dispute.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-501(b). We now turn to the specific passages in the articles that Piscatelli asserts were defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We start our analysis by noting that the murders of Conver-tino and Wisniewski and Miller\u2019s trial for those murders are matters of public interest and concern. Additionally, we point out that Piscatelli, in his deposition, admitted that the complained-of statements do not contain falsities. That is to say, while he challenges the underlying truths of the statements, he does not dispute that the statements are accurate representations of what occurred at trial and what individuals told Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Our review of the statements in the articles identified by Piscatelli as defamatory leads us to conclude that they are all covered by either the fair reporting or fair comment privileges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>or are opinions and, thus, are not bases for liability. We will now address each allegedly defamatory passage separately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">1. \u201cBut, despite Miller\u2019s conviction, the Redwood Trust double murders remain mysterious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">This statement contains an assertion of fact, namely that Miller was convicted, which is unquestionably true. It also contains an expression of opinion, i.e., that the murders remain mysterious. The expression of that opinion is privileged because it \u201chonestly expresses] a fair and reasonable opinion or comment on matters of legitimate public interest.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>227 Md. at 270, 176 A.2d 340.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">2. \u201cMorgan recalls that, right after the murders in 2003, she was led to believe by the initial homicide investigators that the killings were done by more than one person. \u2018From day one, they all seemed to give me the inkling that the crime scene led to at least two people being in the apartment,\u2019 she says. T never was told any facts about how they got that. I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s all they\u2019ve all led me to believe\u2014that, and that there was no evidence, and that they didn\u2019t think the case would ever be solved. Up until, of course, Detective Ritz took over.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">The idea that more than one person was involved in her son\u2019s death has stuck with Morgan. Even though Miller is now serving time, she says, T don\u2019t know if [the truth] will come out\u2019 about the full circumstances surrounding the crime. T hope it does, because this is the hardest thing\u2014to live without knowing if Miller was alone, or if someone else really was the cause of Miller doing this. I really want to know the whole truth, no matter who it comes from or whatever they discover. Once I know the whole truth, I think then I\u2019ll be OK for whatever life I have left.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The excerpt reflects the opinions of Morgan because \u201can ordinary person, reading the matter complained of, [would] be likely to understand it as an expression of [opinion]\u201d and the factual basis for those opinions are readily ascertainable from the same quotation. <em>Kirby, </em>227 Md. at 272, 274, 176 A.2d 340.

T hope the investigators won\u2019t be satisfied with this,\u2019 he said of his brother\u2019s conviction. \u2018These murders were a conspiracy,\u2019 he continues, \u2018Anthony might have known something about it, but sometimes people feel they have to keep their mouth shut.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The above-quoted text is clearly an expression of an opinion about the evidence adduced at Miller\u2019s trial.

Convertino was hired to manage Redwood Trust by Nicholas Piscatelli, a successful Baltimore real-estate developer. Piscatelli meticulously restored a historic downtown bank building that had survived the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 to house his posh nightclub. Convertino, witnesses testified at Miller\u2019s trial, was planning to take his proven skills as a scene-maker to one of Redwood Trust\u2019s competitors, Bohager\u2019s Bar and Grill, when the murders happened. More specifically, Convertino was scheming to take a P. Diddy event that was scheduled to happen at Redwood Trust on April 13, 2003, to Bohager\u2019s instead; after the murders, on April 11, P. Diddy appeared at Redwood Trust, as originally planned. What\u2019s more, Pisca-telli suspected Convertino of stealing not just shows, but money from Redwood Trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Piscatelli does not dispute the accuracy of the statements of fact. His issue with this excerpt is its suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>that he had a motive to murder Convertino. Smith\u2019s comment that Piscatelli may have had a motive is fair in light of the information directly following it: that Convertino was planning to take business away from appellant\u2019s nightclub and that appellant suspected Convertino of stealing from him. The above-quoted text is covered by the fair comment privilege. <em>Kirby, </em>227 Md. at 272, 274, 176 A.2d 340.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">5. \u201cPolansky <em>[Miller\u2019s trial attorney] </em>had made his point: Convertino\u2019s skills as a nightlife manager and promoter were valuable to Redwood Trust. If Convertino went to work for a rival\u2014Bohager\u2019s, as he was about to do\u2014 Redwood Trust would be competing against him in the nightlife market. It might not seem like a suitable motive for murder, but neither does the theft of a credit card and a laptop.

Her radar went up early on, when she met with detective Blane Vucci\u2014the first lead investigator on the case\u2014on her first visit to Baltimore, right after the murders in 2003. Morgan had thought of Piscatelli as nothing more than her son\u2019s employer prior to the murders. But she recalls that when she told Vucci that she thought that the murders must have something to do with Redwood Trust, \u2018because if Jay new anybody, it would have been through the business,\u2019 Vucci\u2019s heated reaction surprised her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The above-quoted passage is Morgan\u2019s description of how she came to suspect appellant was involved in her son\u2019s murder, a matter of public concern.

About a month after the killings, in May 2003, a benefit was held near Binghamton to raise money for Convertino\u2019s young daughter. About 500 people showed up, and while it was going on, Morgan says she was approached by a man she\u2019d never seen before and hasn\u2019t seen since. \u2018He said that Nick Piscatelli was behind my son\u2019s murder,\u2019 Morgan recalls, \u2018that [Piscatelli had] hired someone to do it, and that he\u2019d covered his tracks.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">Since then, Morgan had kept Piscatelli close.
