For almost eight years, the parties, as well as their predecessors in title and some of their neighbors, have been engaged in litigation as to various matters regarding the adjoining parcels. In 2007 and 2008, the Circuit Court for Howard County ordered the parties to submit their disputes to binding arbitration. Of relevance here, in an Arbitration Award (the \u201cAward\u201d) dated December 22, 2008 (issued January 6, 2009), the arbitrator rejected appellant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to an easement over a portion of appellees\u2019 land in order to reach a public road. That decision left appellant\u2019s parcel \u201clandlocked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Dissatisfied with the Award, appellant unsuccessfully asked the Circuit Court for Howard County to vacate it. This appeal followed, in which appellant presents one issue: \u201cWhether the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>arbitrator\u2019s decision and award[.]\u201d For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The properties at issue are two adjacent, irregularly shaped lots in Woodbine, along the South Branch of the Patapsco River at the northern border of Howard County. \u25a0 Appellant\u2019s property is located at 400 Morgan Station Road. We shall refer to it as \u201cLot 2\u201d or the \u201cSharp Lot.\u201d Appellees\u2019 property is located at 410 Morgan Station Road. We shall refer to it as \u201cLot 1\u201d or the \u201cDowney Lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Originally, the two lots were a single tract of land owned by Jack Ryan, Inc., the corporate alter ego of John E. Ryan (collectively, \u201cRyan\u201d). On February 20, 1996, Ryan divided the tract by deed, creating Lot 1 and Lot 2. By a separate deed of even date, Ryan conveyed Lot 1 <em>(i.e., </em>the Downey Lot) to Pamela Jekel, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and retained ownership of Lot 2 (ie., the Sharp Lot). Notably, the Downey Lot adjoins Morgan Station Road, while the Sharp Lot is (in the words of the arbitrator) \u201clandlocked.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>On the same date as the conveyance of Lot 1, Ryan and Jekel executed two instruments relating to two separate easements concerning Lot 1 and Lot 2. One instrument, entitled \u201cDeclaration for Ingress and Egress Easement (Driveway) and Maintenance Agreement,\u201d established an easement \u201cover the existing jeep trail located on Lot 1\u201d (ie., the Downey Lot). We shall refer to this agreement as the \u201cOriginal Jeep Trail Agreement.\u201d The other easement instrument, entitled \u201cDeclaration for Easement and Maintenance Agreement,\u201d is referred to by the parties as the \u201cRiverfront Easement.\u201d All four instruments were recorded in the land records of Howard County on February 27, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">According to the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, \u201c[t]he Easement shall be for the sole purpose of ingress and egress for foot and vehicular traffic and for no other purpose.\u201d It noted that the jeep trail \u201cis not described in a metes and bounds description,\u201d but stated that the jeep trail was \u201cshown on an unrecorded plat titled, \u2018Health Department Percolation Certification Plan, Project No. 423\u2019 \u201d (the \u201cHealth Department Plan\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Original Jeep Trail Agreement also provided: \u201cThe beginning of the Easement at Morgan Station Road is at the driveway which is used in common with 430 Morgan Station Road and [the easement] ends at the northeast boundary of Lot 2.\u201d Further, it stated that the easement was \u201cperpetual\u201d and \u201cbinding on the parties [and their] successors and assigns.\u201d It also provided that, \u201c[i]n the event of disagreement between the owners of Lots 1 and 2 as to the use, repairs, maintenance of the Easement, or any other issue, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the American Arbitration Association rules and procedures.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The Riverfront Easement granted to Jekel (and her successors in title) an easement over a narrow strip of riverfront property that was part of Lot 2, and which separated Lot 1 from the Patapsco River. In relevant part, it stated that \u201cRyan \u25a0will not in anyway interfere with Jekel\u2019s use of the easement such as moving animals to the river or any other purpose.\u201d The primary significance of the Riverfront Easement to the issues on appeal is that, as we shall explain, the arbitrator ultimately found that the jeep trail referenced in the Original Jeep Trail Agreement cut into, and then out of, the Riverfront Easement area as the jeep trail made its way between Lot 2 and Morgan Station Road.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A little over a year after the conveyance of Lot 1, Ryan and Jekel executed and recorded another easement agreement (the \u201cSecond Jeep Trail Agreement\u201d), which, like the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, was titled \u201cDeclaration for Ingress and Egress Easement (Driveway) and Maintenance Agreement.\u201d It provided: \u201cAn easement is established over the existing jeep trails located on Lot 1.\u201d Moreover, the Second Jeep Trail Agreement expressly stated that it \u201creplaces absolutely and in its entirety\u201d the Original Jeep Trail Agreement. Nevertheless, it largely tracked the language of the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, including the statements that the easement was \u201cperpetual\u201d and was for the purpose of \u201cingress and egress,\u201d and the requirement that any disputes be resolved by arbitration. , However, unlike the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, it did not explicitly describe the jeep trails as connecting to Morgan Station Road or to the Sharp Lot. The Second Jeep Trail Agreement again identified the jeep trails by reference to the Health Department Plan, but also by reference to a \u201cnew road approved by the State of Maryland Department of the Environment Water Management Administration, April 25, 1996, permit 94-NT-1072-1994468197\u201d (the \u201cMDE Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>mit\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In 1997, Jekel conveyed Lot 1 (the Downey Lot) to Larry and Wendy Raskin. In turn, by a deed dated December 15, 2000, the Raskins conveyed Lot 1 to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On December 13, 2002, in the Circuit Court for Howard County, appellees filed a three-count \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Judgment,\u201d naming as defendants Jack Ryan, Inc., as well as John E. Ryan and Pamela Jekel Ryan individually, and seeking resolution of several disputes regarding the adjoining properties. Pertinent to this appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the second count of the Complaint alleged that Ryan had constructed a driveway on Lot 1 \u201clocated outside the easement area,\u201d as described in the Second Jeep Trail Agreement. Therefore, appellees sought a judicial declaration that Ryan was \u201cunder an obligation to relocate the driveway serving the [Sharp Lot] to conform\u201d to the Second Jeep Trail Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In the course of the litigation, appellees filed five amended complaints. On September 4, 2003, during the litigation, appellant purchased Lot 2 (the Sharp Lot) from Ryan. As a result, appellees added Sharp as a defendant to their suit. Appellant filed a counter complaint, as did other defendants (including Ryan, as well as the Breslins, a couple who owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>another neighboring parcel and had been named as defendants by the Downeys with respect to claims not at issue here).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Before Sharp purchased Lot 2 and entered the lawsuit, Ryan filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Count II and to Compel Arbitration.\u201d Ryan cited the language of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement calling <em>for </em>resolution by arbitration of disagreements relative to \u201cany ... issue\u201d concerning the easement, and asked the court to dismiss the second count and to \u201corder [appellees] to initiate the arbitration process.\u201d Noting that appellees \u201cindicated that they do not oppose the Motion,\u201d the court granted Ryan\u2019s motion on May 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In the summer of 2003, Ryan and the Downeys began a binding arbitration proceeding to resolve the claims at issue in the Downeys\u2019 original \u201cCount II.\u201d After Sharp purchased Lot 2 from Ryan, he joined in that arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Subsequently, in July 2007, Ryan and Jekel and their associated entities were dismissed from the lawsuit by a joint stipulation that resolved all claims by and against them. By \u201cOrder\u201d entered on September 11, 2007, the circuit court required Sharp and the Downeys to arbitrate in the pending arbitration proceeding their disputes relative to the \u201cSecond Jeep Trail Agreement.\u201d On January 16, 2008, pursuant to an agreement by Sharp and the Downeys, the court entered an Order dismissing the remaining claims between them, and ordering Sharp and the Downeys to submit those claims (which are wholly separate from the issues on appeal) to the arbitrator. Later that month, the Downeys and the Breslins reached a settlement agreement resolving their disputes (which also are not relevant to this appeal). Accordingly, pursuant to joint motions of the parties, the circuit court entered orders dismissing all remaining claims relative to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>remaining parties. On March 26, 2008, the circuit court entered an order directing the clerk to close the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The arbitration proceeding at issue here began in January 2008.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The arbitrator heard testimony, received documentary exhibits, and conducted two site visits to the properties. Notably, the proceedings before the arbitrator were not transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On January 6, 2009, the arbitrator issued his Award, in which he recounted the history of the land transactions relative to the two lots. The arbitrator also explained that before Ryan divided his property into the Sharp Lot and the Downey Lot, he had begun \u201cto improve the jeep trail without the necessary government permits regulating flood plain tidal and non-tidal waterways.\u201d The arbitrator continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">On July 9, 1994, Ryan was ordered to stop such activity. Ryan then filed a Joint Permit application with an attached plat that showed the Jeep Trail. Thereafter, a Letter of Authorization (After-the-Fact) was issued effective May 22, 1995. A dispute arose between Verba O. Day [another neighbor] and Ryan over Ryan\u2019s use of Day\u2019s right-of-way to access Morgan Station Road. To avoid the conflict, Ryan filed a petition to modify the permit to bypass Day\u2019s right-of-way----(Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The arbitrator also observed that the Health Department Plan, referenced in both the Original and the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, indicated the \u201cExisting] Jeep Trail\u201d with a \u201cdarker broken black line.\u201d In his decision regarding the issues pertinent to this appeal, the arbitrator placed great reliance on the Health Department Plan\u2019s depiction of the jeep trail. The arbitrator said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">There are three issues concerning the Jeep Trails Easement, namely, whether the easement extended to Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Station Road, whether the easement extended to Lot 2, and whether the driveway as it now exists is the easement created by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">A careful examination of the Health Department [Plan] discloses that the easement does not extend to Morgan Station Road but connected to the Verba O. Day right of way to access Morgan Station Road. When Day disputed Ryan\u2019s use of her right of way, Ryan filed for a modified permit to bypass the Day right-of-way. The permit was granted effective April 25, 1996. The plat filed with the modified permit application showed the \u201cproposed access driveway\u201d parallel and to the north of the Day right-of-way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The \u201cproposed access driveway\u201d to Morgan Station Road was not built at the location shown [on] the plat attached to Ryan\u2019s [MDE] Permit, but ... connected to the driveway of the Howard County Bus Turnaround. There was no permit to reflect this, nor was there any amendment to the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] to reflect this. Consequently, the easement created by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] does not extend to Morgan State [sic] Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">The second issue, whether the Jeep Trails Easement extends to Lot 2, also invites the close examination of the Health Department Plan. [The Downeys\u2019 version of the Health Department Plan] shows the Jeep Trail Easement going in a northwesterly direction, i.e. traveling away from Morgan Station Road over Lot 1, through Lot 2, then owned by Ryan, through the ... Riverfront Easement, then curving toward the south and re-entering Lot 1, but stopping short of Lot 2. [Sharp\u2019s version of the Health Department Plan] shows the path of the same Jeep Trail, but instead of stopping short of Lot 2 [the trail] extends into Lot 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">The Downeys argue that the existing Jeep Trail did not extend to Lot 2 ..., but fell short of Lot 2.... Of course, the primary purpose of the Health Department [Plan] was to determine the location of the proposed wells and septic systems. The Jeep Trail was not determined by a metes and bounds description and, for the most part, simply followed the contour lines on the Health Department Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The Health Department Plan is dated November 11, 1991. The first recorded evidence of the Jeep Trail easement occurred on February 20, 1996 when Ryan created Lot 1 and Lot 2, conveyed Lot 1 to Jeckel [sic], ... and created with Jekel \u201cthe existing Jeep Trail\u201d Easement <em>[ie., </em>the Original Jeep Trail Agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">The pertinent language of the [Original Jeep Trail Agreement] reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201c1. An easement is established over the existing Jeep Trail located on Lot 1, but which is not described in a metes and bounds description for the mutual use of both lots. The beginning of the Easement at Morgan Station Road is at the driveway which is used in common with 430 Morgan Station Road and ends at the northeast boundary of Lot 2,\u201d and as \u201cshown on an unrecorded plat, Health Department Percolation Certification Plan, Project No. 423, dated November 11, 1991.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">The [Original Jeep Trail Agreement] also stated that the easement \u201cends at the northeast boundary of Lot 2.... \u201d The easement stops at the division line of Lot 1 and 2 and does not enter Lot 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">On February 27, 1997, Jeckel [sic] and Ryan executed the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] that replaced absolutely and in its entirety the [Original Jeep Trail Agreement]. This instrument established an easement \u201cover the existing jeep trails located on Lot 1[\u201d] as [\u201c]shown on the Howard County Health Department Certification Plan\u201d and the \u201cnew road\u201d approved by Maryland Water Management permit 94-NT-1072/199468197. Since the prior easement was entirely replaced, this [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] is the sole controlling extant easement and limits the easement to the \u201cexisting jeep trails located on Lot 1\u201d of which none give access to Lot 2, the Riverfront Easement, nor to Morgan Station Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">The remaining issue is whether the existing driveway is located within the Jeep Trails Easement. As stated before, the Jeep Trails Easement does not extend to Morgan Station Road, nor was it built in accordance with the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>94-NT-1072/199468197 as modified, nor does the easement extend into Lot 2. The above, together with ... other evidence shows substantial parts of the driveway were not built within the easement designations. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The arbitrator also rejected a claim by Sharp that, if he did not have an express easement, he nevertheless was entitled to an implied easement. The arbitrator reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Sharp contends that since he is landlocked, he has an implied easement by necessity. When Ryan created Lot 1 and 2, he immediately sold Lot 1 to Jeckel [sic], [and] created with Jeckel [sic] the Riverfront Easement, then the [Original Jeep Trail Agreement]. All of the above instruments were executed on the same day and recorded among the Land Records of Howard County____ The [Original Jeep Trail Agreement] gave an easement through Lot 1 to Ryan, but it did not extend into Lot 2, the Riverfront Easement, or Morgan Station Road. Obviously, Jeckel [sic] did not want any intrusion into her Riverfront Easement.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] Ordinarily, subsequent instruments should not be considered. Here, however, the [Original Jeep Trail Agreement] was substituted by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] by the same parties and concerned the same property and ... also was recorded. This easement did not extend into Lot 2 to cross into the Riverfront Easement nor to Morgan Station Road. This is the operative easement and, once again, it is apparent that Jeckel [sic] did not want her easement rights disturbed. Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">With respect to the instant dispute, the arbitrator made the following \u201cDecision and Findings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>5. The \u201cJeep Trails\u201d over which Sharp has an easement are only those depicted on the Health Department Percolation Certification Plan dated November 11, 1991, and as permitted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Permit No. 94-NT-1072/199468197 (as modified).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">6. The \u201cJeep Trails\u201d do not provide Sharp access to Morgan Station Road[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">7. The portions of the paved driveway are not located within the Jeep Trails defined by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement], and/or extend beyond the 690 feet permitted by the [MDE] Permit, and may be removed by the Dow-neys. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">By letter dated January 13, 2009, the arbitrator advised the parties that the final sentence of the Award\u2019s discussion of easement by necessity \u201cshould read, \u2018Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity, <em>he does not need one.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added to show addition.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On January 20, 2009, Sharp filed with the arbitrator a \u201cMotion to Reconsider, Modify or Correct Arbitration Award,\u201d in which he asked the arbitrator to reconsider his three \u201cFindings,\u201d numbered 5, 6, and 7, relating to the Second Jeep Trail Agreement. Sharp did not challenge five other findings of the arbitrator, which related to issues that are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In the meantime, on January 15, 2009, appellees reopened the circuit court case by filing a \u201cPetition to Confirm Arbitration Award.\u201d Appellant responded with an answer to appel-lees\u2019 petition, as well as a \u201cPetition to Vacate Arbitration Award.\u201d In these papers, appellant advised the court that he had filed his Motion to Reconsider with the arbitrator on January 20, 2009. According to appellant, appellees\u2019 petition to confirm the Award was \u201cpremature,\u201d because \u201cSection 3-222 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides a period of twenty (20) days to file a motion to modify or vacate the award with the arbitrator.\u201d Therefore, Sharp contended that \u201c[n]either [appellant\u2019s] Petition nor the Petition to Confirm Award should be heard until the arbitrator completes his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>task by ruling on the Motion to Reconsider,\u201d and indicated that he was filing his Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award \u201cin an excess of caution.\u201d Appellant asked the court to stay action on the competing petitions until the arbitrator ruled on his Motion to Reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Although the court did not issue a formal stay, it took no immediate action on the two petitions. On March 30, 2009, the arbitrator denied appellant\u2019s Motion to Reconsider. In his \u201cRuling &amp; Order on Motion of Respondent,\u201d the arbitrator stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">There were three issues relative to the \u201cexisting Jeep Trails on Lot 1,\u201d namely, whether the easement extended to Morgan Station Road, whether it extended to Lot 2, and whether the driveway as it now exists is the easement created by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">As to the first issue, the easement did not extend to Morgan Station Road. The easement was not built in accordance with the plat attached to the [MDE] Permit.... Instead, it was built to connect to the Howard County school bus turnaround. There was no permit to do this. The (after the fact) authorization required \u201cgrading and fill associated with improvements to a school bus turnaround.\u201d It was not an authorization to connect to the school bus turnaround, but merely to improve the school bus turnaround.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">As stated in the Arbitration Award, the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] is the controlling easement. It gave no access to Lot 2, the Riverfront Easement, nor Morgan Station Road. In short, Lot 2 has no access to Morgan Station Road since Lot 2 does not have access either to the Riverfront Easement or Lot 1 from Lot 2, and therefore cannot cross Lot 1 to gain access to Morgan Station Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">The Downey\u2019s [sic] own Lot 1 in fee simple unencumbered by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] and unencumbered by the replaced [Original Jeep Trail Agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Since the owner of Lot <em>2, </em>presently Sharp, cannot traverse or cross Lot 1, Sharp has no access to Morgan Station Road. Lot 2 is landlocked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">Relative to the remaining issue, the location of the driveway on Lot 1, such is no longer the concern of the owner of Lot 2, presently Sharp. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On April 7, 2009, appellees filed a \u201cMemorandum in Further Support of Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award\u201d in the circuit court. On April 28, 2009, appellant filed a \u201cFurther Petition and Memorandum to Vacate Arbitration Award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In brief, appellant contended that the Arbitration Award was \u201cirrational\u201d and displayed a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d In Sharp\u2019s view, the arbitrator illogically \u201cfailed to actually locate the \u2018new road\u2019 referred to in the Jeep Trails Easement when the location was shown on exhibits referred to in the Award.\u201d Further, appellant argued that, \u201cif the easement was not beatable by the Declaration of Easement, it must be presumed to be in the location the parties constructed their driveway.\u201d Additionally, Sharp maintained that the Downeys \u201ctook title to Lot 1 subject to the known and clearly visible easement for the existing driveway clearly visible to them on the ground.\u201d Finally, Sharp disputed the arbitrator\u2019s statement that an implied easement was \u201cnot needed,\u201d arguing: \u201cThe finding of no implied easement, because it was \u2018not needed\u2019, leaves Lot 2 landlocked, clearly an arbitrary, irrational decision in manifest disregard of the law. Such clearly was not the intention of Jekel and Ryan when they expressly created the two easement documents for ingress and egress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On September 28, 2009, the court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order, confirming the Award. It recognized that \u201cMaryland law favors the resolution of legal disputes through binding arbitration as evidenced by the codification of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act....\u201d The court also explained that \u201cthe Act severely limits the Court\u2019s authority to vacate an arbitration award,\u201d and that, \u201c[t]o prevent a reviewing court from substituting its judgment for the decision of the arbitrator, a court <em>\u2018shall not </em>vacate the award or refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>confirm the award on the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u2019\u201d (Quoting statute; circuit court\u2019s emphasis).

The evidence before the arbitrator included the fact that the existing driveway was not built in accordance with the Modified Permit or the joint application\u2019s proposed driveway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Furthermore, the arbitrator was not obligated to consider the proposed access driveway contained in the joint application because, contrary to [Sharp\u2019s] assertion, the proposals were not incorporated into the Jeep Trails Easement or the Modified Permit.... As such, it was reasonable for the arbitrator to locate the Jeep Trails Easement ... based upon the accepted controlling documents to find that the easement did not provide [Sharp] access to Morgan Station Road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The court also rejected appellant\u2019s assertion that the easement should be \u201cpresumed\u201d to be located where Ryan had physically placed his driveway, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>[T]he parties\u2019 predecessors-in-interest granted a way with a fixed location found in the Modified Permit. While an easement was intended, the [Downeys] should not be burdened by the unapproved existing driveway because the parties\u2019 predecessors-in-interest elected not to comply with the recorded Jeep Trails Easement and follow the Modified Permit for the access road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In denying Sharp\u2019s claim that the Downeys should be burdened by the easement because it was readily apparent \u201con the ground,\u201d the court observed that \u201cwhether an unrecorded easement is apparent to a purchaser is a fact determination.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that no easement supported the existing driveway was \u201creasonable ... based upon the record ... which includes evidence that [Sharp] purchased his property with knowledge that [the Downeys] had a pending declaratory judgment action against the predecessor-in-title, Jack Ryan, regarding the land.\u201d The court declined to \u201csubstitute\u201d its judgment for \u201cthe judgment of the arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Finally, the court rejected Sharp\u2019s claim \u201cthat an implied easement is necessary to keep his land from being landlocked and that such a finding is supported by Maryland law.\u201d The court stated: \u201cAn owner may freely cut off access to his land.\u201d For that proposition, it cited <em>Shpak v. Oletsky, </em>280 Md. 355, 371, 373 A.2d 1234 (1977). The court explained that, in the arbitrator\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 predecessors-in-interest created an easement involving the Jeep Trails, but ... did not extend it into [appellant\u2019s] property (Lot 2), the Riverfront Easement, or Morgan Station Road, leaving [appellant] landlocked.\u201d Finding no error in the arbitrator\u2019s determination, the circuit court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">The necessity to access [Sharp\u2019s] property and Morgan Station Road did not exist at the time of severance of title as evidenced by the boundaries of the easement agreements, preventing a finding of an implied easement by necessity. This lack of necessity is also reflected in [appellant\u2019s] purchase of the property at a reduced rate based upon knowledge that [appellees] were challenging the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>encumbrances to the land. It is reasonable to conclude that [Sharp] purchased the land with the understanding that any easements may not be valid or upheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Accordingly, the court entered its \u201cOrder\u201d granting the Downeys\u2019 Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and denying Sharp\u2019s competing Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">As the circuit court correctly recognized, this case is governed by the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), codified in Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d).

Arbitration is encouraged in Maryland because it provides an informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to conventional litigation. <em>RTKL Assocs., Inc. v.

(Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Where the parties have agreed to submit a dispute to binding arbitration, the Act gives \u201cthe courts jurisdiction to enforce arbitration agreements and enter judgments on arbitration awards.\u201d <em>Questar Homes, </em>388 Md. at 684, 882 A.2d 288. The courts are also empowered to determine whether the parties have a valid agreement to arbitrate. C.J. \u00a7 3-207. \u201cIf a party to an arbitration agreement\u201d that is covered by the Act \u201crefuses to arbitrate, the other party may file a petition with a court to order arbitration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Once an arbitrator has rendered an award, C.J. \u00a7 3-227 authorizes either party to file a petition in court to confirm the award. The Act also permits the filing of a petition to vacate an arbitration award \u201cwithin 30 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the petitioner,\u201d or within 30 days after \u201ccorruption, fraud, or other undue means\u201d in procuring the award \u201cbecome known or should have become known to the petitioner.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-224(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThe court shall confirm the award, unless the other party has filed an application to vacate, modify, or correct the award____\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-227(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Notably, the Act contemplates an extremely limited role for the courts in reviewing or countermanding an arbitrator\u2019s decision. As we observed in <em>Mandl, </em>159 Md.App. at 85, 858 A.2d 508, \u201cthe General Assembly has severely restricted the role the courts play in the arbitration process.\u201d Further, we explained: \u201cTo prevent the possibility that a reviewing court will substitute its judgment for the decision of the arbitrator, thereby frustrating the purpose of arbitration, the General Assembly has narrowly confined ... the circumstances in which the court has the power to vacate an arbitral award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Under the Act, a court may not vacate an award or refuse to confirm an award \u201con the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-224(c). Rather, C.J. \u00a7 3-224(b) enumerates limited circumstances in which a court \u201cshall vacate an award\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">(1) An award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown for the postponement, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of [C.

Moreover, \u201cthis burden is a heavy one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCourts generally refuse to review arbitration awards on the merits, reasoning that the parties are required \u2018to submit to the judgment of the tribunal of their own selection and abide by the award.\u2019 \u201d <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters, Local 1619 v.

Kroll, Inc., supra, </em>29 Md.App. at 407-08, 348 A.2d 870, this Court recognized that the Act \u201crestrictively defin[es] the grounds upon which a court might vacate an [arbitration] award, and expressly proscribe^] any possibility of substitution of a reviewing court\u2019s judgment for that of the arbitrators.\u201d Nevertheless, the Court recognized that the text of the Act supported a \u201cvery limited extension of the reviewing court\u2019s scope of review to include authority to vacate an award that is \u2018completely irrational.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 348 A.2d 870. Although the \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard derives originally from common law standards of review of arbitration awards that predate the Act, we gleaned \u201c[statutory support\u201d for its application \u201cin the fact that arbitrators \u2018exceeded their powers\u2019 when they reach a completely irrational result, [and] in the connotation of the words \u2018undue means\u2019____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting C. J. \u00a7 3-224(b)(l) &amp; (3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Thus, the <em>Kroll </em>Court held that, \u201cwhen reviewing the fruits of an arbitrator\u2019s award, a judge may withhold only such as were tainted by improbity <em>or </em>based on a completely irrational interpretation of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 408-09, 348 A.2d 870 (emphasis in original). Explaining its holding, the Court stated that courts are empowered by the Act to grant relief \u201cfrom an arbitration award that was arrived at in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>but, because of grossly misguided judgment, is shockingly absurd[. |\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 348 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Notably, the Court made clear that this restrictive standard of review is distinct from, and sets a bar far higher than, the standards of review applicable to the decisions of trial courts or administrative agencies. It stated: \u201cWe must judicially accept an arbitrary interpretation of a contract by an arbitrator. We shall vacate a completely irrational one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 348 A.2d 870. Further, the Court said: \u201c[Ojur review ... need not seek a preponderance of the evidence to support the award, nor even substantial evidence. There need only be <em>some </em>evidence to meet the test of rationality, <em>i.e., </em>it may be so little as to make the result \u2018arbitrary\u2019, so long as it is not completely irrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 348 A.2d 870 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In addition, we have recognized that the Act\u2019s standard for vacatur of an arbitral award where the award was procured by \u201cundue means,\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3\u2014224(b)(1), or the \u201carbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tors exceeded their authority,\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-224(b)(3), may encompass reversal of an award that displays \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Southern Md.

The Court said: \u201cSince ... the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act is not applicable to the instant arbitration award, we need not and do not decide whether an arbitration award subject to the Uniform Act may be vacated ... for \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 522 A.2d 931.

Hall Street sees this supposed addition to \u00a7 10 as the camel\u2019s nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584-85, 128 S.Ct. 1396 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court rejected this view, however. \u201cQuite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract,\u201d said the Court, \u201cHall Street overlooks the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>fact that the statement [from <em>Wilko </em>] it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator\u2019s legal errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 128 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The Supreme Court opined that, even if the parties agree otherwise, \u201cthe text [of the FAAJ compels a reading of the [statutory] categories as exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 128 S.Ct. 1396. In its view, the FAA \u201ccarries no hint of flexibility\u201d as to expansion of the grounds for vacatur. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 128 S.Ct. 1396. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 585, 128 S.Ct. 1396 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">Maybe the term \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the \u00a7 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them. Or, as some courts have thought, \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d may have been shorthand for ... the paragraphs authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were \u201cguilty of misconduct\u201d or \u201cexceeded their powers.\u201d We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <em>Wilko </em>language as we found it, without embellishment, and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In the wake of <em>Hall Street, </em>a lively debate has ensued in the federal circuit courts of appeal over the continued vitality of the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard. Some circuits have taken the view that because <em>Hall Street </em>holds that the FAA\u2019s statutory grounds are \u201cexclusive,\u201d it follows that \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d is no longer viable. <em>See Citigroup Global Markets Inc. v. Bacon, </em>562 F.3d 349, 350 <em>&amp; </em>355-58 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cManifest disregard of the law is no longer an independent ground for vacating arbitration awards under the FAA.\u201d); <em>Medicine Shoppe Int\u2019l, Inc. v.

CitiFinancial Corp., LLC, </em>604 F.3d 1313, 1322-24 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that prior circuit precedent had recognized \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d as a \u201cnon-statutory ground! ] for vacatur,\u201d but holding that \u201cour judicially-created bases for vacatur are no longer valid in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of <em>Hall Street Ramos-Santiago v.

The Supreme Court assumed that the \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d standard applied and declined to resolve the controversy. It said: \u201cWe do not decide whether \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 survives our decision in <em>Hall Street </em>... as an independent ground for review or as a judicial gloss on the enumerated grounds for vacatur set forth at 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10____Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied.... \u201d <em>Stolt-Nielsen SA v.

In its view, the arbitration panel improperly \u201cimposed its own policy choice and thus exceeded its powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">We recognize that the issue remains unsettled. But, for several reasons, we decline to reconsider whether \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d remains a viable basis to vacate an arbitral award under the Maryland Act. First, neither <em>Hall Street </em>nor <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>squarely states that \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d is no longer viable. Moreover, the case <em>sub judice </em>arises under the Maryland Act, not the FAA; regardless of <em>Hall Street\u2019s </em>import for review of arbitral awards under the FAA, it has only persuasive value in interpreting Maryland\u2019s Act. In addition, this Court\u2019s case law on \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d has never been overruled by the Court of Appeals. Therefore, the well settled principles of <em>stare decisis </em>apply here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>It is also salient that our earlier decisions align with those of several federal courts, <em>see Stolt-Nielsen, supra, </em>548 F.3d 85; <em>Comedy Club, supra, </em>553 F.3d 1277, which, after <em>Hall Street, </em>viewed \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d as a \u201cshorthand\u201d or \u201ccollective\u201d expression for enumerated statutory grounds for vacatur (specifically, C.J. \u00a7 3\u2014224(b)(1) and (3) in the Maryland Act). <em>See, e.g., Southern Md. Hosp. Ctr., </em>48 Md.App. at 407-08, 427 A.2d 1051.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In explaining its holding that \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d survives <em>Hall Street, </em>the Second Circuit said in <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>that, where the arbitrator has \u201c \u2018willfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it,\u2019 \u201d the arbitrator has \u201c \u2018failed to interpret the contract at all,\u2019 for <em>parties do not agree in advance to submit to arbitration that is carried out in manifest disregard of the law.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, </em>548 F.3d at 95 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). We find this reasoning instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The Act\u2019s grounds to vacate arbitral awards are all directed at preserving the integrity of the arbitration process. Arbitration is fundamentally a creature of contract, <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>298 Md. at 103, 468 A.2d 91, by which the parties relinquish their right to a judicial dispute resolution forum (containing a variety of procedural benefits, including comprehensive appellate review), in favor of \u201can expeditious and more affordable resolution of the controversy,\u201d including a choice of decision maker. <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 575, 989 A.2d 210 (2010). However, while parties to arbitration agree to accept the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the law, <em>Soc\u2019y of Am. Foresters, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 235-36, 689 A.2d 662, this does not mean that they agree to permit the arbitrator to fabricate the law from whole cloth. If agreeing to arbitrate meant relinquishing any expectation that the arbitrator will apply fundamental substantive legal principles, no rational party would ever agree to submit a dispute to arbitration. Thus, limited judicial review for manifest disregard of the law reinforces the process of arbitration by protecting the parties\u2019 <em>ex ante </em>expectation of an alternative but principled dispute resolution mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Finally, the parties have not asked us to reconsider the standard. To the contrary, they agree that an arbitrator\u2019s award may be vacated for manifest disregard of the law. Therefore, while recognizing that the statutory grounds are the sole grounds for vacatur of arbitral awards, we see no inconsistency in applying the \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Although the parties agree as to the standards of review that we have elucidated, they disagree as to the result we should reach in applying these standards. Because the parties\u2019 contentions implicate the law of easements, we pause to review applicable easement law.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The basic legal principles governing easements are well established. \u201c\u2018An easement is broadly defined as a nonpossessory interest in the real property of another....\u2019\u201d <em>Rogers v. P-M Hunter\u2019s Ridge, LLC, </em>407 Md. 712, 729, 967 A.2d 807 (2009) (quoting <em>Boucher v. Boyer, </em>301 Md. 679, 688, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>484 A.2d 630 (1984)). An easement involves \u201c \u2018the privilege of doing a certain class of act on, or to the detriment, of another\u2019s land, or a right against another that he refrain from doing a certain class of act on or in connection with his own land....\u2019\u201d <em>Rau v. Collins, </em>167 Md.App. 176, 185, 891 A.2d 1175 (2006) (citation omitted). Generally, \u201cthe terms \u2018easement\u2019 and \u2018right-of-way\u2019 are regarded as synonymous.\u201d <em>Miller v. Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. 335, 349, 833 A.2d 536 ( 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">As the Court of Appeals has explained, \u201c \u2018[i]n every instance of a private easement\u2014that is, an easement not enjoyed by the public\u2014there exists the characteristic feature of two distinct tenements\u2014one dominant and the other servient..\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Garrett County v. Bell Atlantic-Md., Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 175, 695 A.2d 171 (1997) (citation omitted). An easement can be described as a right of the owner of the dominant estate\u2014often, a right of way\u2014over the real property that comprises the servient estate. In other words: \u201cA dominant tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate that benefits from an easement\u2019; a servient tenant is the owner of \u2018[a]n estate burdened by an easement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers, </em>407 Md. at 715 n. 1, 967 A.2d 807 (quoting Blacks Law Dictionary 589 (8th ed.2004); alterations in Rogers).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Of import here, there are several ways to create an easement. \u201cAn easement may be created by express grant, by reservation in a conveyance of land, or by implication.\u201d <em>Kobrine, L.L.C. v. Metzger, </em>380 Md. 620, 635, 846 A.2d 403 (2004). An express easement, whether by grant or reservation, must be created by a written memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds; and \u201ca right[ ] of way created by deed\u201d must satisfy \u201c \u2018the mode and manner prescribed by the recording statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 846 A.2d 403 (citations omitted). In <em>Rogers, </em>407 Md. at 729-30, 967 A.2d 807, the Court explained: \u201cAn express easement by reservation often arises when a property owner conveys a portion of his property to another, which would otherwise render the retained part inaccessible, so the reservation permits a right-of-way.\u201d In contrast, an easement by implication \u201c \u2018may be created in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>variety of ways, such as by prescription, necessity, the filing of plats, estoppel and implied grant or reservation where a quasi-easement has existed while the two tracts are one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 967 A.2d 807 (quoting <em>Boucher, </em>301 Md. at 688, 484 A.2d 630).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This case involves principles regarding both express easements and a particular category of implied easement: an implied easement by necessity. As we have seen, Ryan and Jekel executed two documents\u2014the Original and the Second Jeep Trail Agreement\u2014which purportedly burdened Lot 1 (the servient estate, then owned by Jekel) with an express easement benefitting Lot 2 (the dominant estate, then owned by Ryan). However, in the absence of an express easement, which is what the arbitrator found <em>(i.e., </em>that the express easement did not exist, or was not so extensive as to give Lot 2 access to Morgan Station Road), Sharp argues that he is entitled to an implied easement by necessity, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Appellant alleges four errors in the decision of the arbitrator, which he contends amount to a decision \u201cin manifest disregard of the law.\u201d As we shall explain, appellant\u2019s first three arguments, which challenge the arbitrator\u2019s decision making regarding the alleged express easement, cannot overcome the deferential standard of our review. But, we find merit in appellant\u2019s final argument, that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law when he ruled that appellant was not entitled to an implied easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">First, appellant contends: \u201cIt is clear from the language of the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] that there are two documents referred to that locate the easement: (1) a \u2018jeep trail\u2019 shown on the [Health Department Plan]; and, (2) the \u2018new road\u2019 constructed\u201d under the MDE Permit. According to appellant, \u201cthe arbitrator exceeded his power when he failed to locate and determine the \u2018New Road\u2019 referred to in the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] when the location was actually shown on the exhibits referred to and relied on by the arbitrator in reaching his decision.\u201d Instead, appellant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tends that the arbitrator \u201cignored the plat\u201d showing the \u201cnew road\u201d approved by the MDE Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Second, appellant argues: \u201cThe uncontradicted evidence was that there was an existing paved driveway which still remains on Lot 1 and Lot 2----[I]f the easement cannot be located by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement], it must be presumed to be in the location the parties constructed their driveway.\u201d He relies on <em>Sibbel v. Fitch, </em>182 Md. 323, 34 A.2d 773 (1943), and <em>Michael v. Needham, </em>39 Md.App. 271, 384 A.2d 473, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 736 (1978), which he describes as standing for the proposition that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4\">when there is a right of way expressly granted, but not by specific description, but there is a right of way located at the time of the grant and used for a long period of time, such right of way will be held to be the location of the way granted as if located by metes and bounds in the same location, unless a contrary intention appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Third, appellant posits that, \u201cif the circumstances show that a purchaser had notice of prior equities or unrecorded easements which ought to have put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry,\u201d Maryland law is \u201cwell established\u201d that \u201cthe purchaser ... takes his title subject to all equities of which he had knowledge and which an investigation would disclose.\u201d \u201cFurthermore,\u201d he argues, \u201ca purchaser of property cannot fail to investigate matters plain and open to him when purchasing property.\u201d In Sharp\u2019s view, because the existing driveway over Lot 1 was readily apparent when the Downeys purchased the lot, \u201c[i]t was irrational and a manifest disregard of the law for the Award to ignore the existing driveway as an open and apparent encumbrance on the Downey\u2019s [sic] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">We need not iterate more extensively appellant\u2019s first three claims, nor appellees\u2019 responses to them, because the claims simply cannot surmount the applicable standard of review.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the express ease<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ment delineated in the Second Jeep Trail Agreement did not reach Lot 2, and did not reach Morgan Station Road, was based on the arbitrator\u2019s review of the evidence, including a \u201cclose examination of the Health Department Plan,\u201d and his construction of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The arbitrator gave particular weight to the lines depicting the jeep trail on the Health Department Plan. He concluded that the easement described in the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, as delineated by the Health Department Plan, stopped short of Lot 2, and did \u201cnot extend to Morgan Station Road but connected to the Verba O. Day right of way to access Morgan Station Road.\u201d The Award fully and rationally explained this decision. Although another tribunal might have taken a different view of the evidence, or might have interpreted the Second Jeep Trail Agreement differently, the conclusions are founded upon the evidence and are certainly not \u201ccompletely irrational.\u201d <em>Kroll, supra, </em>29 Md.App. at 409, 348 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In particular, we reject appellant\u2019s first claim, that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law by failing to specifically locate the \u201cnew road\u201d approved by the MDE Permit. We agree with the circuit court that the arbitrator \u201cwas not obligated to issue a decision as to each proffered statement of fact\u201d at issue. The arbitrator considered the evidence submitted regarding the MDE Permit, but did not find that the MDE Permit extended the \u201ceasement created by the [Second Jeep Trail Agreement] ... to Morgan Station] Road,\u201d in part because the driveway that Ryan constructed was not actually built at the location shown on Ryan\u2019s Joint Permit Application for the MDE Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Likewise, we discern no merit in appellant\u2019s second argument. <em>Sibbel </em>involved a deed to a parcel that expressly \u201c \u2018reserved] ... a right of way to and from\u2019 \u201d an adjacent landlocked tract, but did not define the location of the way. <em>Sibbel, </em>182 Md. at 325, 34 A.2d 773 (quoting deed). Although the right of way was not expressly defined in the deed, there was an \u201cold road,\u201d in use for \u201cmore than half a century,\u201d that ran across the deeded parcel to the landlocked tract. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 34 A.2d 773. In that context, the Court quoted favorably the discussion of easements in <em>Corpus Juris Secundum </em>(\u201cCJS\u201d): \u201c \u2018Where a way is granted without fixing its location, but there is a way already located at the time of the grant, such way will be held to be the location of the way granted unless a contrary intention appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 34 A.2d 773; <em>see also Michael, </em>39 Md.App. at 280, 384 A.2d 473 (quoting the same passage from CJS, in a case where there was a right of way in long use, despite no express easement). However, the rule of law quoted in <em>Sibbel </em>and <em>Michael </em>is not apposite to the location of the express easement allegedly established by the Second Jeep Trail Agreement. The Second Jeep Trail Agreement, by incorporation of the Health Department Plan, specifically defined the location of a right of way, but the arbitrator found that the easement, as located, simply did not provide access to Lot 2 and Morgan Station Road. In other words, the Second Jeep Trail Agreement did not grant a way \u201c \u2018without fixing its location.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sibbel, </em>182 Md. at 326-27, 34 A.2d 773 (quoting CJS).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Appellant\u2019s third argument, which relies on <em>Kimm v. Andrews, </em>270 Md. 601, 313 A.2d 466 (1974), <em>Fertitta v. Bay Shore Development Corp., </em>266 Md. 59, 291 A.2d 662 (1972), and <em>Kramer v.

We elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Implied easements by necessity \u201carise from a presumption that the parties intended that the party needing the easement should have access over the land.\u201d <em>Calvert Joint Venture </em># <em>140 v.

The public policy exists in recognition that to allow a landlocked parcel inadvertently to be created affects not only the initial owner of that parcel, but every subsequent owner as well. By cutting off the land from all access to public ways, landlocking a parcel renders the land unuseable for virtually any future purpose.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>In <em>Stansbury, </em>the Court of Appeals \u201csummed up\u201d the \u201cprerequisites to the creation of an easement by necessity,\u201d 390 Md. at 489, 889 A.2d 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">(1) initial unity of title of the parcels of real property in question; (2) severance of the unity of title by conveyance of one of the parcels; and (3) the easement must be necessary in order for the grantor or grantee of the property in question to be able to access his or her land, with the necessity existing both at the time of the severance of title and at the time of the exercise of the easement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Here, there is no controversy as to the first two elements; it is undisputed that Ryan initially owned both Lot 1 and Lot 2 as a- single, undivided parcel, and then severed his unity of title by partitioning the lots and conveying Lot 1 to Jekel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Rather, the parties\u2019 dispute centers around the element of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">As the nomenclature suggests, necessity is a critical component of the doctrine.

Therefore, the necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ty must be continuous, beginning at the time that the dominant and servient properties are subdivided.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On occasion, the Court has stated that \u201c[necessity of itself does not create a right of way; it is merely a fact offered in evidence to show an intention to establish a right of way by raising the presumption of a grant.\u201d <em>Greenwalt, </em>178 Md. at 139, 12 A.2d 522. <em>See also Shpak, </em>280 Md. at 361, 373 A.2d 1234 (quoting L.

Henderson, supra, </em>236 Md. at 104 n. 2, 202 A.2d 599, the Court observed that \u201c[t]he concept that a way of necessity arises from the presumed intention of the parties has been criticized,\u201d and characterized the majority in <em>Condry, supra, </em>184 Md. 317, 41 A.2d 66, as adopting the proposition that \u201cthe basis for implying the grant was the necessity of ingress and egress over the grantor\u2019s land, imposed by law regardless of a contrary expression of intent by the parties.\u201d <em>Hancock, </em>236 Md. at 104 n. 2, 202 A.2d 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Nevertheless, the <em>Hancock </em>Court recognized that \u201c[t]he cases seem to be searching for the intent of the parties____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 202 A.2d 599. This is because \u201cthe basis of an implied easement is the implied intention of the parties that an easement be created[J\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Houstle, </em>217 Md. 259, 265, 142 A.2d 556 (1958). But, as the Court explained in <em>Stansbury, </em>in the case of an implied easement by necessity, \u201c \u2018[t]he intent to create the easement is ... deemed to be shown by the type of transaction involved and no other evidence is necessary to establish the intent of the parties to create a way of necessity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stansbury, </em>390 Md. at 489, 889 A.2d 403 (quoting 3 Herbert T. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property, \u00a7 793 (3d ed.1939, 2004 Supp.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The <em>Stansbury </em>Court made another important observation, <em>id. </em>at 485 n. 5, 889 A.2d 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Technically an easement by necessity exists by reason of the facts and circumstances present in a situation. It exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>without a court order. It exists by operation of law. When disputes arise as to its existence, however, a court action is the proper way to resolve the disputes. What a court does is to affirm (or not) that an easement by necessity already exists. The court does not \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201cestablish\u201d such an easement. In some circumstances\u2014if an easement by necessity is determined to be in existence\u2014a court may \u201clocate\u201d that pre-existing easement at a particular location. But courts generally do not \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201cestablish\u201d easements; they recognize or affirm (or not) easements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">As we have seen, the doctrine of implied easement by necessity is founded in a strong public policy that favors \u201cfull utilization of land and the presumption that parties do not intend to render land unfit for occupancy.\u201d <em>Condry v. Laurie, supra, </em>184 Md. at 321, 41 A.2d 66. Moreover, as indicated, the elements of implied easement by necessity are well established.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Here, it was plain that Lot 1 and Lot 2 satisfied the first two elements to show an implied easement by necessity: \u201c(1) initial unity of title of the parcels of real property in question; [and] (2) severance of the unity of title by conveyance of one of the parcels.\u201d <em>Stansbury, supra, </em>390 Md. at 489, 889 A.2d 403. In that context, the arbitrator\u2019s statements that \u201cSharp has no access to Morgan Station Road\u201d and that \u201cLot 2 is landlocked\u201d are fundamentally irreconcilable with his statement that \u201cRyan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity, he does not need one.\u201d As the Court in <em>Stansbury </em>explained, \u201can easement by necessity exists by reason of the facts and circumstances present in a situation.\u201d 390 Md. at 485 n. 5, 889 A.2d 403. Given the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Lot 2 was landlocked, the necessity required to show an implied easement by necessity was present, and it was \u201ccompletely irrational,\u201d <em>Kroll, </em>29 Md.App. at 409, 348 A.2d 870, for the arbitrator conclude that appellant \u201cdoes not need\u201d an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As noted, appellees argue that, at the time the Sharp Lot was created, no necessity existed. To be sure, the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>decision was ultimately based on interpretation of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, which Sharp and Jekel executed a year after the subdivision of Lots 1 and 2 and the conveyance of Lot 1 to Jekel. The arbitrator recognized explicitly that the Second Jeep Trail Agreement was the \u201csole controlling extant easement\u201d and \u201centirely replaced\u201d the Original Jeep Trail Agreement. But, .in reaching his decision regarding the scope of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, the arbitrator first construed the Original Jeep Trail Agreement. Explaining his decision, the arbitrator observed that the \u201cfirst recorded evidence of the Jeep Trail easement occurred on February 20, 1996 when Ryan created Lot 1 and Lot 2, conveyed Lot 1 to Jeckel [sic], created with Jeckel [sic] the Riverfront Easement ... and created with Jekel \u2018the existing Jeep Trail\u2019 Easement.\u201d (Citations omitted.) In the Award, the arbitrator continued to refer to the Original Jeep Trail Agreement with the phrase \u201c \u2018existing Jeep Trail\u2019 Easement,\u201d and by reference to its exhibit number in the arbitration proceeding, which was Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> After quoting the Original Jeep Trail Agreement at length, the arbitrator concluded that \u201c[t]he existing Jeep Trail Easement (Cl., Ex. 6) <em>[ie., </em>the Original Jeep Trail Agreement] gave an easement through Lot 1 to Ryan, but it did not extend into Lot 2, the Riverfront Easement, or Morgan Station Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Moreover, even if the arbitrator had not explicitly construed the scope of the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, his construction of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement relied on his interpretation of the Health Department Plan, which defined the location of the right of way in both the Original and the Second Jeep Trail Agreement. Indeed, in the Original Jeep Trail Agreement, the Health Department Plan was the only document incorporated to locate the easement. If the Health Department Plan does not describe a right of way that connected the Sharp Lot to Morgan Station Road when incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>rated in the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, it follows logically that the same document cannot describe a right of way connecting the lot to the road when incorporated into the Original Jeep Trail Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The inescapable conclusion is that the arbitrator determined that there was never an express easement over Lot 1 that provided Lot 2 with access to Morgan Station Road. Therefore, under the arbitrator\u2019s construction of the easement instruments (which was neither illogical nor manifestly in disregard of the law), Lot 2 was landlocked from its inception. Thus, contrary to appellees\u2019 contention, the necessity required for an implied easement by necessity existed from the time that unity of title was severed until the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In support of their second argument, <em>i.e., </em>that a landowner can landlock himself, appellees rely upon <em>Shpak v. Oletsky, supra, </em>280 Md. 355, 373 A.2d 1234. There, the Court said that Maryland law \u201cdoes not prohibit one from cutting himself off from all access to his land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364-65, 373 A.2d 1234 (citation omitted). But, appellees\u2019 reading of <em>Shpak </em>is selective.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">For the proposition that the law permits a landowner to landlock himself, the <em>Shpak </em>Court relied on a law review article by Professor J. Simonton, <em>Ways by Necessity, </em>33 W. Va. L.Q. 64, 78-79 (1923), from which the Court quoted at length, 280 Md. at 365, 373 A.2d 1234 (italics in <em>Shpak; </em>boldface added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cIs the so-called presumption of intent conclusive, or may it be overcome by showing the real intent of the parties? To put it in terms of public policy, are the interests in favor of allowing the easement strong enough to overcome the contrary expressed intent of the parties? ... <em>\\I ]t seems the presumption as to an easement by necessity may be overcoms by showing the actual contrary intent of the parties. Seemingly the law allows a landowner to cut off all his rights of access to his land, if he so desires.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The passage quoted in <em>Shpak </em>is in accord with the authorities we have cited, recognizing that \u201cthe basis of an implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>easement [by necessity] is the implied intent of the parties that an easement be created,\u201d as demonstrated by the necessity for a right of way to reach a public road. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>217 Md. at 265, 142 A.2d 556. Thus, <em>Shpak </em>supports the proposition that, when the parties\u2019 actual intent is clear, there is no basis to infer a contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In this case, it is quite clear that Ryan never intended to landlock Lot 2. To the contrary, both Ryan and Jekel unequivocally intended to create an easement for the express purpose of ingress and egress to Lot 2. Indeed, both the Original and the Second Jeep Trail Agreement used the phrase \u201cingress and egress\u201d in their titles, and explicitly stated that the purpose of each agreement was to provide for ingress and egress. In a decision that we have found was not \u201ccompletely irrational,\u201d the arbitrator determined that the easement over the \u201cjeep trails\u201d described in those agreements was, in the words of appellees\u2019 counsel at oral argument, \u201cdefective,\u201d because the Health Department Plan on which the easement was based did not show the trails extending to Morgan Station Road or to Lot 2. But, this does not negate Ryan and Jekel\u2019s clearly-expressed intent to create an easement over Lot 1 for ingress and egress to Lot 2. Nor, critically, does it negate the <em>necessity </em>for such an easement; without the easement, Lot 2 is rendered inaccessible.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The situation is akin to <em>Condry v. Laurie, supra, </em>184 Md. 317, 41 A.2d 66. In that case, Condry\u2019s predecessor in title, Rephorn, conveyed a portion of his property to the Hittles, who were predecessors in title of Laurie. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 41 A.2d 66. Rephorn retained a tract that separated the Hittles\u2019 property from the county road. <em>Id. </em>The Hittles\u2019 deed to their property granted them \u201ca \u2018license to use the private road from the County Road to and from the property now conveyed ... while they shall remain owners of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting deed). After Condry and Laurie acquired their respective titles to the adjoining properties (after a lengthy chain of title in each case), Condry barricaded the private road across his property, allegedly preventing Laurie from accessing his own parcel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The Court rejected Condry\u2019s argument that, by granting an explicit license to the Hittles, Rephorn had negated an implied easement by necessity. The <em>Condry </em>Court explained that a critical difference between a license and an easement is that a license \u201c \u2018ceases with the death of either party, and cannot be transferred or alienated by the licensee, because it is a personal matter,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 320, 41 A.2d 66 (citation omitted), while an easement runs with the land and is binding on successors in title. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 323, 41 A.2d 66:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">While the Hittles were given a license to use the designated road only as long as they remained owners of the parcel conveyed, the license did not imply that future owners might be barred from access to the county road. When the licensees were no longer owners of the property, succeeding owners were still entitled to a way of necessity, although the way might not necessarily be the same as that used by the licensees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Millson v. Laughlin, supra, </em>217 Md. 576, 142 A.2d 810, is also instructive. There, the predecessors in title of adjoining landowners had executed an express easement for the dominant owner to travel across the servient owner\u2019s land. <em>Id. </em>at 580-82, 142 A.2d 810. The question before the Court was whether the existence of the express easement for ingress and egress compelled the conclusion that the dominant owner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not entitled to an implied easement by necessity for an electric pole and wires that ran across the servient property to provide electrical service to her house. <em>Id. </em>at 580, 142 A.2d 810. Relying on <em>Condry, </em>the Court determined that the servient owner was entitled to the implied easement. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 142 A.2d 810. It explained, <em>id. </em>at 588-84, 142 A.2d 810:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">[T]he express easement of travel should not be held as establishing an intention on the part of the parties not to grant an easement which was clearly necessary and perfectly obvious.... It was contended [in <em>Condry </em>] that the express grant [of a license] for a limited time negated an implied grant of a way of necessity.... [B]ut the <em>[Condry </em>Court] held that the succeeding owners were entitled to a way of necessity which had been granted by way of implica-tion____ The court concludes that the appellant has an easement to maintain the electric line across the property of the appellee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Similarly, in this case, the parties\u2019 execution of an express easement for ingress and egress that later turned out to be \u201cdefective,\u201d so as not to actually provide ingress and egress, cannot supply a supposed intent of the parties to landlock Lot 2, so as to defeat the presumption of an easement. Although it was defective for its intended purpose, the express easement demonstrated the clear intent of the parties\u2019 predecessors not to landlock Lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In sum, here the arbitrator ruled that there was no implied easement by necessity because it was \u201cnot needed,\u201d although the Award, on its face, found the existence of all of the predicates of an implied easement by necessity. This error is central to the dispute at hand.

The arbitrator evidently concluded that the clear and unambiguous import of the Health Department Plan was that the jeep trails did not reach Morgan Station Road. Although we must defer to the arbitrator\u2019s construction of the Second Jeep Trail Agreement, we note that it is in some tension with the \"cardinal rule of contract interpretation,\u201d which \"is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d <em>Tomran, Inc. v.

It is also plain from the record that the arbitrator was made aware of the law regarding implied easements by necessity when appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>filed his Motion to Reconsider (if not earlier in the arbitration proceeding), but \u201cproceeded to disregard\u201d the applicable law. <em>MCR, supra, </em>148 Md.App. at 120, 811 A.2d 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">.

We express no view as to whether the issue of the location of the implied easement is within the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement. <em>See NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v.
