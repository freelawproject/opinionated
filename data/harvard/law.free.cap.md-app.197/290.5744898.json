EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The primary issue presented by this appeal involves the interpretation of a \u201cworkers compensation and employers liability\u201d policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) and, specifically, a \u201cresidual market limited other states insurance endorsement\u201d (the \u201cEndorsement\u201d). The Policy was issued in Delaware by American Zurich Insurance Company (\u201cZurich\u201d), appellant, to A <em>&amp; </em>B Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cA &amp; B\u201d), with its principal place of business in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">A &amp; B contracted with Richard Townsend, a resident of Salisbury, Maryland, to build a pole building on Mr. Townsend\u2019s land, located near Salisbury. A <em>&amp; </em>B then subcontracted the work to Wayne and Marie Travis, Delaware residents, doing business as WMT Contracting (\u2018WMT\u201d). Dean J. Young, a Delaware resident, was employed by WMT; while working on the job site near Salisbury, he fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Mr. Young filed a workers compensation claim against WMT in Delaware but did not collect benefits because WMT was uninsured. Mr. Young then filed a workers compensation claim in Maryland against WMT. The Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cUEF\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, appellee, impleaded both A &amp; B as statutory employer, and its insurer, Zurich. The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) concluded that A <em>&amp; </em>B was a statutory employer, Mr. Young sustained a compensable injury, and the Policy provided coverage for the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Zurich petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court affirmed, and this appeal followed. In an opinion filed on November 3, 2010, we affirmed the judgment. On December 1, 2010, Zurich filed a motion for reconsideration. Because we agreed that Zurich\u2019s motion had merit, we granted it and withdrew our earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>opinion. Albeit for a different reason than originally stated, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">A <em>&amp; </em>B was in the business of constructing \u201cfarm buildings,\u201d \u201cfood shelters,\u201d and \u201cpost frame buildings.\u201d A &amp; B performed 90% of its work in Delaware and 10% of its work in Maryland. Mr. Young sustained an accidental injury on May 16, 2005, while working on a pole building near Salisbury, in the course of his employment by WMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Mr. Young was hired by WMT, in Delaware, a few days prior to May 16. WMT performed 95% of its work in Delaware, 3% of its work in Maryland, and 2% of its work in Virginia. Consequently, Mr. Young understood that he would generally work in Delaware, with the rest of his work time in Maryland. A &amp; B anticipated that construction of the pole building would take approximately a month. Mr. Young started working on the pole building near Salisbury on May 12. He was involved only in the framing and was expected to complete his work on May 17, had the accident not intervened. On each day, Mr. Young traveled from his home in Delaware to WMT\u2019s place of business in Delaware and, from there, Mr. Travis transported Mr. Young and other employees to the job site. After Mr. Young sustained an accidental injury, he continued to work for WMT at a job site in Delaware but, because of his injuries, was able to work only one day. In July, 2005, he attempted to return to work for WMT, but WMT did not respond to his efforts to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In December, 2006, Mr. Young filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against WMT in Delaware, with that state\u2019s Industrial Accident Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), seeking benefits. On February 9, 2007, the Board found that WMT admitted that Mr. Young sustained an injury during the course of employment but that WMT was uninsured at the time of the accidental injury. The Board found that the claim was compensable and required WMT to post a bond to secure the payment of compensation. Apparently, WMT did not post the bond, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>after Mr. Young failed to appear for a hearing scheduled on June 28, 2007, the Board dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">On February 28, 2007, Mr. Young filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in Maryland. On May 29, 2008, after A &amp; B and Zurich had been added as parties, the Commission held a hearing. On June 5, 2008, the Commission issued an order, in which it ruled that Mr. Young was employed by WMT; that WMT was uninsured; that A &amp; B was the statutory employer of Mr. Young; that A &amp; B was covered by the Policy; and that Mr. Young had sustained a compensable injury. With respect to coverage, the Commission found that A <em>&amp; </em>B was covered by the Policy by virtue of the terms of the Endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On July 7, 2008, Zurich filed a petition for judicial review in circuit court. Zurich and UEF each filed a motion for summary judgment. On June 23, 2009, the circuit court, after holding a hearing, granted UEF\u2019s motion and denied Zurich\u2019s motion. In holding that there was coverage, the court relied heavily on <em>Kacur v. Employers Mutual, </em>253 Md. 500, 254 A.2d 156 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Zurich filed a motion for reconsideration, and the court denied it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>The Policy and Endorsement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The Policy was issued in Delaware. In the application for the Policy, A &amp; B stated that it did not conduct operations in states other than Delaware. The \u201cinformation page\u201d of the Policy reflects that the Policy period was from July 21, 2004 to July 21, 2005. Thus, the Policy was in effect at the time of Mr. Young\u2019s injury. The same page, in paragraph 3.A, provides that the workers compensation portion of the coverage \u201capplies to the Workers Compensation Law of [Delaware].\u201d Under a heading entitled, \u201cOTHER STATES INSURANCE,\u201d the Endorsement is referenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The Endorsement is entitled \u201cRESIDUAL MARKET LIMITED OTHER STATES INSURANCE ENDORSEMENT\u201d and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>A.

Zurich contends that the Endorsement is applicable, and its language controls the outcome of this case. Zurich concedes that subsection A.l.a. is satisfied because Mr. Young was hired in the state of Delaware. Zurich contends that A.l.b. requires that all three sub parts, <em>ie., </em>(i), (ii), and (iii), must be satisfied in order for subsection b. to be satisfied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>According to Zurich, because A <em>&amp; </em>B was required, by Maryland law, to obtain insurance for its Maryland operations, relying on the statutes referenced above, <em>Smigelski v. Potomac Insurance Company of Illinois, </em>403 Md. 55, 62, 939 A.2d 189 (2008), and <em>Granite State Ins. Co. v. Hernandez, </em>191 Md.App. 548, 567, 992 A.2d 528 (2010), subsection (ii) is not satisfied. Additionally, there is no evidence that A &amp; B is an authorized self insurer, and thus, subsection (iii) is not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Zurich also contends that Mr. Young\u2019s work in Maryland was not temporary, and thus, subsection A.l.c. is not satisfied. Relying heavily on <em>Granite State, supra, </em>Zurich argues that Mr. Young was \u201cregularly employed\u201d in Maryland and a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">With respect to the decision in <em>Kacur, supra, </em>relied on by the circuit court, Zurich argues that it stands for the proposition that if a workers\u2019 compensation claimant has a choice of fora, the employer and its workers\u2019 compensation insurer are liable for benefits in either forum. Zurich explains that <em>Kacur </em>holds that an insurer is liable in a given forum only to the extent that the insurer would have been liable if the claimant had filed in another available forum. In this case, Zurich argues, <em>Kacur </em>does not apply because, as of the time of Mr. Young\u2019s accidental injury, Delaware did not recognize the statutory employer doctrine. Thus, according to Zurich, had Mr. Young filed a claim in Delaware against A &amp; B, it would have been denied. In other words, while Mr. Young had a choice of fora as to WMT, it did not have a choice as to A &amp; B. Moreover, Zurich observes that, in <em>Kacur, </em>there was no endorsement similar to the Endorsement in this case. Zurich argues that the <em>Kacur </em>decision rested on the intention of the parties, not on public policy independent of the applicable policy\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">UEF contends that there is coverage under the terms of the Endorsement. UEF, observing that \u201cor\u201d is disjunctive, argues that A.l.b. is satisfied if either (i), (ii), or (iii) is satisfied. Thus, according to UEF, A.l.b. is satisfied because Zurich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>concedes that A &amp; B did not have \u201cother workers compensation insurance coverage\u201d in Maryland, <em>see </em>(i), and it was not an authorized self insurer, <em>see </em>(iii). In addition, UEF argues that, because Mr. Young was employed in this State temporarily, separate coverage was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">UEF contends that the terms of A.l.c. are satisfied because Mr. Young\u2019s employment in Maryland was temporary. UEF argues that the concept is fact based, there was substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s determination, and it should be affirmed. With respect to the Endorsement, UEF also argues that, to the extent the Endorsement is ambiguous, it should be construed against Zurich.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Finally, UEF contends that <em>Kacur </em>also provides a basis for coverage, not dependent on the terms of the Policy. UEF argues that whether Delaware recognized statutory employer liability at the pertinent time is irrelevant to a <em>Kacur </em>analysis. Because Mr. Young had a choice of proceeding in Maryland or Delaware as to WMT, and his claim was compensable in both, <em>Kacur </em>applies. In addition, UEF takes issue with Zurich\u2019s assertion that Delaware did not recognize statutory employer liability at the time of the injury. Lastly, UEF contends that had Mr. Young pursued a claim in Delaware against A &amp; B, under Delaware\u2019s choice of law rules, the Delaware Board would have applied Maryland\u2019s law relating to statutory employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Ordinarily, a decision of the Commission is entitled to deferential judicial review, as is generally true when reviewing administrative decisions. <em>See, e.g., W.M. Schlosser v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>414 Md. 195, 203, 204, 994 A.2d 956 (2010) and <em>Granite State, </em>191 Md.App. at 557, 558, 992 A.2d 528.

Orient Express Delivery Serv., </em>190 Md.App. 438, 451, 988 A.2d 1120 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As previously stated, A <em>&amp; </em>B is a statutory employer and, thus, is liable for benefits. The question of insurance coverage turns on the language in the Endorsement. Subsections a., b., and c. of the Endorsement are joined by \u201cand,\u201d and all have to be satisfied. Subsection a. is satisfied if Mr. Young was hired in Delaware or was, at the time of injury, principally employed in Delaware. The three sub-parts in b. are joined by \u201cor,\u201d and are disjunctive, but because the lead in phrase is in the negative (\u201cWe will pay when ... the employee ... is not claiming benefits in a state where----\u201d), satisfaction of any of the three sub-parts prevents coverage. Thus, subsection b. is satisfied if A &amp; B had other coverage, was required, by virtue of its operations in Maryland, to have separate coverage, or was a self-insurer. Subsection c. is satisfied if the duration of the work being performed by Mr. Young was temporary. In essence, the Endorsement provides coverage for temporary operations, even though the operations are outside of the named state of coverage, unless the employer has other workers compensation coverage, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>employer is required to have separate coverage in the outside state, or is a self-insurer in the outside state.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We conclude that the Endorsement provides coverage in this instance. Mr. Young was hired in Delaware, and thus, A.l.a. is satisfied. Under subsection A.l.b., A &amp; B did not have other workers compensation insurance in Maryland and was not an authorized self-insurer in Maryland. Thus, the question is whether A &amp; B was required to have \u201cseparate workers compensation insurance coverage\u201d in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In Maryland, an employee is a \u201ccovered employee\u201d if injured in this State, <em>see </em>LE \u00a7 9-203(a), unless the employee was a \u201ccasual employee,\u201d <em>see </em>LE \u00a7 9-205, or was in this State only \u201cintermittently or temporarily,\u201d <em>see </em>LE \u00a7 9-203(b)(l), and the other requirements of LE \u00a7 9-203(b)(l) are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">With respect to \u00a7 9-205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Although the term is not defined by statute, \u201cthis Court has consistently held that ... application of the term, \u2018casual employee,\u2019 should be made according to the particular facts presented in each case.\u201d <em>Wood v.

Some of the factors we use to determine whether an employee is a casual employee are: the nature of the work, the duration of the employment, and the nature of the contract of employment. <em>Wood, </em>268 Md. at 222, 300 A.2d at 669 (quoting <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, 53, 187 A. 887, 893 (1936)). We use these factors to determine whether an employment arrangement is casual, and the question \u201cmust be determined with principal reference to the scope and purpose of the hiring rather than with sole regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>duration and regularity of the service.\u201d <em>State Accident Fund v. Jacobs, </em>134 Md. 133, 135, 106 A. 255, 255 (1919).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Smigelski v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>403 Md. 55, 62-63, 939 A.2d 189 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In this case, the evidence is that Mr. Young was hired as a regular employee, with the intention by both employer and employee that he would continue employment for a regular and indefinite term. Thus, he was not a \u201ccasual\u201d employee within the meaning of \u00a7 9-205, and there is no contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In our earlier opinion, we noted that a nonresident individual hired in another state is not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d in Maryland if working in this State \u201cintermittently or temporarily.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-203(b)(l). Relying heavily on \u00a7 9-203(b)(l)(i), (ii), and (in), we concluded that separate coverage was not required in Maryland. In doing so, we noted that \u00a7 9\u2014203(b)(1) contains other requirements, <em>see </em>(in), (iv), and (v), but observed that the parties did not raise them.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On motion for reconsideration, Zurich pointed out that the basis of our decision was not the basis relied on by the Commission and was not raised in this Court. Additionally, in its motion, Zurich argued that, contrary to our belief, Delaware does not have a reciprocal arrangement with this State that would fulfill the requirements of subsections (iii), (iv), and (v). In response to Zurich\u2019s motion, UEF argued, inter alia, that Delaware does have a statute that satisfies the reciprocity requirement. We agree with Zurich that the issue was not the basis of the Commission\u2019s decision; consequently, we accept that Mr. Young was a \u201ccovered employee,\u201d and that, for present purposes only, Delaware does not satisfy the reciprocity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Nevertheless, we reach the same result, for a different reason. The Endorsement provides coverage under the law of states other than Delaware, in its lead-in clause (\u201cwe will pay ... benefits required of you by workers compensation law of any state [other than Delaware] ... if all of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>conditions are met.\u201d). Thus, if the subsections are satisfied, the effect is coverage for benefits required by <em>Maryland law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Maryland requires insurance coverage coextensive with liability for benefits, but the statutory and regulatory requirements related to insurers address insurers doing business in Maryland and issuing policies in Maryland. Typically, such policies are issued to Maryland employers or employers doing regular business in Maryland. Such employers are required to have coverage that is in full compliance with all of Maryland\u2019s laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Obviously, if coverage exists under the Endorsement, there is insurance coverage for Mr. Young\u2019s injuries. The Endorsement does not state, however, that merely because the state in which injury occurred requires insurance coverage, coverage does not exist under the Endorsement. The Endorsement provides coverage unless \u201cby virtue of the nature of [A <em>&amp; </em>B\u2019s] operations,\u201d in Maryland, A <em>&amp; </em>B was required by Maryland law \u201cto have obtained separate workers compensation insurance coverage....\u201d A &amp; B did not regularly do business in Maryland; as discussed below, Mr. Young was working in Maryland temporarily; coverage under the Endorsement satisfies Maryland law; and A &amp; B was not required to have <em>separate </em>coverage in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellant relies on language in <em>Smigelsld </em>and <em>Granite State </em>for the proposition that subsection b. (ii) is satisfied if Maryland requires any insurance coverage, as it does, for Mr. Young as a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d In both cases, the insurance policy at issue contained an endorsement the same as the one in this case. The issue was not a holding by the Court in either case, however. In <em>Smigelsld, </em>the employee was a Virginia resident who was employed in Virginia and was injured in Maryland. 403 Md. at 57, 939 A.2d 189. A jury found that the employee was regularly employed in this State and not working in the State temporarily. Similarly, in <em>Granite State, </em>the employer was in Virginia, the employee was hired in Maryland, the employee was injured in Maryland, and the employee was principally employed in Maryland. 191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Md.App. at 553, 992 A.2d 528. Thus, the employee was not hired in Virginia and was not working in this State temporarily-</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Appellant\u2019s interpretation of the Endorsement renders nugatory the word \u201cseparate.\u201d Our interpretation is consistent with the purpose and intent of the Endorsement, read in its entirety. Thus, if an employee employed in the state of coverage, in this instance Delaware, is injured in another state which provides for benefits under its laws, in this instance Maryland, but the employer does not regularly do business in that state, and the employee is performing work in that state on a temporary basis, the Endorsement provides coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">This brings us to subsection c. The question of whether work is temporary is often a question of fact, but no issue of fact has been raised by the parties. Each party asserts that it is correct as a matter of law. Under LE \u00a7 9-745(a), the decision of the Commission is prima facie correct. Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot hold as a matter of law that Mr. Young was not \u201ctemporarily\u201d in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Consequently, we conclude that the \u201cduration of the work being performed by [Mr. Young was] temporary,\u201d within the meaning of A.l.c. Mr. Young was expected to work in Maryland only for a few days. In <em>Granite State, </em>the employee was employed in Maryland, worked on three projects in Maryland, and was injured in Maryland. The employer, who was insured in Virginia, argued that its intention was for the employee to work primarily in Virginia in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 992 A.2d 528. We held that what might happen in the future was mere speculation and conjecture, and consequently, for coverage purposes, the employee was principally employed in Maryland, not Virginia, at the time of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 992 A.2d 528. In <em>Granite State, </em>the terms of the policy included an endorsement identical to the Endorsement in this case. As a result of our conclusion, the Endorsement did not provide coverage because A.l.a. was not satisfied (the employee was not hired in Virginia and was not principally employed in Virginia). In addition, with respect to A.I.C., we observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>there was not evidence that the employee\u2019s \u201cwork in Maryland was temporary to otherwise regular work in Virginia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 992 A.2d 528. In the case before us, there was evidence that it was the present intention of the parties to the employment agreement that Mr. Young generally work in Delaware. The parties expected that Mr. Young would be in Maryland only a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">To recap, Mr. Young was hired in Delaware within the meaning of A.l.a. Maryland did not require \u201cseparate workers compensation insurance coverage\u201d within the meaning of A.l.b. of the Endorsement. Mr. Young\u2019s work in Maryland was temporary within the meaning of A.l.c.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As a result of this conclusion, we need not reach the parties\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
