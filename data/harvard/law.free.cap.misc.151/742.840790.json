Van Schaick, as Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, for an Order to Take Possession of the Property of and Rehabilitate the New York Title and Mortgage Company. In the Matter of the Application of George S. Van Schaick, as Superintendent of Insurance, for an Order Authorizing the Exchange of Bonds and Mortgages Held as Collateral Security for Mortgage Participation Certificates Issued by New York Title and Mortgage Company, and Designated as Series <em>\u201c </em>S-1,\u201d for Bonds of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, Pursuant to the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933, as Amended.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b758-9\">Supreme Court, New York County,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Afd\">May 25, 1934.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>Harry Rodwin [Harry Rodwin, Irving H.

Chapter 792 of the Laws of 1933, as amended by chapter 115 of the Laws of 1934,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> expressly authorizes the Superintendent of Insurance, as rehabilitator of an insurance company, to exchange bonds and mortgages for bonds of Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation <em>\u201c without an order of the court or other </em>authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In so far as the Superintendent seeks the permission of the court to exchange bonds and mortgages in the possession of the depositary for bonds of Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation <em>of a smaller face amount, </em>a different situation is presented. It is questionable whether chapter 792 of the Laws of 1933, as amended by chapter 115 of the Laws of 1934, authorizes such an exchange. It is unnecessary, however, to determine this question upon the present application, in view of the fact that the court is of the opinion that no application for <em>blanket </em>authority to accept in exchange Home Owners\u2019 bonds of a smaller face amount than that of the bonds and mortgages now in the possession of the depositary, should be granted. A separate application should be made in each instance where such exchange is proposed, based upon the specific facts claimed to justify the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">For the reasons indicated the motion is denied, but without prejudice to the making of separate applications in each instance where the Superintendent proposes to accept Home Owners\u2019 bonds of a smaller face amount than that of the bonds and mortgages to be delivered in exchange.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\"> Real Property Law, \u00a7 278, added by Laws of 1933, chap. 792, as amd. by Laws of 1934, chap. 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
