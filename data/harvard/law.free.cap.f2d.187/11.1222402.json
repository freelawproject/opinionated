We agree with them, too, that the case, having been tried and determined adversely to appellants on the theories they elected to try it on, may not be retried here on the wholly different one they now propose to try out,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-15\">.
