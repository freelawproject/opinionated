It will, therefore, serve no useful purpose to set out and discuss the facts in detail. It will suffice for us to say, as we do, that the judgment will be modified by allowing plaintiff to recover of McCullough the $10,000 found as the amount of his damages, and, as so modified, it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Modified and affirmed with costs of appeal against McCullough.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-25\">.
