We do not, however, write, we only apply, the law as it has been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">So applying it, we hold unfounded: (1) respondent\u2019s complaint of the amended charges as not within the scope of the charge as originally filed; and (2) its complaint that the findings on which the order rests are without adequate support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">In view, however, of the long lapse of time since the last certification, the decree granting enforcement must carry a provision to the effect that respondent, while obligated to bargain with the union \u201cas the representative of its employees until the fact that it is not, is made to appear\u201d, has the right to have determined by an election or other satisfactory method whether in fact the union is such and to act upon that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">Petition granted and enforcement decree, as suggested, authorized.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
