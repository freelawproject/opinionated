They urge upon us that the judgment should, therefore, have 'been for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the amounts ascertained by him to be due rather than for those stated 'by plaintiffs\u2019 accountant Moore, and that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We agree with appellants that there is no basis in the evidence in this and the record on the former appeal for fixing December 31st as the termination date of the partnership relations between Boy-lan, Glasscheib, and the Detrios. These relations were terminated on July 31, 1945, the time of the \u201cblow-up\u201d when there was a separation by agreement as to all the Detrios except Louis and Sylvester, and as to them by and because of appellees\u2019 breach of the partnership contract and expulsion of these two from its activities and fruits.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We cannot, though, agree with appellants that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover for the damages suffered by them as a result of the breach of the partnership agreement. Nor can we agree that ap-pellees\u2019 recovery should be limited to the amount which plaintiffs\u2019 accountant reported as due them.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> We think it clear that, since the failure of the partnership to continue as such was due to the wrongful act of appellants in breaking their agreement with appellees, both appellees were entitled to recover, in addition to realized profits, the damages caused to them by the breach. These damages, of course, like the accounting for profits, to be based upon evidence and not upon mere speculation or conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">An examination of the evidence on which the judgment below rests, in the light of these facts, leaves us in no doubt that it may not stand as rendered but must be substantially revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">As to the accounting for profits realized, this reduction may be accomplished by taking the figure of Moore, plaintiffs\u2019 accountant, as of July 31st, instead of December 31st. This, as to Louis Detrio, would be $19,261.81, and, as to Sylvester, would be $11,258.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">As to the accounting for the loss to each of them by breach, we think the evidence taken as a whole furnishes no support either for the theory or the amount of the estimate of Moore, plaintiffs\u2019 accountant, which the district judge accepted. Indeed it rebuts as clearly erroneous his allowance of $50,000 damages to Louis Detrio and $6500 to Sylvester Detrio. The evidence on both trials, taken as a whole, will not support a finding of more than half of those sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">The judgment in favor of the appellees will, therefore, be modified by reducing it as to Louis Detrio to $45,261.81, and, as to Sylvester Detrio, to $14,508.43, and, as modified, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-16\">.
