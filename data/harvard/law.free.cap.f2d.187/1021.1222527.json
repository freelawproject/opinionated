The findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Therefore, these are binding upon us, and the judgment stands. Based on the findings, plaintiff was awarded commission in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">We affirm upon the basis of the excellent opinion of the Trial Court, 91 F.Supp. 61.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
