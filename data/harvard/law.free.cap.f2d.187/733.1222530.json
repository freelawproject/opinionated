Plaintiff had a verdict and judgment in the trial court and the defendant appeals. No federal question is involved; the federal court has jurisdiction on grounds of diversity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>only. Nor does the case present any legal question on which the parties are in dispute. The plaintiff\u2019s verdict was for considerably less than he claimed, but he makes no point of that. Questions of fact were submitted to a jury by the Trial Judge and we do not find in the verdict or the manner m which the case was submitted any error which seems to us grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
