Judgment of restitution for the use and benefit of the tenants overcharged was rendered, and the usual injunction was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-22\">Appellant concedes that if the accommodations owned by him are rooming houses the judgment is correct. He contends that he operates apartment houses; that he attempted to register under the controlled housing rent regulation which applies to apartments and similar accommodations; that the area rent director wrongfully refused to process his registrations; and that the provisions of the price regulations on rooming houses do not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-23\">This contention has no merit. The District Court found as a fact that the houses involved were rooming houses. This finding is supported by the testimony of a witness that he occupied one partly furnished room and that there was but one bathroom in a building used by fifteen tenants. The landlord\u2019s practice of charging rates that varied, depending upon the number of occupants is a characteristic of the operation of rooming houses rather than apartments, as also the statement of extras submitted with the registrations for appellant\u2019s accommodations, reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">\u201cLite over 60-W, 500, Radio 250, E. Iron 500, Parking, $1.50, extra person, $4.00, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>E. Heater, $3.00, E. Plate, $3.00, pets $3.00 and E. blankets extra.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">These practices clearly support the conclusion of the District Court. Such accommodations could not be considered \u201cfacilities commonly regarded in the community as necessary for a self-contained dwelling unit, and of a class of accommodations customarily rented without variations in rent,\u201d that is, apartments. 12 Fed.Reg. 4302, Rent Regulations under the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, \u00a7 825.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
