From the return it appears that the relator is an alien who entered the United States in June 1949 as a deserting seaman. In March 1950 an immigration warrant of arrest was served upon him and he was released on a $500 administrative bond. On the basis of information subsequently obtained his release on bond was terminated and he was detained without bond under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781 et seq. Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>trative hearings with respect to deporting him are still pending. The return states ample ground for revoking the bail as a matter of discretion. Whether the Internal Security Act of 1950 gives the Attorney General unreviewable discretion as to release on bail, we need not decide. Even if it be assumed that the Attorney General\u2019s action is judicially reviewable, the alien must show an abuse of discretion in the denial of bail before he is entitled to be released. See United States ex rel. Potash v. District Director, 2 Cir., 169 F.2d 747. In the case at bar no proof was offered to contradict the allegations of the return. The order is reversed with directions to dismiss the writ and order the relator back into custody. Our mandate will be issued forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
