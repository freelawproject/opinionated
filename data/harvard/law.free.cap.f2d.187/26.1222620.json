Indeed, they do not resist enforcement of paragraphs 1(b) and 2(b) of the order based on this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-23\">The finding of Sec. 8(5) violations is concurred in by three, and dissented from by two, members of the Board, and Respondent vigorously contests its correctness and resists enforcement of the order based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-24\">In agreement, as we are, with the views ol the dissenting members, it will serve no useful purpose for us to do more than say that the contested finding is not well based, and the order based on it will not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Of the supplemental contention put forward for the first time in the Board\u2019s brief that our opinion in Holmes Company v. N. L. R. B., 179 F.2d 876, requires enforcement, it is sufficient to say that that case is not in point on the facts and that what was there decided does not support the enforcement contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The enforcement prayer will be granted as to paragraphs 1(b) and 2(b) and (c), but denied as to paragraphs 1(a) and 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Enforcement granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
