For the reasons stated in the opinion filed by Judge Mur-dock for the Tax Court in banc, 13 T.C. 869, we are satisfied that the trusts were not subject to the decedent\u2019s power to terminate them. The Tax Court, therefore, rightly held that they were not subject to the estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-20\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
