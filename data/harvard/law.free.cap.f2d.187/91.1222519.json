S. Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers Club, European Theater,\u201d which is an unincorporated association of certain Army personnel as described by its title, and certain alleged \u201csupervisory agents\u201d of the Club, including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Under Secretary of the Army, the Quartermaster General, and other officers. Appellant sued appellees for breach of contract. However, appellant\u2019s brief states that the \u201cindividual defendants were named solely for the purpose of acquiring jurisdiction over the defendant association. Judgment is sought only against the defendant association and not against the individual defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-20\"> Like post exchanges, the appellee Club is organized, under Army regulations, for the benefit of army personnel. The Supreme Court has said that post exchanges \u201care integral parts of the War Department, share in fulfilling the duties entrusted to it, and partake of whatever immunities it may have under the constitution and federal statutes.\u201d Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, 316 U.S. 481, 485, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 1170, 86 L.Ed. 1611. It would seem to follow that appellee Club is an integral part of the War Department\u2019s sue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cessor, the Department of the Army, and partakes of its immunity to suit without the consent of the United States. But we need not decide that question, for even if the Club is not immune to suit it is not within the jurisdiction of the courts in this suit. It operates in Germany and carries on no activities in the District of Columbia. None of the individuals named as defendants, or served with process, has any authority to sue or be sued, or accept service, on the Club\u2019s behalf. Accordingly the complaint was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
