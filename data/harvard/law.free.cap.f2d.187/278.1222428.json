The claim that there was trademark infringement was dismissed, because of the local, intrastate nature of defendant\u2019s business, however, the district court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s claim as to unfair competition and entered a judgment and decree, permanently enjoining and restraining defendant from using the word \u201cJewel\u201d or any name similar to or in imitation thereof in the names of his stores, and in, about or in connection with the conduct and operation of his business in the city of Chicago, its suburbs, and the State of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">Jewel Tea Company was incorporated as an Illinois corporation in 1904. Jewel Tea Company, Inc., the plaintiff herein, is a New York corporation incorporated on January 14, 1916, and was authorized to do business in Illinois on January 16, 1916. Plaintiff acquired the assets of the previously incorporated Illinois corporation. On March 8, 1932, Jewel Food Stores, Inc., was incorporated as a New York corporation. It merged with plaintiff on February 19, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">In the beginning plaintiff engaged in merchandising certain food products by means of wagons and trucks. At the time of trial plaintiff had routes for door-to-door delivery in 41 States. From March 11, 1932, until the merger on February 19, 1934, Jewel Food Stores, Inc., as a subsidiary of plaintiff, operated a chain of retail grocery stores in Chicago and suburbs. At the time of the trial plaintiff operated 150 retail food stores in the Chicago area, including fotir in Berwyn, two in Cicero and seven in Oak Park, under the name \u201cJewel Food Stores, A Department of Jewel Tea Co., Inc.\u201d Since February 19, 1934, the name \u201cJewel Food Stores, Inc.\u201d has not been used as a corporate name by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Plaintiff\u2019s business is nationwide in scope and from 1936 to 1945 plaintiff spent $1,-500,000 in advertising its business conducted in its stores. In 1945 its total store business was in excess of $37,000,000, of which more than $4,000,000 was from the sale <em>o\u2018 </em>dairy products. Plaintiff first sold ice cream in its stores commencing in February, 1945, and sold it in packages bearing the name \u201cJewel\u201d since August 1, <em>1946.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">Plaintiff first used the word \u201cJewel\u201d on a store sign on November 1, 1932. At the trial it was stipulated, \u201cNo store or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>establishment has been found dealing in food of any sort under the name \u2018Jewel\u2019 prior to plaintiff\u2019s opening of their (sic) food stores as stipulated hereinabove.\u201d On November 1, 1934, plaintiff first installed a sign on one of its stores, containing the word \u201cJewel\u201d in large letters and the words \u201cFood\u201d and \u201cStore\u201d on either side in smaller letters. In every store sign used by plaintiff since November, 1932, on the outside of its store buildings, which signs were visible to the public, the word \u201cJewel\u201d appeared in letters twice as high and wide as the letters in other words appearing on the sign. The words \u201cJewel Tea\u201d have never been used in combination on store signs by the plaintiff or by Jewel Food Stores, Inc. In 1945, 16% of the grocery items sold by plaintiff in its stores bore the name \u201cJewel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Plaintiff uses one of three types of signs on its stores: The type most commonly used has the word \u201cJewel\u201d in the center and has two side panels, the one on the left containing the words \u201cServe Yourself\u201d and the one on the right containing the words \u201cSave Money.\u201d In the second type the word \u201cJewel\u201d is in the center while the left panel contains the word \u201cFood\u201d and the right panel contains the word \u201cStore.\u201d And in the third type only the word \u201cJewel\u201d is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Defendant entered the milk business in 1930 in Cicero, Illinois, operating a retail dairy selling milk, cream, butter, eggs and cheese. In 1934 defendant opened two retail milk stores in Cicero, specializing in the sale of milk in gallon jugs. At the time of the trial defendant owned and operated eight stores located in Berwyn, Cicero and Oak Park. One of defendant\u2019s stores was located immediately adjacent to and in the same building as one of plaintiff\u2019s stores,' one was located five doors from the nearest store of plaintiff; and the remaining six were located respectively 1, 2, 6, 7, 14 and 17 blocks distant from the nearest store operated by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The largest volume of defendant\u2019s business is in the sale of dairy products, but he also sells a line of miscellaneous grocery items. The word \u201cJewel\u201d or \u201cJewels\u201d in combination with the. word \u201cDairy\u201d was first used by defendant on a milk and dairy store in 1940. The name \u201cJewel\u201d was first placed by the defendant on a product \u2014 ice cream \u2014 in 1940. On September 30, 1946, defendant, doing business as Jewel Milk Stores, registered the name \u201cJewel\u201d with the Secretary of the State of Illinois, and was issued a certificate of registration. The word \u201cJewel\u201d has not and presently is not being used by defendant on any product other than ice cream. In 1945 defendant\u2019s total business amounted to $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Contending that the likelihood of confusion is negligible defendant points to a number of differences in the physical characteristics and methods of operation between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s stores: plaintiff\u2019s stores are larger than defendant\u2019s, and are largely self-serviced, thus involving a difference in interior arrangements; defendant\u2019s stores are open Sundays, holidays and until eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, whereas plaintiff\u2019s stores are closed at such times (at least they were prior to the time of the trial) ; plaintiff does not sell milk in gallon or half-gallon containers whereas such sales are large items of defendant\u2019s business; defendant uses window signs, \u201cJewel Milk Stores,\u201d in which the word \u201cJewel\u201d is in script in white letters on a black background, whereas in plaintiff\u2019s signs the word \u201cJewel\u201d is not in script and is in black letters on a white background; plaintiff\u2019s employees wear distinctive uniforms, whereas those of defendant do not; and further, defendant\u2019s stores do not sell fruits, vegetables and fresh meats.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The district court found that the plaintiff had so identified the word \u201cJewel\u201d with itself in connection with the retail grocery business in Chicago and suburbs as to give it a secondary meaning as applied to the business in which it is engaged; that defendant is a subsequent user of the word \u201cJewel\u201d and that the businesses conducted by plaintiff and defendant are so similar that there has been, and there will be a likelihood of, confusion by the public, trade and customers; that the testimony disclosed instances of actual confusion between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s stores; and that there existed in the minds of the public an association between the word \u201cJewel\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>There is no hard and fast rule by which it can be determined when a court should interfere by injunction to prevent unfair methods of business. Many of the decisions on the question of unfair competition seem to be in conflict. One line of cases adopts a narrow rule of construction, where the word appropriated as a trade-mark or trade name was originally descriptive and thus is not distinctive, while another line of cases extends broad protection where the trade-mark or trade name is arbitrary and fanciful. Consideration is also given in many cases as to whether the trade-mark or trade name is \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak.\u201d In other cases the matter of prime concern is whether competition actually existed between the parties in the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"> Whether a claim based on unfair competition exists depends upon the peculiar facts of each case. Sinko v. Snow-Craggs Corp., 7 Cir., 105 F.2d 450, 452. Generally speaking, however, it can be said that in all cases of unfair competition it is the principles of old-fashioned honesty which are controlling. Radio Shack Corp. v. Radio Shack, Inc., 7 Cir., 180 F.2d 200, 206. Also we must follow the rule stated by the Supreme Court in Pecheur Lozenge Co., Inc. v. National Candy Co., Inc., 315 U.S. 666, 62 S.Ct. 853, 86 L.Ed. 1103; Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild of America, Inc., v. Federal Trade Commission, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949, and apply the appropriate State law, which in this case is that of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The word \u201cJewel\u201d has been widely used in connection with various products. It has been registered at the U. S. Patent Office 25 times by others than plaintiff on food products, 93 times on other classes of goods, and 67 times in combination with other words. In its usual and ordinary connotation \u201cJewel\u201d refers to a precious stone, gem or ornament. In a secondary or figurative sense, it stands for high quality, merit or value.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">When plaintiff adopted the name \u201cJewel\u201d as a part of its corporate name, and when plaintiff and defendant used the word \u201cJewel\u201d as a part of the name by which they designated their retail stores, they of course did not contemplate operating jewelry stores. On the other hand \u201cJewel\u201d is not a coined or fanciful name, such as \u201cKodak,\u201d \u201cPhilco,\u201d or \u201cBudweiser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In trade-mark cases courts have pointed out the weakness of \u201cJewel\u201d as a mark. In. Pro-phy-lac-tic Brush Co. v. Jordan Marsh Co., 1 Cir., 165 F.2d 549, at page 552, involving the marks \u201cJewelite\u201d and \u201cGem-lite,\u201d the court said: \u201cFurthermore both marks are weak. The words \u2018gem\u2019 and \u2018jewel\u2019 equally share the connotation of value and beauty combined, and the suffix \u2018lite\u2019 is in common use as the equivalent of \u2018lith\u2019 to denote a mineral or mineral like substance, as in cryolite or bakelite. * * * Their obvious connotations of beauty and value make them as weak as the marks \u2018Blue Ribbon\u2019 and \u2018Gold Seal\u2019 with their obvious connotations of prize-winning quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, Commissioner, 269 U.S. 372, at page 383, 46 S.Ct. 160, at page 163, 70 L.Ed. 317, the court cites, apparently with approval, a statement from the Commissioner of Patents : \u201c \u2018The word involved in this case is one of a large class of words which have for a great many years been much used because of their peculiarly suggestive meaning. For other examples there are the words \u201cAcme,\u201d \u201cAnchor,\u201d \u201cChampion,\u201d \u201cEureka,\u201d \u201cExcelsior,\u201d \u201cIdeal,\u201d <em>\u201cJewel,\u201d </em>\u201cLiberty,\u201d * * *. It would be a serious matter if the law actually permitted anyone who chose to do so to organize a series of corporations with names containing these words, respectively and thereupon virtually withdraw these words from public use as trade-marks and monopolize them, by preventing their registry as such.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">To illustrate the narrow scope which courts have accorded to words in common use by many manufacturers on a wide variety of products, the court in Arrow Distilleries, Inc., v. Globe Brewing Co., 4 Cir., 117 F.2d 347, held that the owners of the trade-mark \u201cArrow\u201d as applied to liqueurs and cordials were not entitled to an injunction against the use of \u201cArrow\u201d as a name to designate beer and ale. The court cited France Milling Co. v. Washburn-Crosby Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 7 F.2d 304, where the words \u201cGold Medal\u201d as applied to straight wheat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>flour were held not infringed by the words \u201cGold Medal\u201d as applied to prepared pancake and buckwheat flour. In the Arrow case the court, quoting from the France Milling Co. case, said 117 F.2d at page 350: \u201c \u2018One who devises a new, strange, \u201ccatching\u201d word to describe his wares may and often has by timely suit prevented others from taking his word or set of words to gild the repute of even wholly different goods * * *; but one who takes a phrase which is the common place of self-praise like \u201cBlue Ribbon\u201d or \u201cGold Medal\u201d must be content with that special field which he labels with so undistinctive a name.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We recognize that the judgment of the district court was based upon unfair competition. However, the common law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader field of unfair competition. Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 413, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713. The Supreme Court has said, \"The facts supporting a suit for infringement and one for unfair competition are substantially the same.\u201d Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 325, 59 S.Ct. 191, 196, 83 L.Ed. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The key word of the trade name adopted by plaintiff is \u201cJewel\u201d which has some of the characteristics of a generic or descriptive word, as distinguished from a coined or fanciful word; but even if the word \u201cJewel\u201d were considered as a descriptive term, that in itself would not be sufficient to invalidate it as a trade-name. Steem-Electric Corp. v. Herzfeld-Phillipson Co., 7 Cir., 118 F.2d 122. If a generic term has acquired a secondary meaning, late users must adopt means to avoid public deception. Radio Shack Corp. v. Radio Shack, Inc., supra, 180 F.2d at page 206; General Finance Loan Co. v. General Loan Co., 8 Cir., 163 F.2d 709. The law in Illinois is in accord with the general rule. Lady Esther, Ltd. v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe, Inc., 317 Ill.App. 451, 46 N.E.2d 165, 148 A.L.R. 6; Auto Parts Co. v. Silverstein, 211 Ill.App. 436. In the latter case the court held that a latecomer, regardless of fraudulent intent or actual injury, owes the duty of adopting affirmative precautions sufficient to make confusion in the use of a similar trade name improbable. In that case the use by the latecomer of the trade name \u201cAuto Sales and Parts Company\u201d was held to be unfair competition where the older company operated under the trade name \u201cAuto Parts Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> The district court found that the word \u201cJewel\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning in connection with plaintiff\u2019s retail grocery business in Chicago and suburbs. It is without dispute that plaintiff used the word \u201cJewel\u201d in the trade name of its stores at least eight years before the defendant used it in the name of his stores. On the record before us we cannot say that the district court\u2019s findings as to secondary meaning are clearly erroneous. We, therefore, approve the findings of fact of the district court in this respect and pass to the question whether defendant adopted reasonable precautions to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Although defendant\u2019s stores dealt primarily in dairy products and had various distinguishing characteristics hereinbefore mentioned, yet defendant sold goods of the same descriptive properties as similar items which plaintiff sold in its stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Defendant\u2019s practice of establishing stores in the vicinity of plaintiff\u2019s stores, and in one case in the same building where plaintiff had a store for two years, in itself is sufficient to show that defendant did not take reasonable precautions to avoid confusion. Under the circumstances the district court was justified in enjoining defendant from using the word \u201cJewel\u201d in his trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The district court made detailed findings of fact and concluded that as a matter of law plaintiff was entitled to an injunction restraining defendant \u201cfrom the use of the word Jewel on any store he operates in connection with the retail business of distributing or selling food or dairy products in Chicago and its suburbs.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusion of law was properly limited and confined to the relief to which plaintiff was entitled under the evidence. But the restraint set forth in the decree is much broader than that stated in the court\u2019s conclusion of law, for defendant is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>strained \u201cfrom using the word \u2018Jewel\u2019 * * * in, about and in connection with, the conduct and operation of his (defendant\u2019s) business * * Also the area is enlarged to include the entire State of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As we interpret the decree it is broad enough to restrain defendant from selling ice cream when the name \u201cJewel\u201d is used as any part of the label. Thus any right to that name acquired by defendant for use on his ice cream is denied, although defendant was selling ice cream under that name for five years before plaintiff sold any ice cream at all, and for six years before plaintiff used the word \u201cJewel\u201d on its ice cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Comparatively speaking, the sale of dairy products was and is incidental in plaintiff\u2019s business, as only slightly more than 10% of its income derives from that source. By contrast defendant\u2019s business chiefly has been the sale of dairy products and ice cream. On his stores defendant customarily has neon signs in the outline of a milk jug. In the window are neon signs depicting an ice cream cone and reading, \u201cIce Cream.\u201d Signs reading, \u201cWe Make Our Own Ice Cream,\u201d are also prominently displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In the matter of the sale of ice cream under the name \u201cJewel\u201d it was the plaintiff who was the latecomer. Ice cream is not of the same descriptive properties as dairy products, such as butter, cheese, milk and cream. As pointed out in Hutchinson Ice Cream Co. v. State of Iowa, 242 U.S. 153, 158, <em>37 </em>S.Ct. 28, 61 L.Ed. 217, under some formulas ice cream is made without using either <em>cream or </em>milk. The term \u201cdairy or other farm products\u201d as used in the Wisconsin \u201cTon-mile tax\u201d statute, Laws 1931, c. 454, was held not to include malted, condensed, evaporated or powdered milk, or ice cream. State ex rel. Wisconsin Allied Truck Owners Ass\u2019n v. Public Service Commission, 207 Wis. 664, 679, 680, 683, 242 N.W. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In Consumers Petroleum Co. v. Consumers Co. of Illinois, 7 Cir., 169 F.2d 153, 155, this court held that the defendant, engaged in the sale of solid fuels under the name of \u201cConsumers Company of Illinois,\u201d did <em>not </em>acquire a property right in the trade name \u201cConsumers\u201d as applied to fuel oil, where it did not commence selling fuel oil until after the plaintiff had commenced selling fuel oil under the name of \u201cConsumers Petroleum Company.\u201d In California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Sunkist Baking Co., 7 Cir., 166 F.2d 971, this court refused to enjoin the use of the trade-mark \u201cSunkist\u201d in the sale of bakery products including raisin bread although the plaintiff owned and had used the trade-mark covering fruits, including raisins.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The only product sold by defendant to which he applied the word \u201cJewel\u201d was ice cream. On the cartons containing ice cream appeared the words \u201cJewel Fine Ice Cream.\u201d In our opinion, by reason of \u25a0his prior public use, extending for a period of more than five years, the defendant is entitled to use the term \u201cJewel Fine Ice Cream,\u201d on ice cream cartons sold in his stores or distributed by him. The defendant will be required, however, to eliminate and cease to use the word \u201cJewel\u201d from the identifying phrase on such ice cream cartons, to wit, \u201cJewel Milk Stores, Cicero, Illinois,\u201d as a necessary result of the restraint, properly imposed, on defendant in connection with the use of the word \u201cJewel\u201d as his trade name and as his store name.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The injunction will be modified so as to preserve to the defendant the right to sell ice cream under the words \u201cJewel Fine Ice Cream,\u201d but without referring to \u201cJewel\u201d as any part of defendant\u2019s trade name. In all other respects the judgment containing the injunction will be affirmed. Costs will be assessed two-thirds to be paid by defendant and one-third by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Defendant\u2019s petition for rehearing insists that the injunction as modified in our opinion filed December 5, 1950, is too broad. His contentions were heretofore duly considered, and were disposed of in our opinion, except possibly in one respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">Defendant contends the injunction is so broad that he would be prohibited from selling products such as Swift\u2019s Jewel oleo margarine, and the products of the Jewel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Paint and .Varnish Company, and that he would not be permitted to buy or sell other products on which the word \u201cJewel\u201d has been registered as a trade-mark. We do not think that the injunction as modified can reasonably be interpreted as defendant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The injunction as modified, although couched in general terms, is not aimed at defendant\u2019s handling in the ordinary course of business the products of other persons or concerns who use the word \u201cJewel\u201d as part of their trade name or on their products where the wrappers or cartons containing such products give appropriate notice of the origin or sponsorship of such persons or concerns. Let the wording of the injunction be modified to expressly exempt the defendant from such restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It is so ordered, and the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
