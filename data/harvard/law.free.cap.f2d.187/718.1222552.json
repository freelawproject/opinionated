It will be sufficient for us to say that we are in full agreement with the findings and conclusions of the Tax Court and with the reasoning on which they are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-23\">So agreeing, in spite of petitioner\u2019s earnest and vigorous attack upon them by brief and oral argument, we deny the petition for review and affirm the attacked order for the reasons and upon the considerations advanced by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-25\">.
