The answer confessedly depends upon the meaning of \u00a7 191 of Title 31, U.S.C.A., a section which had its origin in 1790 and after several later accretions took substantially its final form in 1797,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and which went into the Revised Statutes as \u00a7 3466, by which name it has thereafter been generally known. Two questions arise: (1) was the debtor \u201cinsolvent\u201d; and (2) had it committed \u201can act of bankruptcy\u201d? Both the referee and the judge held that it was not \u201cinsolvent\u201d because its assets were not less than its debts, and for that reason they did not reach the second question. So far as we have found, the Supreme Court first had occasion to consider the question while the Act of 1799 was in force,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and when the language now in that part of \u00a7 3466 which follows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>words, \u201cshall be first satisfied\u201d, was in a later part of the section and began: \u201cAnd the cases of insolvency mentioned in this second shall be deemed to extend,\u201d instead of \u201cthe priority established shall extend\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There being no bankruptcy statute then in existence, and therefore no \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d being possible, the Court was confined to the other occasions prescribed in the section. It held that \u201cinsolvency must be understood to mean a legal and known insolvency, manifested by some notorious act of the debtor, pursuant to law\u201d; and, that, as there had been none in the case then at bar, the section did not apply. It did not, however, rule as to whether the separated clause was to be read as a definition of \u201cinsolvency.\u201d However, fourteen years later Story, J.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> said that the \u201clatter clause is merely an explanation of \u2018insolvency,\u2019 used in the first clause, and embraces three classes of cases, all of which relate to living debtors. The case of deceased debtors stands wholly upon the alternative in the former part of the enactment. Insolvency, then, in the sense of that statute, relates to such a general divestment of property as would in fact be equivalent to insolvency in its technical sense. It supposes that all' the debtor\u2019s property has passed from him. * * * So, too, a mere inability of the debtor to pay all his debts is not an insolvency within \u2019 the statute; but it must be manifested in one of the three modes pointed out in the explanatory clause already referred to.\u201d This was certainly a ruling that the \u201clatter clause\u201d defined the scope of \u201cinsolvency\u201d; and, since one of \u201cthe three modes pointed out\u201d \u2014 an assignment \u2014 was conditioned upon the insufficiency of the debtor\u2019s assets to meet his debts, the others presumably were not so limited. In 1838 the Court followed this declaration by saying that<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cno evidence can be received of the insolvency of the debtor until he has been divested of his property in one of the modes stated in the section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">From the foregoing it appears to us that \u201cinsolvency\u201d did not originally mean more than a failure to pay in due course; a meaning which at the time was almost inevitable anyway, because it was not until 1898 that it had ever been used to indicate inadequacy of assets. However, this was not the view which the Court took in 1923 when the question came up again.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The suit was one of original jurisdiction, the United States having filed a bill in equity against the state which the state moved to dismiss for insufficiency. The bill alleged that the state by a statutory commissioner had taken possession of the assets of one of the state\u2019s own banks; but it did not allege that the assets were insufficient to pay the debts. The Court held that \u201cMere inability of the debtor to pay all his debts in ordinary course of business is not insolvency within the meaning of the act\u201d 261 U.S. at page 260, 43 S.Ct. at page 297. The assets must be insufficient; and, even though they are, the resulting insolvency \u201cmust be manifested in one of the modes pointed out in the latter part of the statute which defines or explains the meaning of insolvency referred to in the earlier part.\u201d Apparently, the Court read the definition of insolvency, which was attached to assignments for the benefit of creditors, as being a definition of \u201cinsolvency\u201d generally. Having decided that this definition did apply to all insolvency, it would seem that the case would have been at an end; for, by hypothesis, none of the \u201cmodes\u201d was enough without insolvency. However, 261 U.S. on pages 262 and 263, 43 S.Ct. on page 298, 299 the Court, after disposing of the issue of insolvency, went on to decide whether there was \u201can act of bankruptcy\u201d; which was irrelevant. This leaves us in some doubt whether it regarded insolvency as a <em>sine qua </em>non, or as an alternative to an act of bankruptcy. Since the second is nowhere explicitly avowed, and since it certainly involves a wider departure from the precedents, we think that the decision means that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>insolvency always demands an insufficiency of assets; and that is the reading -which three Courts of Appeals have put upon the opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court -having in any event plainly declared its understanding of the term itself, we of course accept its decision as authoritative.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-14\">. 1 St.L. 515.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-25\">. 1 St.L. 676.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\">.
