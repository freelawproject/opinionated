The Superintendent had received the amount in suit from the Veteran\u2019s Administration as a pension to which the patient was entitled, and had held it in the patient\u2019s pension account.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">A statute requires the hospital to apply the unexpended balance of a deceased patient\u2019s pension money \"to the general uses of said hospital\u201d. 35 Stat. 593, 24 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 165. Moreover, the United States has not consented to be sued. But we need not consider those points, for the Probate Court \u201chas no jurisdiction to decide a dispute regarding the title or the right of possession of personal property.\u201d Jones v. Dunlap, <em>73 </em>App.D.C. 59, 115 F.2d 689. Holzbeierlein v. Grant, 73 App.D.C. 154, 117 F.2d 26. The judgment must therefore be reversed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-18\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
