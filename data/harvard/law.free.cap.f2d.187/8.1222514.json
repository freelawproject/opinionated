It insists, though: that the language relied on in one of them was <em>dicta; </em>the other was inadequately considered, and, therefore, wrongly decided; that the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>sought to be applied 'by the district judge did not apply; and that the district judge was free, indeed was compelled, to construe the act for himself as plaintiffs contend it should be construed. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">We will not undertake to independently assay or assess the correctness of the decisions relied on by the district judge, or the others cited to us by the appellee. It is sufficient to say that we are in complete agreement with the district judge that they were binding upon him, and with ap-pellee that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-27\">.
