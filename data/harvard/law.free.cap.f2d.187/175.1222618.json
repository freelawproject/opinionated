It particularly pleaded registrations No. 128,351 of January 6, 1920, and No. 199,341 of June 9, 1925.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The former shows parallel circumferential lines forming a double circle. In the space between the lines appears the word \u201cCrown\u201d in capital letters and at the center of the inner circle is a representation of a crown. The latter consists of the word \u201cCrown\u201d over the word \u201cAdjust-alls\u201d surrounded by lines which form a rectangle.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">There is nothing about the word \u201cCrom-vella\u201d which so much as suggests the idea of a crown. It seems to be an arbitrary or coined term, having no particular meaning aside from applicant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">Opposer alleges that the mark \u201cis confusing in that the first syllable thereof <em>could </em>readily be taken for the word \u2018Crown\u2019, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and that the casual observer upon seeing the trade-mark would believe that the mark consisted of the word \u2018Crown\u2019 with the letters \u2018ella\u2019 attached thereto, * * (Italics supplied.) Two witnesses, both of whom were connected with opposer, testified, in effect, that at least at first glance the term appeared to them to be the word \u201cCrown\u201d with the suffix \u201cella\u201d' added thereto, and one of them (whose name is signed as counsel to the brief of opposer filed before us) quoted from a decision of this court written by the late Presiding Judge Graham, The American Products Co. v. Leonard, 53 F.2d 894, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 742, wherein we quoted with approval the statement of a witness in that case that \u201cThere is no such thing as a correct pronunciation for a trade-mark. It is pronounced in different ways by different people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We adhere to our approval of that statement, but it is not supposed that many, if any, persons could be found who would give the pronunciation of \u201cCrown\u201d to the word \u201cCrom,\u201d nor do we suppose that many would mistake the clearly written letters \u201cmv\u201d for \u201cwn,\u201d so far as appearance is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We think it obvious that opposer, in its perfectly legitimate desire to protect its \u201cCrown\u201d trade-mark, made a mistake in instituting the instant proceeding. We quote with approval the following from the brief for applicant: The Opposer seeks a ruling that applicant\u2019s mark is other than what it plainly is and that if applicant\u2019s mark were such other than it is, that such other and different mark is confusingly similar to the mark of Opposer. Applicant knows of no legal authorities for any such decision by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In view of the fact that, as also stated in the brief for applicant, \u201cthere is no similarity of sound, spelling, appearance or significance\u201d between the mark of applicant, as it now stands, and any of opposer\u2019s marks, we are unable to discern how any confusion would be likely to result from the use by applicant of its mark, and we agree that it is entitled to the registration sought and that the notice of opposition properly was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The decision of the Assistant Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-17\">. The respective registrations, apparently in the forms used, were filed as exhibits with the notice of opposition and with them was another in which there appears the hyphenated notation \u201cCrown-Head-fight.\u201d No copy of the certificate of its registration appears in the record. As we view it, this exhibit is merely cumulative and adds no strength to opposer\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
