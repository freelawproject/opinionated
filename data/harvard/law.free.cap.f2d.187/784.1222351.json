Weems v. U. S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 157 Miss. 740, 128 So. 503, and that that statute in effect nullified the contract of indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>and prevented the plaintiff from recovering on it. He sustained the motion for a directed verdict and entered judgment on the verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Appellant is here insisting, upon the authority of many cited cases <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the court erred in denying recovery upon its contract of indemnity and that the judgment may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Appellee, in addition to urging as he did below that plaintiff\u2019s contract is in effect nullified by Sec. 4234 and that the judgment of dismissal in the suit against the sheriff is a bar to plaintiff\u2019s suit, insists that Sec. 256<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the 1942 Code of Mississippi is a further and complete barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">We do not think so. On the contrary, we think it plain that since the suit is on an express contract of indemnity, neither of the invoked statutes is applicable here, and that the authorities appellant cites and relies on fully support its position. We think, too, that it is a complete contradiction in terms to say that the judgment dismissing the suit against the sheriff, entered as a part of and in accordance with, the settlement agreement, operates in any way to bar plaintiff\u2019s suit on its agreement for indemnity to recover the very sums which were paid by it as a consideration for the dismissal judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor. Indeed it seems to us fantastic to claim that the defendant may take the benefit of the judgment in the suit against him, obtained by and as a part of the settlement, and, at the same time, refuse to stand to the indemnity agreement under the authority of which the plaintiff made the settlement and secured the entry of the judgment on defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-12\">. \u201cIn Consideration of the American Surety Company of New York acting as surety on the bond herein applied for. * * * The, undersigned further agrees for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns to indemnify and keep indemnified the Surety from and against any liability, loss, costs, charges, suits, damages, counsel fees and expenses of whatever nature, which the Surety shall or may for any cause, at any time, sustain or be put to in consequence of the Surety having executed said bond, or any renewal, continuation, extension or modification thereof; and that the Surety Company shall have the right to pay or compromise any expense, claim or charge, of the character enumerated in this agreement, and the voucher or other evidence of such payment shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the propriety thereof and of my liability therefor to the Surety Company. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-26\">. \u201c\u00a7 4234.
