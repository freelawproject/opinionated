They sued for damages for alleged injuries and loss of services caused by the wife\u2019s falling upon a walk alleged to have been maintained by appellant in an icy and dangerous condition. The jury awarded $2500 to the wife and $500 to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Appellant raises several questions. They involve sufficiency of evidence as to negligence, injuries, suffering, and the amounts awarded to each appellee. We have considered these questions in the light of the testimony. Our conclusion is that the case was properly submitted to the jury and that the damages awarded cannot be adjudged excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
