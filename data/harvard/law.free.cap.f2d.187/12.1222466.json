Count Two was for \u201ckeeping in possession\u201d counterfeit money \u201cwith intent to defraud,\u201d and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 472 makes that an offence alternative to passing, uttering, publishing, selling, or concealing. So far therefore as any possession is a necessary incident to any of the other offences, it can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>not have been intended as a separate of-fence. As to Chiarella, he certainly did not \u2022wish to \u201ckeep in possession\u201d the counterfeits for an instant longer than was necessary; he wished to sell them and presumably to be rid of such dangerous goods with title utmost expedition. True, he was privy to their retention by Pietraniello and Seid-ler, while he, Palmisano and Gopadze went back to get the payment in Manhattan; but he was the seller, and Pietraniello was his agent to hold the goods until the price was \u25a0paid. It is of no moment that this involved a delay of some hours before the \u25a0exchange took place; that was the period required to make the sale and it was a part of the sale. So too as to Count One, for \u00a7 473 makes receiving an alternative to buying, selling, exchanging, transferring and delivering, and again that pre-supposes more than is inevitably involved in the other prohibited acts. Chiarella \u201creceived\u201d the counterfeits only in order to deliver them, and delivery was certainly a part of the sale, not a separate act, like, for instance, receiving them preparatory to their utterance by someone else. Neither Count One, nor Count Two was proven, each was included under the sale, and cannot stand as a separate offence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The same reasoning applies, if anything more clearly, to Stancin.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The conviction upon Counts One and Two will be reversed and the indictment dismissed as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The conviction on Counts Three and Four will be affirmed with an aggregate sentence of fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>On Petition of the Prosecution for Rehearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The prosecution is right in saying that we asked for briefs only upon the question whether Count One <em>or </em>Count Two was proved, and that we decided that <em>both </em>were not proved; but that Count Three was proved. Our decision was deliberate; but we have considered the arguments made to so show that we were wrong, and they do not persuade us. The sentence will be as we said: that imposed upon Count-Three \u2014 ten years \u2014 to which will be cumulatively added that imposed on Count Four\u2014 five years. If Pietraniello wishes to make any application in the light of what we said in our opinion upon the reserved question, we will entertain his application. We have nothing to add to o-ur opinion of January 5, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Petition denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">. Schroeder v.
