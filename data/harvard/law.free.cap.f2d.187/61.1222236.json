This is so because the refusal of most, indeed of nearly all, of the items, was based upon the view that there was no provision in the Statute, the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., or in the practice of the court authorizing their allowance, while the allowance of the other small items was in the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-33\">In Parkerson v. Borst, 5 Cir., 256 F. 827, at page 829, this court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>allowance or disallowance of items of cost was properly determined by whether there was a statute, rule, order or practice of the court allowing them as taxable costs in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The action of the court below in disallowing items as costs was in precise accordance with that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">As to the amounts he allowed, it is settled by the authorities cited supra, that where the taxation or non-taxation of costs involves not a question of the power to allow 'but of the amount to be allowed, an appellate court will not review the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-19\">.
