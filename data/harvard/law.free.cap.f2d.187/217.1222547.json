The parties carried out their agreement. He paid for a house and title was taken in her name. She willed him her residuary estate, including the house, and cared for him until she died. He petitions for review of a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals \u25a0for the District of Columbia that the transfer of the house is taxable under D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 47-1601 (a), 50 Stat. 683, which taxes all property \u201ctransferred from any person who may die seized or possessed thereof, either by will or by law, or by right of survivorship * *</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">Petitioner contends that in equity and good conscience he inherited nothing that was not already his and therefore no tax is due. But the fact is that he had no legal or equitable right to dispose of the house during the lifetime of Josephine Mathy. In other words, while she lived she had not only legal title but also a beneficial interest. We need not consider whether she had the whole beneficial interest or whether petitioner had a share in it. In either case, when she died he acquired not only her legal title but her beneficial interest. It is immaterial whether he is thought to have acquired it by her will or by the right of survivorship that the oral agreement sought to create, for the tax law expressly covers transfers \u201cby will * * * or by right of survivor-ship\u201d. Accordingly there is no occasion to consider whether the purchase of the house, and the oral agreement, created a trust in petitioner\u2019s favor. Cf. D.C. Code (1940) \u00a7 12-303, 31 Stat. 1367-1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">Statutes sometimes exempt from taxation transfers by will when they are made pursuant to contract, but Congress chose not to exempt such transfers. The choice appears to have been deliberate. In the same sentence by which Congress taxed all transfers from a decedent \u201cby will or by law, or by right of survivorship\u201d, it proceeded to exempt from taxation transfers by <em>deed </em>intended to take effect after the death of the decedent \u201cin cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d. Cf. In re Howell\u2019s Estate, 255 N.Y. 211, 174 N.E. 457; Jacob v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 B.T.A. 636, affirmed 8 Cir., 34 F.2d 233. We need not decide whether this exemption would have covered a deed from Josephine to the petitioner No deed was made. As the Board said in effect, the tax- law applies to what was done, not what might have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">No question regarding the <em>amount </em>of the tax is before us, for none was raised before the Board or in petitioner\u2019s brief-</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
