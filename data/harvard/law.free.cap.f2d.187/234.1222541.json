But it is without dispute that the amount realized under the new contract was 50 per man per month. Moreover, appellants further admit that both the General Accounting Office and the trial court assumed that the contract carried- the rate suggested, and the jury was charged to that effect. Under such circumstances, we are constrained to adhere to our former opinion, and the petition for rehearing is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
