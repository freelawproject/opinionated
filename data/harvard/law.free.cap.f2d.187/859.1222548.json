They are dismissed so far as they seek reconsideration of liability of the parties for costs. So far as the petitions state the amounts determinable as taxable costs, they are allowed as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">In appeal No. 12216:</p>\n<p id=\"b913-25\">Docketing in the Circuit Court $ 25.00</p>\n<p id=\"A5o\">Notice of Appeal in District Court 5.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-26\">Transcript (District Court) 189.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-27\">Transcript (Court Reporter) 141.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-28\">$360.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-29\">In appeal No. 12084D:</p>\n<p id=\"b913-30\">Filing Notice of Appeal in the District Court and docketing case in the Circuit Court (Share) $ 10.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-32\">Transcript 12084 Vol. 1, pp. 39-100 63 pages at 1.50 94.50</p>\n<p id=\"b913-33\">Transcript pp. 128-162, 46 pp. at .70 32.20</p>\n<p id=\"b913-34\">Transcript 12084 Vol. 3, pp. 522-556 44 pp. at 1.50 66.00</p>\n<p id=\"b913-35\">$202.70</p>\n<p id=\"b913-36\">As to No. 12084A, the cost bill fails to show what portions of the transcript used in this and other appeals are attributable to this appeal.
