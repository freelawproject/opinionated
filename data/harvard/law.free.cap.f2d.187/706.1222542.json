COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b760-4\">No. 27, Docket 21665.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b760-5\">United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b760-6\">Argued Feb. 7, 1951.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b760-7\">Decided March 14, 1951.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-14\">To the facts stated in the opinion of the Tax Court, reported in 13 T.C. 368, the following should be added: The letter of December 5, 1944 from Lawrence Whipple\u2019s lawyer to taxpayer reads as follows: \u201cOn behalf of my client Lawrence Whipple of 15 Exchange Place, Jersey City, N. J. I am authorized to offer you the sum of Five hundred ($500.) dollars for the full and complete redemption of the notes of John Whipple now held 'by you. As you know, or have been definitely informed John Whipple is unable to make any payment on account of these notes at this time. His liabilities are far in excess of his assets and his income is insufficient to permit such payment. Your acceptance of this offer, together with the check for Five hundred ($500.) dollars tendered herewith, as evidenced by your signature affixed to the copy of this letter, shall indicate the termination of John Whipple\u2019s obligation to you on the notes and his release from further liability thereunder.\u201d The letter of December 1, 1944, from taxpayer to Irving Sprague, reads thus: \u201cI accept your offer of $1,000 for the notes of C. O. M. Sprague which I hold aggregating approximately $22,000. I enclose you the notes which I have endorsed without recourse. Please send me your check for $1,000 to my order in payment.\u201d The taxpayer testified that in the Spring of 1944 he had negotiations with C. O. M. Sprague to \u201csee * * * whether we could arrive at a composition of the notes.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-16\">R. E. Lee, New York City, (Charles L. Kades, John F. B. Mitchell, Jr. and Edwin A. Margolius, all of New York City, of counsel), for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-17\">Theron Lamar Caudle, Washington, D. C., (Ellis N.

We do not agree with this blanket generalization. The situation is not the equivalent of a sale followed -in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>year by a partial charg\u00e9-off.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For in such a case, after the sale, the taxpayer owns no debt which he can charge off, whereas, when the sale is the later event, there is no reason why the charge-off, if independent of the sale, should not be deductible. The fact that both transactions occur in the same year is irrelevant; the requirement of accounting for income tax purposes, on an annual basis is, we think, immaterial in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">But the result is different if the taxpayer has arranged for the sale before he makes the charge-off; for then, in reality, he is charging off a debt he no longer owns. Obviously that was the case here, if the seeming sales were actual sales, since the charge-offs and the sales occurred the same day and, patently, pursuant to previous negotiations. We would, therefore, sustain the Tax Court, were there no more to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">However, taxpayer urges that the apparent sales were not in fact sales but compositions with the debtors which resulted in deductible charge-offs. It seems most likely that such was the nature of the Whipple transaction, as the letter written on behalf of Lawrence Whipple, brother of the debtor John Whipple, speaks of the \u201cfull and complete redemption of the notes of John Whipple.\u201d The Sprague transaction is perhaps somewhat less clear, since taxpayer\u2019s letter to Irving Sprague, the brother of the debtor, C. O. M. Sprague, shows that the debtor\u2019s notes were endorsed, without recourse, and delivered to the brother; but taxpayer\u2019s testimony concerning the earlier Sprague negotiations supports the composition contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">As the taxpayer did not make this contention in the Tax Court, the Commissioner should have an opportunity, if he desires, to present evidence bearing on that argument. We therefore reverse and remand for a further hearing, at which, of course, taxpayer may also present further evidence in support of his contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">.
