Woods, a justice of the peace of Perry township, Lawrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>county, upon tbe official bond of M. T. Hornbuckle. The bond, dated April 9, 1875, is in the penal sum of $1,000, payable to the State of Ohio, recites the election of Horn-buckle, as constable of Upper township, Lawrence county, is conditioned as required by statute (1 S. &amp; C. 802, \u00a7 184; Rev. Stats. \u00a7 1516), and is signed by Hornbuckle as principal, and James M. Kelley and Thomas Golden as sureties. The action was in the name of the state of Ohio, for the use of Lewis Smith, and against Hornbuckle, Kelley and Golden, and the ground of recovery alleged in the bill of particulars, was that Hornbuckle, having in his hands, as such constable ol Upper township, an execution in favor of said Smith against Peter Schlosser, did, on September 9,1875, make a false return thereof. The return and its falsity, as well as the bond, are set forth in the bill of particulars. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, for $47.63 and costs, and that judgment was affirmed in the District Court. This petition in error was filed in this court, on leave, by Hornbuckle, Kelley and Golden, and the question is whether the justice of the peace had jurisdiction of the action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-5\"><em>W.
