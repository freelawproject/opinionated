He having died during the pendency of the action, it was revived against his administrator, Alonzo Simmerson, the present plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The petition of plaintiff alleged that Rhoda Simmerson, her mother, and wife of Joseph, died about October, 1871, leaving a will whereby she devised to her daughter, the plaintiff, her interest in a lot of land in Clyde, Sandusky county, together with all her claims or rights of action against her husband. It further alleged that in March, 1863, this lot was purchased by Joseph and Rhoda jointly for $520, the conveyance being to them as tenants in common of equal shares, Rhoda paying $200 of the purchase-money out of her own separate moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">That, at this time Rhoda owned a certain'promissory note for $100, which Joseph collected, and applied $70 of the proceeds toward paying the purchase-money, and appropriated the balance to his own use. The deferred payments were secured by a purchase-money mortgage on the premises. To meet the deferred payments, when the same became due, Joseph and Rhoda sold a portion of the lot for $450, out of which the balance of purchase-money ($250) was paid; the rest was appropriated by Joseph to his own use. The petition prayed judgment for the sums claimed to be due, with interest, and for an account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">The answer, among other matters of defense, alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action had not accrued to her within six years prior to bringing suit. This the reply denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">The court of common pleas, without passing upon any other issues, held that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations, and rendered judgment in favor of defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">This judgment was reversed in the district court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-10\"><em>B.
