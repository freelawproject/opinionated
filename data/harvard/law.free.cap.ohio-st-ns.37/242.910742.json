To this counter-claim there was a reply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT0\">A verdict was rendered in favor of Dewey, Vance &amp; Co., for $3,090; and the cause having been reserved to the general term on a motion for anew trial, the motion was overruled, and judgment was rendered on the verdict. On leave, this petition in error was filed to reverse the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">The material facts, either admitted or shown by the evidence, are as follows: During the year 1873, and during many preceding years, Dewey, Vance &amp; Co. was a firm engaged in the manufacture of iron at Wheeling; Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works was a corporation engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel at Cincinnati and Newport; and the Iron Mountain Company was a corporation-at St. Louis, having a monopoly of the kind of iron ore mentioned in the above agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">The Carondelet landing inferred to in the contract is owned by the Iron Mountain Company, is situated on the Mississippi river within the corporate limits of St. Louis, and the company owns all the ore placed thereon. The ore is kept in a pile, from which the boats of the company\u2019s customers are loaded. No particular part of the ore is set apart to any customer*, biit the loading is done from that part of the pile nearest the boats. The ore is not weighed at the landing, but the weight is estimated by the displacement of the boats when loaded, a memorandum of the weight thus approximated is made, and that governs in the settlement and payment, if the ore or any part of it is lost in transit; but if none of it is thus lost, the actual weight is ascertained when the ore arrives at its destination, and payment is then made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">The Iron Mountain Company, during the fall or early part of winter in each year, sends a circular letter to each of its customers, fixing the price of ore for the ensuing year. The price so fixed remains unchanged during such year. In the fall of 1871, the company fixed the price of ore for 1872, \u201c on the landing at Carondelet,\u201d at $5.50 per ton. Ore ordered in pursuance of such circular must be taken away during such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>succeeding year, as the contract is canceled at the end of such year, as to any ore not removed. The company never permits ore to be taken from the landing in any other manner or upon any other terms than as above stated; but where a customer who has agreed to take ore gives orders to others for part or all the ore he contracted for, the company fills such orders, but still looks to the customer for payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">This mode of dealing with respect to Iron Mountain ore at Carondelet landing, has been for many years uniform, invariable and well known, and the parties to this suit were familiar with the usage, when the agreement was made, and contracted with reference to such usage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">As early as May, 1872, Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works had exhausted all the ore due to it for that year, under its contract with the Iron Mountain Company made the preceding autumn. In that month and again in August, Mr. Swift applied to the company for more ore, but the company refused, as it had contracted with others for all it could deliver during 1872. In that condition of things, Mr. Swift applied to Dewey, Yanee &amp; Co. That firm had contracted with the Iron Mountain Company for more ore than it could use during 1872, and knowing that the contract would be canceled on January 1, 1873, as to any ore not taken away in 1872, it was willing to let Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works have ore, provided it could obtain, in the spring of 1873, an equal quantity of ore at the price prevailing in 1872, that is, at $5.50 per ton, for it was then manifest that the price for 1873 would be much higher ; and in fact, in the fall of 1872 the Iron Mountain Company fixed the price of ore for 1873 at $10 per ton. Under these circumstances, the contract of October 1, 1872, was made at Cincinnati, and for the reasons stated, it was advantageous to both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">An order was at the same time delivered to Mr. Swift in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201c Alex.

Later in November and during December, the rivers became so full of ice that it was impossible to remove the ore by boat during that year. Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works applied to the Iron Mountain Company, while the river was thus filled with ice, for leave to remove the ore in some other manner than by boats, but the Iron Mountain Company declined to grant the request, and the ore was never obtained. In fact, there \u2018is no other practicable way by which to remove ore from the landing than by boat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\">As already stated, no ore was delivered to Dewey, Yance &amp; Oo. under the agreement, nor did they receive any order on the Iron Mountain Company for ore. They demanded of Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works repeatedly, at Cincinnati, during May, 1873, compliance with the agreement as to the delivery of ore in the spring of 1873, insisting on an order on the Iron Mountain Company for such ore. The only reason given for non-compliance with the demands was the alleged noncompliance by Dewey, Yance &amp; Co., with their agreement to deliver ore in 1872. Dewey, Yance &amp; Co. were ready and willing to pay for the ore according to the custom already stated, that is, according to weight as ascertained on arrival of the ore at its destination, or in case of the loss of the ore or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>any part of it while in transit, according to its weight as ascertained by displacement, in the way stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">The objections of Swift\u2019s Iron and Steel Works to a recovery on the part of Dewey, Yance <em>&amp; </em>Co., and the grounds of recovery on the part of the former on their counter-claim, are presented in exceptions to the refusal of the court below to give certain instructions to the jury, and in exceptions to certain portions of the charge given. So far as it is necessary to state these exceptions, they will be found in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-6\"><em>Hoadly, Johnson &amp; Colston </em>and <em>John Johnston, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">No valid usage was- shown. <em>S.

If the parties are bound by the terms of this contract, unaided by extraneous testimony, it is clear that the judgment is erroneous. The plaintiff in error \u25a0demanded the delivery of the ore, at the place named in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>contract, and within the time there stated, and was then able and willing to pay for it, while the defendants in error did not demand ore at Carondelet, in the spring of 1873, nor were they there ready to pay for it. Under such circumstances, looking alone to the face of the agreement, the defendant in error would not be entitled to recover, but the plaintiff in error could maintain an action. Extraneous evidence, however, shows the rights and obligations of the parties to this instrument to be very different from those implied in the absence of such evidence. Such evidence shows, as we have seen, that there is a uniform, settled custom at Carondelet, well known to the parties, and -with reference to which they contracted, according to which a party holding such an order for ore as the plaintiff in error had, may present it to the agent of the Iron Mountain Company, at the landing, and have placed in his boats, from the pile there collected, the ore specified in the order, the Iron Mountain Company being the owner of the landing and the ore thereon; and that payment is made when the ore is carried by the boats to its place of destination, and there weighed, unless the ore or part of it is lost in transit, in which ease payment is made according to the weight estimated from the displacement of the boats at the time they are loaded. It further appears, that it was well known to both parties to the contract, at the time it was made, that the Iron Mountain Company never permits ore to be removed from the landing in any other manner, or upon any other terms or condition; indeed, that there is no other practicable mode of removing such ore. The question, therefore, is, whether it was competent to show such facts by such evidence, the plaintiff in error objecting; for, if it was, the plaintiff in error, not being able or or willing to remove the ore by boat, cannot recover damages for a refusal to deliver to it such ore.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Extrinsic evidence is admissible to show that the parties to a written agreement have contracted upon a common basis of usage, applicable to the business in which the contract is made, whereby they have impliedly assented to certain conditions not mentioned in the contract. With respect to usage of the character relied on here, it must appear, in order to be valid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that when the contract was made .such usage was uniform, well-established, and known to the parties ; but that the agreement is on its face free from ambiguity, or that such agreement with, and the same agreement without the incidents annexed, imports very different rights and obligations, affords no valid objection to such evidence. In <em>Humfrey </em>v. Dale, 7 E. &amp; B. (90 Eng. C. L.) 266, Lord Campbell said: \u201cIn a certain sense, every material incident which is added to a written contract varies it, makes it different from what it appeared to be, and so far is inconsistent with it. If by the side of the written contract <em>without, </em>you write the same contract <em>with </em>the added incident, the two would seem to import different obligations and be different contracts.\u201d And see <em>Myers v. Sarl, </em>3 E. <em>&amp; </em>E. (107 Eng. C. L.) 306. The usage, however, must not be inconsistent with the words of the agreement nor must it be unreasonable; but the usage here shown seems not to be obnoxious to either of these objections. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 M. G. &amp; S. 412; <em>Leidemann </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>14 C. B. 38 ; <em>Cuthbert </em>v. <em>Cumming, </em>10 Hurl. <em>&amp; </em>Gord. 809; affirmed, 11 Ib. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The cases relating to usage of this character seem not to be in entire harmony. It is difficult to extract from them any more definite rules by which to determine the validity of such usage than those already stated. It is sometimes difficult, moreover, to determine whether the law, in a particular case, will or will not permit such proof. Each case must be determined by itself, aided by such light as may bo derived from the judgments in other cases where the facts are analogous. Upon consideration of the cases cited in argument, and others, we unite in holding that the proof offered in this case to show usage was competent; and there being no substantial conflict as to the facts, the rights of the parties arc determined by such proof. As the plaintiff in error never demanded the ore upon the order, though the defendants in error were able and willing to deliver it, in pursuance of the contract with such incidents annexed, a right to recover damages, with respect to the ore of 1872, never accrued to the plaintiff in error; and, for the same reason, it is wholly immaterial whether the covenants in the agreement should be regarded as dependent or indefiendent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>So, it is immaterial whether the court properly construed the contract, in charging the jury that if Dewey, Yance &amp; Co. were entitled to recover, one thousand tons of ore would be the basis of such recovery; for if the construction was erroneous, the error was favorable to the plaintiff in error. And these views likewise dispose of the remaining question, as to the right of the defendants in error to recover for the failure of the plaintiff in error to deliver to them ore in the spring of 1873, and sustain such recovery; for the ore \u25a0 could only be obtained on the order of the plaintiff in error; and when the defendants in error, at Cincinnati, in the spring of 1873, demanded such order, the plaintiff in error refused to give it, or to comply with the contract, the defendants in error being at the time able and willing to comply with the agreement in accordance with its terms and such annexed incidents. In view of these facts, the defendants in error were not required to demand the ore at Carondelet in the spring of 1873, or have boats there to receive it. <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Barrelli, </em>21 Ohio St. 324. And this is not inconsistent with <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>19 Ohio St. 375, or <em>Simmons </em>v. Green, 35 Ohio St. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The rulings in the court below are not inconsistent with the views here expressed, nor is there any error in the record, and therefore the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
