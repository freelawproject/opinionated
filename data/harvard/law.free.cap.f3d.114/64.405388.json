We have noted that \u201c[c]ourts have generally drawn a line between decisions at a planning level, or decisions that exercise policy judgment, and decisions at a[n] operational level, or decisions that are merely incident to carrying out a government policy.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Even if the government is immune from tort suits with respect to its policy decision to search the NORDIC in Haiti and then accede to the Haitian request to exercise Haitian jurisdiction, it still had a duty to exercise reasonable care in carrying out that policy.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Supreme Court has clarified the definition of a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d by explaining that it can include even a low-level operational decision so long as the decision \u201crequires judgment as to which of a range of permissible courses is the wisest.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A government planner low in the organizational hierarchy can nevertheless exercise discretion on behalf of the government. The central question, then, is whether the government engaged in tortious conduct not \u201cgrounded in social, economic, [or] political policy.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">According to Coumou, the government failed to communicate potentially exculpatory information from one LEDET to another and then failed to communicate that information to Haitian police and prosecutors. The United States has no policy interest in treating informants the same way it treats other suspected criminals. Its need for discretion in conducting foreign relations does not include a need to decide whether to inform foreign governments that there may be no basis for prosecuting a United States citizen because he provided the tip that led to the arrest. If Coumou\u2019s account of events in Port-auPrince is accurate, the government was required to take reasonable care to see that Haitian officials learned of Coumou\u2019s cooperation. Its failure to transmit the information may have been the result of a breach of that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">We remand Coumou\u2019s suit for the district court to determine whether the government failed to convey information to Haitian authorities and whether any such failure breached its duty of reasonable care.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. <em>Trevino v.
