A magistrate had found no unlawful detention, and held Backey to answer for trial in the superior court. Disagreeing, the superior court ordered suppressed the burglary\u2019s fruits found in Backey\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">The controlling authority of our inquiry follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, 797-798 [108 Cal.Rptr. 852, 511 P.2d 1204]. \u201c \u2018While a detention of a citizen by a police officer based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>\u201cmere hunch\u201d is unlawful, if there is a rational <em>suspicion </em>that some activity out of the ordinary is taking place, and some <em>suggestion </em>that the activity is related to crime, a detention is permissible.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>12 Cal.3d 85, 91 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353], \u201cWhere there is a rational belief of criminal activity with which the suspect is connected, a detention for reasonable investigative procedures infringes no constitutional restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>15 Cal.3d 384, 388-389 [124 Cal.Rptr. 536, 540 P.2d 632] (cert. den., 425 U.S. 934 [48 L.Ed.2d 175, 96 S.Ct. 1664]). \u201c \u2018[A] police officer may stop and question persons on public streets . . . when the circumstances indicate to a reasonable man in a like position that such a course of action is called for in the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties. . . . The good faith suspicion which warrants an officer\u2019s detention of a person for investigative reasons is necessarily of a lesser standard than that required to effect an arrest. . . . Where there is a rational belief of criminal activity with which the suspect is connected, a detention for reasonable investigative procedures infringes no constitutional restraint.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\"><em>In re Tony C., </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 892-899 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957], There the high court considered the competing public interests of the problem before us: (1) \u201cthe right of every person to enjoy the use of public streets, buildings, parks, and other conveniences without unwarranted interference or harassment by agents of the law\u201d (p. 893); and (2) the public expectation that \u201c\u2018in the proper discharge of the&lt;officer\u2019s duties\u2019 \u201d (p. 894), he will investigate his reasonable suspicions of criminal activity. The court said: \u201cBalancing these factors, the courts have concluded that in order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his training and experience ... to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. The corollaiy to this rule, of course, is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch is unlawful, even though the officer may be acting in complete good faith. ...\u201d (P. 893, fn. omitted.) \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal\u2014to \u2018enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u2019 \u201d (P. 894.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">We are concerned only with the evidence whether or not the police officer reasonably entertained a <em>\u201cgood faith </em>suspicion\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 388) that as to Backey \u201c \u2018some activity out of the ordinary [was] taking place\u2019 \u201d with a \u201c <em>\u2018suggestion </em>that the activity [was] related to crime, . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gale, supra, </em>9 Cal.3d at p. 798.) It follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">A police officer received an official daytime radio message that a citizen informer had reported a suspicious stranger in a residential area of Palo Alto. It was a high burglary area\u2014\u201c[t]he highest in the city.\u201d The burglaries mostly took place in the daylight hours, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The suspicious person was closely described. A short time later the police radio reported that the same citizen had again, in a different part of the city, seen the suspicious person who was then \u201cconcealing something under his coat.\u201d The officer soon saw the described person; his pockets \u201cobviously\u201d contained \u201clarge items.\u201d One of the items which could be seen was a portion of a camera. The officer stopped his car and approached and talked to Backey; \u201cit was something to the effect that we had a report of a suspicious person in the south end of town and he matched the description and I wanted to talk to him about it.\u201d The policeman conceded that pending the investigation, Backey was not \u201cfree to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">While, of course, there \u201cis nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 34 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 913, 88 S.Ct. 1868] (conc. opn. of White, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Manis, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 653, 662-663 [74 Cal.Rptr. 423]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>46 Cal.2d 114, 117 [293 P.2d 57]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 44, 47 [109 Cal.Rptr. 840]), here the superior court reasonably found a show of police authority. It has been said that, at least ordinarily, \u201ca detention occurs if the suspect is not free to leave at will\u2014if he is kept in the officer\u2019s presence by physical restraint, threat of force, or assertion of authority.\u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 895.) There\" was thus a \u201cdetention,\u201d which will be justified only where there is the <em>reasonable </em>\u201cgood faith suspicion\u201d of <em>Gale, Flores, Harris </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number><em>Tony C. </em>Nothing in the record suggests, nor does Backey contend, that the officer\u2019s obvious suspicion was not in good faith; the immediate issue is whether the officer had formed a <em>suspicion of criminal activity </em>and, if so, whether the suspicion was <em>reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The superior court\u2019s suppression ruling was based upon its conclusion that prior to the detention, the police officer was <em>informed of no \u201cevidence of a crime in this case.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">It seems proper, therefore, to consider whether the \u201c \u2018good faith suspicion which warrants an officer\u2019s detention of a person for investigative reasons\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 C.3d 384, 388-389) requires that he previously be furnished with \u201cevidence of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">\u201cSuspicion\u201d is commonly defined as; \u201cimagination or apprehension of something wrong or hurtful without proof or on slight evidence\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (3d ed. 1965) p. 2304); \u201c \u2018the imagination of the existence of something without proof, or upon very slight evidence, or upon no evidence at all.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Singer Sewing Machine Co., </em>138 Cal.App. 418, 421 [32 P.2d 430]).  California\u2019s courts, as noted <em>supra </em>in <em>Gale </em>and <em>Tony C, </em>have modified these definitions as applied to police detention, making it clear that such a detention may not be based upon \u201cmere curiosity, rumor, or hunch.\u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.) There must instead be \u201c \u2018a rational <em>suspicion </em>that some activity out of the ordinary is taking place, and some <em>suggestion </em>that the activity is related to crime, . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gale, supra, </em>9 Cal.3d at p. 798.) And the suspicion \u201cmust be based on an objective perception of events rather than the subjective feelings\u201d of the officer. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 423, 426 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">From all of the foregoing it will appear that a police detention may be based upon specific and articulable matters personally observed by the officer or communicated to him by others. Such matters must be something more than a rumor or such as will cause conjecture or a mere hunch of criminal activity.  They will ordinarily be something less than an honest and reasonably held strong suspicion of such wrongdoing, for at that point the officer would have probable cause to arrest.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>They will be such as \u201cstrikes a balance between a person\u2019s interest in immunity from police interference and the community\u2019s interest in law enforcement. It wards off pressure to equate reasonable cause to investigate with reasonable cause to arrest, thus protecting the innocent from the risk of arrest when no more than reasonable investigation is justified.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickelson, </em>59 Cal.2d 448, 452 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The evidence of the instant case manifests the officer\u2019s good faith <em>suspicion </em>of Backey\u2019s criminal activity, a suspicion based on specific, articulable, and objective, although perhaps \u201cslight,\u201d information, and not upon \u201cmere curiosity, rumor, or hunch.\u201d Backey\u2019s detention was authorized by the authority of <em>Gale, Flores, Harris </em>and <em>Tony C. </em>It was accordingly without constitutional fault, and the superior court erroneously used a standard requiring \u201cevidence of a crime in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Backey appears to concede\u2014at least he makes no contrary contention\u2014that assuming the right to detain, the officer had a corresponding right for his own safety to make, as he did, a minimally intrusive pat-down search. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Juarez, </em>35 Cal.App.3d 631, 636 [110 Cal.Rptr. 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Another issue appears.  It is argued that the detention was unduly, and thus unconstitutionally, delayed while the officer sought radio and computer information whether property observed in Backey\u2019s possession was stolen. In respect of this issue, the following appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Upon Backey\u2019s detention the officer told him of the citizen\u2019s reports of a suspicious person of Backey\u2019s description, and said he wanted to talk to him about it. The officer \u201cnoticed his pockets were bulging and he had something underneath his jacket,. . .\u201d Referring to a camera a portion of which was in plain sight, Backey said that it was his property. The officer then \u201cstarted asking him about the functions of the camera, the lens settings and the T stop, and he was unable to answer the questions.\u201d The officer testified, \u201cI asked him if I could see the camera. . . . He said yes and he took it out of the case and gave it to me.\u201d It had a hand engraved number on it, and the communications system \u201cran it as a California driver\u2019s license and subsequently came back to a residence in the south part of town where the defendant had been seen . . . .\u201d Further radio information indicated that the camera had been stolen earlier that day in a burglary, whereupon Backey was arrested. The entire detention lasted about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>A detention reasonably effected must also be reasonable in its duration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilliam, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 181, 188 [116 Cal.Rptr. 317], and see authority there cited.) At the instant detention\u2019s commencement it appeared reasonably probable that Backey was in possession of stolen property. It became reasonable to continue the investigation, thus to \u201c \u2018enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.) The relatively short continued detention for this purpose does not appear to have been unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">The peremptory writ of mandate will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The petition of the real party in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 30, 1978. Bird, C. J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">\u201c \u2018Cause for arrest exists when the facts known to the arresting officer \u201cwould lead a man of ordinary care and, prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person is guilty of a crime.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn, </em>18 Cal.3d 889, 895 [135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
