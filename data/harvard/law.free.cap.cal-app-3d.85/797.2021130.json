J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsX\">This appeal is taken from an order of dismissal entered after Security Pacific National Bank\u2019s (hereinafter Security) general demurrer to Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company\u2019s (hereinafter Fireman\u2019s) second amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff-appellant Fireman\u2019s instituted these proceedings against defendant-respondent Security, among others, to recover damages in the amount of a $25,000 check deposited by one of the latter\u2019s customers, Jason A. Keyes (hereinafter Keyes), into his account having earlier forged one of the drawer\u2019s signatures on a check drawn from the account of Daniel Reeves &amp; Company (hereinafter Reeves) at Banco Popular De Puerto Rico (hereinafter Banco).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Fireman\u2019s contends that it has pleaded sufficient facts to allege a cause of action for common law negligence, as well as breach of certain warranties found within divisions 3 and 4 of the California Uniform Commercial Code (hereinafter Commercial or Com. Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The problem confronting us arose when Keyes absconded with $25,000. The check involved was prepared by Keyes, whose signature was one of two required on checks drawn on the Reeves account at Banco. After signing his own name to the check, Keyes forged the other required signature and the check was made payable to the order of \u201cSecurity Pacific National Bank A/C No. 260 049 569 GC Associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">At or about the same time the forgeiy was committed, Keyes opened an account at Security in the name of G. C. Associates. The account number was No. 260 049 569.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the forgery, Keyes took the check to Security, the check having then a typewritten indorsement thereon, reading: \u201cDeposit Only AC 049 569 G. C. Associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Security provisionally accepted the check for deposit to account No. 049569 and, allegedly, after the check was paid by Banco the money was withdrawn by Keyes, who was the authorized signatory for the G. C. Associates\u2019 account.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">When Security forwarded the check for payment to Banco, Banco paid Security and debited the Reeves account. Although Reeves has demanded that its account be recredited, Banco continues to refuse to do so. In the interim, Fireman\u2019s Fund paid Reeves the $25,000 on its Fidelity bond and now seeks reimbursement from <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fireman\u2019s has chosen to look to Security for its recovery so far as these three causes of action are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The code allocates risks for forgeries according to both the type of forgery involved and its underlying policy promoting free transferability of checks within the context of commercial transactions. Disregarding certain exceptions, ultimate liability for payment of a check bearing a forged drawer\u2019s signature rests with the drawee bank, which, in this case, is Banco.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The code provides that as between the drawee bank and the depositor, losses from a forged or unauthorized signature are borne by the bank<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since payment not made pursuant to directions of a \u201cproperly payable\u201d order cannot be charged to the depositor\u2019s account. (Com. Code, \u00a7 3401, subd. (1) and \u00a7 4401, subd. (I).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Basch </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 316 [139 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Reeves therefore has the right to insist that Banco recredit its account with the amount of the unauthorized payment. <em>(Stone &amp; Webster Eng. Corp. </em>v. <em>First National B. &amp; T. Co. </em>(1962) 345 Mass. 1 [184 N.E.2d 358, 99 A.L.R.2d 628].) (This recovery is sought in other counts, or count, in the complaint.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We conclude that Fireman\u2019s is suing the wrong party.  If it has a cause of action against a bank,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is not against Security, but against Banco for breaching its primary contractual obligation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to its customer (Reeves) and for violating its implicit duty under section 4401 to pay only checks \u201cproperly payable.\u201d As drawee, it was Banco\u2019s duty to know Reeve\u2019s signature, <em>(Basch </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 316) and having payed the forged check, such payment is considered to have been made from its own funds. Absent negligence on the part of the drawer, Banco is liable even if it has paid in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. <em>(Union Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bk. </em>(1923) 192 Cal. 40, 46 [218 P. 424, 28 A.L.R. 1417]; <em>Janin </em>v. <em>London &amp; S. F. Bank </em>(1891) 92 Cal. 14, 22-23 [27 P. 1100]; <em>Hensley-Johnson </em>v. <em>Citizens Nat. Bank </em>(1953) 122 Cal.App.2d 22 [264 P.2d 973]; 10 Am. Jur.2d, Banks, \u00a7 603.) <em>This is, of course, not the issue before us and our statement here is not a holding binding upon Banco. </em>It may have other defenses such as the statute of limitations about which we have no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Further, if there does lie a cause of action against Security, the proper plaintiff would be Banco.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">This summation is insufficient, however, to satisfy Fireman\u2019s contentions :</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The standard of review is well established for measuring the validity of a pleading that has not withstood a demurrer. While \u201c[a] demurrer admits all material and issuable facts properly pleaded. ... it does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged therein.\u201d <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].) It has also been established that \u201c. . . \u2018plaintiff need only plead facts showing that he may be entitled to some relief [citation].\u2019 [Citation.] Furthermore, we are not concerned with plaintiff\u2019s possible inability or difficulty in proving the allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>(Gruenberg </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 566, 572 [108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In its second amended complaint, Fireman\u2019s sets forth seven separate causes of action. Three of the causes of action were against respondent Security. The others are against other parties not involved in this appeal. In its fifth cause of action, Fireman\u2019s alleged that Security was negligent in its handling of the check in that it failed to \u201cadhere to the reasonable commercial standards of the banking business in the community,\u201d and also violated its own standards as set forth in its operations manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In its sixth cause of action, it alleged that Security, in its capacity as joint payee of the forged check, breached its warranty of good title to Fireman\u2019s insured in that it did not have good title to the instrument and was not acting on behalf of a person who did have good title to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In its seventh cause of action, Fireman\u2019s alleged that Security, in its capacity as collecting bank, breached its warranty of good title to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Fireman\u2019s insured, as drawer of the check, who was a third party beneficiary of such warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Fireman\u2019s did not discuss its sixth or seventh causes of action in either its opening or reply briefs, except most generally. However, a general demurrer will not be sustained if the pleading, liberally construed, states a cause of action on any theory. <em>(Minsky </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 118 [113 Cal.Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726].) Thus, these causes of action are properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Does appellant\u2019s complaint state a cause of action against Security?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">1. <em>Has Fireman\u2019s, in its sixth and seventh causes of action, set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action with respect to respondent Security for breach of warranty of good title, or otherwise?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Fireman\u2019s sixth cause of action is based upon warranties of presentment and transfer as provided for in section 3417, subdivision (l)(a), of the Commercial Code. That section, which is contained within division 3 of the code governing \u201cCommercial Paper\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 3101), provides: \u201c(1) Any person[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] who obtains payment or acceptance and any prior transferor warrants to a person who in good faith pays or accepts that (a) He has good title to the instrument or is authorized to obtain payment or acceptance on behalf of one who has a good title; and (b) He has no knowledge that the signature of the maker or drawer is unauthorized, except that this warranty is not given by a holder in due course acting in good faith. . . . (ii) To a drawer with respect to the drawer\u2019s own signature, whether or not the drawer is also the drawee; \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Fireman\u2019s seventh cause of action states that Security is liable for breach of warranty of title under section 4207, subdivision (l)(a), within division 4 of the Commercial Code governing \u201cBank Deposits and Collections\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 4101), which provides: \u201c(1) Each customer or collecting bank who obtains payment or acceptance of an item and each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>prior customer and collecting bank warrants to the payor bank or other payor who in good faith pays or accepts the item that (a) He has good title to the item or is authorized to obtain payment or acceptance on behalf of one who has a good title; and (b) He has no knowledge that the signature of the maker or drawer is unauthorized, except that this warranty is not given by any customer or collecting bank that is a holder in due course and acts in good faith. . . . (ii) To a drawer with respect to the drawer\u2019s own signature, whether or not the drawer is also the drawee; . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Fireman\u2019s has pleaded both of these sections, despite the similarity of their provisions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as a result of varying its statement of the capacity in which Security acted during the transaction with Keyes. In its sixth cause of action, Fireman\u2019s alleges that Security was liable as \u201cjoint payee.\u201d The seventh cause of action, however, is predicated upon the allegation that Security acted as \u201ccollecting bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">This variance in allegations apparently stems from Security\u2019s allegedly being named payee on the face of the check in addition to acting as the conduit through which funds were collected on behalf of its customer\u2019s (Keyes) account. (See Com. Code, \u00a7 4105.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">While we recognize the permissibility of pleading \u201cinconsistent counts\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 290-292, pp. 1965-1967), it is our conclusion that Security is precluded from being a \u201cpayee\u201d in the instant case. (See <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In any event, for our purposes, the warranties of sections 3417, subdivision (l)(a) and 4207, subdivision (l)(a) are identical in that they both present the issue, namely, whether Security breached a warranty of good title under the facts of the case at bar.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Considering Fireman\u2019s right to maintain an action based on the warranties of sections 3417 and 4207, we first ascertain whether Reeves (to whose rights Fireman\u2019s is subrogated), as drawer of the check in question, may rely upon the aforementioned warranty provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Although it had been the general view that section 4207 did not specifically provide for a direct cause of action by a drawer<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> against a collecting bank, in <em>Sun \u2019N Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 671 [148 Cal.Rptr. 329, 582 P.2d 920], the California Supreme Court\u2014in reexamining the rule of <em>Cal. Mill Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 334 [223 P.2d 849]\u2014held to the contrary. The court stated: \u201c[T]he drawer of a check whose account is charged is [an other payor] within the meaning of section 4207 and may maintain an action against a collecting bank based on that section\u2019s warranties.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 682, 683.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Fireman\u2019s, then, may rely on the warranty of good title provided by sections 3417 and 4207, but do the alleged facts, if assumed to be true, constitute a breach of said warranties?</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The warranty of good title provisions of sections 3417 and 4207 require a very limited inquiry: \u201cdoes the instrument presented contain all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>necessary indorsements and are such indorsements genuine or otherwise deemed effective?\u201d <em>(Sun \u2019N Sand Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 671, 687; see also Whaley, <em>Forged Indorsements and the UCC\u2019s \u201cHolder\u201d </em>(1972) 6 Ind.L.Rev. 45, 59-61; White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (1972) pp. 510, 521, fn. 6; <em>Bagby </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1974) 491 F.2d 192, 199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Since the warranty of good title relates only to the validity of necessary indorsements, the question is whether the typewritten indorsement \u201cDeposit only A/C 049 569 G. C. Associates\u201d can be considered to be a forgery. Commercial Code, section 1201, subdivision (43), defines an \u201cunauthorized\u201d signature or indorsement as \u201cone made without actual, implied or apparent authority . . . .\u201d Section 3401, subdivision (2), states that \u201c[a] signature is made by use of any name, including any trade or assumed name, upon an instrument, or by any word or mark used in lieu of a written signature.\u201d The indorsing signature, therefore, \u201cmay be handwritten, typed, printed or made in any other manner,\u201d and \u201cmay be made in any name, including any trade name or assumed name, however false and fictitious, which is adopted for the purpose.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 3401, U. Com. Code Com. 2.) The fact that the check in question had a typewritten indorsement rather than a written signature is immaterial in determining whether the indorsement was valid, and the issue is whether Keyes had the authority to indorse the Reeves check in the name of G. C. Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Fireman\u2019s alleges that Keyes was a \u201cco-partner and agent\u201d of G. C. Associates, with authority as signator on account No. 260 049 569. From these allegations we conclude that Keyes <em>did </em>have such authority to indorse the check in question and that such indorsement was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We hold, therefore, that Fireman\u2019s has failed to state a cause of action against Security under either section 3417 or section 4207 of the Commercial Code, and that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Fireman\u2019s sixth and seventh causes of action was proper.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">2. <em>Does a noncustomer drawer whose signature was forged on a check by an employee (with authorization to sign in his own capacity) have a right of action against a bank, functioning in the alternative as either a payee or collecting bank, whose alleged negligent handling of the check aided the forger in collecting the proceeds from the drawer\u2019s account at the drawee bank?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>In its fifth cause of action, Fireman\u2019s alleges that Security owed a duty to Reeves to use reasonable care in dealing with the check and proceeds thereof, and to \u201cadhere to the reasonable commercial standards of the banking community.\u201d Fireman\u2019s further alleges that this duty of care was breached by failure of Security to adhere to those standards and that Security further acted negligently by violating its own standards as set forth in its operations manual. Fireman\u2019s contends that the violation of either or both of these standards is evidence of negligence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Regarding the elements of a cause of action for negligent injury to person or property, the complaint \u201cmust allege (1) defendant\u2019s legal duty of care toward plaintiff . . . ; (2) defendant\u2019s breach of duty\u2014the negligent act or omission . . . ; (3) injury to plaintiff as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>breach\u2014proximate or legal cause . . . ; [and] (4) damage to plaintiff . . . .\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7 450, p. 2103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Although the legal conclusion that \u201ca duty\u201d exists is neither necessary nor proper in a complaint, facts which cause it to arise (or from which it is \u201cinferred\u201d) are essential to the cause of action. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Crafts </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 370, 374 [60 P.2d 533].) The present California test for negligence liability is much broader and based simply on foreseeability of the risk and proximate cause. <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728, 740 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316].) It was the application of this test, \u201cforeseeability of the risk,\u201d which led the court, in <em>Sun </em>TV <em>Sand, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 671, at page 695, to find the existence of a duty on the part of a collecting bank with regard to its handling of a noncustomer drawer\u2019s check made payable to the bank, but negotiated by a third party for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Furthermore, the <em>Sun </em>TV <em>Sand </em>court rejected the bank\u2019s contention that section 1103 disallowed a cause of action for common law negligence under the facts of that case. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Like the case at bar, <em>Sun </em>TV <em>Sand </em>involved the question of the right of an employer to recover funds embezzled by an employee through the manipulation of company checks. The employee in that case, Eloise Morales, prepared checks for signature by a corporate officer. Her scheme was a simple one: over a three-year period she prepared a series of checks payable to a bank (UCB) at which she deposited the checks into her personal account, after obtaining the necessary authorized signatures. The officer signing the checks, did so under the mistaken belief that they represented sums his company owed to the bank. Such debts, however, did not in fact exist. The checks were originally made out in small amounts. After being signed, however, employee Morales would alter them, increasing the amount of each check to several thousand dollars. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The employer based one of his causes of action against the bank on the theory of negligence\u2014on the allegation that \u201c[although UCB was the named payee, it \u2018caused or permitted\u2019 the proceeds of the checks to be deposited in\u201d Morales\u2019 personal account which she maintained at UCB. <em>(Id.) </em>As in the case at bar, UCB (the collecting bank) presented the checks to the employer\u2019s bank (drawee bank) and the latter paid them after charging Sun \u2019N Sand\u2019s account for their face amounts. Again, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>here, Sun \u2019N Sand proceeded, inter alia, upon a negligence cause of action, asserting that UCB breached its duty of care in permitting checks on which it was named as payee to be deposited in the personal account of Sun \u2019N Sand\u2019s employe\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In reversing the lower court\u2019s judgment (order of dismissal), the Supreme Court found that the allegation stated a cause of action for negligence. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 703.) The court, however, was very careful to limit the circumstances upon which such a duty to make inquiry arises. Relying upon the principle of <em>Pacific Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Bank of Yolo </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 357 [10 P.2d 68], reaffirmed in <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Security First Nat. Bank </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 75 [56 Cal.Rptr. 142],<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the <em>Sun N Sand </em>court stated that the bank\u2019s \u201cduty is narrowly circumscribed: it is activated only when checks, not insignificant in amount, are drawn payable to the order of a bank and are presented to the payee bank by a third party seeking to negotiate the checks for his own benefit.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at p. 695.) In emphasizing that the bank\u2019s obligation is minimal, the court continued by stating that \u201c[w]e hold simply that the bank may not ignore the danger signals inherent in such an attempted negotiation. There must be <em>objective indicia </em>from which the bank could reasonably conclude that the party presenting the check is authorized to transact in the manner proposed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 695-696. Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The court also rejected UCB\u2019s contention that section 1103<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the code precluded the plaintiff from proceeding by means of a common law action for negligence. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 696.) The court found that the code did not articulate a loss distributive scheme \u201cthat applies to fact patterns such as alleged herein [which would displace] common law negligence actions.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The factual pattern in <em>Sun \u2019N Sand </em>is somewhat similar to that of the instant case; they are, however, critically different in two respects: First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the defendant bank in the first case was the named payee of the check in question. Second, the check in <em>Sun \u2019N Sand </em>did not involve a forged drawer\u2019s signature as did the check in question in the case at bar. This second fact brings into play code section 3418 which <em>does </em>articulate a loss distributive scheme that displaces an action for common law negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In order to determine whether Security\u2019s duty, if any, can rest upon the \u201cforeseeability of the risk\u201d test, we must first clarify in what capacity Security is to be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A. <em>Was Security a payee?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Fireman\u2019s specifically alleges that the check in question could be construed to be payable to Security itself, and that for the purpose of the demurrer this allegation must be accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Fireman\u2019s contention, however, that Security is the payee of the check in question is based solely upon the \u201calleged\u201d ambiguity of the payee line: \u201cSecurity Pacific National Bank A/C No. 260 049 569 G. C. Associates.\u201d In support of its argument that Security was a payee, Fireman\u2019s incorrectly relies on Commercial Code section 3117, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This code provision makes checks payable to a named person with additional words of description (other than words describing him as agent or officer, or fiduciary) payable to the payee unconditionally, with the additional words having no effect whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Fireman\u2019s contends that because Security is not specifically designated as agent (Com. Code, \u00a7 3117, subd. (a)), or as fiduciary (Com. Code, \u00a7 3117, subd. (b)) that it must therefore be an \u201cunconditional payee\u201d under Commercial Code section 3117, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">However, a review of Commercial Code section 3117, Uniform Commercial Code Comment 3, which expands on subdivision (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>indicates that this subdivision does not apply to the facts presented in the case at bar.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Subdivision (c) deals with the words of description which are to be \u201ctreated as <em>mere identification, </em>and not in any respect as a condition of payment,\u201d or descriptive words which <em>do \u201cnot </em>name the . . . beneficiary.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The additional words on the payee line of the forged check\u2014\u201cA/C No. 260 049 569 G. C. Associates\u201d\u2014do not merely \u201cdescribe\u201d Security.  It is a settled rule of statutory construction that statutes are to be given a reasonable and common sense construction <em>(Ivens </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 177, 181 [27 Cal.Rptr. 801]), in accordance with their apparent purpose and intention <em>(County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Kuchel </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 193, 199 [195 P.2d 17]), and one that is practical rather than technical. <em>(Estate of Anderson </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 535 [3 Cal.Rptr. 697].) The words must be read in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute <em>(Johnstone </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 41, 46 [229 P.2d 9]), and the statutory language applied must be given such interpretation as will promote rather than defeat the objective and policy of the law. <em>(City of L. A. </em>v. <em>Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 253, 256 [330 P.2d 888].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The purpose of section 3117, subdivision (c), is two-fold; first, that \u201cthe person named [as payee] may negotiate ... the instrument if he is otherwise identified, even though he does not meet the description\u201d; and, second, that \u201c[a]ny subsequent party [e.g., indorsers, or depository, collecting or payor banks] dealing with the instrument may disregard the description and treat the paper as payable unconditionally to the individual. . . .\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 3117, U. Com. Code Com. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">It is clear from this comment that the purpose and intended practical effect of section 3117 is to protect both the payee, in his right to negotiate the instrument, and the subsequent transferor, from being misled. Its purpose is <em>not </em>to protect the drawer of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Few reported cases have involved interpretation of Commercial Code section 3117, subdivision (c), and all are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The seminal case, <em>West Penn Administration, Inc. </em>v. <em>Union National Bank </em>(1975) 233 Pa.Super. 311, [335 A.2d 725], involved checks representing payments into pension and welfare trust funds on behalf of labor unions, which named as payee a certain bank, followed by the designation of a particular \u201ccontribution account.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court held that the bank, rather than the named \u201ccontribution account,\u201d was the real payee. <em>However, the court relied upon language of an express agreement </em>between plaintiff and defendant bank which had been used to establish the accounts, and also upon subsequent conduct by the defendant bank consistent with the agreement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>Frost National Bank </em>v. <em>Nicholas and Barerra </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1976) 534 S.W.2d 927, the court found section 3117, subdivision (c), to be applicable where checks had been drawn naming as payee \u201cDepository Account No. 607.\u201d Although the court held that the words \u201cNo. 607\u201d merely amounted to \u201cwords of description,\u201d it based its conclusion upon facts which are not present in the case at bar. First, the number \u201c607\u201d was not an account number, and had been placed upon the check by the embezzler \u201cto lend credence to [his] whole scheme.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 933.)

However, in reaching its conclusion the court referred to the presence of the comma, separating the two parties, as introducing a \u201cpatent ambiguity\u201d on the face of the instrument; and although the language admittedly was \u201cnot typical of instruments payable with words of description . . . ,\u201d based its finding upon evidence that \u201cthe parties responsible for this language intended the instrument to be payable to Haliewicz <em>uncondition</em>ally.\u201d (Italics in original. <em>Id., </em>at p. 1147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>In view of the aforementioned cases and upon an analysis of the comments to section 3117, the most reasonable construction of the payee line in the instant case is to interpret it as falling within the ambit of Commercial Code section 3117, subdivision (a), which provides that \u201c[a]n instrument made payable to a named person with the addition of words describing him (a) As agent or officer of a specified person is payable to his principal but the agent or officer may act as if he were the holder.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We find, therefore, that the meaning of the payee line as set forth on the instrument in question is that the inclusion of \u201cA/C No. 260 049 569 G.

Italics added.) The court further noted that a duty to make reasonable inquiries arose because the \u201c \u2018defendant\u2019s name as payee of the check indicated the drawer\u2019s intention to lodge the moneys in its custody and place them under its control, and <em>nothing further than this was inferable from the language of the check.\u2019 \u201d (Id., </em>at p. 693, citing <em>Pacific Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Bank of Yolo </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 357, 360-361 [10 P.2d 68], quoting <em>Sims </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>(1886) 103 N.Y. 472 [9 N.E. 605].

It is upon these facts that the court concluded that UCB had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>\u201caffirmatively engaged in risk-creating conduct,\u201d and it was also in this context that the \u201ccircumstances alleged were sufficiently suspicious, and the risks thus sufficiently apparent, that a duty to make reasonable inquiries arose.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 693.) Not only was Security not the named payee on the check in question, but the inclusion of \u201cA/C No. 260 049 569 G. C.

In its general statement, Fireman\u2019s is correct; however, the <em>presentment </em>of the subject item is not in question in the case at bar. Presentment is made by a presenting bank at a place where the payor bank (Banco) has requested that presentment be made. (U. Com. Code, \u00a7 4204, subd. (3); Com. Code, \u00a7 4204, subd. (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Fireman\u2019s cites in support of its contention <em>Frontier Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Home Bank </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 630 [77 Cal.Rptr. 641], There the plaintiff-drawer brought an action against the defendant-payee bank for payment made by said bank on a check which was issued as a result of a mistake by the drawer. Although the court held that the collecting bank status did not apply, in that the check was made payable to the bank, it specifically noted that even as a collecting bank the defendant would not have been liable, since the duty of ordinary care imposed under section 4202 of the Commercial Code, subdivision (l)(a), does not create a duty of ascertaining whether or not a check was issued by mistake. <em>(Id., </em>at P. 636.)  Similarly, we find that section 4202, subdivision (l)(a), does not impose upon a collecting bank the duty of determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>the check bore a forged maker\u2019s signature. Uniform Commercial Code Comment 3 refers to subdivision (1) as \u201cdescribing] <em>types </em>of basic action with respect to which a collecting bank must use ordinary care.\u201d (Italics in original.) Moreover, Commercial Code section 3504, subdivision (1), defines presentment as \u201ca demand for acceptance or payment made upon the maker, acceptor, drawee or other payor by or on behalf of the holder.\u201d Not only does Fireman\u2019s fail to allege negligence in regard to the above actions, but this is exactly the point in the collection process which marks the inception of the duty of the payor bank (Banco) to detect a forged signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Even viewing the receiving and initial processing of a check as part of the process of \u201cpresentment,\u201d such duties as imposed on a collecting bank by section 4202 of the code, when properly applied, should be imposed only by the owner of the instrument who initiates collection or by a prior collecting bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">2. <em>May Security avail itself of California Commercial Code section 3418, and if so, does this section prevent a drawer from bringing a direct suit against a collecting bank for negligence\u2014expressly or impliedly?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">It is worth repeating that, unlike <em>Sun \u2019N Sand, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 671, our case deals essentially with payment over a forged drawer\u2019s signature, and a collecting bank\u2019s liability to the noncustomer<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> drawer for such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The general rule is that ultimate liability with respect to a forged indorsement other than by the drawer lies with the collecting bank.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The reason most often cited is that the collecting bank is in the best position to ascertain the validity of an indorsement (other than the drawer\u2019s) since it presumably confronts the indorser. Conversely, when dealing with a forged drawer\u2019s signature, it is reasoned that the drawee bank, possessing the signature card, of the drawer, is in the best position to ascertain the forgery. Consequently, liability for payment over a forged drawer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>signature lies solely with the drawee bank, unless the person obtaining payment has knowledge of the forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">This rule, first enunciated in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neal </em>(1762) 3 Burr. 1354, is embodied in Commercial Code section 3418 (restating the rule of former Civ. Code, \u00a7 3143), which provides as follows: \u201cExcept for recovery of bank payments as provided in the division on bank deposits and collections (Division 4) and except for liability for breach of warranty on presentment under the preceding section, payment or acceptance of any instrument is final in favor of a holder in due course, or a person who has in good faith changed his position in reliance on the payment.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Before reviewing the meaning of this section and its applicability to the case at bar, it is essential to determine whether or not Security qualifies for its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Under section 3418 payment or acceptance of an instrument is final in favor of a holder in due course, or in favor of \u201ca person who has in good faith changed his position in reliance on the payment.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">3.  <em>Did Security in good faith change its position in reliance on the payment made by Banco?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Fireman\u2019s alleges that Security allowed Keyes to withdraw the $25,000 <em>after </em>it had received final payment. This satisfies the \u201creliance\u201d requirement of section 3418. The determinative fact regarding the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>reliance is not that the bank gave value, but rather that it changed its legal position only after knowledge of payment by Banco. Hence, it \u201crelied\u201d upon the payment before changing its \u201cposition.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Was Security\u2019s reliance in good faith? California Uniform Commercial Code Comment 2 to section 3302 (delineating the meaning of \u201cgood faith\u201d with regard to holder in due course status) refers to the term \u201cgood faith\u201d as \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1201, subd. (19).) It is of note that this comment continues as follows: \u201cThe presence of suspicious circumstances sufficient to put a reasonably prudent person on inquiry does <em>not </em>negative existence of good faith.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Fireman\u2019s maintains, however, that even conceding the fact that Security has met the requirement of \u201chonesty in fact,\u201d the qualification for protection under section 3418 regarding good faith requires a consideration of \u201cnegligence and all the circumstances surrounding the transaction\u201d in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Admittedly, the code is in need of clarification as to its varying standards of negligence, but with regard to section 3418, Uniform Commercial Code Comment 4 (adopted from the official text) makes the criteria quite clear: \u201c[This] section rejects decisions under the original Act permitting recovery on the basis of mere negligence of the holder in taking the instrument.\u201d This comment continues by concluding that the holder\u2019s negligence does not affect the finality of payment or acceptance unless \u201csuch negligence amounts to a lack of good faith ... or to notice under the rules (Section 3-304) relating to notice to a purchaser of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>instrument . . . .\u201d Uniform Commercial Code Comment 1 makes clear that the term \u201cnotice\u201d as used in section 3304 is defined in section 1201, subdivision (25). Subdivision (25)(c) provides that one has notice of a fact when \u201c[fjrom all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists.\u201d <em>Sun \u2019N Sand, supra, </em>noted that the phrase \u201creason to know,\u201d suggested an objective notion of notice, and in dicta the court disapproved of the more restrictive view of notice which the majority of jurisdictions follow. (21 Cal.3d 671, 697, fn. 21.) In these jurisdictions negligence must be so gross as to amount to bad faith before notice will be found. (See, e.g., <em>Eldon\u2019s Sup. Fresh Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, etc. </em>(1973) 296 Minn. 130 [207 N.W.2d 282, 287]; <em>Richardson Company </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank in Dallas </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1974) 504 S.W.2d 812, 816.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Appellant cites section 3304 of the Commercial Code as providing that the purchaser of commercial paper has notice of a claim or defense if (subd. (l)(a)): \u201cThe instrument is so incomplete, bears such visible evidence of forgery or alteration, or is otherwise so irregular as to call into question its validity, terms or ownership or to create an ambiguity as to the party to pay; . . .\u201d (Subd. (4)(e)): \u201c[A]ny person negotiating the instrument is or was a fiduciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Fireman\u2019s apparently is contending (1) that Security was put on notice of inquiry because of the purported \u201cambiguity\u201d as to the party to be paid, and (2) that Security had a duty of inquiry because it purportedly had notice that the person negotiating the instrument was a fiduciary. Both contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In the first instance, we have already concluded that the payee line was not \u201cso irregular\u201d as to call into question the validity of the instrument; and, secondly, Fireman\u2019s has misstated Commercial Code section 3304 with regard to its claim that a collecting bank has notice of a claim or defense when it has knowledge that the person negotiating an item is or was a fiduciary.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Section 3304, subdivision (4)(e), provides expressly to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">\u201c(4) Knowledge of the following facts <em>does not </em>of itself give the purchaser notice of a defense or claim ...(e) That any person negotiating the instrument is or was a fiduciary.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Even accepting the restrictive view of notice, as approved by <em>Sun \u2019N Sand, </em>we find that the alleged facts herein do not constitute such notice. Even if Security was aware that the item was being negotiated by a fiduciary, unless it took the item with knowledge of a breach of trust (there being no such allegation in the case at bar), or, at a minimum, without \u201cobjective indicia from which [it] could reasonably conclude that the party presenting the check [was] authorized to transact in the manner proposed,\u201d it was free to assume that the fiduciary was acting properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Unlike <em>Sun \u2019N Sand, </em>in which the defendant bank\u2019s \u201cnegligence derives from its failure to respond reasonably to the \u2018notice\u2019 conveyed by . . . suspicious circumstances,\u201d we find in the case at bar that there was no \u201cnotice\u201d as defined in Commercial Code section 3304. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 697.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Therefore, we conclude that Security, as both a holder in due course<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and as \u201ca person who has in good faith changed his position in reliance on the payment,\u201d qualifies for protection under the final payment rule embodied in section 3418 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Before turning to the consequences of such protection, we address ourselves to one final argument Fireman\u2019s makes in an attempt to preclude such coverage. Fireman\u2019s argues that even if more than \u201cmere negligence\u201d is required to deprive one of the availability of the section 3418 shield, the violation by Security of its own regulations may amount to \u201cgross negligence.\u201d However, we note that a holder\u2019s.good faith has been upheld despite violation of the holder\u2019s own managerial rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>regarding check cashing. <em>(Industrial Nat. Bank of R. I. </em>v. <em>Leo\u2019s Used Car Ex., Inc. </em>(1973) 362 Mass. 797 [291 N.E.2d 603, 606].) In this case, the court held that the fact that a bank teller took and cashed two checks of a corporation drawn on another bank, in violation of an internal rule of the cashing bank requiring the approval of the manager before such checks should be cashed, made no difference in testing the good faith of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The facts here are similar to those presented in <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Hampton State Bank </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1973) 497 S.W.2d 80, in which a drawee bank tried to recover on a forged check after payment to the collecting bank. The drawee bank argued that the collecting bank was liable to the drawee based on common law negligence. In rejecting this argument, and specifically referring to Uniform Commercial Code section 3418, the court made the following observations: \u201cThe code sweeps away all exceptions to the Price v. Neal rule and substitutes the more definite standard of good faith for the standard of ordinary care, which produced confusion and uncertainty. J. Brady, Bank Checks 469 (4th ed. H. Bailey 1969). Consequently, we find no merit in Hampton\u2019s argument, based on pre-code cases [dealing with negligence], that Hampton [the collecting bank] had a common-law liability to Northwest [the drawee bank] for negligence in failing to observe the prevailing banking practice of requiring a corporate resolution before permitting withdrawal from an account opened in a corporate name. Under \u00a7 3-418, common-law liability is excluded and the controlling question is whether payment of the check by Northwest to Hampton was \u2018final\u2019.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 85-86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Likewise, Fireman\u2019s reliance on precode cases dealing with common law negligence is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Moreover, even if notice of the reason-to-know type depends upon some grade of negligence or what is \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d (see, e.g., <em>Von Gohren </em>v. <em>Pacific National Bank of Washington </em>(1973) 8 Wn.App. 245 [505 P.2d 467]; <em>Kaw Valley State Bank and Trust Company </em>v. <em>Riddle </em>(1976) 219 Kan. 550 [549 P.2d 927]), the alleged facts of the instant case were not sufficiently suspicious that a duty to make reasonable inquiry arose. As <em>Sun \u2019N Sand </em>states \u201c \u2018the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or an obligation to plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>{Sun </em>'N <em>Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank, supra, </em>21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Cal.3d 671, 695, citing <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728, 740 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The key fact here is that there were two signatures on the check in question, only one of which was that of the fiduciary (Keyes). Even if Security had noticed, as alleged, that Keyes was a fiduciary and the named payee on the check (signator of the account to which the payee line was made out), Security could have relied upon the second signature as an assurance that no misappropriation or fraud was being conducted which would lead to a foreseeable risk to Fireman\u2019s. Security awaited final payment from Banco (whose duty it was to verify the signatures) before it released the $25,000 which the check represented. We find that the presence of the second signature, coupled with the fact that a specific name and account number was designated as payee of the check, satisfied the requirement stated in <em>Sun \u2019N Sand </em>that \u201c[t]here must be objective indicia from which the bank could reasonably conclude that the party presenting the check is authorized to transact in the manner proposed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 695-696 of 21 Cal.3d.) It is only in the absence of such indicia that the bank \u201cpays at its peril.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>atp. 696 of 21 Cal.3d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Noting that section 3418 articulates a loss distributive scheme that is applicable to the fact pattern as alleged herein (forged drawer\u2019s signature), we further find that this section displaces an action for common law negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Fireman\u2019s final contention is that even if section 3418 precludes a common law action for negligence against a collecting bank after final payment has been made, this immunity applies only to a drawee bank, and not to a drawer.  We agree with Fireman\u2019s initial contention that the settled relationship between a drawer and drawee bank is one of debtor and creditor and not that of principal and agent. <em>(Smiths\u2019 Cash Store </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank </em>(1906) 149 Cal. 32, 34-35 [84 P. 663].) Thus, the drawer cannot be charged with the acceptance or payment of the check by the drawee bank through any agency concept.  Fireman\u2019s argument, however, violates the plain meaning of section 3418. After listing certain exceptions, inapplicable in the instant case, the section states that \u201cpayment or acceptance of any instrument is final in favor of ... a person who has in good faith changed his position in reliance on the payment.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 3418.) It has been argued that the words \u201cfinal payment\u201d are technical words embodying only a payor bank. (See Com. Code, \u00a7 4213.) However, even assuming this to be true, such words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>need not be limited to their technical meaning and effect if the context indicates that such a construction would frustrate the intention <em>of </em>the drafters. <em>(Shorb </em>v. <em>Barkley </em>(1952) 108 Cal.App.2d 873, 876-877 [240 P.2d 337].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Only by the use of a negative inference can the language of section 3418 be said not to preclude an action by a drawer. However, \u201c \u2018[w]here a section is silent on a particular point, negative inference may be justified when the reason of the situation requires or justifies such an inference.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In <em>Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank of Habersham County </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 553 F.2d 398, a federal court of appeals rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim that the final payment rule protects holders in due course only against subsequent claims of a drawee, and not those of a drawer. The plaintiff in <em>Perini </em>was a drawer who tried to bring a direct action for negligence against a collecting bank. The court noted that \u201c[njothing in the Code provide[d] [plaintiff with] an action against the collecting banks on the basis of [a] forged drawer\u2019s signature.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 416.) It further noted that the code, however, displaces common law causes of action only to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions of the code,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and then held that section 3418 did in fact bar the negligence cause of action. The court concluded its discussion by stating that section 3418 \u201callows one who meets its prerequisites to transfer a check secure in the knowledge that payment by the drawee ends the transaction with respect to claims that the drawer\u2019s signature is forged. See \u00a7 3-418, Comment 1. To allow the drawer, who as a regular customer of the drawee might be tempted to shift the loss away from that bank, the option of reopening the transaction would frustrate the expectations created by the Code.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">This interpretation of the code is consistent with its underlying purpose to \u201csimplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commercial transactions.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1102, subd. (2)(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">This interpretation is also in harmony with the finality policy which the drafter\u2019s recognize as the only valid modern basis for the rule of <em>Price </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number><em>Neal.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(\u201c[To prevent] an opening up of a previous transaction or series of transactions upon an instrument which is later discovered to have been forged or paid in error for any reason.\u201d (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 3418, Cal. Com. 1.))</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Finally, we consider whether Fireman\u2019s additional allegations that Security\u2019s violation of its own policies contained in its operations manual establish the existence of a duty owed to the noncustomer drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Admitting these allegations as true for the purpose of ruling on the demurrer, we find that Fireman\u2019s has still failed in its attempt to state a cause of action for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">While in some situations violation of a company rule may be used as evidence of breach of duty, it <em>cannot </em>be used to <em>establish </em>the existence of such a duty when contrary to both statutory and common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">For the violation of a statute to create actionable negligence, the plaintiff must have suffered the type of harm sought to be prevented by the rule, and <em>also </em>be a member of the class of people for whose protection the rule was enacted. <em>(Routh </em>v. <em>Quinn </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 488, 491-492 [127 P.2d 1, 149 A.L.R. 215].) A self-imposed rule from a bank\u2019s internal operations manual would have even less effect than a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Fireman\u2019s reliance on <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 241 [129 Cal.Rptr. 91], is of no avail. In that case the diity imposed upon the bank was based upon a contractual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">We hold, therefore, that under the facts of this case a noncustomer drawer whose signature was forged on a check drawn upon his account is precluded, by divisions 3 and 4 of the California Uniform Commercial Code, from bringing a direct cause of action based upon statutory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>common law negligence against a collecting bank after final payment has been made by the drawee bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Our holding, however, does not go so far as to preclude a drawer\u2019s direct cause of action for common law negligence against a collecting bank for the negligent handling of a check bearing a forged indorsement in all cases. We note that such a cause of action is nowhere specifically prohibited by the language of the code.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A court might conclude that equitable principles, not displaced by the code, and the duty to interpret the code liberally, when coupled with the overriding obligation to act in good faith, and the constant emphasis made by the code upon commercial reasonableness, permit a drawer to state an action directly against a collecting bank when the alleged facts indicate that the bank participated in the acts resulting in the loss suffered by the drawer. As we noted earlier, both statutory and case law unmistakably place the burden of loss from a forged indorsement on the party who deals with the forger. <em>(Covington </em>v. <em>Penn Square National Bank </em>(Okla. 1975) 545 P.2d 824, 826.) The code places the burden directly on the first bank in the collection process to insure that subsequent indorsements from the maker on a check are valid; and there is no duty either under law merchant or under the Uniform Commercial Code for the drawee bank to verify such indorsement of a payee on a check that <em>comes to it </em>from a collecting bank under warranty of indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">While the underlying policy of section 3418 makes it clear that to allow a cause of action for negligence by the drawer against the collecting bank based on the latter\u2019s failure to ascertain whether the drawer\u2019s signature is forged would vitiate the final payment policy <em>(Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank, supra, </em>553 F.2d 398), allowing a cause of action against a collecting bank for unreasonable conduct outside of the collection process, or for .failure to detect a forged instrument, would not so impede the processing of check transactions as to vitiate the final payment policy of section 3418. In our view such a cause of action would comport with the modem objectives of the Uniform Commercial Code and the directives for its application as set forth in section 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The final obstacle to such a plaintiff stating a cause of action for common law negligence might be the assertion of a failure to exercise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>duty of care owed to him by a collecting bank. However it has been said that analysis of liability for negligence in terms of \u201cduty\u201d is a question-begging process. The California Supreme Court, in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 728, 734, stated that \u201c[t]he assertion that liability must... be denied because defendant bears no \u2018duty\u2019 to plaintiff \u2018begs the essential question\u2014whether the plaintiff\u2019s interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant\u2019s conduct. . . .\u2019 \u201d A better approach is to weigh the policy considerations which \u201c \u2018lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 342 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737], and cases therein cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In imposing liability for negligence upon UCB, the <em>Sun </em>TV <em>Sand </em>court noted that \u201c[t]he most important of these [policy considerations] were set forth in <em>Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R.3d 496], and include[d] \u2018. . . the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sun </em>'N <em>Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 671, 695. See also <em>Biakanja </em>v. <em>Irving </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 647, 650 [320 P.2d 16, 65 A.L.R.2d 1358]; <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 241, 248 [129 Cal.Rptr. 91].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">This approach would also be consonant with California\u2019s \u201cstrong policy favor[ing] fault-based liability; negligent tortfeasors must compensate persons injured by their failure to exercise ordinary care. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Sun </em>'N <em>Sand, supra, </em>at p. 698 of 21 Cal.3d.) In that both statutory and case law clearly place the burden of loss from a forged indorsement on the party who deals with the forger, the foreseeability of the risk to the drawer, if such checks are handled in a negligent manner, is therefore direct and immediate. The drawee bank, having no means by which to ascertain the validity of such indorsement, cannot prevent the ensuing loss if the indorsement happens to be forged. Therefore, \u201cthe chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or an obligation to plaintiff. . . the foreseeability of the risk\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> is present in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>question of a collecting bank\u2019s liability for negligence to n noncustomer drawer whose losses stem from the bank\u2019s negligent handling of the latter\u2019s check bearing a forged indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">With regard to the instant case, however, we reiterate our holding that under these facts a noncustomer drawer whose signature was forged on a check drawn from his account is precluded by the California Commercial Code from bringing a direct cause of action against a collecting bank after final payment has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Sustaining a general demurrer without leave to amend is not an abuse of discretion if it appears from the complaint that under applicable substantive law there is no reasonable possibility or probability that the defect can be cured by amendment. <em>(Voter </em>v. <em>County of Glenn </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 815, 821 [323 P.2d 85].)
