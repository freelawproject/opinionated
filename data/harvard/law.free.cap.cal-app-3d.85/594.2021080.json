J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS_\">On November 3, 1976, in the City of Seaside, Dennis Volk was robbed at gunpoint while clerking at Mai\u2019s Market. By information in count one, appellants Kenneth Edward Young, Gregory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Ray Pickens and one Brainard Dennis Canty were jointly charged with the robbery of Mr. Volk.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">On November 7, 1976, Delmar Bear was robbed at gunpoint while he was clerking at Broadway Liquors, also located in the City of Seaside. Count two of the aforestated information charged appellant Pickens, along with Canty, with the robbery of Mr. Bear. Both robberies were the daylight variety; and in each count Mr. Canty was designated as the gunman by appropriate \u201cuse\u201d clauses. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5 and 1203.06.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Five or six hours after Mr. Volk was robbed, appellant Young was arrested in nearby Sand City Beach. At the beach, he was arrested as he conversed with a female companion while occupying the driver\u2019s seat of a \u201cblack and white\u201d automobile. While the vehicle only generally matched the eyewitness description furnished the police, it did bear the identical license number of the sought after \u201cgetaway car.\u201d No incriminating evidence was found on the person of Mr. Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">However, the black and white automobile was impounded and stored by the police as evidence. The day following the arrest the police in the course of scientific criminal investigation (dusting for prints) lifted the latent fingerprints of Mr. Pickens (outside) and Mr. Canty (inside).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Appellants\u2019 pretrial motion to suppress pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5 was denied; the fingerprints were received in evidence. Appellants herein complain reversible error: \u201cunreasonable search and seizure.\u201d Reasoning erroneously that dusting for fingerprints was a warrantless search, they urge this court to view the lifting of the latents as an illegal seizure. However, we will briefly explain that there was neither search nor seizure in the constitutional sense. Appellants\u2019 contention fails to appreciate that the \u201cgetaway car\u201d was itself evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">When jury selection commenced in Judge Harkjoon Paik\u2019s courtroom, there were not two but three defendants. During the noon recess of the second day of the prosecution\u2019s proof, codefendant Brainard Canty effectively removed himself from the courtroom and the jury\u2019s consideration by pleading \u201cguilty as charged\u201d to both counts of robbery. Over the remonstrations and objections of defense counsel, the trial judge greeted the jurors on their return with what is best described as a full disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall explain that in our view this was error but not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Mr. Canty made oral and written statements to the police. Mr. Young filed a pretrial motion to sever his cause from Mr. Canty\u2019s trial. The trial court denied the motion, edited the statement, and ruled the statements admissible. We shall reject Mr. Young\u2019s contention that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Neither Mr. Young nor Mr. Pickens testified. The prosecution requested jury instructions CALJIC No. 2.60 (rev. 1973) and CALJIC No. 2.61 (rev. 1971) concerning defendants\u2019 right to decline to testify, which the court gave. We find that this was not error. Even if we were to find error, we are convinced the error would not necessitate reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Mr. Young and Mr. Pickens were convicted of first degree robbery as charged. We will affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Dennis Volk was the only grocery clerk in Mai\u2019s Market in Seaside at about 8:15 a.m. on November 3, 1976, when appellant Kenneth Young walked in and asked if the store still bought silver coins. Volk remembered that Young had sold him some coins about a week earlier and Volk told him that he would buy them. Young sold Volk between $6 and $7 worth of coins at twice the face value. Young then left and Volk went back to his work filling the candy shelves.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Two or three minutes later appellant Gregory Pickens, who was wearing a diamond earring, walked up to Volk and asked him if he sold Ch\u00e1mpale. Volk answered that he did not and Pickens left. Within a minute or two Brainard Canty appeared. Canty pointed a handgun at Volk and forced him to fill up a brown paper bag with money from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>cash register. Volk put about $50 in the bag, and after Canty left, Volk called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">At about 8:15 that morning Patricia Alexander, who lived near Mai\u2019s Market, looked out her window and noticed appellant Young sitting in a large white car with a black top. The car was parked on the wrong side of the street and was moving backward and forward. Another woman, Silvia Caffall, was on her way to Mai\u2019s when she saw two men, one holding a gun, dash across the street and jump into a white car with black stripes and a black top. One got into the back and the other into the passenger side of the front and the car immediately took off. She jotted down the license number and took it in to Volk, who passed it on to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Four days later, on November 7, 1976, Delmar Bear was working at Broadway Liquors in Seaside at about 4:40 p.m. when Pickens and Canty entered together. Pickens asked for Ch\u00e1mpale. When Bear came back from the cooler with a four-pack, Canty had an automatic pistol trained on him and said, \u201cGet over here and give us all your money.\u201d Appellant Pickens had a knife tucked into his belt. Pickens took a paper bag and stuffed $50 or $60 into it. They forced Bear into the bathroom at the back of the store and demanded more money. They tied his hands with a piece of wire, took his car keys, and asked where his car was. Canty held the pistol to Bear\u2019s head and asked \u201cShall we kill him?\u201d Pickens answered \u201cNo\u201d and they left. Bear loosed his restraints and called the police within a minute after they left.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">A gas station attendant saw the two emerge from Broadway Liquors, and a neighbor saw them run down the street and try to hide behind some bushes in a vacant lot. A police car arrived almost at once, and the officer chased the two over an eight-foot fence and through several backyards before capturing them. The neighbor found a sack of money where they had been hiding in the vacant lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Appellants contend that the fingerprints of Canty and Pickens were improperly admitted into evidence. Their argument is premised on the misconception that when the police acquired the fingerprints there was a <em>search </em>requiring a warrant issued upon probable cause. Their premise is false. We are not concerned here with a search incident to lawful arrest, <em>exigent circumstances </em>or even <em>inventory search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The principle that governs is stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Teale </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 497, 511 [75 Cal.Rptr. 172, 450 P.2d 564], cited with approval in <em>North </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 301, 305-308 [104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d 1305, 57 A.L.R.3d 155]. Justice Sullivan states: \u201cWhen officers, incidental to a lawful arrest, seize an automobile or other object in the reasonable belief that such object <em>is itself evidence </em>[fn. omitted] of the commission of the crime for which such arrest is made, any subsequent examination of said object undertaken for the purpose of determining its evidentiary value does not constitute a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. . . .\u201d The <em>Teale </em>principle arose in the context of the automobile being used to transport the victim. However, it is not factually limited but applies with equal force to the \u201cgetaway\u201d vehicle. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 610 [124 Cal.Rptr. 290] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Lundy </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 939, 947 [82 Cal.Rptr. 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Indeed, the vehicle need not be a \u201cgetaway\u201d car. The rule in <em>Teale </em>was reaffirmed, followed and extended to include a crucial incriminating letter seized from a suspect van without the requirement of a search warrant by Justice Clark, speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 542 [146 Cal.Rptr. 732, 579 P.2d 1048].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Herein, there is no contention that appellant Young\u2019s arrest was anything but lawful. Seizing the black and white automobile as evidence incident to the arrest was certainly reasonable in light of the fact that the license number matched identically that reported by the eyewitness Silvia Caffall. It was reasonable to hold the automobile as evidence. No unwarranted or unconstitutional invasion of privacy was involved. It is to be expected of modern law enforcement that as an object of evidence, the vehicle would be scientifically examined, and the results made available to all parties. The trial court properly denied appellants\u2019 Penal Code section 1538.5 motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Error was committed when the trial court informed the jury that Canty had pled guilty. In our view, to hold otherwise would be intellectually dishonest. Canty\u2019s plea of guilty made him a nonparty. However, whether Canty was the gunman was a remaining question of fact to be decided by the jury in determining the guilt of each appellant. Where, as here, the trial is of multiple defendants and counts, the jury must decide separately whether each of the defendants is guilty or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>guilty. The record reveals that the trial judge opted to disclose the fact of the plea to the jury because he did not want the jury to speculate as to the reason for Canty\u2019s sudden disappearance from the courtroom. Clearly, the fact of Canty\u2019s absence, as well as the reason, was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s determination of guilt or innocence in appellant\u2019s causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">By revealing over defense objections that Canty, a nonparty, had admitted his complicity, the jury received what is tantamount to inadmissible hearsay evidence that Canty in fact participated in the robberies as the gunman. It is for this precise reason that we conclude that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Respondent concedes that Canty\u2019s plea was inadmissible as irrelevant, but argues that it was not presented by sworn evidence and that a strong admonition advised the jury that the plea was in fact irrelevant to their deliberations. If in fact Canty\u2019s guilt forged an important link in the prosecution\u2019s chain of evidence, the fact that the jury was informed of it by the judge rather than by a sworn witness and the fact that the jury was admonished to disregard the fact could hardly negate the prejudice caused by the court\u2019s assistance to the prosecution. Error could hardly be negated by the form in which the inadmissible matter reached the jury or cured by an admonition to disregard evidence prejudicial to the defense case. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518, 529 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Had the trial court accepted Young\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggestion that the jury be informed only that Canty\u2019s case had been disposed of and that the jury should not concern itself with Canty, explaining that it should not speculate upon the legal reasons for Canty\u2019s removal from the case, the jury would have been adequately advised of the circumstances with no harm to the defense. Thus, the court\u2019s rejection of that suggestion in favor of giving irrelevant information to the jury must be termed error. The critical question, however, is whether the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Tested by even the more stringent test of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], the error was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the second robbery (Bear). As to that robbery, not only was Canty identified as the gunman, but a chain of witnesses traced his path from the crime scene to his capture, with evidence of the crime strewn along the getaway path. His admission of guilt to that could have had little effect upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>jury\u2019s conviction of Pickens, who was also apprehended during the getaway and identified by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">As to the first robbery (Volk), the conclusion is not so obvious. The evidence connecting Canty to the robbery included the victim\u2019s eyewitness testimony, the discovery of his fingerprints in the getaway car, and the similarity in modus operandi with the second crime (asking for Ch\u00e1mpale). Young was connected to the first robbery by his presence in the getaway car later that day and by the fact that he was in the store just before the robbery, added to the evidence that the witness Alexander identified Young as the person waiting in the vehicle that immediately thereafter was identified by the witness Cafiall as the getaway car. Pickens was connected to the first robbery by his presence in the store utilizing the Ch\u00e1mpale modus operandi and his fingerprint inside the getaway car.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As to the first robbery conviction (Volk), we find no reversible error under <em>Chapman. </em>We hold that beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would have convicted appellants even without knowledge that Canty entered a guilty plea. The eyewitness testimony that appellants were in Mai\u2019s Market within five minutes before Canty\u2019s use of the gun was uncontradicted. Eyewitness testimony that Young drove the getaway car was not substantially impeached. The fingerprint evidence was not contradicted and when viewed in conjunction with the reasonable inferences from the eyewitness testimony places Pickens in the getaway vehicle. Appellants were convicted as aiders and abettors of Canty, Young as the \u201cdriver\u201d and Pickens as the \u201clookout.\u201d When the jury was told that Canty had admitted that he in fact pulled the armed robbery, they were not told anything but that which the uncontradicted evidence revealed. Knowledge of Canty\u2019s guilty plea did not add to the existing evidence concerning the extent of appellants\u2019 knowledge and complicity in Canty\u2019s act of robbery. Thus, beyond a reasonable doubt conviction would have occurred even had the jury not been informed of the Canty plea of guilty. The error was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Devoid of any merit is appellant Young\u2019s assertion that in disclosing Canty\u2019s guilty plea the trial judge engaged in prejudicial misconduct mandating a conclusive presumption of prejudicial error. Counsel for appellant Young\u2019s reliance upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1925) 71 Cal.App. 575 [236 P. 189] is misplaced. Our reading of the entire record prompts us to declare that when the trial judge informed the jury of Canty\u2019s guilty plea, we cannot detect in the slightest any desire, motive or intention to prejudice Young in the eyes of the jury. The record is clear that the judge mistakenly felt that the jury should \u201chave an absolute right to know what is going on in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Earlier we alluded to the fact that Canty made oral and written statements to the police. Canty\u2019s confession implicated appellant Young by name as the person who cased Mai\u2019s Market, advising that since there was only one clerk in the store it would be \u201can easy place to hit.\u201d Further, Canty identified Young as the driver of the black and white getaway car; and that he, Pickens and Young were \u201clooking for a place to rob.\u201d Properly, appellants moved for separate trials. The trial court denied the motions, ruling that Canty\u2019s confessions as edited, deleting all reference to appellants, would be admissible in evidence against Canty only. The trial court thereupon ordered a joint trial. We footnote Canty\u2019s edited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which originally clearly incriminated appellant Young. Canty did not testify in the case and the statements were never offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Appellant Young asserts that denial of the motion for severance was reversible error. He urges that the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, supports his assertion. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>the Supreme Court of this state, cognizant of the constitutional right of confrontation, laid down a procedural rule for the trial court as follows: \u201cWhen the prosecution proposes to introduce into evidence an extrajudicial statement of one defendant that implicates a codefendant, the trial court must adopt one of the following procedures: (1) It can permit a joint trial if all parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants can be and are effectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant. By effective deletions, we mean not only direct and indirect identifications of codefendants but any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity is otherwise established. (2) It can grant a severance of trials if the prosecution insists that it must use the extrajudicial statements and it appears that effective deletions cannot be made. (3) If the prosecution has successfully resisted a motion for severance and thereafter offers an extrajudicial statement implicating a codefendant, the trial court must exclude it if effective deletions are not possible.\u201d (At pp. 530-531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Aranda </em>requires only an effective deletion of references to codefendants. Recognizing this, Young argues that the motion should have been granted since the prosecution was unable to edit Canty\u2019s extrajudicial statements to effectively delete mention of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Appellant Young\u2019s specific objections to the editing of the statement are that it left in the description of the car he was arrested in and it implied that someone other than Canty was driving the car during the first robbery. He argues that the statement, had it been introduced, would have tied him to the robbery, and that the trial court therefore should have granted his motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Appellant Young is not precluded from making this argument by the fact that Canty pled guilty during trial, thus removing the threat that an improperly edited statement would be introduced.  \u201cThe propriety of the denial of a motion for separate trials must be tested as of the time of the submission of the motion [citation]; the question of error cannot be determined in the context of subsequent developments at the trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899, 919 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].) But, in considering whether the error, if any, was prejudicial, the court may look to developments at trial. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 921-923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Had the Canty statements been introduced at trial and Canty not testified, the test for prejudicial error would have been that of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711], made applicable because of the abridgment of appellant Young\u2019s right to confront codefendant Canty concerning his statements. However, because the statement was not introduced, only state rules for separate trials and hearsay statements are involved, making <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], the applicable test. (See <em>Massie, supra, 66 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 923-924; <em>People </em>v. <em>Houston </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 894, 899 [89 Cal.Rptr. 351].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">We find no error occurred here. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 146, 157, the court discussed the problem of a statement which, when combined with other evidence, could show involvement by a second person: \u201cNone of the cases reviewed in this opinion suggest that it is <em>Bruton </em>or <em>Aranda </em>error to admit in evidence the admission or confession of one defendant, which reflects his commission of a crime that is revealed by the physical evidence, because it might reflect on the issue of whether or not a crime was actually committed by not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>declarant but also by another, whom evidence, other than the confession, links to the declarant\u2019s activities. In fact <em>Aranda </em>suggests the contrary. It suggests that if references to the participation of anyone else, whether directly or indirectly identified or not, are nonexistent, or are deleted, the trial may be joint, and the extrajudicial statement may be received as against the declarant (63 Cal.2d at p. 530).\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Romo </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 976, 984 [121 Cal.Rptr. 684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The statements here give no indication that more than one person was involved in the robberies. The language, \u201cThe vehicle <em>was parked </em>in the parking lot\u201d (italics added) and \u201cthe vehicle <em>was then parked </em>in an alley,\u201d (italics added) contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, does not imply involvement of a second person. The description of the vehicle likewise does not imply involvement of a second person. The tie-in with appellant Young is made only by eyewitness evidence that three people were involved in the first robbery and by the independent fact that he was arrested in the car identified as the getaway car. It is not Canty\u2019s statements, but the independent evidence, which implicates appellant Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Even if we were to find error, it would not be prejudicial. For all practical purposes appellant Young did receive a severed trial, Canty having pled guilty during the prosecution case, and his statement never having been admitted. When Canty left the case, he was as available as a defense witness as he would have been in a separate trial. The evidence presented at appellant\u2019s trial was the same as would have been presented at a severed trial. Thus, it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant Young would have occurred absent any error in the court\u2019s treatment of the motion to sever. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">As stated earlier, neither defendant testified. At the request of the prosecution, the trial court read to the jury the following instructions in the order they appear: \u201cIt is a constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal trial that he may not be compelled to testify. You must not draw any inference of guilt from the fact that he does not testify, nor should this fact be discussed by you or enter into your deliberations in any way.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.60 (rev. 1973).)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether or not to testify, the defendant may choose to rely on the state of the evidence and upon the failure, if any, of the People to prove every essential element of the charge against him, and no lack of testimony on defendant\u2019s part will supply a failure of proof by the People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>so as to support a finding against him on any such essential element.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.61 (rev. 1971).)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Appellants in their briefs complain that during settlement of instructions they objected to the court\u2019s decision to give the instructions. Their objections do not appear of record, they explain, because the reporter was not present.  Because an appellate court cannot properly consider assertions of fact in an appellate brief when the facts are not of record, we view the trial court\u2019s action as without objection by defendants. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ham </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 768, <em>777 </em>[86 Cal.Rptr. 906].) Of course, the record does not show that they requested or \u201cinvited\u201d the complained of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Under the rule in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], error is committed whenever the prosecutor or the court comments on the failure to testify. The Supreme Court held that instructions by the court that the defendant\u2019s silence is evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Appellants contend that the court\u2019s instructions herein violated the <em>Griffin </em>rule and cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 470, 477 [108 Cal.Rptr. 15, 509 P.2d 959], to sustain their position. \u201cThe purpose of the <em>Griffin </em>rule is to prevent the accused\u2019s exercise of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination from being judicially emphasized as affirmative evidence against him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 984, 992 [80 Cal.Rptr. 418].) Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Vargas </em>is misplaced. <em>Vargas </em>held that the phrase \u201cby itself\u2019 created <em>Griffin </em>error as used in CALJIC No. 2.61 as originally adopted. Further, it was held that the phrase, while objectionable, was not prejudicial as it was buried within an otherwise proper instruction. Appellants\u2019 jury did not hear the objectionable phrase \u201cby itself\u2019 for the reason that the trial court properly charged CALJIC No. 2.61 (rev. 1971). Further, appellants\u2019 argument fails to appreciate that <em>Vargas </em>approved instruction (CALJIC No. 2.60) as correctly setting forth a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent and the further principle that no adverse inferences could be drawn from that silence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>at p. 479; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaulden </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 942, 956-957 [111 Cal.Rptr. 803].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Appellant Pickens cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Molano </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 841 [61 Cal.Rptr. 821, 18 A.L.R.3d 1328], which holds that instructing in the language of CALJIC No. 2.60 over the \u201cstrenuous objection\u201d of the defendant constituted <em>Griffin </em>error because it highlighted and emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that the accused did not take the stand, which is tantamount to commenting upon the fact that the defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Since <em>Molano </em>there has been considerable divergence in the decisions considering the propriety of giving such instructions. In three cases the courts declined to resolve a conflict between <em>Molano </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 820 [61 Cal.Rptr. 368], over the question, concluding instead that even if there were error in giving the instruction at prosecution request, without objection, it was harmless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 30 [66 Cal.Rptr. 601]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 206 [70 Cal.Rptr. 885]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 96, 104-106 [88 Cal.Rptr. 919].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, supra, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 984, the court concluded that it was proper to give the instruction if requested by the prosecution \u201cwith or without objection.\u201d Other cases have concluded that it is not error to fail to give the instruction <em>sua sponte. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardner </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 843, 852-854 [79 Cal.Rptr. 743, 457 P.2d 575]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ham, supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.3d 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The question of whether the instruction may be given over defense objection is the most difficult of those considered by the above cited authority. None conclusively resolved the question, since in <em>Brady </em>there was no defense objection and its \u201cholding\u201d on that point was mere dictum. Less difficult is the question presented here, where the record does not reveal a defense objection. In <em>Gardner, </em>the Supreme Court, while discussing whether the trial court had a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to instruct on the defendant\u2019s silence, noted \u201cthat the instruction contains many of the vices condemned in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, including the evil of pointing up to the jury the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d However, it further observed that \u201cthe instruction also seeks to prevent the evil condemned by <em>Griffin </em>in that it expressly forbids the jury from drawing an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d The court concluded that whether the instruction was or was not to the defendant\u2019s advantage was debatable. (71 Cal.2d at pp. 853-854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In light of the fact that the question of whether the instruction is to the defendant\u2019s advantage is \u201cdebatable,\u201d we do not find error in the giving of such an instruction either <em>sua sponte </em>or on prosecution request if there is no defense objection. Presumably, if the defendant perceives a danger in the instruction, he will object. If he declines to object any prejudice is speculative since it is possible that the instruction actually worked to the defendant\u2019s advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In accordance with the foregoing, we hold there was no error in the trial court\u2019s instructing in the language of CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61. Even if there were error because of or without objection by defendants, error was nonprejudicial in light of the strength of the prosecution case and the debatability of the question of disadvantage to the defendants from the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Scott, J., and Feinberg, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> After the jury returned, the court made the following statement: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a brief delay over the noon hour. I would like to inform you that Mr. Canty is no longer a party to this lawsuit. A few minutes ago Mr. Canty changed his plea, and he is no longer in this case. However, the fact that Mr. Canty pled should not be considered by you as evidence of guilt as to any of the remaining defendants in this case. Each one of you promised at the beginning of this trial that you will consider each defendant separately and distinctively. I would like to admonish each one of you to please remember that promise because you must now consider only the evidence produced as to both Mr. Young and Mr. Pickens only and ignore all evidence as to Mr. Canty. [H] In other words, the evidence that has been introduced as to Mr. Canty should not be considered necessarily irrelevant to convict either one of the defendants, or you should not view this case in a way that just because Mr. Canty entered a plea of guilty you would conclude that the remaining defendants are guilty. You are not permitted to do so. The reason, of course, in informing you of Mr. Canty\u2019s change of plea is because the Court felt that you should have an absolute right to know what is going on in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In <em>Rogers, </em>the Supreme Court, notwithstanding the fact that they could have reached the same result by limiting their reasoning to a consent search, utilized <em>Teale </em>and reasoned that since the New Jersey police reasonably believed that the van itself was evidence of the crime the defendant had committed in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, no warrant was required to seize a letter from the impounded van. The letter formed the basis for the criminal prosecution in California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In their briefs urging prejudicial error requiring reversal, appellants made the contentions that we conclude, after consideration, have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AM3O\">First, appellant Young cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 35 [81 Cal.Rptr. 478] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 23 [41 Cal.Rptr. 551], as requiring reversal because informing the jury of Canty\u2019s guilty plea resulted in conviction by \u201cguilt by association.\u201d Assuming appellants\u2019 good faith, and without invading the jury\u2019s province of judging the credibility of witnesses and fact finding, we have applied hindsight to the record evidence of facts to determine if the conviction of appellants was obtained under conditions that deprived them of a fair trial as required by the <em>Mitchell </em>case. We find that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfull disclosure\u201d statement did not create a courtroom atmosphere that resulted in a denial of due process, i.e., \u201cguilt by association\u201d at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>with Mr. Canty. We would reverse the convictions without hesitation, if we thought otherwise for it is clearly written that \u201cguilt by association\u201d is thoroughly discredited in American jurisprudence. Appellants\u2019 cases are clearly different from <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Mitchell. Chambers </em>was a case of a series of particularly disgusting assaults on elderly nursing home patients. Defendant secured a reversal because the appellate court concluded his conviction was obtained because of evidence of association (husband and wife) with a codefendant (wife) who was separately charged with equally disgusting assaults on the same patient. Additionally, it was held that the trial court\u2019s instruction did not specify which evidence was limited to which defendant. In <em>Mitchell, </em>one attorney represented two defendant brothers-in-law on a charge of burglary. Appellant won a reversal because his codefendant was impeached by 29 felony convictions, most of them burglaries. Thus, the concern of the <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Mitchell </em>courts was that admission of association together with evidence that the codefendant was a bad person and probably guilty, had caused conviction of the appealing defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"AMy\">As we have heretofore pointed out, and will elsewhere have occasion to reiterate, appellants\u2019 association with Canty was clearly shown by eyewitness and fingerprint evidence. Evidence introduced against Canty was properly admissible and relevant to the prosecution cases against appellants. Young and Pickens were convicted because the evidence proved that Canty was the gunman and that with knowledge of Canty\u2019s unlawful purpose, Pickens acted as a lookout and Young as the driver of the getaway car.</p>\n<p id=\"AVJP\">Secondly, appellants argue reversible error relying upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518. This reliance is misplaced even though they only argue by analogy that Canty\u2019s guilty plea was like a confession introduced in a joint trial implicating codefendants as well as the confessing defendant. There was no violation of <em>Aranda. </em>Canty\u2019s plea of guilty did no more than tell the jury, when revealed by the trial court, \u201cI robbed the stores.\u201d Young and Pickens were not thereby implicated. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 146, 157 [109 Cal.Rptr. 733].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The edited statements of codefendant Canty are: \u201cI.
