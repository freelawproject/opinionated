J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgB\">Petitioner Henry Callahan contends that all of his psychiatric disability is related to his industrial injury of August 21, 1969, and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) erred in apportioning 50 percent of his psychiatric disability to preexisting nonindustrial causes. Respondent McDonnell Douglas Corporation (McDonnell), which was Callahan\u2019s employer at the time of the industrial injury of August 21, 1969, and its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, Industrial Indemnity Company (Industrial Indemnity), argue in rebuttal that the Board correctly apportioned Callahan\u2019s disability in that different rules of apportionment should apply to \u201cpsychiatric\u201d as opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>to \u201cphysical\u201d injuries. For the reasons stated below, we annul the Board\u2019s finding of apportionment and remand the question for further evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Callahan, while employed on August 21, 1969, by McDonnell, sustained injury arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment to his head and neck. The injury also resulted in psychiatric disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge initially found that Callahan\u2019s industrial injury of August 21, 1969, did not result in any psychiatric disability. Callahan sought reconsideration by the Board, contending the judge\u2019s decision on the question of psychiatric disability was in error. The Board granted reconsideration to refer Callahan to an independent medical examiner in the field of psychiatry, Dr. Myron Feld, \u201cto obtain an opinion of whether or not the applicant had a psychiatric disability which was the result of the industrial injuries . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Dr. Feld viewed this matter as involving two questions. First, whether Callahan had a psychiatric disorder. Second, whether the psychiatric disorder, if it existed, was secondary to an industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Dr. Feld noted that the first question involved the \u201ctouchy matter\u201d of whether Callahan\u2019s newly found religious fervor, in reality stemmed from a psychiatric disorder. Dr. Feld felt Callahan\u2019s \u201creligious conversion\u201d was actually a psychosis, stating in his report of May 12, 1977: \u201cThere is no doubt that religion carried to the extreme, and being obsessed with it, can be a form of a psychosis even if we use the old term of monomanical psychosis and I do believe that [Callahan\u2019s] extreme views, feelings, etc., constitute a psychosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">As to the question of the industrial causation of the \u201cpsychosis,\u201d Dr. Feld opined that Callahan\u2019s psychiatric disorder was, in part, related to the 1969 industrial injury. While viewing Callahan\u2019s psychiatric disorder as one of moderate intensity, Dr. Feld attributed only 50 percent of the psychiatric disability as related to the 1969 industrial injury. In his report, Dr. Feld explained the issue of apportionment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\u201cThis individual has had some previous stigmata of course. He had enuresis, intermittently until the age of 16, which in the absence of any urological disease, of course, would indicate a psychopathology being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>present. Further, he had already given up on really advancing when he quit college after a year and a half, feeling that he, as a black man and could not go forth in the business world. And despite being at least of normal intelligence, he has never been able to do more than non-skilled type work. The patient tells me, that he himself believes, that even if he had had no accident, that his religious conversion was bound to come. This I do not believe, of course, can be used in one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cHe has felt, himself, as being unable to progress in this world as he would like to. By being touched by God and really being in a tremendously omnipotent position of being the only type of his kind in the world, and knowing the only truth, has made something of himself unique, which was otherwise unobtainable and overrides his feelings of basic inferiority and an inability to handle realities of the world and his position in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cSo the questions still arises. If he had not had this accident and the subsequent surgeries, etc., would he have felt it necessary to, or would he have had, what I consider this illness at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201cI must say that the ground was certainly fertile for this and, therefore, I\u2019m going to make an apportionment. At the time I see him, I believe him to be moderately ill. Until, and if ever, he acts on some of his thoughts that may come to him, I do not believe that he is committable under the present laws of the State of California and I\u2019m not too sure any of the medications, including the Phenothiazines would be of any help. But my rating is of moderate degree in total with apportionment of 50% due to the accident in the position of which he finds himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In a two-to-one Board panel decision, the Board followed Dr. Feld\u2019s finding on the issues of the existence of an industrially related psychiatric disorder,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> level of psychiatric permanent disability and apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> Callahan then again sought reconsideration challenging the 50 percent apportionment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The two member majority of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>panel denied reconsideration on the issue of apportionment, stating that different rules of apportionment apply for psychiatric disability as opposed to physical disability. The dissenting panel member argued no apportionment was proper since present law does not provide for different standards in apportioning psychiatric as opposed to physical disabilities and that here \u201cthe apportionment provided by Dr. Feld does not constitute legal apportionment\u201d since it had not been shown Callahan \u201cwas psychiatrically disabled prior to the injury of 1969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">McDonnell, Industrial Indemnity and the majority of the Board panel argue that the well-established rules of apportionment as applied to physical injuries should be different than that applied to psychiatric injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Board\u2019s majority opinion rationalizes such a distinction is warranted by stating: \u201cIt must be realized that there is a fundamental, substantive difference in the standards applied to determining physical disability <em>vis-a-vis </em>mental disability. The court-made rule restricting apportionment to situations where there is actual, pre-existing physical disability is inapplicable when concerned with psychiatric injuries. Since a person afflicted with a \u2018pronounced neurosis\u2019 may be capable of performing even \u2018very heavy lifting,\u2019 to limit apportionment of such neurosis to cases of actual pre-existing physical disability is a <em>non sequitur. </em>If the distinction between physical and mental disability remains unrecognized, the result may be that potential employers would require potential employees to undergo pre-employment psychiatric examinations in order to determine if there are any work restrictions caused by mental disorders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Appellate authority does not indicate that any different rules of apportionment apply to psychiatric injuries. (See <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 1009 [144 Cal.Rptr. 573]; <em>Bstandig </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 988 [137 Cal.Rptr. 713]; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 905 [75 Cal.Rptr. 314]; see also <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 832 [92 Cal.Rptr. 1, 478 P.2d 937]; <em>Baker </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 852, 861-862 [96 Cal.Rptr. 279].) As pointed out by the dissenting Board member, no basis for such a distinction is found in the pertinent statutory law.  Accordingly, we expressly reject the contention that different rules of apportionment apply to psychiatric as opposed to physical injuries. Thus, as is the case with \u201cphysical injuries,\u201d an injured\u2019s predisposition or vulnerability to psychiatric injury alone is never a basis for apportionment. <em>(Dorman, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at p. 1018; <em>Bstandig, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at pp. 997-998.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We perceive the difficulty here as proper application of the rules of apportionment. Division Three of this district in <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 224 [145 Cal.Rptr. 22], has recently made an exhaustive review of the rules of apportionment which are pertinent here.  As pointed out in that case, the statutes governing apportionment generally are Labor Code sections 4663<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 4750.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at p. 236.) While these two sections share certain principles, they also have significant differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Under both sections the employer is liable to the extent the industrial injury accelerates, aggravates or \u201clights\u201d up the preexisting disability, condition or impairment. <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at pp. 237, 242-245; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1018; <em>Bstandig v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 988, 997.) Both sections seek to avoid the employer from being charged with permanent disability unrelated to the industrial injury. <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d 224, 235-236.) Further, neither section permits apportionment to mere pathology but only apportionment to disability. <em>(Franklin, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Under section 4663, the employer is not liable to the extent the present permanent disability is actually related to the natural progression of the preexisting nonindustrial condition. <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>at pp. 243-246.) For apportionment under section 4663, unlike section 4750 as will be discussed below, the preexisting condition need not be symptomatic or disabling at the time of the industrial injury. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Section 4750 is designed to ensure that an employer is not charged with the disability which preexisted the industrial injury. <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>at p. 236.) Clearly, section 4750 by its terms only deals with preexisting <em>disabilities </em>as opposed to asymptomatic and nondisabling <em>conditions </em>covered by section 4663.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Here, the Board apportioned Callahan\u2019s disability on the basis of Dr. Feld\u2019s opinion that prior to the industrial injury he had psychiatric disability. Neither the Board nor Dr. Feld purport to apportion based upon the natural progression of Callahan\u2019s preexisting condition. Thus, we only deal with apportionment pursuant to section 4750 and not under section 4663/</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In deciding the issue of apportionment, the Board may rely upon expert medical opinion. <em>(Zemke </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 794, 798 [69 Cal.Rptr. 88, 441 P.2d 928]; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 786, 791 [69 Cal.Rptr. 68, 441 P.2d 908]; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d 224, 235; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1018.) Of course, medical opinion which does not rest on relevant facts or which assumes an incorrect legal theory cannot constitute substantial evidence on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Board may base a finding of apportionment. <em>(Zemke, supra; Franklin, supra; Dorman, supra.) </em>Accordingly, in order for the Board to rely upon a physician\u2019s evaluation as to apportionment under section 4750, \u201cthe physician must disclose adequate familiarity with the preexisting disability.\u201d <em>(Dorman, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1018.) That is, the physician must describe in detail the exact nature of the preexisting disability and the basis for such opinion in order that the Board be able to determine whether the physician is properly apportioning under correct legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Dr. Feld here appears to impermissibly give an arbitrary figure on apportionment in order to be \u201cfair\u201d in this difficult case. (See <em>Zemke, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 798-799; <em>Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 791.) Because the case is difficult to apportion, it does not excuse the physician, the parties or the Board from undertaking the task. Anything less than best efforts either deprives the injured of the compensation to which he is entitled or impermissibly charges the employer with nonindustrial disability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">While Dr. Feld does propose that prior to the 1969 industrial injury Callahan had some psychiatric problems, Dr. Feld does not explain how such translates into 50 percent apportionment. Dr. Feld\u2019s apportionment is a \u201cmere legal conclusion.\u201d <em>(Zemke, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 794, 798; <em>Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 786, 791; <em>Skinner, supra, </em>269 Cal.App.2d 905, 909.) Accordingly, Dr. Feld\u2019s opinion does not support a finding of apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">This is not to say that on remand the Board may not find any apportionment of Callahan\u2019s permanent disability.  The fact that before the 1969 injury Callahan was not partially disabled on a psychiatric basis from performing his job duties at McDonnell does not alone preclude a finding of a preexisting psychiatric disability. Any. preexisting psychiatric disorder may merely have gone unnoticed because the work at McDonnell was congenial to the preexisting disorder. (See <em>Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Baldes) </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 392, 401-402 [1 Cal.Rptr. 833, 348 P.2d 193]; see also <em>Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d 224, 237-238.) The fact that the alleged preexisting psychiatric disorder did not interfere with the injured\u2019s employment that he was engaged in at the time of the industrial injury is merely strong evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that such preexisting psychiatric disorder did not disable the injured from <em>that type of employment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u201cConsequently, neither the fact that the preexisting disability did not interfere with the occupation the injured was engaged in at the time of the subsequent injury nor the fact that it was unknown to him is determinative. The question is whether it can be demonstrated by competent evidence that the preexisting condition did interfere or would have actually interfered with any type of work activity [in the open labor market].\u201d <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at p. 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We are cognizant, however, that the very nature of psychiatric disability makes apportionment difficult. The physician in apportioning to preexisting psychiatric disability must take care not to apportion to \u201cpathology\u201d or \u201cpredisposition.\u201d Further, the physician may not apportion based upon a retroactive prophylactic restriction on a psychiatric basis. (See <em>Franklin, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d 224, 238-239.) There is all the more reason, therefore, in psychiatric cases for the parties to have their reporting physicians detail the basis for their apportionment or their opinion as to the lack of a basis for apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Accordingly, the award is annulled as it pertains to apportionment, and the matter remanded to the Board for the obtaining of further evidence or such other proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The sole issue before this court is the question of apportionment. Whether Callahan\u2019s \u201creligious fervor\u201d is truly a psychiatric disorder and whether such psychiatric disorder is related, at least in part, to the 1969 industrial injury are issues not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">It also appears that Callahan in fact alleged several industrial injuries while employed by McDonnell. The Board found all the industrial psychiatric disability to be the result of only the 1969 injury and not related to any of the other alleged industrial injuries. We are also not asked to review this portion of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Since on reconsideration the Board obtained additional evidence, Callahan was entitled to seek reconsideration again, even though he was the party that originally sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>reconsideration. <em>(Goodrich </em>v. <em>Ind.

The more enlightened view to which we subscribe does not impose physical accident or trauma as a precondition of recovery for psychoneurotic injury. <em>(American National Red Cross </em>v. <em>Hagen </em>(7th Cir. 1964) 327 F.2d 559; 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1970) \u00a7 42.23; Note, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Awards For Psycho-neurotic Reactions, </em>70 Yale L.J. 1129, 1135-1138.) In order to find a physical industrial injury, a single identifiable traumatic experience need not be shown. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc.
