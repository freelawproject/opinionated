The victim alleged to have been murdered was Charles Mulcahy. Both minors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>denied the allegations of the petitions. On August 9, 1977, the juvenile court conducted hearings on the minors\u2019 motions to suppress evidence, made pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, and on Johnny V.\u2019s additional motion to exclude his inculpatory statements. The motions were denied the following day. Thereafter, the parties stipulated that all evidence presented at the Penal Code section 1538.5 and Evidence Code section 402 hearings would be considered by the court as part of the evidence presented at the adjudication hearing, with the exception of that evidence which was received at the section 1538.5 hearing for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause and that evidence of Johnny V.\u2019s statements would not be admissible against Jimmy A.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">At the adjudication hearing at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, both minors made motions for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Penal Code section 1118. These motions were denied. Both minors then rested without presenting any evidence in their defense. The court sustained the petitions to the extent of finding that each minor had committed the offense of an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), a lesser and necessarily included offense within the murder charge. Each minor was declared to be a person described by section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">At a subsequent disposition hearing on August 25, 1977, each minor\u2019s motion for a general verdict of acquittal was denied. The court also made a finding that the offense committed in violation of section 245 of the Penal Code was a felony and each minor was committed to the California Youth Authority. Each minor has appealed from the orders of the juvenile court\u2014the orders which sustained the petitions of August 1 and the disposition orders of August 25, which committed the minors to the California Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>The Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">On June 11, 1977, at approximately 1:40 a.m., officers of the Los Angeles Police Department observed a group of about six to eight young Latin males congregated in the vicinity of Q Street and Frigate in Wilmington. It appeared that a fight was in progress. There was one person down in the street and the surrounding group of males were kicking him and hitting him with their fists. As the officers approached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the group dispersed, leaving the victim covered with blood on the pavement. The officers proceeded in their vehicle in pursuit of those who had run from the scene. The officers finally stopped a speeding vehicle which appeared to come out of Q Street and make a sudden right hand turn on Wilmington Boulevard without stopping at the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The stopped vehicle contained three males and two females. Blood was observed on the hands of the driver, Arvizo, and a knife was recovered from the vehicle\u2014a knife that had fresh blood stains on it. In addition, there were beer bottles in the automobile. Johnny V. was in the back seat but Jimmy A. was not one of the males in this vehicle.. Johnny V. was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On arriving at the police station, Johnny V. was placed in a \u201cholding tank,\u201d i.e., a cell six-by-eight feet with a glass enclosure. At about 4 a.m., investigating officers Drouin and Pagenkopp removed Johnny V. from the holding tank and took him to an interrogation room. There, he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; he waived them, and indicated that he was willing to talk to the officers. He told them that he and his companions were on their way to a party when they were stopped by the police, and that he knew nothing about a murder. Following this interview, appellant was left in the interrogation room, where he remained, alone. At about 7 a.m., Police Officer Hernandez asked one of the officers at the station the identity of those in custody for the murder offense. Upon being told that there were \u201cabout three or four guys in there,\u201d Hernandez walked over to the interrogation room and saw Johnny V. inside. Hernandez was acquainted with Johnny V., having talked to him on the street several times in connection with gang activities. Hernandez testified at the pretrial hearing that, before discovering Johnny V. in the interrogation room, he was unaware that Johnny had made any statements to the police. Hernandez further testified that he did not enter the interrogation room to elicit statements from Johnny V.; that he entered the room merely to learn who had been arrested for the murder. When Hernandez entered the room, Johnny V.\u2019s first words to him were: \u201cFll take the Fifth. I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d Hernandez replied: \u201cWell, they got you for this thing, too, huh? . . . Well, I could understand if they had gotten Haystack [the street name of Johnny\u2019s older brother] and not you.\u201d Johnny V. then made the following statement: As he and some others were riding in a car, they saw a drunk walking down the street; they stopped the car, got out, and jumped him; Johnny V. \u201cwas kicking him and doing his thing.\u201d Johnny added that he didn\u2019t see A1 (Arvizo) stab the person, nor did he see \u201cBadger\u201d hit him with a bottle. When asked why he continued to talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to Johnny after the latter had asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, Hernandez replied: \u201cHe began talking to me, and I listened to him.\u201d Hernandez further testified that he asked Johnny V. no questions, and that Johnny\u2019s statements were \u201cspontaneous.\u201d Johnny V. testified at the pretrial hearing that he told Hernandez at the outset that he did not want to talk to him and, in fact, Johnny did not want to talk; he did so only because he was asked questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Following his conversation with Johnny V., Hernandez told a police sergeant what Johnny had said. The sergeant suggested that Hernandez readvise Johnny V. of his rights and see if he then would make a statement. Hernandez did so, but Johnny V. again stated that he did not wish to talk and that he was \u201ctaking the Fifth.\u201d Thereafter, Johnny V.\u2019s earlier statements to Hernandez were reduced to writing. It was these statements which Johnny V. sought to suppress as a violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. of the morning of the incident in question, Officer Drouin talked with Ramona, one of the females in the vehicle stopped by the police, who informed him that she had seen \u201cBadger\u201d hit the victim with a bottle. An inspection of the police files revealed that \u201cBadger\u201d was the street name for Jimmy A. The police files also revealed that Jimmy A. lived at a Wilmington address. Officers Drouin and Pagenkopp then went to the Wilmington address, but were referred to an address on Highland in Carson. At approximately 8:45 a.m., the officers arrived at the Carson address. The officers identified themselves and the door was opened by a Paul Ramirez, the owner of the residence. The officers stated to Ramirez that they were looking for Jimmy A. and Ramirez indicated that he could be found in a bedroom. Ramirez gave the officers permission to go into the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Upon arrival at the bedroom door, the officers found the door locked. The officers knocked and stated \u201copen the door\u2014police.\u201d Ramirez then called his son\u2019s name, Robert, and requested Robert to open the door, that it was all right. The bedroom door was then unlocked and opened by the young man who turned out to be Robert. Jimmy A. was lying on the bed. He was placed under arrest and asked to get dressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">As Jimmy A. started to put on his shoes, he took off the left shoe and pushed it under the bed. The officers recovered the shoes which appeared to have blood stains on them. Robert at first said the shoes were his, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>when the officers stated that Robert would then have to come with them, Robert said that the shoes belonged to Jimmy A.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">An autopsy was conducted on the body of Mulcahy, the victim in the instant case, and death was ascribed to a hemorrhage as a consequence of stab wounds to the chest. No other wounds or injuries were asserted to be any contributing causes to Mulcahy\u2019s death. The knife found in the automobile was established to belong to Arvizo, the driver of the vehicle stopped by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The blood stains on the shoes taken from the bedroom in the Ramirez home were human blood stains of type A blood, which was the same blood type as that of the victim. Jimmy A.\u2019s blood type was found to be type O.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\n<em>The Minors\u2019 Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The minors make the following contentions on appeal: (1) that the suppression-of-evidence motion should have been granted because of the warrantless arrest of Jimmy A. in the Ramirez house; (2) that the suppression-of-evidence motion should have been granted because the arresting officers did not comply with the knock and notice requirements of Penal Code section 844; (3) that the statements made by Johnny V. were secured by the police in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and should have been held inadmissible; (4) that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to find that the minors had committed an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury as such an offense is not a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder; and (5) that the Youth Authority commitments were made without appropriate and necessary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\n<em>Jimmy A.\u2019s A rrest Was Illegal and the Suppression-of-evidence Motion Should Have Been Granted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">It is Jimmy A.\u2019s contention that his arrest was illegal under principles of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramey </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 263 [127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>1333], and, consequently, the shoes and clothing worn by him should have been suppressed as being the product of the illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The essence of the <em>Ramey </em>holding is that, even though based upon probable cause, a warrantless arrest within a home is unreasonable per se unless there are exigent circumstances present to justify dispensing with the warrant requirement. Such a warrantless arrest constitutes a violation of the suspect\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under article I, section 13 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">It is conceded in the case at bench that the police had no warrant for the arrest of the minor Jimmy A. in this case. The People, however, assert that there was a <em>consent </em>to enter the Ramirez home and that <em>Ramey </em>creates a second exception to an invalid warrantless arrest in a home and that this second exception is that a consent to enter will justify the warrantless arrest. There is no doubt that the actual holding in <em>Ramey </em>is to the effect that <em>exigent circumstances </em>will justify a warrantless arrest in a home. The question that is not entirely clear, however, is whether there is a second exception of a <em>consent to enter </em>as justifying a warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Although there do not appear to have been any subsequent decisions of the California Supreme Court interpreting the <em>Ramey </em>decision as to whether a consent to enter will justify a warrantless arrest in a home, the majority in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kenner) </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 65 [139 Cal.Rptr. 343], interpreted the <em>Ramey </em>decision as creating an exception to the invalidity of a warrantless arrest in a home where there is a consent to enter given by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Assuming that, under <em>Ramey, </em>a consent to enter will justify the warrantless arrest of Jimmy A. in the home of Ramirez, we turn to the question of whether the evidence establishes that such a consent was given by Ramirez, the homeowner. Clearly, the facts do not establish any exigent circumstances. The officers had time to obtain an arrest warrant had they desired to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">At the suppression-of-evidence hearing, Officer Drouin testified as follows with respect to the Ramirez home visit and the arrest of the minor, Jimmy A.:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, after you had pulled a gang card out, did you and Officer Pagenkopp take some action with regard to Mr. A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cWe went to 22602 Highland Avenue, in Carson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the home of Mr. A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u201cQ. Do you recall who met you at the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\u201cA. Mr. Paul Ramirez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Ramirez identify himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">\u201cWe identified ourselves, and we asked him who he was and if Jimmy A. was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">\u201cQ. What did Mr. Ramirez say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">\u201cA. Mr. Ramirez said that he was the resident, he was the owner of the residence, and that Jimmy A. was in a bedroom inside his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">\u201cQ. Were you given permission to enter the home and speak to Mr. A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-18\">\u201cMr. Ramirez indicated to us the bedroom in which Mr. A. was in and gave us the approval to enter the room to talk to Mr. A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-19\">\u201cQ. What happened when you entered that room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-20\">\u201cA. Mr. A. was with another young man\u2014I don\u2019t know his name\u2014and they appeared to be sleeping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-21\">\u201cAnd Jimmy A. woke up, and we told him that we wanted him to come down with us to the station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-22\">\u201cQ. Did you indicate the reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-23\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">This testimony of Officer Drouin raises the question of whether there was a valid consent by Ramirez for the police officers to enter his home for the purpose of arresting Jimmy A.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">It is established law that the police may not justify a warrantless arrest if the limits of the consent to enter a home have been exceeded. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>police officer\u2019s right to enter is limited to the scope of the consent. A consent to enter for the purpose of <em>talking </em>with a suspect is <em>not </em>a consent to enter for the purpose of making an arrest of the suspect. Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Arketa) </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 122 [89 Cal.Rptr. 316], the court held that a consent to <em>enter </em>could not be construed as a consent to <em>search. </em>In similar fashion, a consent to enter for the purpose of talking with a suspect may not be deemed a consent to enter to make an arrest of a suspect. The <em>Kenner </em>case is of significance here. In the <em>Kenner </em>case the court stated: \u201cIn Kenner, the request was to \u2018talk to\u2019 Kenner. In fact, as the record makes clear, the officers had no intention of talking to Kenner at all. When he appeared he was immediately arrested, without any prior interrogation. A person may willingly consent to admit police officers for the purpose of discussion, with the opportunity, thus suggested, of explaining away any suspicions, but not be willing to permit a warrantless and nonemergent entiy that affords him no right of explanation or justification.\u201d <em>(Kenner, supra, 73 </em>Cal.App.3d 65, 69 [40 Cal.Rptr. 841, 395 P.2d 889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 861 [40 Cal.Rptr. 841, 395 P.2d 889], it was held that a general consent to search particular premises did not include a consent to piy into particular items located on the premises but which belonged to third persons (suitcases and boxes). And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harwood </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 460 [141 Cal.Rptr. 519], it was held that an occupant\u2019s general consent to search particular premises and a consent to search for specific items did not include a consent for police officers to intercept telephone calls to the premises involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In the case at bench it seems clear that Officer Drouin and his partner sought from Ramirez a consent to enter and \u201ctalk\u201d with the minor, Jimmy A. The People admit that at one point in Officer Drouin\u2019s testimony he indicated that he sought only a consent to enter the Ramirez home to talk with the minor such as was the case in <em>Kenner. </em>But the People point out that Officer Drouin testified differently in other parts of his testimony, which would justify the trial court in finding that the officer sought from Ramirez a consent to enter in order to arrest the minor Jimmy. The testimony of Officer Drouin which the People allude to is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cQ. Now, when you came to the front door, did you announce your identity and your reason for being there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201cA. Yes, I did. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201cQ. And it was at that time that the man opened the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cA. He had opened the door, and I did show him my identification card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cQ. And were you talking in a normal conversational voice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cA. Yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201cQ. Do you recall what you stated to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201cA. I believe I inquired about Jimmy A.\u2019s presence at that location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate to you that he was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate to you that he was in the bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">In addition, the People refer to another portion of Officer Drouin\u2019s testimony, which is as follows: \u201cQ. Officer, at the time that you went to the Highland address, was it your intention to arrest Jimmy . . . ? [I] A. Yes, it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">We start with the principle that in the case of a warrantless arrest and search, the burden is upon the prosecution to establish justification such as a consent to search, under a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. This burden of proof must be sustained by the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 99, 106, fn. 4 [137 Cal.Rptr. 447, 561 P.2d 1135]; cf. <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 274 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">\u201cSimilarly, it is the government\u2019s burden to prove that a warrantless search was <em>within </em>the scope of the consent given.\u201d <em>(Harwood, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.3d 460, 466.) (Italics added.) In <em>Arketa, </em>the court sets forth this principle by stating: \u201cThe authority to search pursuant to a consent must be limited to the scope of the consent.\u201d <em>(Arketa, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 122, 127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">A consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing of Jimmy A.\u2019s suppression-of-evidence motion can only lead to one conclusion, namely, that the prosecution failed to sustain its burden of establishing that Ramirez, the owner of the premises, gave to Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Drouin and his partner a consent to enter to arrest the minor. The evidence presented is only susceptible reasonably to the interpretation that the officer sought consent to <em>talk </em>with the minor and <em>not </em>to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The testimony of Officer Drouin upon which the People rely does not sustain the People\u2019s position. That testimony does not change at all Officer Drouin\u2019s first statement that he sought entrance from Ramirez for the purpose only of talking with the minor. Officer Drouin\u2019s subsequent statement that he informed Ramirez of the purpose of his visit can only refer to the words of the conversation with Ramirez which Officer Drouin said he had with Ramirez upon going to the premises. Furthermore, nothing is added by Officer Drouin\u2019s subsequent testimony that at the time he went to the Ramirez premises it was his intention to arrest Jimmy. His internal and unannounced intention cannot be converted by any reasonable inference into an announced purpose of arrest\u2014conveyed to Ramirez\u2014to sustain the trial court in its implied finding that the prosecution had sustained its burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Ramirez had given the officers a consent to enter for the purpose of making an arrest of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Since we hold that Jimmy A.\u2019s suppression-of-evidence motion should have been granted, we find it unnecessary to consider Jimmy A.\u2019s contention that there was a failure of the police to observe the knock and notice requirements of Penal Code section 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>Evidence of Johnny V. \u2019s Statements to the Police Was Secured in Violation of His Miranda Rights and Should Have Been Held to Be Inadmissible</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The rule of law is well settled that, once a suspect indicates that he wishes to assert his privilege against self-incrimination, it is unlawful for the police to continue or renew interrogation of the suspect and any statement thereafter elicited from him is inadmissible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettingill </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 231, 240-241 [145 Cal.Rptr. 861, 578 P.2d 108].) It was explained in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 473-474 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 723, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]: <em>\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. </em>At this point, he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; <em>any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. </em>Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.\u201d (Italics added; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The juvenile court found that after Johnny V. had asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, he voluntarily told Officer Hernandez of his involvement in the crime. The court further found that, following Johnny V.\u2019s \u201cvoluntary\u201d statement, Hernandez questioned him regarding the participation of others in the crime, and that Johnny V. \u201cimplicated himself\u2019 by his answers to those questions. Under <em>Miranda, </em>Johnny V.\u2019s statements made in response to questions (i.e, his statements that he did not see A1 stab the victim, and did not see \u201cBadger\u201d hit him with a bottle) clearly were inadmissible. The remaining question is whether Johnny V.\u2019s prior statement describing his part in the crime, characterized by the court as a \u201cvoluntary\u201d statement, was in fact voluntaiy within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>and California cases which have considered the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 714, 719 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[W]e prohibit only continued questioning after an individual has <em>once </em>asserted his constitutional, rights. We do not, of course, disapprove of the use of statements, whether admissions or confessions, voluntarily initiated by a suspect. Such statements have been repeatedly sanctioned in the decisions of this court [citation], and are also expressly authorized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion. \u2018There is no requirement,\u2019 said the court, \u2018that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment. . . .\u2019 <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].)\u201d The <em>Fioritto </em>court then discussed several California cases holding that statements made by a defendant after he has asserted his constitutional rights are admissible where the defendant himself initiates the discussion with the police in which the statements are made. In conclusion, the court said: \u201cWe reiterate, however, that the foregoing authorities are inapposite under circumstances in which the police initiated resumption of interrogation. The form of the renewed queries, however subtle or gentle, cannot be considered in determining whether there has been a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of the stem principles prescribed by the Supreme Court in Miranda.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 720; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522, 536-537 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In the present case, Johnny V. did not seek out Officer Hernandez for the purpose of volunteering a statement. It was Hernandez who approached Johnny V. and then, despite Johnny V.\u2019s immediate assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege, initiated a conversation in the course of which Johnny V. described his complicity in the crime. Hernandez\u2019 first words to Johnny V., expressing his disbelief that Johnny V. had been arrested, were an invitation to him to explain his involvement in the crime. This clearly constituted a form of \u201csubtle or gentle\u201d query which was condemned in <em>Fioritto. </em>Accordingly, Johnny V.\u2019s statement that he jumped the victim and kicked him was not volunteered within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Fioritto </em>and, therefore, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to discuss Johnny V.\u2019s further contention that his statements were inadmissible because they were involuntary in that they were the product of coercion, both physical and psychological, practiced by the police on him during his detention at the police station. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\n<em>The Trial Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Find That the Minors Had Committed the Offense of an Assault by Means of Force Likely to Produce Great Bodily Injury Because Such an Offense Is Not a Lesser and Necessarily Included Offense Within the Crime of Murder Charged in the Petitions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The minors take the position on this appeal that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make a finding that they had committed the offense of an assault upon the victim Charles Mulcahy by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), since the only offense charged in the petitions was that of murder. The minors\u2019 position is that the trial court was limited to making a finding that they had committed the offense charged\u2014murder\u2014or some other offense that was a lesser but necessarily included offense within the charge of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The minors assert that a violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), is not a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The People concede that the offense of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, proscribed by Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), is not a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benjamin </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 63 [124 Cal.Rptr. 799]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 585 [9 Cal.Rptr. 263].)  The primary test to be used in determining whether a particular lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense is set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 595, 612 [91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409]: \u201c \u2018The test in this state of a necessarily included offense is simply that where an offense cannot be committed without necessarily committing another offense, the latter is a necessarily included offense.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In <em>Benjamin, </em>it was stated that for an offense \u201c[t]o constitute a lesser and necessarily included offense it must be of such a nature that as a matter of law and <em>considered in the abstract </em>the greater crime cannot be committed without necessarily committing the other offense.\u201d <em>(Benjamin, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 63, 71.) (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The <em>Benjamin </em>court went on to point out that \u201cmurder can be committed <em>without committing </em>an assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. For example, one could commit a murder by withholding food and drink from an invalid. Therefore, the statutory definition of murder does not necessarily include assault with a deadly weapon [or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury].\u201d <em>(Benjamin, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 63, 71.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">But the People advance the argument that, even though the offense of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is not a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder, the trial court in the case at bench could still properly find that the minors committed the assault offense even though it is not a necessarily included offense within the charge of murder. But that this view is not the law is set forth clearly in <em>In re Hess </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 171, 174-175 [288 P.2d 5], in which the court held that \u201c[a] person cannot be convicted of an offense (other than a necessarily included offense) not charged against him by indictment or information, whether or not there was evidence at his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to show that he had committed that offense.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 585, 599-600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The basic reason for not permitting a defendant to be convicted of an offense not charged in the information as a lesser but necessarily included offense is that \u201c[d]ue process of law requires that an accused be advised of the charges against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at his trial.\u201d <em>(In re Hess, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The due process requirement that provides the basis for the inability of a court to convict a defendant of an uncharged offense not included as a lesser offense within the charged offense renders the court <em>without </em>jurisdiction to convict defendant of a different offense. \u201cWhen a defendant pleads not guilty, the court lacks jurisdiction to convict him of an offense that is neither charged nor necessarily included in the alleged crime. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>West, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 595, 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">As the People point out, however, there are situations in which a defendant is not allowed to complain that he has been convicted of an offense not charged nor included within the charged offense as a lesser and necessarily included offense. Thus, it has been held that \u201c[a] defendant who knowingly and voluntarily pleads guilty or nolo contendere can hardly claim that he is unaware that he might be convicted of the offense to which he pleads; his plea demonstrates that he not only knows of the violation but is also prepared to admit each of its elements.\u201d <em>(West, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 595, 612; see <em>In re Hawley </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 824, 828 [63 Cal.Rptr. 831, 433 P.2d 919].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It has also been held that if a defendant either requests or acquiesces in a conviction of a nonlesser-included offense, he cannot claim lack of notice and the court has jurisdiction to convict him of such offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Francis </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 66 [75 Cal.Rptr. 199, 450 P.2d 591]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 477 [78 Cal.Rptr. 51]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blunt </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 200 [50 Cal.Rptr. 440].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The People urge that the two minors before us are precluded from claiming error in the trial court\u2019s finding that they committed the offense of a violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), on the theory that they acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s action. The People rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 884 [46 Cal.Rptr. 415], in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defendant submitted his case on the transcript of the preliminary hearing and offered no defense. The court found the defendant guilty of a lesser offense than that charged but not necessarily included within the offense charged. In holding that defendant could not object, the court reasoned: \u201cIn submitting the case as they did, neither defendant nor his counsel could rationally have anticipated anything other than a finding of guilty of <em>some </em>offense.\u201d <em>(Powell, supra, 236 </em>Cal.App.2d 884, 887.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In <em>Powell, </em>it was the failure of defendant to object to the court\u2019s procedure and the finding of guilt which was significant. The <em>Powell </em>court relied upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Hensel </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 834 [43 Cal.Rptr. 865], by stating: \u201cAs in <em>Hensel, </em>defendant\u2019s failure to object must be regarded as an implied consent to treat the information as having been amended to include the offense on which the sentence was imposed, and thus to be a waiver of the only objection\u2014lack of notice of the offense charged\u2014which was available to defendant.\u201d <em>(Powell, supra, 236 </em>Cal.App.2d 884, 888.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The instant case, however, is not like that of <em>Powell </em>or <em>Hensel. </em>The minors before us did not acquiesce in the trial court\u2019s action. They did <em>not </em>fail to object as did the defendants in <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hensel. </em>On the contrary, adequate objections were made to the juvenile court\u2019s action in the case at bench. Both minors made a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case. (Pursuant to Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118.) Although the minors did not put on a defense, they made a motion for an acquittal after the court indicated that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding that the minors aided and abetted Arvizo in the latter\u2019s act of stabbing the victim and thereby perpetrating the offense of homicide. Both minors vigorously asserted that the assault offense was <em>not </em>a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder. At the beginning of the disposition hearing the minors again raised the issue that the assault offense\u2014a violation of Penal Code section 245\u2014was not a lesser offense included within the crime of murder, by making a motion for an acquittal, and asserting that they had not been put on notice that they were being subjected to the possibility of a finding that they had committed an offense in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Had these minors been properly charged with the offense of an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, a felony, in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), they might well have produced defenses. Certainly, there was no need to put on any defense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the face of the prosecution\u2019s evidence that did not inculpate them in Arvizo\u2019s acts of stabbing the victim with a knife\u2014the stab wounds being the sole cause of death. Under the circumstances, Johnny V. and Jimmy A. were denied their constitutional due process of law rights to be notified of the charges against them so that they could prepare a defense to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The errors discussed herein are obviously prejudicial and require reversal of the orders from which the appeals have been taken. We find no need, therefore, to discuss the contention that the orders of commitment to the California Youth Authority were fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>Because of Penal Code Section 654, the Minors May Not Be Tried on an A mended or New Petition Charging Any Offense Growing Out of the June 11, 1977, Incident Involving the Victim, Charles Mulcahy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">At the hearing before us both the People and the minors presented oral argument on the question of whether, in the event of a reversal of the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicatory and dispositional orders, the minors could be charged in an amended petition or a new petition with a violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), or with any other offense growing Out of the June 11, 1977, incident involving the victim, Charles Mulcahy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">It is the contention of the minors that, in the event of a reversal, they are not subject to being tried for any offense growing out of the incident with the victim Charles Mulcahy, by reason of Penal Code section 654. The pertinent portion of section 654 provides that \u201can acquittal or conviction and sentence under either one [provisions of the Penal Code] bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d Penal Code section 654 sets forth a public policy against successive prosecutions for the same course of conduct. \u201cWhen, as here, the prosecution <em>is or should be aware of </em>more than one offense in which the same act or course of conduct plays a significant part, all such offenses must be prosecuted in a single proceeding unless joinder is prohibited or severance permitted for good cause. Failure to unite all such offenses will result in a bar to subsequent prosecution of any offense omitted if the initial proceedings culminate in either acquittal or conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>(Kellett </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 822, 827 [48 Cal.Rptr. 366, 409 P.2d 206]; fn. omitted.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The prohibition against multiple prosecutions, established by Penal Code section 654, assumes that a joinder is permitted of the several offenses for which a defendant may be prosecuted. \u201cPenal Code section 954 provides for the joinder in a single accusatory pleading of two or more offenses connected in their commission or having a common element of substantial importance in their commission.\u201d <em>(Kellett, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 822, 825.) In the case at bench, pursuant to Penal Code section 954, the two minors could have been charged by separate paragraphs of a petition in the juvenile court with the offense of murder of the victim Charles Mulcahy and with the offense of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily harm and even the misdemeanor offense of battery. Section 954 does not distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors in those provisions for joinder. Hence, a charge of a felony and a charge of a misdemeanor may be joined in the charging document. (See <em>Kellett, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 822, 826, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The policy which supports Penal Code sections 954 and 654 is that of requiring a joinder of related offenses in a single prosecution in order to prevent harassment of a defendant and to save both the People and the defendant time and money required in the presentation of a needless repetition of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">It must be recognized, however, that a joinder in a single prosecution of separate offenses growing out of the same transaction is not always required in order to preclude application of Penal Code section 654. The case of <em>In re Dennis B. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 687 [135 Cal.Rptr. 82, 557 P.2d 514], presents a type of situation in which the failure to join two offenses in a single prosecution did not require the application of the proscription against successive prosecutions set forth in Penal Code section 654. In the <em>Dennis B. </em>case, a minor, while attempting to change lanes on a highway, had a collision with a motorcycle, which caused fatal injuries to the cyclist. The minor was first tried in municipal court on a traffic charge of making an unsafe lane change in violation of Vehicle Code section 21658, subdivision (a), and was fined $10. Three weeks later, a petition was filed in the juvenile court charging the minor with the offense of vehicular manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192, subdivision (3)(b). The minor in <em>Dennis B. </em>contended that Penal Code section 654 was applicable to preclude his prosecution in juvenile court after a prosecution in the municipal court for a traffic violation. The <em>Dennis B. </em>court first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>stated that \u201c[preliminarily, we recognize that one act, the unsafe lane change, did result in two offenses here, and this circumstance was susceptible of discovery in time to avoid multiplicity problems: since the cyclist died before either trial began, the prosecution could have filed manslaughter charges and either joined the two offenses or dismissed the lesser.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">But the <em>Dennis B. </em>court held that the proscription against successive prosecutions set forth in Penal Code section 654 was not applicable because the circumstances were not such that the prosecution was either <em>aware of </em>or <em>should have been aware of </em>the fact that more than one offense had been committed. The <em>Dennis B. </em>court set forth the issue as follows: \u201cThe issue is, under the <em>Kellett </em>standard, whether on the record herein the prosecution was or should have been \u2018aware of more than one offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dennis B., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 687, 692-693.) The <em>Dennis B. </em>court observed that the <em>Kellett </em>principle of awareness of more than one offense to bring into play Penal Code section 654 \u201capplies, however, only to intentional harassment, i.e., to cases in which a particular prosecutor has timely knowledge of two offenses but allows the multiple prosecution to proceed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In holding that the prosecution of the minor in <em>Dennis B. </em>for the offense of vehicular manslaughter could proceed in spite of the fact that there had been a prior prosecution of the traffic violation of unsafely changing lanes, without the latter prosecution constituting a violation of Penal Code section 654, the <em>Dennis B. </em>court distinguished the case of <em>In re Benny G. </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 371 [101 Cal.Rptr. 28], in which a probation officer first filed a robbery charge against a juvenile. But when the allegations were found untrue, the same officer filed a new petition alleging that the juvenile had been an accessory to the robbery. The <em>Dennis B. </em>court approved of the <em>Benny G. </em>holding that the accessory-to-robbery allegation was barred under Penal Code section 654 by reason of the juvenile\u2019s exoneration of the robbery charge. The <em>Benny G. </em>case was distinguished from <em>Dennis B. </em>in that, in <em>Dennis B., </em>there was no showing that a particular prosecutor actually <em>knew </em>of both offenses in time to prevent a multiplicity of prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In the case at bench we must apply the <em>Kellett-Dennis B. </em>formula to ascertain whether the prosecution either <em>knew </em>or <em>should have known </em>of the . two offenses of murder and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in connection with the death of the victim, Charles Mulcahy.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We do not here deal with successive charging petitions as was the case in <em>Dennis B. </em>Certainly the situation at bench is more akin to that of the <em>Benny G. </em>case. The record indicates that, at the hearing on the motions made under Penal Code section 1538.5 and conducted under Evidence Code section 402, held on August 9 and 10, 1977, the People and the minors stipulated that an autopsy was performed on the victim\u2019s body on June 12, 1977, the day following the homicide, with the result that the cause of death was ascribed solely to the stab wounds to the chest and that there were no other wounds or injuries as contributing causes to the victim\u2019s death. It is of significance that the petitions charging the two minors with having committed murder on June 11, 1977, were not filed by the district attorney\u2019s office until August 1, 1977. As of the date of the filing of the petitions the district attorney\u2019s office was aware that the victim had died on June 11, 1977, the date of the murder offense, and that the June 12, 1977 autopsy revealed that the cause of death was <em>solely </em>from stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The extensive evidence received at the hearing on the motions to exclude evidence on August 9 and 10, 1977, certainly informed the deputy district attorney prosecutor as of that time, if he had not seen the police reports prior to the hearing dates, that Arvizo was the person who had the knife and who committed the stabbing, and that Johnny V. and Jimmy A. could only be held responsible for murder as aiders and abettors. At no time, however, during the presentation of the evidence at the hearing on the suppression-of-evidence motions made by the two minors, nor during the adjudicatory hearings the following day on August 11, 1977, did the deputy district attorney prosecutor seek to amend the petitions to charge the two minors with a different offense such as an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily harm or the misdemeanor offense of battery. The prosecutor was aware of the fact that the evidence presented at the suppression-of-evidence hearing reasonably established that the part played by the two minors, Johnny V. and Jimmy A., in the June 11, 1977 incident, was that of striking the victim with their fists and kicking the victim and the striking of the victim by Jimmy A. with a beer bottle or beer can.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">It appears that the prosecutor made a deliberate choice of continuing with the adjudicatory hearing on the theory that the minors could be held responsible for the victim\u2019s murder by Arvizo on the theory of aiding and abetting. It follows, therefore, that in the instant case, the prosecutor clearly <em>should have known </em>of the two possible offenses\u2014murder and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>there is a disparity in gravity between a murder offense and an assault offense, nevertheless, \u201c[w]hen both offenses are serious crimes, the potential for harassment and waste is sufficiently strong that section 654 imposes on prosecutors an administrative duty to insure that the charges are joined. Although occasional failure to coordinate prosecutorial efforts may result in a defendant guilty of a felony escaping proper punishment, such a risk \u2018is inherent in the preclusion of section 654 of multiple punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dennis B., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 687, 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We conclude that Penal Code section 654 is applicable to the case at bench to preclude any subsequent prosecution of the two minors, Johnny V. and Jimmy A., for any offense growing out of the June 11, 1977, incident. The juvenile court judge\u2019s invalid finding that the two minors had committed the offense of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injuiy in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), as a lesser and necessarily included offense within the crime of murder, also constituted a finding that the minors had not committed the offense of murder\u2014in essence an acquittal of the murder charge. This acquittal of murder makes applicable the principle that \u201c[fjailure to unite all such offenses will result in a bar to subsequent prosecution of any offense omitted if the initial proceedings culminate in either acquittal or conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>(Kellett, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 822, 827; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The orders appealed from are reversed with directions to the juvenile court to dismiss the petitions in accordance with the views set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Kingsley, Acting P.
