His victims were five young boys, aged nine to thirteen. Each of the boys testified that Harris had induced or forced him to enter an automobile (three said it was a \u201cwhite automobile\u201d) which was then driven to a secluded building or other area where at knife point, or threat of shooting, Harris compelled him to submit to an act of sodomy. Each boy had promptly reported the incident, and each showed physical evidence of his victimization.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The crimes, and their modus operandi, received much newspaper publicity in the locality of their commission. A young man, Ron, who had thus been made aware of the crimes\u2019 perpetration, testified over a hearsay objection at Harris\u2019 trial to the following: \u201cA. What I exactly saw was the Defendant here in a white\u2014in a white Chevy, \u201867 model, and he was trying to encourage a little boy to get into his car. This is why I wrote down the license plate number. . . . Q. Did you hear the boy saying anything that made you think the Defendant was tiying to encourage the boy into the car? A. I did so. Q. And what did the boy say? A. He said, T don\u2019t have to get in your car, Mister, to show you where it\u2019s at. It\u2019s just right down there.\u2019 \u201d The vehicle\u2019s license number was reported to the police. It led to Harris\u2019 apprehension, and identification by each of the crime victims as his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Harris\u2019 first appellate contention is that the above quoted testimony of Ron was erroneously allowed over his <em>hearsay </em>objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">At least debatably, it may be that the \u201clittle boy\u2019s\u201d statement, \u201cI don\u2019t have to get in your car, Mister, to show you where it\u2019s at,\u201d carried the implication that the car\u2019s driver had asked that the boy get in his car, and that such implication would thus be based upon hearsay. But Ron\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>testimony was patently not hearsay insofar as it related that he had observed Harris seated in a white automobile talking to a little boy outside the car. Since the young boys\u2019 violator had engaged in the consistent practice of stopping his white car and talking to his selected victims, that evidence had <em>some </em>\u201ctendency in reason\u201d (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to establish a <em>similar modus operandi, </em>and the <em>identity </em>of Harris as the offender (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101). Although its probative value may not have been great, the weight to be given it was properly to be determined by the jury, not the trial court or this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Harris\u2019 objection, running to the <em>entirety </em>of Ron\u2019s testimony, was invalid, and the overruling of it did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">\u201cWhere inadmissible evidence is offered, the party who desires to raise the point of erroneous admission on appeal must <em>object </em>at the trial, <em>specifically </em>stating the grounds of his objection, and directing the objection to the <em>particular evidence </em>which he [properly] seeks to exclude.\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 1285, p. 1188, and see authority there collected.) And it is settled law that where evidence is in part admissible, and in part inadmissible, \u201cthe objectionable portion cannot be reached by a general objection to the entire [evidence], but the inadmissible portion must be specified.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lang Transportation Corp., </em>43 Cal.App.2d 134, 141 [110 P.2d 464]; and to the same effect see <em>Shatto </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>87 Cal. 629, 631 [25 P. 921]; <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. </em>v. <em>East Bay Union of Machinists, </em>227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712 [39 Cal.Rptr. 64]; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 748, 768 [291 P.2d 503]; <em>Ballos </em>v. <em>Natural, </em>93 Cal.App. 601, 608 [269 P.2d 972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The trial court instructed the juiy on the limited effect of Ron\u2019s testimony. They were told, \u201cSuch evidence was not received and may not be considered by you to prove that he, the Defendant, is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes. Such evidence was received and may be considered by you only for the limited purpose of determining if it tends to show either of the following: The <em>identity </em>of the person who committed the crimes of which the Defendant is accused, or <em>a characteristic method, plan or scheme </em>in the commission of criminal acts similar to the method, plan or scheme used in the commission of the offenses in this case. For the limited purpose for which you may consider such evidence, you must weigh it in the same manner as you do all other evidence in this case. You are not permitted to consider such evidence for any other purpose.\u201d (Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>A subsidiary contention of Harris is: \u201cBefore [Ron\u2019s] evidence of an uncharged offense is admissible at trial, a foundational showing must first be made by clear and convincing proof that such an offense was actually committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The testimony of Ron, as we view it, established no \u201cuncharged offense;\u201d it is doubtful whether the point at which a criminal attempt (Pen. Code, \u00a7 664) would have resulted, had been reached. (See <em>In re Smith, </em>3 Cal.3d 192, 200 [90 Cal.Rptr. 1, 474 P.2d 969].) But we find it to be of a high order of credibility on the issues for which it was admitted, and thus clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Moreover, we observe that Evidence Code section 1101\u2019s recognition of the admissibility of certain evidence to prove such things as \u201cpreparation,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d and \u201cidentity,\u201d is not limited, as suggested by Harris, to \u201cuncharged offenses\u201d; it embraces also \u201cother acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">It is notable also that declarations such as that of the \u201clittle boy\u201d overheard by Ron have often been held not hearsay at all, but <em>circumstantial evidence </em>from which any logical and relevant inference may be drawn, including that of criminal activity. An illustration: An anonymous telephone caller\u2019s declaration offering to place bets, to a policeman during the course of a bookmaking raid, \u201cwas a circumstance to establish\u201d the premises\u2019 use by its occupant for unlawful purposes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>49 Cal.2d 442, 447 [317 P.2d 967].)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By a parity of reasoning it may be said that the \u201clittle boy\u2019s\u201d overheard declaration was admissible circumstantial evidence, from which could be drawn the reasonable inference that he was rejecting an invitation of Harris to enter his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Harris\u2019 remaining contention\u2014\u201cthe trial court erred by failing to exclude appellant\u2019s 1967 prior robbery conviction for impeachment purposes\u201d\u2014is also found invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>An accused\u2019s prior robbery conviction, of course, reasonably concerns his integrity, and thus bears upon the issue of his veracity. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle, </em>6 Cal.3d 441, 453 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1].) Harris\u2019 purpose was patently the sexual molestation of his victims. But as an incident to that purpose he had removed small change from the pockets of two of the boys, thus bringing about two robbery charges against him. Harris argues that the trial court\u2019s questioned ruling was violative of <em>Beagle\u2019s </em>admonition that: \u201c \u2018As a general guide, those convictions which are the same crime should be admitted sparingly.\u2019 \u201d (6 Cal.3d, p. 453.) But <em>Beagle </em>also points out that this is only one of the factors to be <em>considered </em>by trial courts in \u201cthe sound exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d Another such consideration was expressed by <em>Beagle </em>as: \u201cNo witness including a defendant who elects to testify in his own behalf [as did Harris] is entitled to a false aura of veracity.\u201d Here we discern no abuse of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">As pointed out, we have found neither error nor abuse of judicial discretion in the proceedings attending Harris\u2019 trial. But assuming error, arguendo, as to any or all of his appellate contentions we are of the opinion that the error was harmless according to the criteria of the state\u2019s Constitution, article VI, section 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] [cert. den., 355 U.S. 846 (2 L.Ed.2d 55, 78 S.Ct. 70)]; and <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065],</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 27, 1978, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 27, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Other such authority will be found in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>46 Cal.2d 3, 8 [291 P.2d 929]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, 22 </em>Cal.2d 169, 176 [137 P.2d 1] [cert. den., 320 U.S. 715 (88 L.Ed. 420, 64 S.Ct. 264)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 900, 907 [76 Cal.Rptr. 160]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carella, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 115, 140 [12 Cal.Rptr. 446]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 444, 449 [304 P.2d 208]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 630, 637 [211 P.2d 375]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 785, 789 [195 P.2d 478]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>71 Cal.App.2d 588, 592 [163 P.2d 71]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Radley, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 607 [157 P.2d 426]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Joffe, </em>45 Cal.App.2d 233, 235 [113 P.2d 901]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reifenstuhl, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 402, 405 [99 P.2d 564].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
