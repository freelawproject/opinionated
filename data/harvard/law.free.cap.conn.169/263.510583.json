He then pleaded guilty to the second part of the information charging him with being a persistent felony offender under \u00a7 53a-40 (b) of the General Statutes. After inquiry of the defendant, who was represented by counsel, the trial court determined that the pleas were voluntary and accepted them. On March 29, 1974, the defendant was sentenced by the trial court \u201cas a Persistent Offender for the term of not less than three, nor more than six years, concurrent with the time he is now serving.\u201d Prom that judgment, the defendant has appealed, claiming that there was an insufficient factual basis on the record for the court to render judgment on his plea of guilty to being a persistent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Under \u00a7 53a-40 (b), a persistent felony offender is defined as \u201ca person who (1) stands convicted of a felony; and (2) has been, prior to the commission of the present felony, convicted of and imprisoned under an imposed term of more than one year . . . for a crime.\u201d When a defendant is found to be a persistent felony offender, \u201cand the court is of the opinion that his history and character and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct indicate that extended incarceration will best serve the public interest, the court in lieu of imposing the sentence of imprisonment authorized by section 53a-35 for the crime of which such person presently stands convicted, may impose the sentence of imprisonment authorized by said section for the next more serious degree of felony.\u201d General Statutes \u00a753a-40 (f). Thus the second part of the inf or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>mation, which alleged that the defendant was a persistent felony offender, did not charge him with a separate crime but affected only the terms of imprisonment which could be imposed in the event of conviction of the crime charged in the first part. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaSelva, </em>163 Conn. 229, 233-34, 303 A.2d 721; <em>Sinisgalli </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>153 Conn. 599, 600, 219 A.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The second part of the information alleged that the defendant had been convicted in 1972 of \u201chaving weapons in a motor vehicle and possession of narcotics and imprisoned under an imposed term of more than one year.\u201d It also alleged that he had been convicted in 1968 of breaking and entering \u201cand imprisoned under an imposed term of more than one year in the Cheshire Beformatory.\u201d The defendant now claims that he did not understand the elements required under \u00a7 53a-40 (b) for a finding that he was a persistent felony offender; that he was not sentenced to \u201can imposed term of more than one year\u201d for any of the crimes specified in the second part of the information; and that the presentence investigation report, which was before the trial court at the time of sentencing, established that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The presentence report recites that the defendant received sentences of only nine months for each of the 1972 convictions and that he was sentenced to an indefinite term at Cheshire for the 1968 conviction. The state now concedes that the 1972 convictions should not have been included in the second part of the information since the nine month sentences actually imposed were not for \u201can imposed term of more than one year.\u201d Nevertheless, the state maintains that the defendant could properly be found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>persistent felony offender on the basis of the 1968 conviction and the indefinite sentence to Cheshire. It is true that such a sentence may be for a maximum of two years; however, with good behavior, the basic minimum for an indefinite term at Cheshire is less than one year. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-75; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wildman, </em>27 Conn. Sup. 87, 230 A.2d 48; <em>State </em>v. <em>Genova, </em>25 Conn. Sup. 483, 208 A.2d 353. Moreover, \u201c[a]t any time prior ... [to a Cheshire inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole] the. commissioner of .correction may recommend that parole be granted and, under special and unusual circumstances, the commissioner may recommend that an inmate be discharged from the institution.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-125. It is axiomatic that penal statutes must be strictly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>161 Conn. 283, 286, 287 A.2d 369. For that reason, the state\u2019s argument must fail and we conclude that the sentence to Cheshire for an indefinite term was not a sentence for \u201can imposed term of more than one year\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-40 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201cThe plea of guilty by the defendant must represent a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 534, 290 A.2d 332. The record in this case, which included, the presentenee report required by \u00a7 54-109 of the General Statutes, affirmatively disclosed that there was no factual basis for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the second part of the information. The trial court, therefore, erred in sentencing the defendant as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant has not attacked the voluntariness of his guilty plea to the first count of the first part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of the information. Since we have found error in the judgment as to the second part of the information, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the second part of the information and to resentence the defendant on the first count of the first part of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
