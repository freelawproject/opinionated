The defendants answered the allegations of the complaint and filed three \u201cspecial defenses.\u201d The trial court found all the issues for the plaintiff and entered a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants have appealed to this court from the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Contrary to our practice, the majority of the errors assigned which are directed to the finding of facts neither claim that facts were found without evidence nor allege that the facts which the defendants seek to add to the finding are admitted or undisputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 622, 628; <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>165 Conn. 478, 480 n.1, 338 A.2d 497; <em>Randolph Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Kings East Corporation, </em>165 Conn. 269, 271 n.1, 334 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Furthermore, the assignment of errors presents no rulings on evidence which state in each instance the question, the objection, the answer, if any, and the exception taken, as required. Practice Book 619A (formerly \u00a7 648), 652. This precludes our consideration of the assignment of errors pertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ing to the rulings on evidence. <em>Schurgast </em>v. <em>Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 481, 242 A.2d 695; <em>Vachon </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>150 Conn. 452, 454, 190 A.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Finally, the finding is devoid of any claims of law made by the defendants before the trial court, nor do any appear in the draft finding. Claims of law must be raised before the trial court and ruled upon adversely to a defendant\u2019s claim if they are to furnish a basis for a successful appeal to this court. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 223, 652; <em>Bigionti </em>v. <em>Argraves, </em>152 Conn. 700, 701, 204 A.2d 408; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Since no claims of law appear, this appeal presents no question of law for our consideration. <em>John Meyer of Norwich, Inc. </em>v. <em>Old Colony Transportation Co., </em>164 Conn. 633, 635, 325 A.2d 286; <em>Krulihowski </em>v. <em>Polycast Corporation, </em>153 Conn. 661, 668, 220 A.2d 444; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Randolph Corporation, </em>150 Conn. 232, 243, 188 A.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">There is no error; the case, however, is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except for such modification as is made necessary by the lapse of time since the date of the original judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\"><em> </em>One of the findings of fact properly attacked is supported by the evidence in the appendix to the plaintiff\u2019s brief. Another is immaterial and has not been briefed. A third, concerning default of payments, properly constitutes a conclusion and should not have been included with the finding of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
