The court granted the motion for summary judgment. The judgment rendered enjoins the defendant from further conducting The Wethersfield School of Law, Inc., without first obtaining proper licensure in accordance with law. The defendant has appealed from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The defendant has assigned as error a number of rulings made by the trial judge, including the granting of the summary judgment. We have reviewed the assignment of errors and conclude that the action of the court in granting the summary judgment was error and this conclusion is dispositive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The statutes that the defendant is alleged to have violated prohibit it from conferring degrees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>from including such, authority in its charter of incorporation without prior approval. The defendant is also prohibited from offering a \u201cprogram ... of higher learning.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-330 (c), (d). Section 10-330 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the General Statutes defines applicable terms. Upon reading the statutory sections of \u00a7 10-330 and the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, specifically paragraph eleven<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the affidavit, it is clear to the court that the plaintiff has alleged and set forth facts attempting to show that the defendant has stated or implied that college-level credit may be given or may be received by transfer, and that degrees are.being conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The defendant, in an opposing affidavit, states that it has never awarded a degree, it has not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>any time claimed that college or university-level credits may he given for the successful completion of its courses, and it has not authorized the transfer of such credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The defendant, by admitting in its answer the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint reciting the provisions in the defendant\u2019s certificate of incorporation concerning its corporate purpose, did not foreclose itself from contending that it had not implemented the part relating to instruction on a postgraduate level and the conferring of degrees. See <em>Celina &amp; Mercer County Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Union-Center Mutual Telephone Assn., </em>102 Ohio St. 487, 494, 133 N.E. 540; note, 119 A.L.R. 1012, 1022. Although the recital in the certificate of incorporation concerning the conferring of degrees is in violation of \u00a7 10-330 (c) of the General Statutes, such recital does not of itself establish that the defendant was conferring degrees or was operating a program of higher education.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Since the plaintiff prayed only for an injunction restraining the defendant from operating a school on a postgraduate level, the fact that the provision in the certificate of incorporation concerning the conferring of degrees was in violation of the statute would not warrant an injunction prohibiting the operation of the school unless the actual operation is in violation of the statute. The defendant, as a matter of law, cannot be classified as an \u201cinstitution of higher learning\u201d as defined by \u00a7 10-330 (a) of the General Statutes because, admittedly, it was not \u201clicensed or accredited to offer one or more programs of higher learning leading to one or more degrees.\u201d This leaves the plaintiff with the burden of proving that the defendant was operating a \u201cpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>gram of higher learning\u201d which is defined as \u201cany course of instruction for which it is stated or implied that college or university-level credit may be given or may be received by transfer.\u201d General Statutes \u00a710-330 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">A summary judgment may be rendered only if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof. submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 303; <em>Rathkopf </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>148 Conn. 260, 263, 170 A.2d 135. A material fact is one which will make a difference in the result of the ease. <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 379, 260 A.2d 596. The moving party for a summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of such issue. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>162 Conn. 245, 248, 294 A.2d 278. To satisfy this burden, the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that it excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 488, 280 A.2d 359. There is a genuine issue of material fact, that is, whether degrees are being conferred and whether the defendant has stated or implied that college or university-level credit may be given or may be received by transfer. Therefore, the granting of the motion for summary judgment was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em> </em>\u201c[General Statutes] See. 10-330. authority to confer academic degrees. . . .
