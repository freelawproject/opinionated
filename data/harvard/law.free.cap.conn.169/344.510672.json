General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 35-24 to 35-44. The complaint alleges, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s practices in enforcing certain specified policies were \u201cunlawful as they are for the purpose or have the effect of: (a) Fixing, controlling or maintaining prices, rates or quotations; (b) Refusing to deal or coercing, persuading or inducing third parties to refuse to deal with another person.\u201d The Superior Court, however, refused to assume jurisdiction over the matters complained of and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The proceedings on appeal as followed by the parties raise only the question of the jurisdiction of the trial court to adjudicate the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, a question which can be determined on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>present state of the record. <em>Lusas </em>v. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corporation, </em>123 Conn. 166, 168, 193 A. 204. We express onr opinion upon those issues briefed and argued by the parties since they concern so fundamental an issue as \u201cthe right of the trial court to proceed with the case.\u201d <em>Lusas </em>v. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corporation, </em>supra, 167-68; <em>Eder </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>132 Conn. 152, 155, 42 A.2d 794; see also <em>In re Application of Title &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>109 Conn. 45, 51-52, 145 A. 151; <em>Storm Bros. </em>v. <em>Balcones Heights, </em>239 S.W.2d 842, 845-46 (Tex.

It appears that the court based this conclusion upon two alternative theories: (1) that the public utilities commission (hereinafter the PUC) had \u201cprimary\u201d jurisdiction of the matters complained of; or (2) that the activities of the defendant challenged by the plaintiff were \u201cimmune\u201d from antitrust liability. We consider whether either of these theories, which are interrelated in antitrust cases involving a regulated industry, is a proper basis for the trial court\u2019s decision as presented to us and as briefed by the parties and the amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Enacted in 1971,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the act incorporates, in modified form, and with notable exceptions, various provisions of such federal antitrust laws as, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>example, the Sherman Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Antitrust Civil Process Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of such state antitrust laws as the provisions embodied in the proposed Uniform State Antitrust Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 14 H.R. Proc., 1971 Sess., pt. 9, p. 4182 (remarks of Rep. David H. Neiditz); see also Brodigan, \u201cThe Connecticut Antitrust Act,\u201d 47 Conn. B.J. 12, 16-17, 19, for a discussion of the statutory sources of the Connecticut provisions. The act repealed the previous state antitrust statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53-310, which was originally enacted in 1911 as \u201cAn Act Concerning Combinations to Increase Prices of Necessities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the approximately sixty years of its existence, no actions are reported to have been instituted under that act. Under these circumstances, reference to opinions of courts in other jurisdictions, federal and state, on pertinent antitrust law issues, where appropriate, are an aid to our interpretation of certain questions arising under the present Connecticut statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is a rule of judicial administration created by court decision in order to promote \u201cproper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63, 77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126. Its basis is the concept that courts and administrative agencies are, as Justice Frankfurter suggested, \u201ccollaborative instrumentalities of justice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S. Ct. 999, 85 L. Ed. 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">A premise upon which the primary jurisdiction doctrine is invoked is that the court itself has original \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction of the questions raised in the complaint filed in that court. \u201c \u2018Primary jurisdiction\u2019 . . . applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R. Co., </em>supra, 64. The doctrine is thus distinguished from the concept of exclusive agency jurisdiction, which refers to matters which an agency alone has the power to adjudicate and of which the court has no jurisdiction. <em>Terminal Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>297 U.S. 500, 514, 56 S. Ct. 546, 80 L. Ed. 827; see also <em>Hughes Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, </em>409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577, reh. denied, 410 U.S. 975, 93 S. Ct. 1434, 35 L. Ed. 2d 707. Similarly, a court may not refer a controversy within its jurisdiction to an agency under this doctrine where the agency itself lacks jurisdiction; the court\u2019s jurisdiction in such cases is exclusive. <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 480-81, 234 A.2d 825; 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure, \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In addition, the primary jurisdiction doctrine is distinguishable from the concept of \u201cexhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d The latter requires a party to exhaust such remedies before seeking judicial relief and \u201ccontemplates the situation in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the claim is initially enforceable <em>exclusively </em>by administrative action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Mitchell, \u201cPrimary Jurisdiction\u2014What It Is and What It Is Not,\u201d 13 Proceedings A.B.A. Section of Antitrust Law 26, 29; see, e.g., <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>Mauro Construction Co., </em>144 Conn. 195, 199, 128 A.2d 531; <em>Levitt </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>114 Conn. 628, 634, 159 A. 878; 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure, \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Within the context of antitrust law enforcement, it has been stated that all that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is designed to do, \u201cand all that it properly does is to assure that the substantive exemptions from the antitrust laws created by . . . [the legislature] or required by the logic and structure of the regulatory scheme are not destroyed through by-passing the forum chiefly concerned with the regulation of the industry in question.\u201d Von Mehren, \u201cThe Antitrust Laws and Regulated Industries: The Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction,\u201d 67 Harv. L. Rev. 929, 932. However, the mere existence of a \u201cspecial regulatory scheme for particular aspects of an industry\u201d does not, without more, \u201crender the more general provisions of the antitrust laws wholly inapplicable to that industry,\u201d so that the court need not stay its hand<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on an antitrust controversy and await action by the agency involved simply because the defendant in an anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>trust suit is subject to regulation by a public administrative body. <em>Carnation Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Westbound Conference, </em>383 U.S. 213, 218, 86 S. Ct. 781, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709; see also <em>Otter Tail Power Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>410 U.S. 366, 373, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, reh. denied, 411 U.S. 910, 93 S. Ct. 1523, 36 L.

Ct. 1049, 57 L. Ed. 1354; Hale &amp; Hale, \u201cThe Otter Tail Power Case: Regulation by Commission or Antitrust Laws,\u201d 1973 Sup. Ct. Rev. 99,100-102. Rather, \u201c[a]etivities which come under the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency nevertheless may be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Otter Tail Power Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 372. Thus, the rule is that a court should generally refer an anti, trust controversy to an appropriate agency in cases where action thereon by that agency will result in a determination of the defendant\u2019s liability under the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Carnation Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific West</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>bound Conference, </em>supra, 221-22, citing <em>United States Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co., </em>284 U.S. 474, 52 S. Ct. 247, 76 L. Ed. 408, and <em>Far East Conference </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 570, 72 S. Ct. 492, 96 L.

It has been pointed out that an agency may also have primary jurisdiction of an antitrust controversy even when it lacks the express or implied power to exempt the activities challenged from antitrust liability where the agency is in an advantageous position to be of \u201cmaterial assistance\u201d to the court by marshalling a crucial fact or facts, potentially determinative of the antitrust lawsuit, into a \u201cmeaningful pattern\u201d; <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange </em>v. <em>Deaktor, </em>414 U.S. 113, 114-15, 94 S. Ct. 466, 38 L. Ed. 2d 344; <em>Federal Maritime Board </em>v. <em>Isbrandtsen Co., </em>supra, 498; and a procedure exists empowering the antitrust plaintiff to raise the issue before the agency. <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </em>409 U.S. 289, 304-305 n.14, 93 S. Ct. 573, 34 L. Ed. 2d 525, reh. denied, 410 U.S. 960, 93 S. Ct. 1411, 35 L.

In connection with its telephone service, the complaint alleged, the defendant leases telephone answering and message taking devices which, if leased from the defendant, require no further coupler, interface, or similar protective link apparatus when attached to the subscriber\u2019s telephone. If the devices are obtained from some source other than the defendant, however, the defendant requires the subscriber to lease the protective link apparatus from the defendant at a monthly charge fixed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The complaint further alleged that the defendant requires the subscriber to lease this protective link apparatus even if the answering devices obtained privately do not damage the defendant\u2019s property or interfere with its service. The plaintiff claimed that he obtained from a private supplier a telephone answering and message taking device; upon his refusal to comply with the defendant\u2019s demand that he lease a coupler, interface, or protective link to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>be installed between Ms device and the defendant\u2019s other telephone equipment, the defendant terminated his telephone service. The trial court observed that the procedure followed by the defendant was in accord with its present tariff as approved by the PUC on January 1, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On the basis of these allegations, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant\u2019s cited practices constituted \u201cprice-fixing\u201d and \u201crefusal's to deal\u201d of the kind prohibited by the act, which makes unlawful \u201cevery contract, combination, or conspiracy\u201d when such are \u201cfor the purpose, or have the effect, of: (a) Fixing, controlling, or maintaining prices, rates, quotations, or fees in any part of trade or commerce; (b) fixing, controlling, maintaining, limiting, or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale, or supply of any part of trade or commerce; (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets, either functional or geographical, in any part of trade or commerce; or (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing tMrd parties to refuse to deal with another person.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-28. Jurisdiction to adjudicate claimed violations of this statute is vested in the Superior Court by \u00a7 35-33.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>359 F. Sup. 973, 975, 978 (C.D. Cal.). The action brought by the plaintiff was thus \u201cof the general class [of eases] to which the proceedings in question belong[ed]\u201d as required for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>court to be deemed to have had original jurisdiction of the subject matter involved. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 598, 236 A.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The act \u201capplies to every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce or every contract, combination or conspiracy to monopolize, or every attempt to monopolize, or every monopolization of any part of trade or commerce when any part thereof was entered into or effectuated in whole or in part in this state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-30. The Public Service Companies Act, as amended, does not expressly confer on the PUC the power to exempt activities of the defendant, such as those challenged by the plaintiff, from the reach of the act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Nonetheless, the act itself contains four classes of express \u201cexceptions\u201d from liability under the act. General Statutes \u00a7 35-31. Such exceptions are to be strictly construed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKesson &amp; </em>Robbins, 351 U.S. 305, 316, 76 S. Ct. 937, 100 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>1209; <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Borden Co., </em>308 U.S. 188, 196-202, 60 S. Ct. 182, 84 L. Ed. 181. The exception pertinent to the facts of this case states that \u201cnothing contained in this part shall apply to those activities of any person when said activity is <em>specifically directed or required </em>by a statute of this state, or of the United States [emphasis added].\u201d \u00a7 35-31 (b). General Statutes $ 16-19<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> outlines the procedure before the PUC whereby a tariff proposed by a telephone company authorizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>activities such. as those complained of in this case becomes effective. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Water Co., </em>132 Conn. 496, 509, 45 A.2d 831. Thus, the question pertinent to the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction of the action below, raised by the interplay of 35-31 (b) and 16-19, was whether the activities of a telephone company such as the defendant, authorized by a tariff which becomes effective through the implementation of the procedure described in \u00a7 16-19, can be characterized as \u201c specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ically directed or required\u201d by that statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> so as to be immune from antitrust liability under \u00a7 35-31 (b). King, \u201cThe \u2018Arguably Lawful\u2019 Test of Primary Jurisdiction in Antitrust Litigation Involving Regulated Industries,\u201d 40 Tenn. L. Rev. 617, 630-31. If so, the court would have been justified in staying its hand to allow the PUC to exercise its primary jurisdiction to determine whether the particular activities challenged by the plaintiff were indeed authorized by the tariff approved on January 1, 1969, and thus excepted from attack under the act by \u00a7 35-31 (b). See <em>California </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>369 U.S. 482, 485-86, 488-89, 82 S. Ct. 901, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54; <em>Carnation Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Westbound Conference, </em>383 U.S. 213, 221-22, 86 S. Ct. 781, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709; <em>Otter Tail Power Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359; King, op. cit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Section 35-31 (b) of our General Statutes has no parallel in the federal antitrust statutes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, in enacting this provision the Connecticut legislature also did not choose to follow the example set by several other states of specifically and unqualifiedly exempting from antitrust liability the activities of industries and other organizations subject to the supervision of the state regulatory agency equivalent to our public utilities commission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, the exception authorized by \u00a7 35-31 (b) represents a narrowly drawn version of the doctrine of \u201cstate action\u201d immunity from antitrust liability articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 350-51, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315. The court in that case carved out an exemption from Sherman Act liability for activities \u201ccommanded\u201d or \u201cdirected\u201d by a state legislature. Ibid. Section 35-31 (b) limits that holding by purporting to immunize only activities which are \u201cspecifically\u201d required or directed by state or federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The immunity recognized in <em>Parker, </em>supra, related to a program expressly authorized under the California Agricultural Prorate Act. The plaintiff there, unlike the plaintiff in this case, did not allege particular violations of the antitrust laws by a regulated private company but claimed, rather, that the entire state regulatory scheme itself was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>unlawful. Id., 348-49. The Prorate Act called for the establishment, \u201cthrough action of state officials,\u201d of programs for the marketing of state farm products, so as to restrict competition among the growers and maintain prices in the distribution of their commodities to packers. Id., 346. That act further called for \u201cthe creation of an Agricultural Prorate Advisory Commission of nine members, of which a state official, the Director of Agriculture, is ex-officio a member.\u201d Ibid. This director, with the commission\u2019s approval, was then \u201crequired to select a program committee from among nominees chosen by the qualified producers.\u201d Ibid. This committee itself was required to formulate a proration marketing program for the commodity produced, which the commission was authorized to approve \u201cafter a public hearing\u201d and a \u201cfinding that the program is reasonably calculated to carry out the objectives of the Act.\u201d Id., 347. Moreover, authority to administer the program was conferred by the Prorate Act upon the committee, and it was a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, \u201cfor any producer to sell or any handler to receive or possess without proper authority any commodity for which a proration program has been instituted.\u201d Ibid. The United States Supreme Court reversed a District Court decree enjoining enforcement of the program, noting that the Sherman Act was meant to prohibit \u201cindividual and not state action\u201d and that, with respect to the prorate program, \u201cit is the state, acting through the Commission, which adopts the program and which enforces it with penal sanctions, in the execution of a governmental policy.\u201d Id., p. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Under the <em>Parker </em>rationale, the \u201cthreshold inquiry in determining if an anticompetitive activity is state action of the type the . . . [antitrust law] was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity is required by the State acting as sovereign.\u201d <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 790, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572; <em>Continental Ore Co. </em>v. <em>Union Carbide, </em>370 U.S. 690, 706-709, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777. The <em>Parker </em>doctrine draws a firm line, in short, between activities actually commanded by the state, which are immune from antitrust liability and action merely approved or tolerated. <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>359 F. Sup. 973, 976-77 (C.D. Cal.); 7 Von Kalinowski, \u201cAntitrust Laws and Trade Regulations\u201d \u00a746.03; Jacobs, \u201cState Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws,\u201d 25 Case W. Res. L.

As the <em>Parker </em>court itself declared, \u201ca state does not give immunity to those who violate the . . . [antitrust laws] by authorizing them to violate [them], or by declaring that their action is lawful.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 351, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315. A fortiori, actions or orders by state regulatory agencies merely to authorize or accept decisions previously made by private parties are not, without more, thereby immunized from antitrust attack under the <em>Parker </em>doctrine: \u201cWhen such a sequence of events occurs, it is illogical for a regulated person to contend that he acted pursuant to governmental compulsion.\u201d Jacobs, op. cit., p. 242; see <em>Marnell </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service of America, Inc., </em>260 F. Sup. 391, 406-10 (N.D. Cal.). \u201cIt is not enough,\u201d the United States Supreme Court recently stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cthat . . . anticompetitive conduct is \u2018prompted\u2019 by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be <em>compelled by direction of the State </em>acting as a sovereign.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Coldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 791, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572. Such is not the case when there is little or no agency insistence upon specific acts or policies, as in the ease of practices or rates which originate with the regulated industry and are simply approved by the agency. <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 976-77; <em>Marnell </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service of America, Inc., </em>supra, 409; Jacobs, op. cit., pp. 242-43; note, 24 Hastings L.J., op. cit., p. 305; see also comment, <em>\u201cWhitten </em>v.

L. Rev. 272, 289. Significantly, one court has specifically held that the mere filing and approval of a tariff with a state regulatory commission, requiring that all telephone network control signaling be performed by equipment installed and maintained by the telephone company subject to regulation, does not constitute \u201cstate action\u201d immune from antitrust liability under the <em>Parker </em>rationale. <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 976; see also <em>Chastain </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>351 F.

Section 16-19 requires the defendant to \u201cfile any proposed amendment of its existing rate schedule with the commission in such form and in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the commission may prescribe.\u201d None of the published regulations promulgated by the PUC applicable to the initial filing and approval of such tariffs, however, requires the defendant to submit with its proposal any facts specifically designed to make out a sufficient showing that the proposal is necessary, for example, to sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>isfy some public need. See, e.g., Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 16-1-45 et seq. and \u00a7 16-1-53 et seq. Furthermore, the PUC is ordinarily not under any obligation to conduct a fact-finding inquiry of its own \u201cto determine whether the rates specified in any schedule are unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate, or that the service furnished by such company is inadequate to or in excess of public necessity and convenience\u201d; such an investigation into a proposal submitted by the defendant is within the PUC\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Most strikingly, even if the PUC does conduct such an investigation and subsequently \u201cfinds any rate to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive,\u201d it is not actually required to disapprove of the proposal: the statute merely states that the PUC \u201cmay determine and prescribe an adequate service to be furnished and just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be made by such company.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Significantly, this court on a previous occasion, construing predecessor provisions of the Public Service Companies Act, emphasized the uniquely discretionary nature of the PUC\u2019s threshold supervision over proposals filed by companies such as the defendant: \u201cOur law, unlike the public utility laws in many jurisdictions, does not in general condition the establishment of a changed rate schedule by a utility company upon prior approval by the commission. All a company desiring to put into effect a changed rate schedule needs to do in the first instance is to file it with the commission. There is no obligation upon the company to apply to the commission for an order that the effective date of the schedule shall not be suspended, or upon the commission to make an order directing whether or not it shall be suspended, but, unless in the exercise of the power vested in it, expressly made discretionary, it does so order, the schedule becomes effective at the time fixed in it.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Water Co., </em>132 Conn. 496, 509-10, 45 A.2d 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Under these circumstances, the role that is statutorily assigned to the PUC in rendering effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>five tariffs proposed by companies such as the defendant amounts to little more than acquiescence in a program originated by the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In no sense, then, can activities of the defendant such as the kind of activities challenged by the plaintiff, purportedly authorized by a tariff filed with and approved by the PUC, be characterized as \u201ccompelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign\u201d under the <em>Parher </em>doctrine as it has been judicially interpreted. <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State </em>Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 791, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572. Nor can such activities consequently be comprehended within the more stringent standards applicable to exemptions from antitrust liability established by the act. General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 (b). Action on the controversy by the PUC under \u00a7 16-19, accordingly, would not have resulted in a determination of the defendant\u2019s liability under \u00a7 35-31 (b): a decision by the PUC that the particular activities challenged by the plaintiff were among the activities authorized by the defendant\u2019s tariff approved on January 1, 1969, would not necessarily mean that those activities were \u201cspecifically directed or required\u201d by state statute. The PUC, then, cannot be said to have had express power to exempt the defendant\u2019s activities from antitrust liability so as to warrant a conclusion that it had primary jurisdiction over the matters complained of by the plaintiff. <em>California </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>369 U.S. 482, 485-89, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>S.

Such power can be implied only in cases of \u201cplain repugnancy\u201d between the regulatory scheme and the antitrust law. <em>Otter Tail Power Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>410 U.S. 366, 372, 93 S.

Ed. 2d 915; see also King, op. cit., pp. 648-49 n.143. The necessary repugnancy is sometimes found to be inherent in the fact, inter alia, that the regulatory scheme in question was enacted after the antitrust law in question went into effect (although such \u201crepeals\u201d of the antitrust laws are \u201cstrongly disfavored\u201d); <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </em>409 U.S. 289, 301, 93 S.

Ed. 2d 354; <em>Sabin </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>515 F.2d 1061 (10th Cir.). This was the theory underlying, in part, the dispositions of such cases as, e.g., <em>Carter </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>365 F.2d 486, 496 (5th Cir.); <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>359 F. Sup. 973, 976 (C.D. Cal.); and <em>Chastain </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>351 F. Sup. 1320, 1323 (D. D.C.), where the court referred antitrust attacks upon activities authorized by telephone company tariffs to the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d of the federal communications commission upon concluding that the FCC was required by specific provisions of the Federal Communications Commission Act to determine whether the \u201crates,\u201d \u201cservices,\u201d \u201ccharges\u201d and \u201cpractices\u201d of a regulated telephone company were \u201cjust,\u201d \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201clawful,\u201d or otherwise in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d in order for such rates, services, charges or practices to remain in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In this case, the Public Service Companies Act provisions in question antedated the enactment of the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act, so that no \u201crepeal\u201d of the latter can be inferred therefrom. Moreover, the PUC has no obligation under the Public Service Companies Act to take into account the possibly anticompetitive effects of proposed tariffs filed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the commission prior to granting its approval. Bather, whether the PUC decides to approve or modify a tariff pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 16-19 \u2022upon a finding that any \u201crate\u201d is \u201cunreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare,\u201d or that a \u201cservice\u201d is \u201cinadequate or excessive,\u201d is wholly within its discretion. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Water Co., </em>132 Conn. 496, 509-10, 45 A.2d 831; see also discussion, supra, section III, part A, subsection 2. Determinations of the continuing validity of rates and services pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-9, 16-20 and 16-21 are similarly discretionary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 496; <em>Macom Products Corpo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>ration </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>359 F.

Cal.); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>New York Telephone Co., </em>2 P.U.R. 4th 411, 415 (construing article 5 of the New York Public Service Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In sum, no \u201crepeal\u201d of the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act can be inferred from the provisions of the Public Service Companies Act. Nor is there any binding requirement on the part of the PUC to take into account antitrust law policies when reviewing the validity of such activities of a regulated telephone company as those purportedly authorized by the defendant telephone company\u2019s tariff in this case. Accordingly, we find no \u201cplain repugnancy\u201d between the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act and the Public Service Companies Act warranting a conclusion that the PUC has an \u201cimplied\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>power to exempt from antitrust liability the kind of activities of a telephone company which are involved in this case to the extent that jurisdiction in the PUC of the subject matter of this controversy can be said to be \u201cprimary.\u201d <em>Gulf States Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>supra; <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </em>supra, 301; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philadelphia National Bank, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The courts in <em>Carter, Macom Products, </em>and <em>Chastain, </em>supra, in referring the antitrust controversies therein to the primary jurisdiction of the FCC, also attached great significance to the fact that specific procedures existed empowering the plaintiffs to raise before the commission factual issues of decisive importance to the resolution of the antitrust suits in question. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 499 n.27; <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 976; <em>Chastain </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra, 1323, citing <em>Carter, </em>supra; cf. <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </em>supra, 304-305 n.14. However, there is no way that a person in the plaintiff\u2019s position can raise before the PUC any of the critical factual questions in this case arguably within the PUC\u2019s competence, viz., whether the activities of the telephone company challenged in this case are so essential to the public interest as to override any possibly anticompetitive effects on the communications industry in the private sector of the economy, or whether the privately obtained devices secured by the plaintiff would in some way be harmful to the defendant\u2019s network. See <em>Macom Products Corporation </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Co., </em>359 F. Sup. 973 (C.D. Cal.).

Nor, finally, do any of the provisions of Connecticut\u2019s Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA) authorize an individual in the plaintiff\u2019s position to secure from an agency like the PUC a definitive ruling on questions such as those at the heart of this case. See, e.g., the restrictions inherent in the procedures created by \u00a7\u00a74-174 and 4-176 of the UAPA; cf. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>supra. Thus, even if the PUC were in a peculiarly advantageous position to determine a factual issue which could be of material assistance to the court in resolving the question of the defendant\u2019s antitrust liability; <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Deaktor, </em>414 U.S. 113, 115, 94 S.

If the commission finds any rate to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive, it may determine and prescribe an adequate service to be furnished and just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be made by such company. The commission may, in its discretion, pending its conclusion upon an amendment increasing any rate, suspend the effective date of such increase for not more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>hundred, and fifty days from the effective date of such increase. If the commission has not made its finding respecting such increase within the period of suspension, such increase may become effective pending the commission\u2019s finding with respect to such increase or, in the discretion of the commission, any amendment increasing any rate may become effective upon the filing by the company with the commission of assurance satisfactory to the commission, which may include a bond with surety, of the company\u2019s ability and willingness to refund to its customers such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the rates fixed by the commission in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the commission. If the commission finds that the imposition of any increase in rates would create a hardship for a municipality, because such increase is not reflected in its then current budget, or cannot be included in the budget of its fiscal year which begins less than five months after the effective date of such increase, the commission may defer the applicability of such increase with respect to services furnished to sueh municipality until the fiscal year of such municipality beginning not less than five months following the effective date of such increase; provided the revenues lost to the public service company through such deferral shall be paid to the public service company by the municipality in its first fiscal year following the period of sueh deferral. Upon conclusion of its investigation of the reasonableness of such increase, the commission may order the company to refund to its customers any amounts the company may have collected from them during the period that sueh increase was in force, which amounts the commission may find to have been in excess of the rates fixed by the commission in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the commission. Any such refund ordered by the commission shall be paid by the company, under direction of the commission, to the customer in such amounts as are determined by the commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b374-5\"> No federal statutory provision on point has been briefed or argued. In 1968, however, the federal communications commission in its <em>Carterfone </em>decision declared void tariffs filed with the FCC and with state regulatory commissions by all domestic telephone companies prohibiting the interconnection of subscriber-owned devices with the carrier\u2019s telephone system. <em>In re Carterfone, </em>13 F.C.C.2d 420, 42A-26. Forthwith the regulated telephone companies filed tariffs (similar to that of the defendant in this case) with the appropriate regulatory agencies providing for interconnection of such equipment so long as the telephone company furnished, installed and maintained the interconnect. <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corporation </em>v. <em>General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation, </em>351 F. Sup. 1153, 1179 (D. Hawaii), rev\u2019d, 518 F.2d 913 (9th Cir.). The National Academy of Sciences has since reported to the FCC that its study of the technical factors affecting interconnection suggests that while the use of telephone company provided protection apparatus may have been temporarily expedient, there should ultimately be an equipment certification program conducted by the FCC. Id., 1179 n.59. In the meantime, courts have proceeded to adjudicate on the merits the validity of such apparatus requirements under federal antitrust laws.

The <em>Washington Gas Light </em>theory is that mere acquiescence by an agency in actions taken by companies subject to public regulation constitutes a grant of immunity under <em>Parker. </em>The validity of that theory was recently undermined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, a case reversing a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision whose outcome had hinged on the <em>Washington Gas Light </em>theory. <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>497 F.2d 1, 5 (4th Cir.). See also <em>Communication Brokers </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. of Virginia, </em>370 F. Sup. 967, 969 (W.D. Va.), where a district court in the Fourth Circuit declined to apply the <em>Parker </em>analysis of <em>Washington Gas Light </em>in a suit by a plaintiff engaged in the business of selling, leasing, installing, and repairing communication equipment, who alleged, inter alia, that the defendant tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>phone company had sought to restrain unduly competition by deliberately delaying the procurement of \u201cinterface devices\u201d necessary for the interconnection of the plaintiff\u2019s equipment to the defendant\u2019s network.

I do not agree with the conclusion reached in the majority opinion and think that an order should be entered dismissing the appeal since it is not taken from a final judgment\u2014or from any judgment whatsoever. It is an appeal from an interlocutory ruling of a judge of the Superior Court denying an application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>temporary injunction and from time immemorial it has been held that no appeal lies from such an interlocutory ruling of a judge. This holding is in accord with the provisions of \u00a7 600 of the Practice Book and \u00a752-263 of the General Statutes which only authorize appeals to this court \u201cfrom the. final judgment of the court or of such judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The law as it has been established up until the present decision was well expressed by Chief Justice King in <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>145 Conn. 77, 79, 139 A.2d 60. In that case the trial court issued a temporary injunction forbidding the picketing of the plaintiff\u2019s place of business until there would be a trial on the merits and the defendant appealed on many grounds. This court, in a unanimous opinion, stated the law thusly: \u201cAt the outset we are faced with a jurisdictional question as to whether an appeal is possible in this case. This question must be resolved before we can consider the appeal on the merits. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>145 Conn. 1, 6, 137 A.2d 759. The taking of an appeal from the granting or denial of a temporary injunction is ordinarily impossible, since such an order is not a final judgment. <em>Olcott </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>128 Conn. 292, 295, 22 A.2d 633. . . . [S]uch an appeal lies if, but only if, the injunction was granted in a ease \u2018involving or growing out of a labor dispute.\u2019 <em>H. O. Canfield Co. </em>v. <em>United Construction Workers, </em>134 Conn. 358, 360, 57 A.2d 624. Unless the present case falls in that category, this appeal must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff sought a temporary and a permanent injunction by a writ, summons and complaint dated August 27, 1974, and returnable to the Superior Court in Windham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>County on the third Tuesday of September, 1974. On August 27, 1974, <em>Barber, J., </em>acting as a judge of the Superior Court, issued an order to the defendant to appear on September 5, 1974, \u201cto show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued against you as prayed for in said complaint and application.\u201d There followed next a memorandum of decision signed by <em>Driscoll, J., </em>dated September 14, 1974. That memorandum commences with this statement: \u201cThis matter is before the court in response to an order to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued as prayed for in a complaint and application as filed with the Superior Court,\u201d and notes that \u201c[a]part from the complaint and the previously referred to order to show cause there has been no further pleadings in this matter.\u201d The memorandum of decision concluded with this sentence: \u201cAccordingly, the relief sought herein is denied without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Not only were the pleadings never closed but no judgment whatsoever was ever entered and, for obvious reasons in this state of the record, no finding ever requested or filed. The only action taken by the presiding judge was to make an interlocutory ruling which denied \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d the application for a temporary injunction. Under our heretofore settled law, no appeal lies from such an interlocutory ruling and the majority opinion cites no authority of this court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">It suffices to conclude with a quotation from the opinion of Chief Justice Maltbie in <em>Marcil </em>v. <em>Merriman &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>115 Conn. 678, 682, 163 A. 411: \u201cThere is no warrant in law for such an appeal as the one before us. Whenever the absence of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>diction of a proceeding is brought to the notice of a court, cognizance of the fact must be taken and the matter determined before it can move a further step in the case. <em>Woodmont Asso. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>85 Conn. 517, 524, 84 A. 307. Jurisdiction to entertain a particular proceeding cannot be conferred by waiver or consent. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Hugo, </em>93 Conn. 360, 364, 105 A. 709; <em>Savings Bank of Danbury </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>74 Conn. 87, 89, 49 A. 913. Where there is no judgment or ruling from which an appeal can be taken, the attempted appeal must be dismissed, either on motion of the parties or by the court upon its own motion. <em>In re Application of Title &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>109 Conn. 45, 51, 145 A. 151. In <em>Russell Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Co., </em>82 Conn. 517, 74 A. 949, there was an attempt to appeal from the denial of a motion for a stay of execution; examination of the record of the case shows that no motion to dismiss the appeal or similar proceeding was taken; the court, however, refused to entertain the appeal. We said: \u2018The statute provides for appeals only from final judgments. The present appeal is not from such a judgment. It was therefore unwarranted and improper, and gives to this court no jurisdiction over the case. The appeal is erased from the docket.\u2019 These decisions mark out our proper course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The appeal from the denial, without prejudice, of the plaintiff\u2019s application for a temporary injunction should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
