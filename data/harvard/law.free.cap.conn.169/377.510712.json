He was tried by a jury and found guilty on both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The defendant assigns as error the denial by the court of the \u201cdefendant\u2019s motions for directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case, and at the close of the defense.\u201d He also assigns as error certain rulings by the court on the admissibility of evidence and attacks portions of the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In his brief, the defendant attacks the court\u2019s charge. He has not assigned the charge as error; the charge is not included in the finding, nor does the appendix indicate the nature of the defendant\u2019s complaints as to the court\u2019s charge. Hence, this court does not have sufficient information before it to permit a review of this claim. Practice Book \u00a7 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The defendant assigns as error the admission by the court of the testimony of Mrs. Cecile Wardell. She testified that on a night, the date of which she could not specify, she had heard a knock on the door of the house on Green Hill Boad where she was living. When she went to the door, she found no one there, but heard the sound of footsteps as though people were running away. Mrs. Wardell\u2019s testimony did not include hearsay evidence. The issue of the relevancy of this testimony, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>raised in the assignment of errors, has not been briefed and is therefore considered to have been abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>168 Conn. 520, 521, 362 A.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The defendant assigns as error the failure of the court to strike as hearsay the testimony of Craig K. Philippe, the principal witness against the defendant, placing the date of the offense as January 29, 1972. This assignment of error has no merit. The witness testified on cross-examination that he had been called from a party which he knew had been held the night of the last Saturday in January and when the police had showed him a calendar he had picked out January 29, 1972. The verification of that date by reference to a calendar merely confirmed a fact of which the court could have taken judicial notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>47 Gonn. 179, 180; Holden &amp; Daly, Conn. Evidence \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for a \u201cdirected verdict,\u201d after the state had rested and at the close of all the evidence. We treat the first motion as a motion to dismiss. In a criminal case, a verdict will be directed only when \u201cthe reasoning mind could not reasonably reach a conclusion other than that the evidence, under the law, is not sufficient to justify a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torello, </em>100 Conn. 637, 643, 124 A. 375; General Statutes \u00a7 54-89; Maltbie, Conn.

Denial of a motion for a directed verdict \u201cis reviewed on the evidence alone and not on the finding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amendola, </em>152 Conn. 166, 168, 204 A.2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Under the appellate rules in effect at the time the appeal was taken, all evidence which was mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>rial to the issues on appeal was required to be printed in the appendices to the briefs. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 645, 721. Set out in narrative form in the state\u2019s appendix is the testimony of Philippe, the principal witness against the defendant. Philippe testified that on January 29, 1972, a' friend had called him out of a party he was attending and told him someone wanted to see him. In a car parked outside, Philippe and another individual met the defendant and a friend. The defendant and his friend asked Philippe and the other individual if they would steal some gold coins from a house on Green Hill Road in the town of Madison. The individual with Philippe refused and returned to the party. The defendant then drove Philippe and the other person to the house, where they took a tire iron from the car and approached the house while the defendant drove up and down the street waiting for their return. The two individuals knocked on the door to see if anyone was home. Hearing the voice of someone who was coming to the door, the two ran back to the street where they were picked up by the defendant. It is clear from the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses recited above that there was sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury and to sustain its verdict of guilty on both counts, as all the elements required by the statutes were presented by the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Philippe and another to the house, the defendant was guilty of conspiracy in that he committed an overt act in pursuance of their agreement to burglarize the Wardell house. That conduct also constituted a substantial step in the course of attempting to commit the burglary in transporting the others and in waiting to provide a quick getaway in case any alarm system, which they thought was in the house, was activated. Although the defendant denied that he had done any of the acts described by Philippe, the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony is for the jury to determine. <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Palladino, 143 </em>Conn. 547, 548-49, 123 A.2d 872; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. $ 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> While no mention was made in the briefs or in oral argument, it appears that there was a typographical discrepancy between the information and the judgment, as printed in the record. Count one of the information charged the defendant with the crime of <em>attempted burglary, </em>second degree; however, the judgment as printed in the record states that the defendant was convicted of <em>burglary, </em>second degree. In view of this discrepancy, we examined the original judgment of the court as entered and found that it was a judgment of guilty of attempted burglary, the typographical error having occurred in the printing of the record for this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 53a-48. conspiracy. . . .
