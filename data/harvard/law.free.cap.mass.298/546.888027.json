Upon inspection the plaintiff found the steering apparatus in good condition and refused the defendant\u2019s request. Thereafter the defendant drove the automobile upon the streets of Springfield covered with this writing: \u201cDon\u2019t believe what they say, this car is no good; I tried to have it fixed but they can\u2019t fix it and they will do nothing about it . . . this car was no good when I got it; don\u2019t be a sucker, this car is no good but it looks all right.\u201d The defendant continues to drive and to park the automobile thus equipped in the streets and in public places in Springfield, well knowing that his claims are false, solely for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and extorting money from the plaintiff to which the defendant knows he is not entitled. The defendant, for the same purpose, has made statements to the public to the effect that the plaintiff sold him the automobile, and that \u201cit is a lemon and never was any good,\u201d but that the plaintiff \u201cwon\u2019t make good.\u201d There are further general allegations of the defendant\u2019s knowledge that his statements and signs were untrue, of malice on the part of the defendant, and of damage to the plaintiff in his business. The defendant demurred for want of equity; because the plaintiff\u2019s bill was \u201cbased on allegations of libel and slander,\u201d and the plaintiff had failed to make definite allegations of special damages; and because the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The demurrer was rightly overruled, The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>relies upon <em>Boston Diatite Co. </em>v. <em>Florence Manuf. Co. </em>114 Mass. 69, wherein it was held that equity jurisdiction does not extend to cases of libel or slander or of false representations as to the character or quality of the plaintiff\u2019s property or as to his title thereto which involve no breach of trust or of contract. See also <em>Whitehead </em>v. <em>Kitson, </em>119 Mass. 484; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>143 Mass. 295; <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>153 Mass. 263; <em>Aberthaw Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Ransome, </em>192 Mass. 434, 439; <em>Finnish Temperance Society Sovittaja </em>v. <em>Raivaaja Publishing Co. </em>219 Mass. 28. But later cases have held that equity will take jurisdiction where there is a continuing course of unjustified and wrongful attack upon the plaintiff motivated by actual malice, and causing damage to property rights as distinguished from \u201cinjury to the personality affecting feelings, sensibility and honor\u201d <em>(Choate </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>240 Mass. 131, 135), even though false statements and false announcements are the means or are among the means employed, and that in such cases there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>New England Railway Publishing Co. </em>203 Mass. 470. <em>M. Steinert &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Tagen, </em>207 Mass. 394. <em>Hotel &amp; Railroad News Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>243 Mass. 317. <em>Lawrence Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sun-American Publishing Co. </em>245 Mass. 262. See <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>147 Mass. 212; <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>Plumbers\u2019 Supply Association of New England, </em>169 Mass. 229, 235; <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Orlov, </em>228 Mass. 1, 11; <em>Godin </em>v. <em>Niebuhr, </em>236 Mass. 350; <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>294 Mass. 44, 46. This case falls within the principle of the cases last cited. Neither conspiracy nor unfair competition need appear. <em>Lawrence Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sun-American Publishing Co. </em>245 Mass. 262, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In view of the distance to which our own decisions have already carried us, it would be profitless, although it might be interesting, to enter upon a discussion of the past and present state of the law in other jurisdictions. There is evidence of a process of evolution which may be still in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal from the final decree granting the plaintiff injunctive relief and nominal damages presents no additional question of law. The findings of the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>support, in general, the allegations of the bill and add further details of the defendant\u2019s efforts publicly to disparage the make of automobile sold by the plaintiff and to injure the plaintiff\u2019s business by tying lemons and other articles to the defendant\u2019s automobile, pasting papers in the automobile windows showing that it had been purchased from the plaintiff, and exhibiting the automobile in this condition near the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, near the place of business of the distributors, near the local automobile show, and in other public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">\n<em>Interlocutory decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
