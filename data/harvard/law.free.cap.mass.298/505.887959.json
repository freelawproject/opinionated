The defendant\u2019s answer contains, with a general denial, an allegation of contributory negligence of the plaintiff, but no specific allegation that the automobile operated by him was not legally registered. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in his favor \u201cupon the law, pleadings and evidence\u201d was denied, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The argument of the defendant in support of the motion was based solely on the ground that the automobile operated by the plaintiff was not legally registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The burden of proving that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was not legally registered was on the defendant. <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>217 Mass. 91. It could not have been ruled as matter of law that this burden was sustained. Consequently there was no error in the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The defendant relies primarily on a misstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s residence in his application for registration. Independently of the effect of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1934, c. 361, a misstatement \u2014 apart from trifling inaccuracies <em>(Caverno </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>294 Mass. 110, 113) \u2014of the plaintiff\u2019s residence in the application would invalidate an attempted registration. See <em>Lappanasse </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>297 Mass. 290, and cases cited. But G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1934, c. 361, provides as follows: \u201cA motor vehicle or trailer shall be deemed to be registered in accordance with this chapter notwithstanding any mistake in so much of the description thereof contained in the application for registration or in the certificate required to be filed under section thirty-four B as relates to the type of such vehicle or trailer or to the engine, serial or maker\u2019s number thereof, or any mistake in the statement of residence of the applicant contained in said application or certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted testimony \u2014 which is binding upon him \u2014 that this automobile was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>bought by him in June, 1936, and was delivered to him on June 26, and, from such testimony and the records in the office of the registrar of motor vehicles (see <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 495), that the application for registration made by the plaintiff on June 26 stated his \u201caddress\u201d and his \u201cplace of residence\u201d to be \u201cNo. 191 Main Street, Greenfield.\u201d See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2. The facts bearing upon the plaintiff\u2019s place of residence on June 26, 1936, as shown by his uncontradicted testimony, were these: He was an inspector of boilers, employed by the Commonwealth. In December, 1935, he was transferred from Springfield to Greenfield. Thereafter his office was at 191 Main Street, Greenfield, but he never lived there. The plaintiff, however, lived for six days a week in Greenfield, first at \u201cCabot Lodge\u201d and later, from about June 1, 1936, until August 14, 1936, at \u201cMrs. McKenna\u2019s,\u201d at a house numbered 108, on a street the name of which does not appear, but which apparently was not Main Street. Before he was transferred to Greenfield his home was at 16 Landseer Avenue, Framingham. His family continued to live there, supported by the plaintiff, until, in the \u201clatter part of June,\u201d before he bought the automobile, he moved them to Dennis where he had hired a cottage for the summer. The plaintiff\u2019s furniture remained at 16 Landseer Avenue, Framingham, until June 30, 1936, when it was loaded for moving, and the next day it was delivered at \u201cNo. 23 Massasoit Street, Northampton,\u201d a house which the plaintiff had arranged to lease on June 29, 1936. He had given notice to terminate his tenancy of the premises in Framingham, but paid rent thereon until July 1, 1936. The plaintiff\u2019s family moved into the house in Northampton on September 8, 1936, when they returned from Dennis. When the plaintiff gave notice to terminate his tenancy of the premises in Framingham he knew that he was going to move out but he did not know until June 29, 1936, that he. was going to move into the house in Northampton. The plaintiff \u201crenewed . . . [his] driver\u2019s license on June 20, 1936, giving . . . [his] home address as No, 16 Land-seer Avenue, Framingham, Mass,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>It is not necessary to consider whether, apart from the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1934, c. 361, there was such a misstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s residence in the application as-would invalidate the registration, for, even if there was such a misstatement, it could have been found to have been a \u201cmistake\u201d which, by reason of the statute, would not have that effect. The provision in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended, with respect to \u201cmistake in the statement of residence\u201d was first incorporated therein by St. 1934, c. 361. In this connection the word \u201cmistake\u201d has the same meaning as when used in the provision relating to the \u201cengine, serial or maker's number,\u201d which had been incorporated in the statute by St. 1928, c. 187, \u00a7 1. The word \u201cmistake\u201d so used was defined in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. 55, 58, as including only \u201ccomplete honesty of purpose accompanied by blameless oversight or ignorance of facts.\u201d See also <em>Emeneau </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>282 Mass. 280, 284. There is nothing in the evidence to show any lack of \u201ccomplete honesty of purpose\u201d on the part of the plaintiff. And a finding was not precluded that, so far as there was any misstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s residence in the application, it was due to \u201cblameless oversight or ignorance.\u201d We cannot say that this case falls outside the evident purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The testimony of the plaintiff, moreover, must be construed as meaning that the statement of his residence in the certificate of registration was the same as in the application. Since a statement of \u201cplace of residence\u201d in the certificate of registration is specifically required by statute (G. L. [Ter. EdJ c. 90, \u00a7 2) an omission of such a statement or a misstatement may invalidate the registration. See <em>Brodmerkle </em>v. <em>Gorolsky, </em>293 Mass. 517. Compare <em>Faria </em>v. <em>Veras, ante, </em>117, 120-121. And the relief given by the amendment of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, by St. 1934, c. 361, from the effect of a \u201cmistake\u201d in the \u201cstatement of residence\u201d in an application is not in terms extended to a misstatement in the certificate of registration. While the application is made by the owner of a motor vehicle, the certificate is issued by the \u201cregistrar or his duly author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ized agents.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2. The application, however, is the source of the information contained in the certificate. <em>Lappanasse </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>297 Mass. 290, 293. And the relief given for a \u201cmistake\u201d in the \u201cstatement of residence\u201d in the application would be signally ineffective if such a \u201cmistake\u201d followed precisely in the certificate should invalidate the registration. An intention to pass such an ineffective statute is not to be imputed to the Legislature. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>231 Mass. 252, 257. We think it is fairly to be implied that the Legislature intended that the relief granted in the case of a \u201cmistake\u201d in the \u201cstatement of residence\u201d in the application should extend to a like misstatement in the certificate naturally resulting therefrom. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. 55, 58. It could not have been ruled, therefore, that the registration of the automobile operated by the plaintiff was invalidated by reason of misstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s residence in the certificate of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Even apart from the specific reference in the motion to the pleadings the action of the trial judge cannot be reversed if it was right on the pleadings. <em>Aldworth </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>295 Mass. 344, 345. Though the answer did not allege that the automobile operated by the plaintiff was not legally registered, that fact could be shown under the allegation of contributory negligence, since the operation on a public way of an automobile not legally registered not only is a wrongful act independent of negligence, but also is evidence of negligence. <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>262 Mass. 475. <em>Balian </em>v. <em>Ogassin, </em>277 Mass. 525, 530. In view, however, of the conclusion reached it is unnecessary to decide whether the action of the judge, considered in the light of the pleadings, was right on any other ground. See <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>262 Mass. 475, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
