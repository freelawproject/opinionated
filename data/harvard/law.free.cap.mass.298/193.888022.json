The general right to recover that assessment from stockholders here was established in <em>Friede </em>v. <em>Sprout, </em>294 Mass. 512. The plaintiff filed an affidavit of no defence, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 59B. <em>Norwood Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>295 Mass. 597. In a counter affidavit the defendant showed that a number of years before the proceedings which led to the assessment, he had indorsed his certificate of stock to his daughter and had delivered it to her as a gift. The stock was never transferred from the name of the defendant on the books of the corporation, nor was the certificate ever sent to the corporation for transfer. No dividend has since been received, and the defendant has never since taken any action as a stockholder. The judge, holding that these facts constituted no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>defence, ordered judgment for the plaintiff under the statute cited. The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The relevant statute is printed in a note to <em>Friede </em>v. <em>Sprout, </em>294 Mass. 512. It fastens liability upon \"shareholders,\u201d without further description. In that respect it is like our own statute as to trust companies (G. L. [Ter. EdJ c. 172, \u00a7 24), and the national banking act (U. S. C. Title 12, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 63, 64), which impose liability upon \"stockholders\u201d or \"shareholders.\u201d In <em>Commissioner of Banks </em>v. <em>Waltham Trust Co. </em>293 Mass. 62, 65, this court said, \u201cthe fact that stock stands on the books of the trust company in the name of a person is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that such person is the owner thereof and the burden of proving that he is not rests upon him. . . . And an individual once the owner of stock of a trust company and registered as such on its books cannot escape the stockholders' liability incident to ownership of such stock without showing that before the significant date he transferred ownership thereof to someone else . . . and performed the duty incumbent on him of securing the transfer of such stock on the books of the trust company or at least of doing all he could \u2018to divest himself of the indicia of title\u2019 thereto.\u201d In <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Taunton Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>216 Mass. 156, 159, 163, it appeared that the defendant White had sold his stock before the significant date, but that \u201cthe trust company never was notified of the sale nor was any new certificate ever called for or issued to the purchaser, and that the books of the trust company at the time of the receivership and at the time of the hearing showed him to be the owner of twelve shares of stock.\u201d The ruling that \u201cupon these facts the sale of stock did not reheve this defendant from liability\u201d was held \u201ccorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Similar rulings have been made under the national banking act. In <em>Matteson </em>v. <em>Dent, </em>176 U. S. 521, 530, the rule was stated as follows: \"the legal owner . . . remains liable for an assessment so long as the stock is allowed to stand in his name on the books, and, consequently, . . . although the registered owner may have made a transfer to another person, unless it has been accompanied by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>transfer on the books of registry of the association, such registered owner remains liable.\u201d See also <em>Apsey </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>199 Mass. 65, 69, 70, affirmed <em>sub nomine Apsey </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>221 U. S. 514; <em>Superintendent of Banks of New York </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>294 Mass. 518, 521; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Floria, </em>81 Fed. (2d) 275. We need not consider just what unsuccessful effort by an assignor of corporate stock to cause the transfer to be recorded on the corporate books would relieve him of liability as a stockholder for a subsequent assessment. In the present case, so far as appears, no effort whatever was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
