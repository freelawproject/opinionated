Whatever title the Commonwealth or its successors in title had under that deed passed to the Boston and Maine Railroad in 1919 and from it to the defendant. The question is, whether the claim of the plaintiffs or that of the defendant is the better. The decree upheld the claim of the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The deed conveyed lands in Deerfield \u201csituated upon the line of the Troy &amp; Greenfield Railroad.\u201d Following the description, but before the <em>habendum, </em>were these words: \u201cIt being understood and agreed that the above described lands are to be used for Railroad and Station purposes: .otherwise the same (with the exception of a strip five rods in width covered by the location,) shall revert to the Grantors.\u201d The land in question is that part which might thus revert. The <em>habendum </em>was as follows: \u201cTo Have and to Hold the above granted premises, with all the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging to the said Commonwealth and its assigns, to their use and behoof forever.\u201d Even before the recent statute dispensing with the word heirs in the conveyance of a fee (St. 1912, c. 502, \u00a7 19; G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 183, \u00a7 13), a conveyance with the <em>habendum </em>in the form used in the deed in question, made to the Commonwealth which exists in perpetuity and can have no heirs, conveyed a fee. <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Wash. 585, 592.

'</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In 1874 the land ceased to be used for \"railroad\u201d or \"station\u201d purposes. That fact had no effect upon the title of the grantee if the provision in the deed amounted only to a covenant. If the provision amounted to a condition, the same fact could have no effect upon the title of the grantee unless and until the original grantors or their heirs or devisees should enter upon the lands for breach of the condition, or bring an action to recover the lands, with the intent to repossess themselves of them, which they never did. <em>Brattle Square Church </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>3 Gray, 142, 146. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Merrimack Manuf.

The unexercised possibility or right of reentry for condition broken could pass from the original grantors by descent or devise. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>5 Pick. 528. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Cambridgeport Parish, </em>21 Pick. 215, 223, 224. But it could not pass from the original grantors to a third person by a conveyance <em>inter vivas. </em>An attempt so to pass it, either before or after breach, would merely discharge the condition, and make unconditional the title of the original grantee. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>12 Allen, 141. <em>Guild </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>16 Gray, 309. <em>St.Paul\u2019s Church </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>164 Mass. 188, 198. <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Co. </em>265 Mich. 696. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Property, \u00a7 160. Compare <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>8 Allen, 597. If the provision in question amounted to a condition, the title of the defendant has been freed from it by the very conveyances that purported to transfer to the plaintiffs\u2019 devisor the rights of the' original grantors, and the plaintiffs have acquired nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The plaintiffs can prevail upon the record title only on the theory that the deed conveyed what is called a base, qualified or determinable fee, to end without entry or action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>whenever the granted lands (to construe the provision favorably to the plaintiffs) should cease to be \u201cused for Railroad and Station purposes,\u201d and in the meantime leaving in the original grantors a possibility of reverter which for the purposes of this decision we may assume, without deciding, to be alienable. <em>First Universalist Society of North Adams </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>155 Mass. 171. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Caplan, </em>234 Mass. 516, 520. <em>Institution for Savings in Roxbury </em>v. <em>Roxbury Home for Aged Women, </em>244 Mass. 583. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals on Merrimack River </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>245 Mass. 52, 56. <em>Lyford </em>v. <em>Laconia, </em>75 N. H. 220. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Property, \u00a7 44. Simes, Future Interests (1936), \u00a7 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">But none of the common indicia of a determinable fee are found in the deed. Neither in the <em>habendum </em>nor in any other part of the deed are words like \u201cso long as,\u201d \u201cduring\u201d or \u201cuntil,\u201d commonly inserted in the <em>habendum </em>when such a fee is intended. The <em>habendum </em>is not only unqualified, but ends with the words \u201cto their use and behoof forever.\u201d The provision that \u201cotherwise,\u201d that is, if the lands conveyed shall cease to be \u201cused for Railroad and Station purposes,\u201d they shall \u201crevert to the Grantors,\u201d does nojb of itself show an intention that the fee granted shall terminate and the lands \u201crevert\u201d without entry or action. It is true that the words used are not the technical words of condition any more than those of determinable fee; but technical words are not essential to a condition. <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>School District in Uxbridge, </em>7 Allen, 125. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Merrimack Manuf. Co. </em>14 Gray, 586, 612. <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>176 Mass. 332. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Middlesex Co. </em>244 Mass. 224, 230. The words \u201crevert\u201d and \u201creverter\u201d are not inappropriate to express the operation of a condition subsequent upon a fee <em>(Brattle Square Church </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>3 Gray, 142, 147; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>12 Allen, 141, 142), and language not unlike that in the deed in question has been treated as creating a fee defeasible upon condition subsequent. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>135 Mass. 147. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>171 Mass. 575. <em>Capen </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>177 Mass. 84. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Property, \u00a7 45, comment <em>m. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>On the whole we think that no determinable fee was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">It is immaterial whether or not the subsidiary facts reported by the master support his conclusion that the plaintiffs acquired title to the lands in question by the adverse possession of their devisor and themselves from 1906 until 1929, apart from the following question of law. From 1919, at the latest, and doubtless from a much earlier date, until the conveyance to the defendant in 1925, the lands in question were owned by a railroad corporation, according to our construction of the deed of 1867, and the plaintiffs and their devisor before them were the owners of adjoining land. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 88, reads: \u201cNo length of possession or occupancy of land, which belongs to a railroad corporation, by an owner or occupier of adjoining land shall create in him or in a person claiming under him a right to such land of the corporation.\u201d Whatever the purpose of the original statute from which that section was derived, it is now settled that it applies to all land lawfully owned by a railroad corporation, whether a part of its location or used in its business, or not. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>226 Mass. 286. <em>Hurlbut Rogers Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>235 Mass. 402. The claim of the plaintiffs by adverse possession, like their claim under the deed of 1867, is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">One point remains.\" The master found as follows: \u201cThe Fitchburg Railroad Company, successor of whatever rights the Commonwealth derived under the original deed to it, never made any claim to the land claimed by the plaintiffs, and that if it ever did so claim, it abandoned and relinquished and disavowed any claim to such land, at least from September 12, 1898.\u201d Since there is no subsidiary finding inconsistent with this general finding, it must be taken as a fact. <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>290 Mass. 335. But the fact can have no effect upon the title. An easement, it is true, can be lost by abandonment. <em>Amee </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, 212 Mass. 421.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Commonwealth and its successors in title under the deed of 1867 owned a fee simple, though it may have been a defeasible one, and the common law knows no such thing as the loss of a fee simple by mere abandonment. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>24 Pick. 106, 112. <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Bessel, </em>213 Mass. 74, 77. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>226 Mass. 286, 292. <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>121 Maine, 44. <em>Trustees of Caledonia County Grammar School </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>84 Vt. 1, 10. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Kansas &amp; Texas Coal Co. </em>70 Kans. 649, 655. <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Market, </em>124 Minn. 393, 398. <em>Phy </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>122 Tenn. 694, 19 Ann.
