She slipped on the floor and was hurt. There was evidence that what she slipped on was a greasy substance on the linoleum floor, making a spot ten or twelve inches in diameter, which was dirty and grimy and was described as looking \u201clike an old grease spot.\u201d After she had slipped her heel mark \u201cshowed light,\u201d indicating that the dirt in the \u201cdirty\u201d spot was on the surface. Besides, there was direct evidence that \u201cthere was dirt over the spot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We think that this was evidence that the grease had been on the floor long enough to warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent in not discovering and removing it. <em>Man-ell </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>284 Mass. 151. <em>Trottier </em>v. <em>Neisner Brothers, Inc. </em>284 Mass. 336. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>293 Mass. 232. For this reason the order of the Appellate Division ordering judgment for the defendant must be reversed; but as the ground upon which the trial judge found for the plaintiff, namely, that the grease was in fact an accumulation of floor wax, appears to us unsupported by the evidence, we think that the finding for the plaintiff should be vacated, and that the case should stand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
