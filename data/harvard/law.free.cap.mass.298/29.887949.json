Hall, and Harry C. Dunbar, the executor of her will, has been here twice before. <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>294 Mass. 101. <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>296 Mass. 40. The present appeal is from a decree allowing the first and second accounts of the executor. We have no doubt that a creditor may appeal in a case like this, where the estate is insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">In his second account, the executor charges himself with $300 received from the sale at auction of a parcel of land under a license from the Probate Court. The bids were made, as the auctioneer orally directed, large enough to include the mortgage of $1,300. The highest bidder, who became the purchaser, bid $1,600, saying \u201cThis bid includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the mortgage.\u201d To this the auctioneer assented. The purchaser paid $300, and received a deed. The appellant seeks to charge the executor with $1,600, instead of $300. But it is plain that everyone interested understood that in effect the highest bidder offered $300 for the right, title and interest of the deceased <em>(Tyndale </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>182 Mass. 534, 536), subject to a mortgage of $1,300. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 Mass. 97. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>118 Mass. 511. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Basley, </em>123 Mass. 396. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>277 Mass. 8. There was no legal error in the course adopted, although it is not to be commended.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\">The executor concedes that by a clerical error the amount of the inventory with which his first account began was less by $100 than the actual amount of the inventory. To cure this error, the balance shown in the second account is to be increased by $100. As thus modified the decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
