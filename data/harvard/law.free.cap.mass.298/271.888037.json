They were \u201cin distress and standing in need of immediate relief\u201d within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 117, \u00a7 14 (see now St. 1937, c. 113). The plaintiff furnished relief to them between December 4, 1931, and March 4, 1933, to the extent of $432.55, and seeks reimbursement, from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The only question is, whether the plaintiff must give credit for work worth $363.27, which Messier performed \u201cas directed\u201d by the welfare department of the plaintiff, without receiving any wages. Since the plaintiff received the work, it is immaterial whether Messier was bound to perform it as a condition of obtaining relief. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 117, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 17, 21. St. 1937, c. 113. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Church, </em>1 Pick. 23. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>14 Pick. 341. <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>186 Mass. 341. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pouliot, </em>292 Mass. 229. <em>Orlando </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>295 Mass. 205. <em>Auburn </em>v. <em>Farmington, </em>133 Maine, 213. The plaintiff contends that the purpose <em>of the </em>work was the rehabilitation of Messier and not at all the reduction of the expense of relief; and that the right to recover its \u201cexpense\u201d is statutory, and not subject to qualification on principles of fairness or of implied contract. It relies on cases holding that duties and rights arising out of the support of poor and indigent persons are wholly statutory. <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Hinsdale, </em>6 Mass. 501. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cornville, </em>12 Mass. 332. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Somerset, </em>14 Mass. 396. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Colerain, </em>9 Met. 492. <em>Marlborough </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>13 Met. 328. <em>Groveland </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>1 Allen, 23. <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>3 Allen, 515. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>145 Mass. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention seems to be foreclosed by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cisions of this court. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Church, </em>1 Pick. 23, 26, it was said, \u201cA town has undoubtedly a right to the services of a pauper to aid in his support.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>20 Pick. 267; <em>S. C. </em>4 Met. 35, it was held that a town must allow for labor received by it from poor and indigent persons whom the Commonwealth is bound to support, and can collect from the Commonwealth only the excess of the expense above the value of the labor received. Two more recent cases, in which a municipality sought to recover from the poor and indigent person himself the expense of his support, govern the present case in principle. The right to recover from him depends as exclusively upon the statute as does the right to recover from the city or town in which he has a settlement, and in either case what is recoverable is the \u201cexpense\u201d or \u201cexpenses\u201d of support. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 117, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 1, 14. St. 1882, c. 113. St. 1937, c. 125. <em>Groveland </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>1 Allen, 23. <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>3 Allen, 515. In <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>186 Mass. 341, the defendant, while an inmate of the plaintiff\u2019s almshouse, performed work there worth as much as the support furnished him. It was held that \u201cno expense is shown to have been incurred for his support for which there can be a recovery under this statute,\u201d although the defendant had no cause of action against the city for work and labor and could not maintain a declaration in set-off. See <em>Beverly Hospital </em>v. <em>Early, </em>292 Mass. 201. In <em>Millis </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>213 Mass. 350, a wife owning a small house was sued for her proportionate part of food and household supplies furnished to her family, consisting of herself, her feeble husband, her feeble-minded son, and her minor grandson. She was held entitled to allowance for the shelter and services furnished by her to the others, in determining the \u201cexpenses\u201d incurred by the plaintiff town in her support.
