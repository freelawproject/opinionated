Both roads lay wholly in Baltimore County. The defendant demurred to the declaration. The Court (Brows', J.,) overruled the demurrer, the only objection urged by the defendant being that the road, way or highway in the declaration mentioned, was not located or described with sufficient distinctness. At the trial of the case before the jury, Judge Stewart presided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\"><em>Exception. </em>\u2014 The evidence on both sides being closed,, the plaintiff asked the following instruction:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">If the jury find from the evidence, that the road in question had been used immemorially, as a common highway for all persons and carriages having occasion at all times to pass over the same, and that the defendant obstructed the same by building a fence in the bed of said road, whereby the plaintiff was prevented from using the same, for the proper and legitimate uses of his farm, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages as the jury, under all the circumstances, taking into view the motives of the parties as disclosed in the evidence, should think proper to allow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">The defendant offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">1. That the first count in the declaration is defective,, and the verdict must be for the defendant on said first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">2. That the jury, cannot find a verdict for the plaintiff,, unless they find from the evidence, that the owners of the land over which the road in question is claimed, surrendered their right in the same, and abandoned it to the public, without claiming any control over the same as owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\">3. That the jury cannot find a verdict for the plaintiff, unless they find from the evidence, that for twenty years without interruption, the public has used the whole extent of the road from Bird River, to the public highway lead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ing to Chase\u2019s Station, as mentioned in the declaration, adversely to the owners of the land over which the road runs, and without their consent, and in denial of their right to prevent such use by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">4. That the verdict must be for the defendant in this -case, because the action is local, and ought to have been brought in Baltimore County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">The Court (Stewart, J.,) gave the instruction prayed by the plaintiff; and the plaintiff conceded the first prayer of the defendant; the Court granted the third prayer of the defendant, but refused his second and fourth prayers. The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b542-7\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C. J., Yellott, \u2022Stone, Miller, and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-8\"><em>William 8. Bryan, Jr., </em>and <em>John T.

This was necessary in order that the sheriff might summon as jurors, persons from the immediate neighborhood, who were presumed to be acquainted with the nature of the transaction, which they were called upon to try, and who were liable to be attainted, if they rendered a wrong verdict. This was soon found, however, to be extremely inconvenient, especially in mixed transactions which might happen partly in one place, and partly in another, and hence, arose the distinction between <em>local </em>and <em>transitory </em>actions. If the cause of action could only have arisen in a particular place, the action is local, and the suit must be brought in the county or place in which it arose. Actions for damages to real property, actions on the case for nuisances, or for the obstruction of one\u2019s right of way are according to all the authorities <em>local.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On the other hand, actions for injuries to the person, or to personal property, actions on contracts, and in fact all actions founded on transactions, which might have taken place anywhere, are transitory. <em>Mostyn vs. Fabrigas, Cowp., 161; Mayor, &amp;c., of Berwick vs. Ewart, </em>2 <em>W. Black., </em>1036; <em>Com. Dig. Action N., </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Where the action is local, and the suit is brought in another place, the proper mode of taking advantage of the defect is by demurrer, and unless the defendant demurs, the defect will be cured by the Statute of Jeofails, 16 <em>&amp; </em>17 Car. II. This was decided in <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of </em>London <em>vs. Cole, </em>7 <em>T. R., </em>588, in which Grose, J., said: \u201c I admit that where an action of covenant is brought on a privity of estate, and not of contract, the action must be brought in the county where the land lies; if it be not brought there, the defendant must take advantage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>it before verdict, otherwise the defect is cured by the Stat. Car. II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">And again in <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Berwick vs. Ewart, </em>2 <em>W. Black., </em>1070, where the cause of action arose in Berwickupon-Tweed, and the venue was laid in Middlesex, to which the defendant filed a general demurrer, De Grey, Chief Justice, said: \u201cIt is admitted that actions properly local must be laid in the p'roper counties; otherwise it is-ground of demurrer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The distinction between local and transitory actions still exists in this State. Sec. 87 of Art. 75, in part codified from the Acts of 1801, ch. 74, and 1787, ch. 87, provides, it is true, that no one shall he sued out of the county in which he resides, unless he has been returned <em>non est </em>on a summons issued in that county, provided that the section shall not apply to ejectment, dower, &amp;c. This latter clause, however, does not include all the actions excepted from the operation of the section. This is evident from, section 88, which provides that in trespass on real property, if the party committing the same, shall remove from the county where such property may lie,- or cannot be found in such county, he may he sued in any county where he may be found, &amp;c. <em>Patterson vs. Wilson, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>499. An action for obstructing a way or highway being local,, the suit must he brought in the county where the road lies, and the demurrer ought to have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">It was further argued in support of the demurrer that the first count was had, because the private way was not described with sufficient certainty. Now what is the description ? The plaintiff alleges he was seized of a tract of land situate in the Twelfth Election District of Baltimore County, called \u201c Part of Arthur\u2019s Choice,\u201d and was entitled to a way from said \u201cland, over a road adjoining the same, and running to the highway which leads from Chase\u2019s Station to the Philadelphia road, near the twelve mile stone of the county.\u201d The <em>termini a quo </em>and <em>ad qv,em </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>are distinctly stated, and the count is in every respect substantially the one to he found in <em>Bullen &amp; Leake\u2019s Pre</em>cedents, 429, and is, according to the authorities, a sufficient description of the way obstructed. <em>Simpson vs. Lewthwaite, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; Adol., </em>220; <em>Gale on Easements, </em>61.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The second count for obstructing a highway is defective, because it does not set forth such special damage, as will entitle the plaintiff to maintain an action. The only damage complained of is, that the plaintiff is obliged in consequence of the obstruction to use a longer and more circuitous road in going to the post-office, markets, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">Sow it is well settled, that one cannot maintain an action for obstructing a highway, unless he has suffered special damage, different not merely in <em>degree </em>hut different in <em>kind </em>from that suffered by the community at large. And for two reasons: An obstruction of a highway is an offence for which an indictment will lie; and the remedy ordinarily is by indictment; and secondly, to allow every one to sue for such obstruction would lead to endless litigation. Fineux <em>vs. Hovenden, Croke Eliz., </em>664; <em>Hart vs. Bassett, Carth., </em>156; <em>Ireson vs. Moore, </em>1 <em>Ld. Raym., </em>486; <em>Rose vs. Miles, </em>4 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>101.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The second count in this case does not differ in any respect from the declaration in <em>Houck vs. Wachter, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>272, in which the Court said: \u201cAll the authorities agree that to support the action, the damage must be different not merely in degree, but,different in kind from that suffered in common, hence it has been well settled that though the plaintiff may suffer more inconvenience than others from the obstruction, by reason of his proximity to the highway, that will not entitle him to maintain an action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The question as to the nature and character of the special damage necessary to support an action of this kind was fully considered in <em>Wilkes vs. Hungerford Market Co., </em>2 <em>Bing. N. C., </em>281. There the plaintiff, a bookseller, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>a shop by the side of a highway, which was obstructed by the defendant, and the declaration alleged that in consequence of such obstruction the plaintiff had suffered loss in his trade and business.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AzT\">(Decided 26th March, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Tindal, C. J., said: \u201cThe plaintiff in addition to a right of way which he enjoyed in common with others,, had a shop on the roadside, the business of which was supported by those who passed; all who passed had the right of way; but all had not shops. * * * In <em>Baker vs. Moore </em>the refusal of the plaintiff\u2019s tenants to remain on the premises was considered damage sufficiently peculiar and private to entitle the plaintiff to sue the defendant for having erected a wall across a common way used by the tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The special damage sustained by the plaintiff in <em>Wilkes\u2019 Case </em>was the loss in his trade and business occasioned by the obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">There is no special damage alleged in the second count of the declaration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The injury of which the plaintiff complains, that he was obliged to use a longer and more circuitous way, &amp;c., is one which he sustains in common with every other person who may be obliged to use the road. It is not an injury different from that suffered by the community at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The cause of action set forth in the first count being a local one, namely, the obstruction of a private right of way lying in Baltimore County, the suit ought to have been brought in that county and not in Baltimore City. For these reasons the Court erred in overruling the demurrer, and we must therefore reverse the judgment without awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>without awarding a netv trial.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
