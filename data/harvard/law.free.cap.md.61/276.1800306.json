The label of the complainants used when their bill was filed, stated that the bitters is prepared by Dr. S. \u2014 that it was prepared at Angostura, but is now prepared at Port of Spain. Dr. S.. \u25a0 died some years before the bill was filed by his successors in the-business, and he never lived at Port of Spain.

This principle was established in <em>Frese vs. Bachof, </em>(reported in 13 <em>U. S. Pat.

A trade-mark is a \u201c technical commercial emblem,\u201d \u201c nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>more nor less than one\u2019s commercial signature to his goods,\u201d and the right to it is perfected \u201conly when the owner stamps the symbol upon an article of merchandise which he desires to sell.\u201d <em>Browne on Trade-marks, secs. </em>127-130, also, <em>sec. </em>143; <em>Shaw Stocking Co. vs. Mack, </em>12 <em>Fed.

St. Rep., </em>467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">The principle, contended for by the complainants, that a mere geographical name can be exclusively appropriated as a trade-mark, finds no sanction in the cases cited to sustain it. They only hold that the use may be good as against a wrong-doer, who attempts, by fraudulent means, to divert custom from its legitimate channel. This is shown whereArer Courts have occasion to discuss some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>unguarded expressions dropped in such cases as those of <em>Newman vs. Alvord; McAndrews vs. Bassett, </em>and <em>Seixo vs. Provezende; Canal Co. vs. Clarke, </em>13 <em>Wall., </em>325; <em>Browne on Trade-marks, secs. </em>182, 184.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">The fact, therefore, if it he a fact, that Dr. Siegert made bitters in the town of Angostura, gives him no monopoly of that town or its name as against one who can use it truthfully. He has no patent or exclusive right to compound ingredients and give them that name, and, if it rightfully b\u00e9longs to the compound, restrain any one else who produces the same compound from giving it the same name. Any body else, anywhere in the world, has a right to make the same article, and to sell it under the same name. Again; if the name be used to indicate the origin of the merchandise, any person producing merchandise having the same origin has a right so to indicate in its name. The first user could only claim it as against those who would seek to deceive the public by its use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">In this case, there is no evidence of any wish or intention to practice any deception upon any one. The answer avers, and the evidence fully sustains it, that the name used by the defendants was applied to the goods made by them before they had any knowledge that there was any article in the public market, or known to the public, bearing the name of \u201cAngostura Bitters,\u201d or any person in existence bearing the name of \u201c Siegert.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">\u201cAngostura bark\u201d was an article that had been known to the medical profession and to the pharmacopoeia as a valuable bitter and tonic for three-quarters of a century at least. That medicinal simple, the defendant, or those under whom he holds, had a right to use ; and if they so used it that it was the leading characteristic of the article manufactured therefrom, they had a right to give it its true name, derived from, or descriptive of, its composition and properties. See <em>Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th Ed., Art. Angostura; Osgood vs. Allen, </em>6 <em>Am. L. Times, </em>20; <em>Cheavin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>vs. Walker, L. R., </em>5 <em>Ch. Div., </em>862-3; <em>Raggett vs. Findlater, L.

Rep., </em>214; <em>Manufacturing Co. vs. Trainer, </em>11 <em>Otto, </em>101 <em>U. S., </em>54; 58 <em>N. Y., </em>234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">But not only had Dr. Siegert no right to monopolize the use of the word \u201cAngostura\u201d as applied to bitters, he never attempted to do so. He never claimed a right to do so. He never called his bitters \u201cAngostura Bitters \u201d \u2022at all. During all the time of his making of bitters he always called his article \u201cAromatic Bitters,\u201d and never \u201cAngostura Bitters.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">But if Dr. Siegert had a right to tire exclusive use of the name \u201cAngostura Bitters,\u201d and it had \u201cdevolved\u201d upon the complainants, still the label, or wrapper, which they seek to have protected, bristles all over with misrepresentations \u2014 is itself a palpable fraud \u2014 and forfeits \u2022any and all right that they might otherwise have to relief from a Court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-9\">This label or wrapper, in which the name \u201c Angostura Bitters\u201d was for the first time used by any of th\u00e9 Siegert race, and which they now seek to have a Court of equity protect, was adopted by them in the year 1875 \u2014 after they had removed from the place that had once borne the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Angostura, and ceased to have any connection with it,- \u2014 . twenty-nine years after there ceased (as they allege) to he any such place as Angostura, and five years after the death of Dr. Siegert. And yet in every wrapper used hy them since that time, they announce, in all the languages, that figure on it, that it is \u201cAromatic Bitters, or Angostura Bitters, <em>prepared by Dr. Siegert,\u201d </em>&amp;c. They nowhere say or suggest, or hint that the skill and care and experience with which the original discoverer of the article compounded it, are no longer used in its manufacture, hut it is made hy. entirely different persons. Their doing so would he the exact truth, but it would advertise the public that, the skill and care in which they confided in Dr. Siegert is no longer employed in the manufacture of the goods, and so they conceal that fact from the public, endeavor to extend their trade by falsely asserting that what they offer to sell was \u201c prepared by Dr. Siegert,\u201d and then ask a Court of equity to sustain them in so doing. <em>Partridge </em>vs. <em>Menck, </em>1 <em>How.

Dr. Siegert never called the article made by him \u201cAngostura Bitters.\u201d During all his life he called it \u201c Aromatic Bitters,\u201d and labeled it with that name, advertising it as prepared by him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>self at \u201cAngostura.\u201d For five years after his death these-complainants labeled their article in the same way, and specifically claimed the name <em>\u201c </em>Aromatic Bitters\u201d as their trade-mark, and even prosecuted a competitor in the trade in 1874, for infringing their trade-mark by using the name \u201cAromatic Bitters.\u201d <em>Siegert vs. Ehlers, Cox\u2019s Manual of Trade-mark Cases, </em>243.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b313-4\">Irving, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The bill in this case was filed by Carlos D. Siegert and others to prevent, by injunction, Cornelius W. Abbott and Cornelius F. Abbott from imitating the complainants\u2019 trademark and labels, in which they wrapped the bottles of their bitters popularly called \u201cAngostura Bitters,\u201d by putting up a compound represented to have similar properties and virtues, in labels so much like those of the complainants, as to be a palpable simulation of them, by which the-public was likely to be, and was, deceived into buying the defendants\u2019 preparation as and for that of the complainants. The bill also prayed for an account of profits from the sales made by the defendants in that way. The Circuit. Court enjoined one of the defendants, Cornelius W. Abbott, and his agents and employes, and forbade him and them to use the labels described in the proof as used by them ; but the bill was dismissed as to Cornelius F. Abbott, and no account of profits was decreed. The complainants appealed because Cornelius F. Abbott was not <em>eo nomine </em>enjoined, and also because an accounting was. not decreed. The defendant, Cornelius W. Abbott appealed because any relief was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">A motion has been made to dismiss the complainants\u2019 appeal, on the alleged ground, that they have estopped themselves from prosecuting the same, by taking proceedings, after decree granting partial relief and awarding them costs, to enforce the payment of the costs. The whole case being open for review on the appeal of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>fendant in the suit, and, on careful consideration being of \u25a0opinion that there was error in the decree, and that the bill ought to have been dismissed, we have found the motion unimportant, and have not considered the legal question it raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">It is a general rule of law, in cases of this hind, that Courts of equity will not interfere by injunction where there is any lack of truth in the plaintiff\u2019s case ; that is, where there is any misrepresentation in his trade-mark or labels. <em>Browne on Trade-marks, sec. 71, and sec. </em>474, <em>et seq. </em>The respondents invoke the application of this rule to the complainants\u2019 case, as made, which they contend contains a misrepresentation on the face of the label at its very beginning. The heading of the label, as used when the bill was filed, is in three different languages, but the translation of the Spanish and German is the same as the English, which reads \u201cAromatic Bitters, or Angostura Bitters, prepared by Dr. Siegert, at Angostura, now Port of Spain, Trindad.\u201d Here is, certainly, a statement that the article is prepared by Dr. Siegert; that it was prepared at Angostura, but is now prepared at Port of Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It is a conceded fact that Dr. Siegert died in 1810. The bill so charges. He never lived at Port of Spain. The complainants, his sons and successors in business, removed to Port of Spain several years after his death. One of the complainants was associated with Dr. Siegert in the business as his partner, and alleges that, as survivor, he succeeded to the business; and subsequently he associated his brothers, the other complainants, with him as partners in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A late case in the Supreme Court of the United States, <em>(Manhattan Medicine Co. vs. Wood, </em>108 <em>U. S., </em>218,) decided in April, 1883, since the decision of the learned Court from which this appeal was taken, seems to be conclusive against the right of the complainants to the relief asked. There the complainants sold a medicine, put up in glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>bottles with panel shaped sides, on five of which, in raised letters, the words \u201cAtwood\u2019s Genuine Physical Jaundice-Bitters, Georgetown, Mass.\u201d are blown in the glass. Twenty-five years ago the medicine was manufactured by Moses Atwood in Georgetown, Massachusetts, and was-sold by his agents throughout the United States. The complainant in the suit was a corporation under the laws, of New York, to which, by successive mesne assignments, the sole right to use the receipt and manufacture the compound had passed; and that right was being exercised in New York City, when a bill was filed against one <em>Wood </em>for using- their trade-mark and labels, or simulating them, for a medicine manufactured by <em>Wood </em>in Portland, Maine.. The Court says, that Dr. Atwood sold his \u201c Atwood\u2019s Vegetable Jaundice Bitters \u201d with this designation, that it was-manufactured by him. \u201cAs the medicine was tried and proved to be useful, it was sought for under that designation, and that purchasers might not be misled, it was always accompanied with, a label showing by whom and at what place it was prepared. These statements were deemed important in promoting the use of the article and its sale, or they would not have been continued by the assignees of the original inventor. And yet they could not be used with any honest purpose when both statements had ceased to be true. It is not honest to state that a medicine is manufactured by Moses Atwood, of Georgetown, Massachusetts, when it is manufactured by the Manhattan Medicine Company in the City of New York.\u201d The Court-further says : \u201cThe object of the trade-mark being to indicate, by its meaning or association, the origin or ownership of the article, it would seem that when a right to its use is transferred to others, either by act of the original manufacturer or by operation of law, the fact of the transfer should be stated in connection with its use ; otherwise a deception would he practised upon the public and the very fraud accomplished, to prevent which Courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>equity interfere to protect the exclusive right of the original manufacturer.\u201d Because of these untruthful statements the Supreme Court held that the complainants were not entitled to the aid of a Court of equity, and relief was denied. Numerous cases were cited hy the Court in support of the law as laid down by them, among which are <em>The Leather Cloth Company vs. The American Leather Cloth Company, </em>4 <em>DeG., J. &amp; S., </em>137, and 11 <em>Clark H. L., Cases, </em>523; <em>Pidding vs. How, </em>8 <em>Sim., </em>477, <em>and Perry vs. Truefitt, </em>6 <em>Beav., </em>66.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">A more exactly analogous case can hardly he imagined. It is true a removal from \u201cAngostura\u201d or \u201cCiudad Bolivar\u201d to \u201cPort of Spain,\u201d is noted in the label; but it is \u2022so noted as to leave the impression that Dr. Siegert, the inventor and original manufacturer, had so removed and was continuing his manufacture at \u201cPort of Spain.\u201d Although Dr. Siegert died in 1870, and anew firm was compounding the bitters at a place where he never did live \u2022and compound them, when the simulation by defendants was begun and committed, no intimation is to he found in the label that he is dead, and that complainants as his legal successors are conducting the business under his name and signature, a <em>fac simile </em>of whose signature is preserved on the label. It should be remarked, that in the note of warning against counterfeits, at the left hand of the label, it is stated the bottles hear the complainants\u2019 signature, which inspection shows to be not theirs, hut the original inventors. We are unable to distinguish this case from the Manhattan Medicine Company case, from the \u25a0opinion in which we have quoted, and which we think it proper to follow in a case of this nature, in the absence of a statute of the State controlling the subject. The complainants have relied on <em>Siegert vs. Findlater, </em>26 <em>Weekly Reporter, </em>459, wherein the present complainants after the death of their father, were awarded injunction hy Justice Put in England. The same point respecting misrepresen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tation seems to have been made in that case, and to have been made in the pleading ; but just how it was pleaded does not appear. The learned Judge however, overrules the objection, but his reasoning is most unsatisfactory. We do not see how the misrepresentation of the fact that Dr. Siegert is personally compounding these bitters is announced and explained by the statement that he has removed to Port of Spain in the Island of Trinidad. The point is treated, in that case, as if the misrepresentation was solely of the place of manufacture, which, in fact, is the most harmless part of the misrepresentation. Upon that question we cannot regard the <em>Findlater </em>decisionas of sufficient authority to control the case as now presented to us. In the case of <em>Robertson vs. Berry &amp; Co., 50 Md., </em>591, wherein the property right of a publisher to the title and name of his work, is recognized in analogy to the law of trade-marks, and relief was granted against imitation, the point, on which we dispose of this case, did not arise, and the case is distinguishable from this. This decision therefore is not intended to depart from any of the principles therein established.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Asv\">(Decided 7th February, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Eor the reasons we have assigned, the decree in this cause must be reversed and the bill of complaint must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Decree </em>reversed, <em>and bill dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
