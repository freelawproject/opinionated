The defendant offered to prove, and the plaintiff admitted, that when the action which is the subject of this reference was commenced, the suits on which said goods were attached were not disposed of, but were pending in court; and the defendant thereupon objected, that this action was prematurely brought and \\ could not be maintained. The subscriber deemed this objection groundless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">\u201c The defendant then gave in evidence the following mortgage to him, which was recorded by the clerk of the town of Medway, on the 7th of September 1842: 1 Know all men by these presents, that I, Addison Richardson, of Medway, in the county of Norfolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in consideration of two thousand dollars, to me in hand paid by Lewis Richardson, of said Medway, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, do hereby bargain and sell unto the said Lewis the following personal property, viz. the whole stock in trade of said Addison, as well as each and every article of merchandize which the sai 1 Addison this day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>bought of Timothy Walker, being in a store formerly kept by said Walker in said Medway, as every other article constituting the said Addison\u2019s stock in trade, in the shape the same is and may become in the usual course of the said Addison\u2019s trade and business as a trader. To have and to hold the same to the said Lewis, as his own proper goods and chattels. The condition of the above sale is this : If the said Addison pay the said Lewis a note of hand, this day given by him, for two thousand dollars, and interest thereon, then this shall be void; otherwise, to remain in full force. In witness whereof I the said Addison have set my hand and seal this seventh day of October, A. D. 1840. Addison Richardson.\u2019 (seal.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">\u201c It was stated by the plaintiff and admitted by the defendant, that the goods, which are the subject of this reference, were formerly the stock in trade of said Addison Richardson, but that only a part of them was owned by him until after he made said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">\u201c The plaintiff did not deny that the note of two thousand dollars mentioned in said mortgage was justly due from said Addison to the said Lewis, and was wholly unpaid. But the plaintiff insisted that said mortgage was, on the face of it, fraudulent, and wholly void as against other creditors of said Addison, or, if not wholly void, that it was void as to all the goods which were not a part of said Addison\u2019s stock in trade when the mortgage was executed. The defendant thereupon offered to introduce evidence that he had taken possession of all the goods, which are the subject of this reference, before they were attached by the plaintiff, for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage. But the subscriber, deeming such evidence irrelevant, refused to receive it. He also was of opinion that the mortgage was valid as to all the goods which were attached by the plaintiff. The defendant then proposed to give evidence that the true value of the goods which were attached was much less than fifteen hundred dollars; but the subscriber, being of opinion that the defendant was answer able to the plaintiff, if at all, f\u00f3r the sum at which the goods were estimated in the defendant\u2019s receipt, refused to receive such evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>\u201c </em>The defendant next insisted, that by the true construction of the defendant\u2019s receipt, taken in connexion with' said mortgage, the plaintiff attached only so much of the mortgaged property as should be found to remain after payment therefrom of the debt for which it was mortgaged, to wit, the mortgagor\u2019s right in equity to redeem said property. But the subscriber was of opinion, that the plaintiff neither did nor could make such an attachment, and that the whole property in said goods was attached by him, and was included in the receipt given to him by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">\u201c The defendant then gave in evidence a written demand, delivered by him to the plaintiff, after said attachment was made and said receipt given, but on the same day, of the following tenor : \u2018 Be it known to you that I, the subscriber,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">have a mortgage on the goods and property which Addison Richardson has put in my keeping, to the amount of two thousand dollars and interest.

The subscriber was of opinion that the defendant was entitled by law to defend this action under his mortgage, and that the said demand, made on the plaintiff by the defendant, was good and sufficient, at least for the sum of two thousand dollars, which exceeds the value of the goods attached, as estimated by the parties. The subscriber, therefore, on the foregoing statement, is of opinion, and accordingly awards, subject to the opinion of the court to which this award is returnable, that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant, and that the defendant recover of the plaintiff costs of court, to be taxed by the court, and also the costs of reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">Theron Metcalf.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-10\"><em>G.

The case of <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Parkman, </em>2 Met. 258, which may be cited for the defendant, was between the mortgagor and the assignee of the mortgagee, under the insolvent law, and does not apply to the present case; and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Huggeford, </em>3 Met. 515, was decided on the authority of <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Parkman. </em>In neither case was the distinction taken between mortgagees and creditors, and mortgagees and assignees of mortgagors. See <em>Wood v. </em>Lowry, 17 Wend. 492. <em>Divver </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>2 Wend. 600.

The case of <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>14 Pick. 497, contains some <em>obiter dicta </em>on which the defendant will rely. That was a case between mortgagor and mortgagee, and the question whether the mortgage was void as to creditors was not made. In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>2 Story R. 630, which will be pressed by the defendant, the question was between the mortgagee and the mortgagor\u2019s assignees in bankruptcy; and the decision was made on the ground of an equitable lien.

The case of <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Met. 117, was a mortgage of perishable property, and was obviously intended to hinder creditors. When subsequently acquired goods are the proceeds of those that are mortgaged, as by shifting, &amp;c. they are covered by a mortgage specially including them. But it is otherwise, when subsequently acquired property cannot proceed from, or be substituted for, that which is mortgaged. This distinction reconciles all the decisions of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-5\">This case is analogous to that of a covenant to leave manure on leased land, at the end of the term ; and to the hypothecation of a cargo of oil to be procured; and to an insurance of goods, though constantly shifting.

In pursuance of this reference, a hearing of the parties has been had before the arbitrator, and the case comes before us on his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">At the hearing, it appeared in evidence, that the plaintiff claimed the property in question between the parties, by virtue of an attachment thereof as the property of one Addison Richardson, and that the defendant claimed the same under a mortgage to him from the said Addison, made and recorded before the said attachment; and the principal question submitted to the court by the arbitrator is, whether the said mortgage is valid against the creditors of the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The property mortgaged is thus described in the deed: \u201c The whole stock in trade of said Addison, as well as each and every article of merchandize which the said Addison this day bought of Timothy Walker, as every other article constituting the said Addison\u2019s stock in trade, in the shape the same is and <em>may become </em>in the usual course of the said Addison\u2019s trade and business as a trader.\u201d And it was admitted that the goods in question were, at the time of the attachment, the stock in trade of the said Addison, but that only a part of them was owned by him until after he made the said mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">It has been contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the mortgage was in law fraudulent and void against <em>bona fide </em>attaching creditors; or if not wholly void, that it was void as to all the goods which were not a part of the mortgagor\u2019s stock in trade when the mortgage was executed. There seems to us to be no ground for the argument that this mortgage was wholly void, as being fraudulent on the face of it, or as having been made with an intent to defraud the creditors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>mortgagor. It was not denied that the mortgage was given to secure a large debt due from the mortgagor to the mortgagee ; and no evidence was introduced at the hearing, tending to prove that the mortgage was not made <em>bond fide. </em>The question therefore is reduced to this, namely, whether the defendant has acquired any valid title, under the mortgage, to the goods purchased by the mortgagor subsequently to the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">That a person cannot grant or mortgage property,, of which he is not possessed, and to which he has no title, is a maxim of the law too plain to need illustration, and which is fully supported by all the authorities. Perkins, \u00a7 65, says, it is a common learning in the law, that a man cannot grant or charge that which he hath not. Bac. Ab. Grants, D. 2. Com. Dig. Grant, D. It is true that a person may grant personal property of which he is potentially, though not actually possessed. A man may therefore grant all the wool that shall grow on the sheep which he owns at the time of the grant, but not the wool which shall grow on sheep not his, but which he after-wards may buy. So a parson of a church may grant his ithes for years, for although they are not actually in him at the time, yet they are potentially; and the same exception to the general rule extends to grants of crops growing on lands of the grantors, at the time of the grants. <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>1 Man. Grang. &amp; Scott, 383, and the authorities there cited. Not denying these principles, the defendant\u2019s counsel contend, that although the mortgagor could not convey or create a charge on property to which he had no title nor possession, actual or potential, yet when he, after the mortgage, added to his stock in trade by new purchases, the property vested immediately in the mortgagee, without any other act or conveyance on the part of the mortgagor, by virtue of the previous agreement to that effect contained in the mortgage deed. One of the cases cited in support of this argument is <em>Mitchell </em>v. Winslow, 2 Story R. 630. But that case was decided on principles of equity, and on the construction of the United States bankrupt act of 1841, <em>c. </em>9, on which it was held \u201c that (except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>in cases of fraud) assignees in bankruptcy take only such rights and interests as the bankrupt himself had, and could himself claim and assert at the time of his bankruptcy; and consequently that they are affected with all the equities which would affect the bankrupt himself, if he were asserting those rights and interests.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>It is material here to state,\u201d says the learned judge, in giving his opinion, \u201c that the present is not a controversy between a first and second mortgagee as to property acquired and <em>in esse </em>after the execution of the first mortgage, and before the execution of the second mortgage, both the mortgagees being purchasers for a valuable consideration. That might at law present a very different question.\u201d The decision, therefore, in that case, is of no authority in favor of the defendant in the present cas\u00e9, but seems' rather to be an authority impliedly in favor of the plaintiff, who claims under an attachment by a <em>bona, fide </em>creditor of Addison Richardson, the mortgagor. The same remark may be made as to the case of <em>Fletcher </em>v. Morey, 2 Story R. 555. That was a case' in equity, in which the plaintiffs relied on an equitable lien on certain shipments, and the proceeds thereof, in the hands' of the defendant, the assignee of James Read &amp; Co., as col-' lateral security for advances made to them by the plaintiffs. And this lien was adjudged valid, as an equitable charge on the property, constituting a trust. But these decisions have but little bearing on the question under consideration. Many things are held by courts of equity to be assignable which are not so held by courts of law. So the legal distinctions between executory and executed contracts are, in many cases, disregarded by courts of equity. But the present case is to be decided according to the principles of the common law. The question is, what are the legal rights of the respective parties to the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">One of the principal cases, relied on by the defendant is that of <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>14 Pick. 497. In that case, it appeared that Hunting &amp; Lawrence Were lessees of a brick yard, and entered into a contract with Joseph Evans, by which he was to make for them a certain number of bricks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>on certain terms, and to share the profit or loss betweeh them, one half each ; Evans agreeing that Hunting &amp; Lawrence should have .full power to retain Evans\u2019s part of the bricks or money, to the amount of all sums of money due, or which might become due from him to them. Hunting &amp; Lawrence afterwards assigned to the plaintiffs all their property, including the brick yard, and their rights under the contract with Evans, to which Evans assented, and agreed to act as agent for the assignees. This, unquestionably, was a good assignment, upon the principles already stated. Hunting &amp; Lawrence not only had a potential possession, but they owned the clay of which the bricks were to be made, .subject only to the right which Evans might afterwards acquire by his contract. The transmutation of the clay into bricks did not change the right of property; so that Evans coma not acquire an absolute legal title to his share of the bricks until he paid the balance due to the plaintiffs. Upon this view of the case, the question as to the right which might be acquired by the pledging or hypothecation of property was not material to the decision of the case. But if it &gt;ere otherwise, the doctrine laid down by the learned judge, ivho delivered the opinion of the court in that case, is not applicable to' the present case. For if, when a party agrees to pledge property afterwards to be acquired, and, when it is acquired, delivers over the same to the pledgee, the right of the pledgee would then attach, it does not follow that the same doctrine would apply to a mortgage or sale. A mortgage is an executed contract; and it is clear that nothing passed by the mortgage deed, in this case, besides the stock in trade which the mortgagor had at the time the mortgage was executed. But in <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Goodwin, 7 </em>Shepley, 408, it was held, that where certain goods were mortgaged, and the mortgagor afterwards exchanged some of the goods mortgaged for other goods, the mortgagee thereby acquired a title to the goods taken in exchange. And the case of <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Parker </em>rvas cited by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court, as a strong case in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>this decision, without noticing the distinction between the two cases. We cannot, however, concur in the principles upon which the case of <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Goodwin </em>was decided. It was laid down in that case, that \u201c all persons coming in under the mortgagor stand by substitution in his place, equally affected by the contract, whether notified of its existence or not.\u201d But the defendant in that case had attached the property as the property of the mortgagor; and though he claimed under him, he might show that the mortgage and the exchange of property were void as to the creditors of the mortgagor, though they might be valid against him by way of estoppel or otherwise. And that case seems to be impliedly, though not expressly, overruled by the case of <em>Goodenow </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>8 Shepley, 86. And we fully concur with Whitman, C. J. in the principles laid down by him in deciding the latter case. In the former case, the mortgage deed had no reference to any property afterwards to be acquired by the mortgagor; and the case seems to have been decided on the assumed fact that the property mortgaged was afterwards exchanged for the property in dispute, with the assent of the mortgagee ; but it does not appear that the exchange was made with his assent, or that there was any agreement to this between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. In the case of <em>Tapfield </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>6 Man. &amp; Grang. 245, the construction and legal effect of a similar mortgage were considered; and it was decided, that the mortgagee had no title to any property acquired by the mortgagor subsequently to the date of the mortgage. There was a clause in the mortgage, giving power to the mortgagee, upon non-payment of the debt, to enter into the mortgaged premises, and \u201c to take, possess, hold and enjoy all and every the goods, chattels, effects and premises.\u201d And it was held that the mortgagee had no right to take any property but what was on the mortgaged premises at the date of the mortgage. It was however said by Tindal, C. J. that \u201c it would have been very easy so to have framed the power of entry as to make it extend to all effects found upon the premises at the time tha; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>such power should be enforced, if such was the intention of the parties.\u201d From this the defendant\u2019s counsel infer that such a power would have been upheld by the court. And it would, undoubtedly, have been a good defence in that action, if the mortgage had contained such a power ; for it was an action of trespass by the mortgagor against the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">But although the mortgagee, with such a power, would be justified in seizing the goods of the mortgagor, purchased by him subsequently to the date of the mortgage, it would not vest the property in the mortgagee. And so it was decided in the case of <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>1 Man. Grang. &amp; Scott, 379, which afterwards came before the same court, and was decided in February 1845. The plaintiff in that case had a bill of sale from the defendant of \u201c all and singular- his goods, household furniture, plate, linen, china, stock and implements of trade, and other effects whatsoever, then remaining and being, or which should, at any time thereafter, remain and be in, upon or about his dwelling-house,\u201d &amp;c. And it was held that future acquired property would not pass by such a conveyance, unless the grantor should ratify the grant after he had acquired the property therein. The counsel for the defendant relied) among other authorities, on Bacon\u2019s Maxims, Reg. 14. <em>Licet dispositio de interesse futuro sit inutilis, tamen potest fieri declaratio prcecedens, qua, sortiatur effectwm, interveniente novo actu. </em>A strong case in support of the rule is cited by Bacon. <em>\u201c </em>If I mortgage land, and after covenant with I. S., in consideration of money which I receive of him, that after I have entered for the condition broken, I will stand seized to the use of the same I. S., and I enter, and this deed is enrolled, and all within the six months, yet nothing passeth; because the enrolment is no new act, but a perfective ceremony of the first deed of bargain and sale; and the law is more strong in that case, because of the vehement relation which the enrolment hath to the time of the bargain and sale, at what time he had nothing but a naked condition.\u201d 4 Bacon\u2019s Works, (ed, of 1803,) 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>It was contended on the part of the plaintiff, in <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>that the bringing of the goods on the plaintiff\u2019s premises, where they were seized after the execution of the bill of sale, was the new act done by the plaintiff, which gave the declaration contained in the previous bill of sale its effect. But the court held clearly that it could have no such effect. \u201c The new act,\u201d Lord Tindal said, \u201c which Bacon relies upon, appears, in all the instances which he puts, to be an act done by the grantor, for the avowed object and with the view of carrying the former grant or disposition into effect.\u201d This adjudication, which appears to us to be founded on well established principles, is decisive against the defendant\u2019s claim as to the property purchased by the mortgagor after the mortgage. He did not prove, nor offer <em>, </em>to prove, any act done by the mortgagor, after the mortgage deed was executed, by which he ratified the same as to the subsequently acquired property. All he offered to prove was, that he had taken possession of the goods before the attachment. But this evidently was irrelevant, as it was held to be by the arbitrator. But if he had proved that the mortgagor had delivered possession to him of the goods in question, to hold the same under the mortgage, that would not have availed him against the plaintiff, although it might be good against the mortgagor. By the Rev. Sts. c. 74, \u00a7 5, it is provided that \u201cno mortgage of personal property shall be valid against any other person than the parties thereto, unless possession of the mortgaged property be delivered to, and retained by, the mortgagee, or unless the mortgage be recorded by the clerk of \"the town where the mortgagor resides.\u201d Now it is clear, we think, that the record of the mortgage deed is no sufficient notice of a legal incumbrance as to subsequently acquired property ; because, by law, no such property could be sold or conveyed thereby; and it would furnish no notice that any property would be afterwards purchased, or, if purchased, that any act would be done to ratify the grant in that respect. As to such property, therefore, the mortgage could not be valid, except as between the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>thereto, unless such goods were delivered by the mortgagor to the mortgagee, with the intention to ratify the mortgage, and the mortgagee retained open possession of the same until the time of the attachment. Whether such proof would be sufficient against creditors, it is not necessary to decide ; as, according to the report of the arbitrator, no such question has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As to the other questions raised, we think the decisions of the arbitrator were correct, and that upon the whole matter the plaintiff is entitled to recover the estimated value of the goods in question, which were not the property of the mortgagor when the mortgage was executed, and no more. The case, therefore, is to be recommitted to the arbitrator, to ascertain what goods were mortgaged; unless the parties should agree as to this matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
