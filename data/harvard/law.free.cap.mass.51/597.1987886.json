To William Foster, Esq., Boston.\u201d There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>also the money counts, and a count for three per cent, damages, on the statutes. The writ was made returnable to the court of common pleas, and the action was removed into the supreme judicial court on the affidavit of the defendant, pursuant to <em>St. </em>1840, c. 87, &lt;\u00a7\u00bb 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">At the trial before <em>Shaw, </em>C. J. it appeared that the defendant accepted the said bill on presentment, and wrote on the face of it, \u201c accepted. William Foster,\u201d and that the bill was protested for non-payment. It also appeared that the bill was drawn in the State of Maine; that the drawer and the plaintiff were then, and have ever since been, citizens of that State; and that the defendant then was, and now is, a citizen of the State of Massachusetts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">It appeared that it is enacted by the Rev. Sts. of Maine, <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 110, that when an action is brought on a bill of exchange, drawn or indorsed in that State, and payable out o\u00ed the State, but within the United States, and protested for nonacceptance or non-payment, the holder, in an action against the acceptor, drawer or indorser, shall recover not only the contents of the bill and interest, but, in addition thereto, shall recover damages, at the rate of three per cent, on the amount of the bill, if it be payable in either of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">It was in evidence that, after the commencement of the action, the defendant presented his petition, and was declared an insolvent debtor, under the provisions of <em>St. </em>1838, c. 163, and the statutes in addition thereto, and that, on the 17th of October 1844, a certificate of discharge from all his debts was granted to him, pursuant to said statutes. It also was in evidence that the plaintiff had not proved his debt against the estate of the defendant, and had not in any way become a party to any of the proceedings against the defendant under said statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\">The judge ordered a default to be entered, subject to the r. pinion of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-9\"><em>A.

In the present case, the bill was drawn at Bangor, in the State of Maine, upon the defendant, a citizen of Massachusetts, in favor of the plaintiff, a citizen of Maine, and was accepted by the defendant. It was therefore directly a contract with a citizen of Maine, to pay to him a certain sum of money. Such contract is not discharged by the insolvent law of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Upon the further question as to the right of the plaintiff to recover damages at the rate of three per cent, upon the amount of the bill, under the revised statutes of Maine, the court are of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to the same, and that we can give no effect to that statute in an action instituted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the default.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
