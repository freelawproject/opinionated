This principle has been adopted, as best calculated to protect the highest welfare of the community in the preservation of the purity and happiness of the most important domestic relation in life. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>6 Mass. 378. <em>Medway </em>v. <em>Needham, </em>16 Mass. 157. <em>West Cambridge </em>v. <em>Lexington, </em>1 Pick. 506. <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Bearcroft, </em>Bul. N. P. 114. <em>Scrimshire </em>v. <em>Scrimshire, </em>and <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Janverin, </em>2 Haggard, 395, 437. There is an exception, however, to this principle, in those cases where the marriage is considered as incestuous by the law of Christianity, and as against natural law. And these exceptions relate to marriages in the direct lineal line of consanguinity, and to those contracted between brothers and sisters; and the exceptions rest on the ground, that such marriages are against the laws of God, are immoral, and destructive of the purity and happiness of domestic life. But I am not aware that these exceptions, by any general consent among writers upon natural law, have been extended further, or embraced other cases prohibited by the Levitical law. This subject has been carefully discussed by Chancellor Kent, in the case of <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>4 Johns. Ch. 343 ; ar.d while he is clear as to the exceptions before stated, he thinks, beyond them there is a diversity of opinion among commentators. 2 Kent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Com. Lect. 26. See also Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, &lt;\u00a7&gt;\u00a7 113, 114. There is also a provision in our statutes, making marriages void in this State, where persons resident in the State, whose marriage, if solemnized here would be void, in order to evade our law, and with the intention of returning to reside here again, go into another State or country and there have their marriage solemnized. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>75, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 6. .The only object of this provision is, as stated by the commissioners in their report, to enforce the observance of our own laws upon our own citizens, and not to suffer them to violate regulations founded in a just regard to good morals and sound policy. As to the wisdom of this provision it is unnecessary here to speak. But the provision is noticed, to show that it has not been overlooked in the consideration of the case at bar, which presents no such state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In view of the whole matter, considering it as a part of the <em>jus gentium, </em>we do not feel called upon to extend the exceptions further. By our statutes, the marriage contracted between Samuel Sutton, the plaintiff, and Ann Hills, his mother\u2019s sister, if celebrated in this State, would have been absolutely void. But by the law of England, this marriage, at the time it was contracted, viz. in November 1834, was voidable only, and could not be avoided until a sentence of nullity should be obtained in the spiritual court, in a suit instituted for that purpose. See Poynter on Marriage and Divorce, 86, 120. 2 Stephen\u2019s Com. 280. In <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Wye, </em>7 Adolph. &amp; Ellis, 771, and 3 Nev. &amp; P. 13, the court of Kings Bench affirmed the doctrine, and held such a marriage voidable only, and that, till avoided, it was valid for all civil purposes. Rose. Crim. Ev. (2d ed.) 286. Since this marriage was contracted, the <em>St. </em>of 6 Wm. 4, <em>c. </em>54, has been passed, making such marriages which should afterwards be celebrated absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In the present case, the marriage of these parties was not void by the laws of England, though voidable in the spiritual court. It never was avoided, and though absolutely prohibited b) our laws, yet not being within the exception, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>against natural law, we do not feel warranted in saying the parties are not husband and wife. The plaintiff, Samuel Sutton, sues on a promissory note given to the said Ann Sutton, and, as her husband, he can maintain an action thereon, in his own name alone, there being no other cause of objection raised than the one stated in .regard to the legal ity of their marriage.
