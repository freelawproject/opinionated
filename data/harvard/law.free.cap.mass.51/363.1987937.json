Bosworth <em>vs. </em>Inhabitants of Swansey.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b371-5\">A person who travels on the Lord\u2019s day, neither from necessity nor charity, cannor maintain an action against a town for an injury received by him, while so travelling, by reason of a defect in a <em>highway </em>which the town is by law obliged to repair.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b371-6\">In an action against a town, to recover damages for an injury received by the plaintiff by reason of a defect in a highway which the town is by law obliged to repair, and over which the plaintiff, when he received the injury, was travelling on the Lord\u2019s day, upon secular business, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that such travelling was from necessity or charity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">This was an action on the Rev. Sts. c. 25, \u00a7 22, for an injury alleged to have been received by the plaintiff, by reason of a defect in a highway, in the town of Swansey, which said town was by law obliged to repair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Wells, G. </em>J. it appeared that the injury set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was sustained by him, as therein alleged, on the 11th of June 1843, being the Lord\u2019s day, in the forenoon of said day, as he was travelling from Warren, (R. I.) where he resided, to Fall River, on business connected with the conduct of a cause then pending in the district court of the United States in Rhode Island. The defendants admitted that they were by law bound to keep said highway in repair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">The judge instructed the jury, that the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, unless he satisfied them that his travelling on the Lord\u2019s day was from necessity or for purposes of charity; that it being admitted that his business was of a secular character, the burden was upon him to show the necessity of transacting this business on the Lord\u2019s day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">The jury found a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to the judge\u2019s instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-11\"><em>Coffin, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A95\">The Rev. Sts. c. 50, \u00a7 2, forbid travelling on the Lord\u2019s day, except from necessity or charity, under a penalty of \u00a710 for every offence. This is all the penalty which the law imposes. See <em>Comyns </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>Cro. Eliz. 485. <em>Geer </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>10 Mass. 312. <em>Clap </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Pick. 247. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Day, </em>17 Pick. 106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>As the plaintiff has sustained an injury by reason of a defect in a way which the defendants were legally bound to keep in repair, the burden of the defence rests on them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-5\"><em>Battelle &amp; E. Williams, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxW\">The case cited from Cro. Eliz. 485, was declared, in <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Defontaine, </em>1 Taunt. 136, not to be law; and it has lqng been settled that a penalty annexed to an act, by statute, implies a prohibition, and renders the act as illegal as if it were expressly prohibited. Story on Con. \u00a7\u00a7 162, 219, and cases there cited. When the plaintiff grounds his action, as in this case, on a violation of law, the law will not assist him to recover. In <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>6 Term. 219, it was held that no action could be maintained on a warranty, made on the sale of a horse (which was not an act of necessity or charity) on the Lord\u2019s day. See Story on Con. \u00a7 221. 23 Amer. Jurist, 10, 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">In <em>Geer v. Putnam, </em>10 Mass. 312, the question arose on a demurrer to a plea which did not show that the note declared on was given before sunset, or that the promisee knew that it was given on the Lord\u2019s day. Besides ; the plea did not negative necessity and charity. It was \u00e1n utterly insufficient plea, and the decision is no authority for the present plaintiff. And in <em>Clap </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Pick. 247, it did not appear that there was any violation of the law for the observance of the Lord\u2019s day. For aught that appears, the schedule to the assignment, in that case, might have been affixed after sunset.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">The instruction as to the burden of proof was correct. It is to be applied to the case, as shown in evidence, namely, after proof that the plaintiff was engaged in secular business when he received the injury. The plaintiff was bound to prove his cause of action affirmatively ; and the burden is on him who holds the affirmative, unless he brings himself within some established exception. The necessity of his travelling, if it existed, was peculiarly within his own knowledge; and for this reason the burden of proving it was on him. Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7 79. 1 Stark. Ev. 376. Peake on Ev. c. 5, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1. <em>Lana </em>v. <em>Crombie, </em>12 Pick. 177.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIM\">This was an action to recover damages against a town for a defect in their highway, by means of which the plaintiff sustained a loss. It appeared that the accident occurred on the Lord\u2019s day.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It has been repeatedly decided that, to maintain this action, it must appear that the accident was occasioned exclusively by the defect of the highway; to establish which, it must appear that the plaintiff himself is free from all just imputation of negligence or fault. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Pick. 621. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>North Bridgewater, </em>16 Pick. 189. And in these and other cases/ it has been held that the b\u00farden of proof is on the plaintiff, to prove affirmatively that he was so free from all fault. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Carlisle, </em>21 Pick. 146. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Crombie, </em>12 Pick. 177. The court are of opinion that this case comes within this principle. The Rev. Sts. c. 50, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 2, provide that \u201c no person shall travel on the Lord\u2019s day, except from necessity or charity,\u201d and that \u201c every person so offending shall be punished by a fine, not exceeding ten dollars for every offence.\u201d The act of the plaintiff, therefore, in doing which the accident occurred, was plainly unlawful, unless he could bring himself within the excepted cases ; and this would be a species of fault on his part, which would bring him within the principle of the cases cited. It would show that his own unlawful act concurred in causing the damage complained of. Then if he would bring himself within either of the exceptions, he must prove the fact which the statute makes an exception. In the case last above cited, <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Crombie, </em>the verdict was set aside, because the judge instructed the jury, that after the negligence of the defendants had been proved, if they relied on want of due care on the part of the plaintiff, the burden was upon them to prove it. This was held to be erroneous, and the burden was decided to be on the plaintiff to prove herself free from all fault. On this ground the verdict was set aside, although the evidence was such that probably the d\u2019\"''ction in regard to burden of proof had not much influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The court are therefore of opinion that the instruction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>judge was right, that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that his travelling on the Lord\u2019s day was from necessity or for purposes of charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">What constitutes such necessity or purpose of charity, are ruestions not raised by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
