Poyen <em>vs. </em>Joseph D. McNeill.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-7\">An officer, who was directed by a writ of replevin to replevy certain goods, provided the plaintiff should give a bond to the defendant \u201cwith sufficient <em>surety or </em>sureties, in the sum of dollars, being twice the value of the said goods,\u201d took a bond with two sureties, and served the writ. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff might amend his writ, by striking out the words \u201csurety or,\u201d and that the service was valid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">This was an action of replevin, in which the writ commanded the officer <em>\u201c </em>to replevy an open buggy wagon, of the value of more than twenty dollars,\u201d and deliver it to the plaintiff, \u201c provided that he, the said Poyen, shall give bond to the said M\u2019Neill, with sufficient surety or sureties, in the sum of dollars, being twice the value of the said goods and chattels, to prosecute,\u201d &amp;c. The officer took a replevin bond, with two sureties, and replevied the wagon. At the return term, in the court of common pleas, the defendant moved that the action be dismissed, and that he might be allowed his costs, and have a judgment for a return, \u201c because the laws of the land require that said writ should not be served until the said plaintiff should give a bond to said defendant with sufficient sureties, in a penalty double the property to be replevied.\u201d The plaintiff, at the same time, moved to amend his writ, by striking out the words \u201c surety or.\u201d At the next term the court overruled the defendant\u2019s motion, and allowed the motion of the plaintiff. The defendant thereupon tendered a bill of exceptions, which the court refused to allow, because the rulings excepted to were merely interlocutory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and not, at that stage of the cause, the subject of exceptions. No record was made of the allowance of said motion to amend, or of the disallowance of said motion to dismiss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">The defendant afterwards pleaded the general issue, reserving all his rights under his motion to dismiss. At the trial of the action and before going to the jury, the defendant again insisted on his motion to dismiss; but the court overruled it, and ruled that the xvrit was sufficient in law to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s action. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions to said rulings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-6\"><em>J. G. </em>Abbott, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj8\">The writ was not in the form prescribed by law, and therefore the officer had no authority to serve it. <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Mass. 311, 312. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 Met. 510. By the Rev. Sts. c. 113, 19, 29, a writ of replevin cannot be laxvfully served, unless the plaintiff gives the defendant a bond \u201cxvith sufficient <em>sureties : </em>\u201d and $&lt;\u00a7&gt; 20, 28, direct that the writ shall prescribe the taking of <em>sureties, </em>by directing that it shall require \u201csuch bond \u201d to be given, and that the writ \u201c shall be in the same form, substantially, that has been heretofore established and used.\u201d The taking by the officer, being unxvarranted, cannot be legalized by the subsequent amendment of the writ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-7\"><em>B. F. Butler, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae0Z\">Such a bond as the statute requires was executed before the xvrit was served ; and if the writ was defective, the amendment cured the defect and legalized the service. <em>Hearsey </em>v. <em>Bradbury, </em>9 Mass. 95. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hellen, </em>1 Iredell, 421. <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Divol, </em>12 Term 499. But the writ was sufficient before the amendment. The Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>113, $ 20, direct that a writ to replevy distrainedx cattle shall require a bond with sufficient sureties; but no section directs that a writ to replevy goods shall require such a bond. Such writ, indeed, by \u00a7 28, is directed to be in the same form, substantially, as heretofore established; that is, not like that prescribed in &lt;\u00a7&gt; 20, but substantially like that prescribed by <em>St. </em>1789, c. 26, \u00a7 4. Section 29 directs that the <em>bond </em>in case of goods replevied shall be like the bond, prescribed in &lt;\u00a7) 20, in case of cattle replevied; and if it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>intended that the <em>writ, </em>in both cases, should have required a bond with \u201c sureties,\u201d it would have been so expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\"><em>In Simonds </em>v. Parker, 1 Met. 510, the only point <em>decided, </em>was, that the exceptions to the writ in that case could not prevail, because they were not seasonably taken. The suggestions as to their validity, if seasonably taken, were extrajudicial. But in that case the writ directed the officer to take a bond in a fixed sum, being twice the value set upon the goods by the plaintiff, and the officer took such bond contrary to the provisions of the Rev. Sts. c. 113, &lt;\u00a7&gt;&lt;\u00a7&gt; 20, 29, which direct that the writ shall not express the sum for which the bond shall be taken, but that it shall be in double the value of the property, as appraised by disinterested persons, or as agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">The taking of one surety only, on a replevin bond, will not avoid proceedings in a replevin suit. <em>Kesler </em>v. Haynes, 6 Wend. 547. <em>A fortiori, </em>a direction to take a bond with \u201c surety or sureties \u201d will not avoid such proceedings, when two sureties are in fact taken before the writ is served.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-7\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOU\">The court are of opinion that these exceptions cannot be sustained. Strictly speaking, the revised statutes do not prescribe the form of a writ of replevin for goods over $20 value. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>113, \u00a7 28. They direct that the writ \u201c shall be in the same form, substantially, that has been heretofore established and used,\u201d that is, established by law for such replevin writs, before the revised statutes ; not established by a prior provision in the same chapter, \u00a7 17, directing the mode of proceeding on a justice\u2019s writ, when cattle are replevied. But undoubtedly, under the above word \u201c substantially,\u201d it is proper to alter the form of the writ so as to conform to the change of the law made by the revised statutes, requiring two sureties. But forms of writs given by statute are directory only, and it is sufficient that they are followed in substance. Whether the writ would have been good if served without taking two sureties, we need not consider, because before service such bond was given, conformably to Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>113, $ 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>And if the process was irregular, we think it was amendable, and the amendment well allowed, under the provision allowing amendments in form or substance \u201c of any process.\u201d Rev. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
