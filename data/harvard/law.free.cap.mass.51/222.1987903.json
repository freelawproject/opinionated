Grim. Law, 424. It is said, in Davis Just. (1st ed.) 117, that a justice of the peace must make such inquiry.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-9\"><em>Wilkinson, </em>(District Attorney,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnS\">for the Commonwealth. By Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 29, if a person, who is arraigned on an <em>indictment, </em>refuses to plead or answer, the court shall order a plea of not guilty to be entered, and he shall be tried as if he had made that plea. A justice of the peace may proceed in a similar manner, when a party refuses to plead to a complaint.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b230-10\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHm\">The next preceding case of <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth </em>disposes of all the material points in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>It was suggested that there was an irregularity in the mode of trial, arising from the fact that no plea was tendered by the party. But the case shows that the party fraudulently and wilfully stood mute, and that thereupon <em>fhe </em>case was tried in the same manner as if the party had pleaded not guilty. To this course the petitioner cannot object.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>Petition di; missed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
