The same day, Sauserman wrote plaintiffs of his chance to sell, and asked to be released from his contract, without expressly saying he was going to violate it. June 7th, plaintiffs sent an agent, who, June 8th, saw Sauserman, and was informed as to the name of the intending purchaser. June 10th, plaintiffs notified defendant, Phillips-Jones Company, of the fact that Sauserman could not sell without violating his contract. The answer was: \u201cYou tell Mr. Salant we can play the game both ways and you have got it and we need it; we shall see this thing to a finish.\u201d June 11th, Phillips-Jones Company contracted for Sauserman\u2019s services as foreman of the factory for a year. June 13th, Salant had notice that Sauserman was going to sell. June 14th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Sauserman conveyed the factory to Phillips-Jones Company. June 18th, the deed was recorded. June 24th, plaintiffs learned of the conveyance. June 28th, plaintiffs learned of Sauserman\u2019s employment as foreman by Phillips-Jones Company. July 5th, Sauserman refused to give possession of the factory to plaintiffs under the contract. The same day plaintiffs filed their bill praying, inter alia, for \u201can injunction, temporary until hearing and permanent thereafter against Phillips-Jones Company, restraining it in any wise from obstructing or interfering with Sauserman\u2019s performance of his contract.\u201d July 5th, the court granted a preliminary injunction as prayed for, and, August 23d, continued it until final hearing. Defendant, Phillips-Jones Company, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">The principal contention of appellant is that the preliminary injunction does not preserve the status quo; or if it does, no benefit accrues to plaintiff and the defendant suffers injury by not being able to use its factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">It is the last actual, peaceable, non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy that is to be preserved: Fredericks et al. v. Huber et al., 180 Pa. 572; Taylor v. Sauer, 40 Pa. Superior Ct. 229. In the present case this consisted of Sauserman being in possession of the factory, uninfluenced by Phillips-Jones Company, and able, if not willing, to perform his contract. A preliminary injunction issues to reframe a state of affairs disarranged by stealth and chicane pending efforts to sustain the status quo: Fredericks et al. v. Huber et al., supra. The position arrived at July 5th was contested and disputed. The Phillips-Jones Company\u2019s ownership of the factory building, even if known to plaintiffs, was not notice that Sauserman would discontinue substantial performance of his contract, and, in regard to other developments, plaintiffs were not required to take notice of private agreements between the defendants. So far, therefore, as the present injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>is concerned, no laches can .be imputed to plaintiffs. The preliminary injunction granted does not command a delivery of property, nor could it: Equitable Trust Co. v. Garis et al., 190 Pa. 544. It properly restrains the Phillips-Jones Company from unfairly and wrongfully interfering with the contractual rights of plaintiffs by offering and giving inducements to Sauserman to refuse further performance of his contract: Flaccus v. Smith, 199 Pa. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">Since the argument our attention has been called to the case of Drum v. Dinkelacker, 262 Pa! 392. The facts and decree in that' case are readily distinguishable from those in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">We think the injunction preserved the status quo, was beneficial to plaintiffs; and was properly granted and continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The appeal is dismissed. Appellant to pay costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
