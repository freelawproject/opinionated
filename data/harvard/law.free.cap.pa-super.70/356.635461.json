Robinson, 108 Pa. 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-9\">It requires no citation of authority for the proposition that if there is no such legal entity in the law as an \u201cestate,\u201d a person cannot act as agent therefor: Jones v. Beal, 218 Pa. 182; Philadelphia v. Peters, 57 Pa. Superior Ct. 275.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-10\"><em>E. Spencer Miller, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASQQ\">From the fact that the attorney for the appellant cites no other case in support of his assertion that there is a fundamental liability upon a daughter, independent of contract, to- pay her mother\u2019s funeral expenses, we may assume that he was unable to find such an authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-11\">On the other hand, we submit many opposed. The following cases hold that even a mother is not liable for necessaries supplied to her children when they have estates: Albert\u2019s App., 128 Pa, 613; Strawbridge\u2019s App., 5 Wh. 568; Keough\u2019s Est., 16 District Reports 225; Commonwealth v. Murray, 4 Binn. 487; Selleck\u2019s App., 16 Weekly Notes Cas. 370; Stanton\u2019s Est., 13 Philadelphia 213; Levering\u2019s Est., 16 Philadelphia 255; Jones\u2019 Est., 19 Philadelphia 228.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A25y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\">But the cases go much further than this. At common law there is no liability upon a mother or even a father, to provide necessaries for a child, if adult, much less on a child as to a parent: Darlington v. Darlington, 5 County Court Rep. 132; Wertz v. Blair County, 66 Pa. 18; Mt. Pleasant Overseer v. Wilcox, 2 Dist. 628; Boyd v. Sappington, 4 Watts 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">It was clearly proper for Miss Chambers to call in the undertaker. The affidavit shows that she was the only child and her mother a widow: Wynkoop v. Wynkoop, 42 Pa. 293; Fox v. Gordon, 16 Philadelphia 185; Pettigrew v. Pettigrew, 207 Pa. 313.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">Letters of administration relates back when equity requires : Leber v. Kauffelt, 5 W. &amp; S. 440; Shoenberger Bros. v. Lanc. Sav. Ins., 28 Pa. 459; Holcomb v. Roberts, 57 Pa. 493; Roberts v. Messinger, 134 Pa. 298.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AQUb\">Kephart, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The appellant seeks to recover funeral expenses incurred by a daughter in the burial of her mother. It is admitted that the mother left an estate ample to liquidate these expenses and the issue, as framed by the affidavit, does not involve the question of the liability of the daughter to furnish this attention as being \u201cnecessaries\u201d under the law. The plaintiff alleges that \u201cat the special instance and request of the defendant\u201d he prepared for burial and buried Ada E. Chambers and in carrying out his contract incurred the expenses for which this action is brought. The defendant in reply sets up that she did not, \u201cand plaintiff well knew that she,did not request him\u201d to incur the expenses on her own behalf; that she did not intend to assume a personal responsibility, but was acting as the agent for the representatives of the estate of the deceased, and this the plaintiff well knew when he received the order from the defendant. Whether or not the defendant contracted to pay these expenses was a question of fact to be submitted to the jury. Apart from the question of a personal contract, it would be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tirely proper as between parent and child when the parent dies leaving an estate, to treat the act of the defendant in performing this necessary duty as made for and in behalf of the estate, although letters had not yet been issued. Letters of administration, when granted, relate back so as to cover and validate acts previously performed in relation to the estate which are so imperatively necessary as that for which the expenses are here sued for: Leber v. Kauffelt, 5 W. &amp; S. 440; Shoenberger\u2019s Executors v. Lancaster Savings Institution, 28 Pa. 459; Holcomb v. Roberts, 57 Pa. 493; Roberts v. Messinger, 134 Pa. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
