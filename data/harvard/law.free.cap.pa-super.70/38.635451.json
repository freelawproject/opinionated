A. Coleman, the secretary and treasurer of the Interstate company, its duly authorized agent, made a full and final settlement with the defendant in consideration of a check for $79.27 and the $500 stock certificate, \u201cthe same being in full and final settlement of all and every debt, claim and demand,\u201d of plaintiff company against the defendant and \u201cthe said <em>W- </em>A. Coleman......returned to the said defendant company all the notes in compliance with the agreement made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The court below entered judgment for plaintiff on the ground that the authority of Coleman was not alleged, that authority could not have been given him to purchase stock of the insolvent company and thus reduce its capital to' the prejudice of creditors. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">There is nothing in the pleadings to indicate that the Interstate company was insolvent April 25, 1911, the-date of the alleged settlement. Nor was the allegation of authority in Coleman to make settlement insufficient. The affidavit alleges an accord and satisfaction, made before the appointment of the receiver, and, accordingly, binding upon him: Hoover v. Pursel, 67 Pa.
