R. Ramsey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">\u201cThis instrument signed in duplicate by both parties, each party retaining one each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-11\">On a rule to strike off the lien McIlvaine, P. J., filed an opinion the material portions of which are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-12\">The contract is certainly inartistically drawn and is difficult to interpret, but there are several provisions in it, as we interpret it, to justify the conclusion that Ramsey was not a lessee of Owen Murphy\u2019s mine, to run it on his own account, but he was rather Owen Murphy\u2019s manager or superintendent to operate and develop the mine as Murphy\u2019s employee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-13\">It will be noticed that the first paragraph of the agreement does not lease the mine to Ramsey. What it does do is to lease to or give him the right to use the shaft, boilers, engines, mules, dwelling house and all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>equipment pertaining to- the mining of coal under or on said tract of land known as the Ryan or Cain tract located at or near Coon Island. In other words, there is no consideration expressed in the agreement that Ramsey was to pay for the use of the shaft, boilers, engines, mules, dwelling house and other equipment as lessee. They were simply turned over to him, presumably as Murphy\u2019s manager, for the period of six months, if he saw fit to stay in Murphy\u2019s employ that long.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-3\">The second paragraph simply provides that Ramsey agrees to mine the coal as per projection made by him, the mining of said coal to be known as development of mine work. This is nothing more than an agreement that Ramsey is to mine coal in Owen Murphy\u2019s coal mine, and while he was mining it the presumption being that he was mining it for Murphy. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\">The next paragraph confirms this, for it provides that the coal when mined will be sold by Murphy, clearly implying that it was then his coal, for the sum of one dollar, provided Ramsey had extracted the coal for Murphy on said property as per projection therein mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">When we come to the sixth paragraph we find that certain other things are to be done by Ramsey, evidently as the employee or manager of Murphy; that is, he is to build tipple, engine house, power house, boiler house and foundation for the same, if desired by the party of the first part, by force account plus 10 per cent., payment of said force account and responsibility to be assumed by Murphy, the party of the first part, there clearly showing that Ramsey was to be his manager or superintendent, and that the necessary labor to do the work was to be paid for by Murphy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">Then coming to the seventh paragraph, we find it expressly provided that Murphy \"is to pay the cost of pumping or extracting the water from the mine or shaft, replace hoisting rope, readjusting railroad tracks, completing air way down to bottom of shaft, and the party of the second part is hereby authorized to start the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>named work,\u201d clearly showing an authority given by an employer to his employee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">The eighth paragraph says that \u201cthe party of the second part is to be paid for work such as making sump, extracting or removing material from the roof, placing pumps into permanent positions, and any other inside work, by receiving 10 <em>% </em>of the actual cost of doing such work, and such work to be paid by the party of the first part\u201d; that is, the men that were employed to do this work were to be paid by Murphy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">Taking the whole contract, it is to our mind clearly not a lease of Murphy\u2019s mine to Ramsey to be operated by him, he thus being an independent contractor or lessee, whose employees would clearly have no right to enter a lien against the mine but only against such interest as Ramsey might have, but clearly this agreement was a contract of employment by which Ramsey became the manager or superintendent of Murphy\u2019s mine, with authority to operate it and to employ for Murphy the miners that might be necessary to do the required work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">We are therefore of the opinion that the written agreement when properly interpreted does not sustain the construction that Murphy has put on it in his affidavit of defense, or the conclusion that Ramsey under that written agreement was a lessee of this mine such as would require the miners employed by him to file their liens against the property of Ramsey. And this being the case, his affidavit of defense is clearly insufficient to prevent judgment, the proper construction of the lease being that Ramsey was his manager or superintendent, with authority to employ miners to carry on Murphy\u2019s mine, and therefore his property or his mine is the object of the lien which the law creates in favor of those who worked for him through Ramsey in carrying on the business of that mine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">We are therefore of the opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">1. That the plaintiff\u2019s lien on its face is good and cannot be stricken from the record.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AvZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-2\">2. That the writ of scire facias was properly issued and cannot be quashed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-3\">3. That the written contract \u2014 \u201cExhibit A\u201d \u2014 attached to the amended answer of the defendant, is not a lease of Murphy\u2019s mine, but a contract that Ramsey was to act as Murphy\u2019s manager to hire miners for him and to carry on the business of operating his mine along the lines therein specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">4. That the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-6\"><em>Harry F. </em>Moore, with him <em>R. W. Know </em>and <em>McIlvaine, Williams &amp; McCreight, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arg\">It is true that the use of the word lease is not conclusive that the agreement was a lease, but it does show what the parties had in mind when the agreement was made, and must be considered as one of the elements which go to make up a lease. It has been held that \u201cany language by which the possession is transferred for a limited time, for the stipulated return, creates a tenancy and is in fact a lease\u201d: Pickering v. O\u2019Brien, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 125.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-7\"><em>J. Boyd Crumrine, </em>with him <em>Acheson &amp; Crumrine </em>and <em>C. L. V.
