H. Mc-Clelland, died in October, 1914, intestate, that the mother is,\u2019 and has been for ten or eleven years last past, insane, and during the greater part of this period has been and is now confined in an asylum. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">That on the 13th day of December, 1907, at No. 7, January Session, Quarter Sessions Court of Allegheny County, Juvenile Branch, upon the petition of M. Alice Carter, a probation officer of said court, setting forth, among other things, that the said Anna and Viola Mc-Clelland were dependent children, without proper parental care and guardianship, that the father drank, and did not properly provide for them, that they were without food or fire, they were returned to their parents under the supervision of the probation officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">That afterwards, on March 20, 1908, they were temporarily committed to the City Home (Pittsburgh) at Marshalsea, and, finally, on May 22,1908, to the care of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>their grandmother, Maria Jacoby, their father\u2019s mother, a Protestant with whom they have lived until August, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">That on the 28th of August, 1917, at these proceedings, upon the petition of the said grandmother, setting forth that she was unable financially to care for said children and that none of their relatives were able to give them a home, they were by this court committed to the detention home of the court pending further disposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">The record further shows that on September 17,1917, they were by this court committed to their maternal aunt, Mrs. Grace Campbell, and that on October 18, 1917, the aunt returned the children to the juvenile court office, refusing to keep them longer, on which date they were again committed to the detention home, pending further disposition, and that finally, on November 1, 1917, after further hearing, they were committed to the Home Finding Department and, at their express request, the probation officer was instructed to place them in a Protestant home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">On the 21st of November, 1917, a petition was presented by Grace Campbell, their aunt, setting forth substantially the facts as herein narrated, as to the marriage, birth and baptism of the respondents, and praying the court to order the Home Finding Department of this court to place them in the care and custody of some person or persons having the same religious belief as their mother, Giles McClelland, their surviving parent, or with some association controlled by persons of such religious belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">The main objection to such an appointment is the attitude of the children. They have from their earliest recollection been attendants at a Protestant Church and a Protestant Sunday school, and when questioned as to their wishes'both express decided and apparently sincere refusal to be placed under the care of a person of the Catholic religion. They are bright, intelligent, well-grown, and unquestionably have formed a prejudice, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>course not founded upon any real knowledge of the subject, toward the church of their mother, so much so that a mere suggestion of placing them under its teachings arouses instantly in them, especially in the younger one, very marked antagonism, inclining the court to the belief that only by force can they be subjected to the prayer of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\">It seems to us that under the circumstances of this case, where these children, coming under the jurisdiction of this court when mere infants, were by it placed, with the consent of the father, who lived with the grandmother intermittently until his death in 1914, and without objection on the part of the mother\u2019s relatives (who are all of the Catholic religion) in the care and custody of a Protestant grandmother, and who without objection . have been taught and reared in the atmosphere of a Protestant Church, until they have reached such an age (one in the 12th, the other in her 13th year) where they have fixed opinions of their own, where there has been utter neglect and abandonment upon the part of the petitioner and other maternal relatives of the children, that the interest and solicitation now shown by such relatives is somewhat tardy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">There was no reason why at the death of the father at least, this present request should not have been made. There was no reason why in their early infancy, when their minds could have been more readily moulded to the reception of the religion of their mother, there should not have been some action taken to this end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">It is not likely that the father would have raised any . objection, and, if he had, his stipulation entered into at the time of the marriage would have been a sufficient answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">But, after a lapse of all these years, the petitioner in this case, as she testified on the stand, having knowledge of all the facts, is it not too late to raise the question of the religious training of these children? Has the petitioner not tacitly acquiesced, standing as she says in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the opinion of her petition, in the place of the unfortunate mother, in the proceedings of this court to such an extent and for such a length of time that she is now estopped from asserting her alleged right to have the children placed under the teachings of a religion other than that they have been taught, with her knowledge, all their lives?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">The father of the children was a Protestant. He was the natural guardian of the children while he lived, and if in permitting them to embrace the teachings of the Protestant religion he was guilty of a breach of his marriage agreement with his wife, was not that a matter between him and her at that time, and not now? She was just as competent then as now to interfere. The petitioner has not shown any authority of law to act for the mother; she is a volunteer, and if her voluntary action is in any force at this time, it would have been of equal force ten years since, or, at least, three years since, at the date of the death of the father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The act of assembly governing cases such as this was in force at the time the first order of court was made. It provides that the courts having the custody of children shall place them, as far as possible, in the custody of persons having the same religious belief as the parents of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">In this case, however, the father was a Protestant when the first order was made, and if the order was, as was said before, in violation of the father\u2019s marriage agreement, that was a matter between him and the present petitioner, his wife\u2019s voluntary representative, at that time. Does the law intend, at the death of the father, his children having been placed during his lifetime, with his consent, in the custody of persons of his religious belief, that their custodial care shall then, at the expiration of seven years, be changed to that of the mother\u2019s belief? Would this be conducive to the best interests of the children ? We think not, nor does the law intend that it shall be so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The words \u201cso far as possible\u201d imply, because of their insertion in the act, that in some cases, owing to the circumstances, there may be such difficulties and peculiar situations, that to place the children as the' act in the main directs, would be unreasonable, and not a benefit to them, Avhich, after all, is the object of all juvenile court laws. These words imply that there is some discretion to be exercised by the court in placing children. If the act is intended to be mandatory in all instances, these, words would have been omitted; on the other hand,. the clear implication from the language is that so far as is reasonably possible the suggestions of the act as to the religious custody of- children shall be obeyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">We are, therefore, considering the age of the children, their hitherto religious training and environment, their decided antipathy to this proceeding, the laches of the petitioner until this time, the impossibility of complying with her prayer without resorting to harsh measures, the serious doubt whether the forcing upon the children religious training and teachings against their will, would not be productive of more harm than good, compelled to dismiss this petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">And now, to wit, November 1, 1917, the above case called for hearing upon petition, and after a hearing and inquiry into the facts, the court determines that said children, Anna and Viola McClelland, are dependent, and that the child\u2019s OAvn good and the interests of the State require, and it is therefore ordered, that said child be committed to the probation officer of this court, who has been by general order appointed director of the Allegheny County Home Finding Department, and to her successor or successors in office, county pay $3.50 per week each for board and clothing, county pay costs, child to remain in detention home until this order can be executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order of the court as above quoting it.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-4\"><em>Thomas L.
