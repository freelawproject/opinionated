J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">This matter heard on rule granted on supervisors of Clinton Township on supplemental petition of citizens of said township for improvement of a highway, under State Aid Highways Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">The first question for our determination is disposing of the petition of some eighteen signers to the original petition for withdrawal of their names from the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">If this proceeding was on the original petition there would be no question as to the duty of the court to refuse the petition, as the signatures of the parties gave a legal status to the petition, and it would be too late to withdraw after such right had attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-9\">The original petition, however, was presented to court May 24,1915, and after due hearing the rule issued thereon was discharged July 24,1915. After the expiration of five months petitioner secured the signatures of additional owners of real estate in said township to the original petition, substituting other names in certain cases, and presented his supplemental petition to court, upon which this rule is granted. This proceeding, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>for all purposes must be considered and treated as de novo.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AxC\">July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-2\">Inasmuch as a considerable length of time has intervened, the withdrawal petitioners in no way ratified or consented to this supplemental petition, but promptly repudiated it by their petition for withdrawal from such proceeding, we are of the opinion that it is our duty to grant the prayer of withdrawal petitioners. Such being the case, the petition lacks the signatures of owners of the majority of the assessed value of real estate in said township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-3\">And now, February 14, 1917, the rule is discharged at cost of petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-5\"><em>A.
