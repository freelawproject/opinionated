Before Copeland, P. J., specially presiding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\">At the trial when Harry O. Walley was on the stand he was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">\u201cQ. Along about the 10th of December, 1914, what was the usual and customary commission for real estate agents for selling property of the value of $6,500?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">\u201cBy Mr. Kline: We object for the reason that we do not think there was any fixed compensation and that it does not enter into this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">\u201cBy the Court: If there was no agreement as to what he was to pay and he agreed to pay him then he would be entitled to what the services were reasonably worth and according to what they ordinarily pay for such transactions in that community. Objection overruled; exception noted. (1)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">\u201cA. The usual commission was 3% on sales of that nature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">[\u201cNow, it was said by counsel here in his argument to the jury that the plaintiff was in the employ of two masters and cannot recover. Well, as an abstract proposition that is true, but that is not a binding rule. That rule can be varied, as we read now to you:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">\u201c \u2018It is a rule of public policy that an agent for the sale of property cannot at the same time act as agent for the purchaser thereof or interest himself therein and thus become entitled to commission from both the vendor and the vendee. This rule may be waived by an express agreement between the parties.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">\u201cSo you see that, as a general proposition, that is true, or where the agent represents both the seller and the purchaser, or the vendor and the vendee, he is not entitled to recover unless there is some understanding, express or implied, that there is a commission to be paid. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>fore, just simply because the plaintiff here might have been an agent for the vendee of this property there is not any reason why he could not recover from the defendant in this case what his services reasonably were worth and ordinarily paid for like services rendered in this case. That is, providing that the defendant here employed him with the knowledge that he was employed as agent for the vendee of the property. As we already have said to you, there is just one thing in this case for you to determine in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and that is: Was this plaintiff employed by the defendant? If you decide he was not employed then that ends this case and your verdict should be for the defendant. If you decide he was employed with the understanding that he was to receive a commission then the defendant is entitled to recover whatever the services reasonably were worth.\u201d] (2)</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APO\">July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $201.54.
