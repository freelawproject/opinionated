To give the wife one-half of the estate, absolutely, and deduct from the other half given to the nieces and nephews, but payable after the wife\u2019s death the $17,000 of cash bequests, would not be consistent with the second clause of this will, for in that clause one undivided half was given to the wife and the other undivided half to the four nieces and nephews, and to construe that as meaning that Mrs. Both should get $28,000 and that out of the $28,000 coming to the nieces and nephews there should be first deducted the $17,000 of cash bequests, which would leave $11,000 for distribution would not be giving one undivided half to the nieces and nephews. We do not see how there can be any other construction of this will than by deducting the $17,000 from the entire estate for distribution, and dividing the balance in half, giving the estate of Eliza Roth one-half and the four nieces and nephews the other half, and we contend that the fact that the half devised to the nieces and nephews is not payable until after the wife\u2019s death has no bearing upon the question involved, for those bequests were not contingent but vested and the death of either one of the nieces or nephews would not cause the bequest to lapse, as the payment only was postponed, and in cas\u00e9 of death the heirs or legal representatives could demand the share: Sellers v.

The first clause of his will gave his wife his entire estate for life. The second clause gave her absolutely one-half of the estate, and the remainder was, at her death, to be divided among four nieces and nephews, of whom appellant is one. The third clause gave Frank Roth $600 per year until he should complete his college career. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>next five clauses made specific bequests amounting to $17,000, payable at Mrs. Roth\u2019s death. The wife and Charles Heinrich were named as executors. Being cited to file an account, they complied in March, 1902, and the Orphans\u2019 Court found the value of the estate to be $56,-811.38. Heinrich was, upon his own request, relieved as executor. Mrs. Roth died December 26, 1913, and her executors filed an account of her husband\u2019s estate showing assets amounting to $10,395.09. At this time appellant had received advancements amounting to $1,192, upon which the court charged interest, $1,239.85, making a total of $2,731.85. To this sum may be added $321.23, allowed him by this decree, so that he has received from the estate $3,056.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Mrs. Roth took an absolute and immediate interest in one-half the estate of her husband under the will. The estate to be accounted for at her death was the remaining one-half of $56,811.38, found to be the value of the estate at the first account in 1902, or $28,120.69. The specific bequests were payable out of this fund before the residuary bequests to the nieces and nephews, as the testator directed that they be \u201cpaid out of my estate after the death of my wife Eliza Roth.\u201d These bequests, with interest, amounted to $17,280.50, which, deducted from $28,120.69, left $11,110.19, and, adding interest, $1,615.33, on the sum from the death of the life tenant, or a total of $12,755.52, for distribution among the residuary legatees. After deducting proper credits, $3,-110.11, there remained $9,315.11, of which appellant was entitled to one-fourth, or $2,336.28, and, as he has received $720 more than he was entitled to under the will, he has no standing to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
