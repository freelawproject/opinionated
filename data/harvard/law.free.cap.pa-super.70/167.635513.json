In such a case it is immaterial that the tenant had no actual knowledge of the partition proceedings, if it appears that such proceedings were a matter of public record; nor can he assert that he was not liable for the rent of the room because he had not been notified of the change of title for a period of two years.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b213-6\">Argued April 22, 1918.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzyF\">Appeal, No. 3, April T., 1918, by defendant, from judgment of C.

On a rule for judgment for defendant n. o. v. Evans, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\">As stated by counsel for the defendant in his brief, \u201cthere are substantially no disputed facts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-10\">On the 8th of February, 1907, the defendant with a man by the name of Carlton leased from the heirs of Henry Sutmeyer, among whom were the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>this case, \u201call that certain building situated at No. 901 Federal Street, Allegheny, Pa.\u201d The building situated at No. 901 Federal street, Allegheny, Pa., was known as the Hotel Federal, and at the date of this lease and for some time prior thereto a room on the second floor of No. 903 Federal street, also the property of the heirs of Henry Sutmeyer, had been used in conjunction with the building at No. 901 Federal street as part of the Hotel Federal. The lease of February 8, 1907, was to begin' the 1st of May of that year and continue for one year. The defendant, who shortly after the 1st of May, 1907, became the sole lessee of the premises, continued to occupy under this lease for the years 1908 and 1909. In July of 1909 the estate of Henry Sutmeyer was partitioned and the premises at No. 901 Federal street were partitioned to Eliza Young and Flora E. White, daughters of Henry Sutmeyer, and the premises at No. 903 Federal street were allotted to the plaintiffs. The lease dated February 8, 1907, was signed by all of the heirs of Henry Sutmeyer, or by their personal representatives, including the two plaintiffs in this case. The defendant occupied the room on the premises known as No. 903 Federal street up to the first of May, 1912, and the plaintiff brings this suit to recover for us and occupation of that room for the two years from May 1, 1910, to May 1, 1912, and the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-3\">The defeiidant suggests two reasons why judgment should be entered for the defendant non obstante veredicto. The first is that the relation of landlord and tenant did not exist and, therefore, assumpsit cannot be maintained for use and occupation. This case was in the Superior Court, and that court\u2019s decision of the case is reported in 63 Pa. Superior Ct. 607, in which it was held that the facts as presented to that court were sufficient to support an action and create a liability on the part of the defendant. In this case the evidence of the relationship of landlord and tenant is stronger than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>in the case that was presented to the Superior Court. The defendant was a tenant of these two plaintiffs, inter alia, from May 1, 1907, to May 1, 1910, by virtue of the lease dated February 8, 1907, for one year and the holding over by him for the two years following; and his continued occupancy of the room after May 1, 1910, continued the relationship of landlord and tenant as between himself and these two plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-3\">It is urged by counsel for the defendant that the defendant knew nothing of the proceedings in partition and, therefore, knew nothing of the change of ownership in the premises. But the proceedings in partition and the record thereof was a public record of which he had constructive notice, and besides he knew that on February 8,1907, he had leased these premises from five heirs of Henry Sutmeyer, all of whom signed the lease which he got at the time, and that on May 1, 1910, he leased the premises from Mrs. Young and Mrs. White without the other heirs of Henry Sutmeyer joining in the lease, and he had notice there of a change of ownership in the premises. If he could have leased these premises for five years and avoid payment of rent because he had not been given actual notice of the change of title resulting from the partition proceedings of the Sutmeyer heirs, he could have leased them for fifty years from two of those heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">Defendant\u2019s counsel makes a point that the plaintiffs are estopped because they did not notify the defendant immediately and waited two years before they notified him that he was occupying their premises without paying rent. I do not know any reason why the owner of real estate should be estopped from claiming compensation for use and occupancy because he has not notified the one who is occupying it to pay his rent. The reason given for not notifying defendant, viz: that plaintiffs thought the lease of February 8,1907, was for five years, may have been the reason why plaintiffs did not notify defendant sooner. I see no reason to disturb the verdict rendered by the jury in this case.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>July 10, 1918:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-2\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in discharging rule for judgment for defendant n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-3\"><em>George H.
