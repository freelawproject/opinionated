It was only after her failure to avail herself of the opportunity thus afforded her to perfect the statement of her case, if it had been possible for her to do so, that the decree, dismissing the bill was passed. We therefore conclude that the bill as filed contains the most favorable statement of the plaintiff\u2019s case of which it is susceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">We agree with the learned Judge below that this hill does not state a case entitling the appellant to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">It is a well settled and familiar principle of equity pleading that every bill of complaint must contain a clear statement of the facts upon which the plaintiff relies for relief as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>it is from those facts alone that the Court derives its jurisdiction. <em>Lamm </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>69 Md. 274; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Payne. </em>97 Md. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Where the bill asks for an injunction, as it does in the present case, \u201ca full and candid disclosure of all of the facts must be made\u201d and \u201cthe <em>res gestae </em>must be represented as they actually are.\u201d <em>Lamm </em>v. <em>Burrell, supra; Johnson </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>40 Md. 200; <em>Tifel </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>95 Md. 668; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>96 Md. 513; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>108 Md. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Disregarding the fact that the bill asks for an injunction, we fail to see that it states ground for any equitable relief at all. The appellant contends that under its allegations she is entitled to have a resulting trust declared in her favor in the leasehold purchased by the appellees although that is not the specific relief prayed for in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Kunkel, </em>46 Md. 565, on which the appellant specially relied we said: \u201cThe Court below very correctly defined a resulting trust to be that 'which arises where one person buys' an estat\u00e9 and pays the purchase money, but takes the deed in the name of another person, then a trust results, by construction in favor of the person who pays the money. The same definition is substantially given in <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>8 Grill, 357, 1 Md. Chy. 479; <em>McElderry </em>v. <em>Shipley, </em>2 Md. 36-7.\u201d \u201cNo trust will result unless the person advance the money in the character of a purchaser, for if A. discharge the purchase money by way of loan to B., no trust is raised in favor of A., who is merely the creditor of B.\u201d <em>Lewin on Trusts, </em>178.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">There is no allegation in the present bill that the plaintiff purchased the property in question and directed it to be put in the names of the defendants. The allegation is that, the defendants \u201csecured\u201d $1,000 from the plaintiff for the purpose of purchasing the property and that although it was purchased in the names of the defendants she believed when she \u201cturned over\u201d the money to them and until recently has continued to believe that it was mutually agreed and. understood between the defendants and her that she was entitled to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>equitable interest in the property and that she in fact has such an interest to the amount and extent of her $1,000 invested therein. To that is added the allegation, inconsistent with the theory that the purchase was for her account, that the defendants agreed that she should receive certain and regular interest instalments on her investment but that they have failed and refused to pay the interest or any of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The circumstances under which the money was \u201cturned over\u201d by her to the defendants are not stated. She simply states her <em>belief </em>that it was understood that she was entitled' to an equitable interest in the property, a mere matter of opinion as to her equitable status. The only agi\u2019eement or understanding between the parties that the bill alleges as a fact is that the plaintiff was to be paid <em>interest </em>in regular instalments, presumably by the defendants as it is further-stated that they have failed and refused to pay the interest. Although the hill avers that the defendants secured the money from her \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing the leasehold property\u201d and that they used it in making the purchase, it neither says nor intimates that the purchase was to be made for her account or that even she regarded herself as the purchaser. If we were to indulge in inferences, the facts stated in the bill indicate more strongly that the plaintiff lent the money to the defendants to enable them to purchase the- property, believing that in so doing she would have an equitable lien on the property for the repayment of her loan and interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The other set of allegations in the bill, that the plaintiff was an aged German uneducated in the English language and with but little business experience and did not understand \u201cthe nature of the transaction in which she was engaged\u201d when she turned over the money and that the defendants took advantage of her ignorance and practiced undue influence on her, is equally insufficient to state a ground of relief, as it does not state the circumstances of <em>the transaction </em>referred to between her and the defendants or that it was conducted in the English language, and totally fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>state the acts or conduct of the defendants which constituted the alleged taking advantage of or using undue influence upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u201cThe rule is well established/\u2019 says Mr. Pomeroy <em>(Eq. Jur., </em>sec. 843), \u201cthat a simple mistake by a party as to the legal effect of an agreement which he executes or as to the legal result of an act which he performs, is no ground for -either defensive or affirmative relief. If there were no elements of fraud, concealment, misrepresentation, undue influence, violation of confidence reposed, or other inequitable conduct in the transaction, the party who knew or had an opportunity to know the contents of an agreement or other instrument, cannot defeat its performance or obtain its cancellation because he mistook the legal meaning and effect of the whole or any of its provisions.\u201d See to same effect 1 <em>Story Eq. Jur., </em>see. <em>138; Gebb </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>40 Md. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">It follows from what we have said that the decree appealed from must he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed wilth costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
