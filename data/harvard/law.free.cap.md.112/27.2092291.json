Linthicum, Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The bill states that on the 2!th of October, 1905, the plaintiff and Eichmond H. Ford, trading as Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co., executed a written contract, \u201caud specifications' forming a part of same,\u201d whereby the said Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co. \u201ccontracted and agreed to construct and build for the plaintiff\u201d certain buildings and improvements \u201cupon the property of the plaintiff at the southwest corner of Howard and Ostend streets in Baltimore City;\u201d that while the agreement made it clear that Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co. was to receive for the work set out in the specifications \u201cthe actual costs thereof and ten per cent, additional as compensation up to the sum of forty-five thousand dollars, said agreement did not make perfectly clear the further condition that said forty-five thousand dollars was the limiting price agreed upon by said parties for the cost of said work including said ten per cent, commission and that no greater amount than said forty-five thousand dollars was to be paid by the plaintiff for the cost of the work included in said specifications with said ten per cent, commission,\u201d and that \u201csaid agreement also set forth clearly'that all the work done outside of said specifications was to be paid for separately at the market price for same;\u201d that \u201csubsequently on the 10th day of May, 1906, before the completion of said work, the said Eichmond' H. Ford addressed a letter to the plaintiff, signed by him as Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co., stating his understanding of said agreement and desiring that the said provision that said sum of forty-five thousand dollars should be the limit of plaintiff\u2019s total liability for the cost of the work included in the specifications and the commission thereon should be made a distinct part of said agreement,\u201d and that the \u201cplaintiff on May 11, 1906, by letter in reply addressed to Eichmond H.' Ford &amp; Co., accepted the said proposition, and agreed that said provision should form a distinct part of said agreement;\u201d that \u201cthe work went on under the agreement as thus completed and understood by the parties thereto and payments were made on the faith thereof to the said Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co., and accepted by him on account of both work' included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>in said specifications and \u2022work not so included;\u201d and the plaintiff in fulfillment of the agreement paid to Richmond H. Eord &amp; Co., \u201cfor and on account of the cost of the work included in said specifications and commission thereon, the whole of said sum of forty-five thousand dollars as set forth in said contract and in addition thereto jtaid in full, in accordance with the terms of said contract and specification, the cost of all work which, under said contract, was not to he covered hy said forty-five thousand dollars, so that said Richmond H. Ford has been paid in full for the work done under said contract as made between him and the plaintiff and has no just and equitable claim for any further payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">It further charges that on the loth of September, 1906, \u201cRichmond H. Eord, trading as Richmond H. Eord &amp; Co., had filed against him a petition in bankruptcy and was adjudged a bankrupt in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland\u201d and Seth H. Linthicum, the defendant, was elected trustee of the estate of said bankrupt, and that he duly qualified and assumed his duties as such trustee; that the agreement \u201cas first executed on the 27th of October, 1905, had affixed under the signature of the said Richmond II. Eord &amp; Co. \u00e1 seal, though no seal was attached to the signature of the plaintiff, so that the said paper, as the plaintiff is informed, could not, at law, as an agreement be modified or completed by any agreement not under seal;\u201d that the said Seth II. Linthicum, Trustee, \u201con the 30th of October, 1907, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Baltimore City an attachment against the plaintiff as a non-resident claiming the sum of $14,510.49 as being still due and unpaid by the plaintiff on account of said contract,, which said attachment has been removed to the Superior 'Court of Baltimore City, where the said case is now pending and is about to be tried;\u201d that \u201cthe claim upon which said attachment is brought\u2014is a Avholly fictitious and fraudulent claim, being based in a great part upon an alleged cost of the work included in said specifications beyond the said sum of forty-five thousand dollars; and it is the intention.of the said Seth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>H. Linthicum, Trustee, by said attachment proceedings to avoid the effect of said letters which completed the agreement between the said parties and formed a necessary part thereof and to make the plaintiff liable upon an interpretation of a mutilated and imperfect agreement that did not express the real and final agreement of the parties and did mot constitute the agreement under which the parties acted and on the faith of which the plaintiff made his payments to said Richmond1 H. Eord &amp; Go. All of which proceedings \u25a0constitute a great hardship and a fraud upon this plaintiff, who has, as is well known to the said trustee, made full payment to the said Richmond H. Ford &amp; Co. of all that in equity and good conscience the said Richmond H. Ford &amp; Co. or said trustee have ever been entitled to demand on ac\u25a0count of said contract,\u201d and that the plaintiff is without remedy in the matter \u201cunless relieved by the action of a Court -of equity, because the said original paper being a sealed instrument cannot be modified or added to by any subsequent agreement of the parties not under seal.\u201d The prayer of the bill is for an injunction restraining the trustee from further proceedings at law against the plaintiff to collect said claim, and \u201cespecially from proceeding further with the said attachment proceeding in the Superior Oourt of Baltimore City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The letters referred to in the bill are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cBaltimoke, Md., May 10th, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARn\">Harry B.

The plaintiff contends that an obligation under seal cannot be altered except by an instrument executed with the same solemnity, and that in an action at law on a contract under seal, a subsequent agreement not under seal, by which the terms of the original contract are modified, cannot be plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ed as a defense, and relies upon the cases of <em>Zihlman </em>v. <em>Cumberland Glass Co., </em>74 Md. 303, and <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Groh, Doub &amp; Co., </em>90 Md. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In the former case the suit was for a breach of a contract under seal, by which the defendant corporation agreed to pay plaintiff a certain royalty for the use of a patent which had been granted to him. The defendant averred in its second plea that the patent belonged to the plaintiff and his brother, and that in accordance with a <em>prior verbal agreement, </em>the defendant, with the approval of the plaintiff, paid one-half of the royalty earned by the patent to the plaintiff and the other half to his brother. The Court, in affirming the ruling of the Court below sustaining a demurrer to the plea, said: \u201cThis plea is pleaded as a common law defense to an action on a contract under seal. It seeks to vary and contradict not only the express terms of the patent, but those of the sealed contract itself, by verbal proof, and by a <em>verbal agreement </em>made <em>before </em>the contract sued on was executed, and by a verbal agreement or <em>understanding </em>made subsequently thereto. That this is no legal defense to the action seem to us too clear for argument.\u201d In <em>Conner\u2019s Case </em>the bill was filed for the cancellation and reformation of the contract under seal alleged to have been procured by fraud-and misrepresentations, and for an injunction restraining the prosecution of a suit at law on said contract. The defendant contended that the plaintiff \u201chad a full, complete and adequate remedy at law by a plea Tor defense upon equitable grounds\u2019 under sec. 83 of Article 75 of the Oode,\u201d but this Court, speaking through Judge Peak.ce, said: \u201cIf we should now hold that this statute has so enlarged the jurisdiction of Courts of law as to confer upon them the power, of cancelling and reforming contracts, we should destroy, by construction, one of the fundamental distinctions between the jurisdiction of law and equity, and this we are not prepared to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Even if we were to admit that these cases go to the extent of holding that in a suit on a contract under seal the defendant cannot rely, in a Court of law, upon a subsequent agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ment not under seal, made before breach and acted on by the parties, they have no application to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The bill states that the contract of the 27th of October, 1905, was signed and sealed by Eichmond H. Ford &amp; Co., but was not sealed by the plaintiff, and the copy of the contract filed with the bill and included in the record, shows that there is but one seal to the contract, and that is opposite the name of Eichmond H. Ford. The contract is not, therefore, the deed or <em>contract under seal </em>of the plaintiff, and any action in a Court of law against the plaintiff, to recover on this contract, must be based on a simple contract and not on a specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In <em>Stabler </em>v. <em>Cowman, </em>7 G. &amp; J. 287, Buchanan, C. J., states the case as follows: \u201cThis is an action on the case, upon a contract in writing, between the plaintiff and defendant, concluding with these words, \u2018in witness of which, we have hereunto set our hands and seals,\u2019 with the word <em>teste </em>prefixed to the name of the subscribing witness, whose handwriting, he being dead, was proved at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u201cIt was signed and sealed by the plaintiff, and signed by the defendant, but with no appearance of a seal, or of there ever having been one, opposite to, or in any manner connected with his signature. The only seal, or appearance of one upon the instrument, being that of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u201cIssue was taken on the plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and to support the issue on his part, the plaintiff' offered to read this paper in evidence, which being objected to, it was rejected by the Court on the ground that, although having but one seal, it must be taken as sealed by both parties, and therefore, could not be admitted in evidence in this form of action, to prove the contract stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u201cIt could only have been on the ground, that it was the deed of the defendant, and covenant therefore, the proper action, that it was rejected, otherwise it-must have been admitted, as in the case of any other contract not under seal which furnishes the subject of an action on the case.\u201d The Court, after holding that the contract was not the deed of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>fendant, reversed the judgment of the Court below and remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Stabler\u2019s Case </em>was cited and relied on in <em>Western Md. </em>R. <em>R. Co. </em>v. <em>Orendorff, </em>37 Md. 328, where the Court said: \u201cIn <em>Stabler </em>v. <em>Cowman, </em>7 G. &amp; J. 284, where a contract in writing\u2019 was entered into between two parties intended to be signed and sealed by both, but which was signed and sealed by one only, and signed by the other but not sealed, it was held that both were bound, but in different forms; that while it was the covenant of the former, it was merely the parol contract of the latter, and an action of <em>assumpsit </em>against him was sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The contract in this case being the <em>simple contract </em>and not the' deed of the plaintiff, in an action at law on the contract against the plaintiff, any subsequent agreement of the parties affecting the liability of the plaintiff would be available as a defense and admissible in evidence. <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Sangston, </em>5 Md. 321; <em>Atwell </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Md. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Sowerby, </em>37 Md. 410, Judge Stewart, after stating the rule that \u201cparol contemporaneous testimony is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument,\u201d says \u201cwithout doing violence to this long established and useful rule of evidence, it has been held competent to prove by parol a distinct subsequent agreement, waiving, abandoning or modifying the terms of the writing, or to prove an <em>additional supplementary agreement, </em>by parol, hy which <em>something </em>is <em>supplied, </em>that is not in the written contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">As full force and effect can be given to the agreement evidenced by the letters referred to in any action at law against the plaintiff on the original contract, and as no other ground is presented by the bill for the intervention of a Court of equity, we must affirm the decree of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
