High on Receivers, \u00a7 164; <em>Ibid, </em>\u00a7 133, note 4, and case there cited of <em>Glossup </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Bea. 134.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">If the receiver and his sureties upon his bond are officers of the court in any sense, then the court has the inherent power to compel them to obedience to its own orders and decrees in the cause in which the receiver is appointed, through its own modes and this, although they may not he parties to the <em>record </em>of the cause, or capable of being made so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">2 Dan\u2019l Ch\u2019y Pr.

In those courts when a receiver is appointed, he and his sureties enter into a recognizance, which is enrolled and becomes thereby, in effect, a <em>judgment </em>for the amount of the recognizance; but no execution can issue upon it without further proceedings. When the receiver makes default he can be proceeded against by motion, &amp;c., as has been done in this case, or on' motion, notice being given to him and his sureties, leave may be given to proceed in one of the offices of the common law court in chancery, known as the Petty Bag office, by <em>scire facias </em>upon this enrolled recognizance, again'st the receiver and sureties to show cause why execution should not issue thereon, if they did not appear and plead execution issued. If they did appear and plead and issue was made then, and only then, was the question sent to the King\u2019s Bench to be tried by a jury ? Unless the parties appeared and plead in the English courts,' the question was never sent to a law court for trial. And so here it is submitted, that these parties cannot be heard insisting that the case shall be sent to a law court when they never answered even, or showed any cause why the case should be so sent. They do not even pretend now, that they have any defence which they propose to make. The only irregularity in these proceedings at all, is the step taken against the administrator of Henderlite, the receiver, and that was taken in the interest of the appellants here. And as the administrator does not complain the court is not called upon to consider that question. It does appear that where the receiver dies, and it is desired to hold his <em>personal representative </em>responsible, it is necessary to file a bill against him; but, as before stated, no complaint being made by the administrator, the court is not called upon to look into this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">Dan\u2019l Ch\u2019y Pr. Vol. 3 (2d Amer. ed. by Perkins), top p. 2072, side p. 1998.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In this case the default of the receiver was first shown; and in order that the sureties might have an opportunity to see that the accounts were properly taken, they were notified of the time and place of taking the account. Judge Bolling finds that Henderlite, as receiver, collected for the cause the sum of $3,683.53, with interest from September 3d, 1878, which he has never accounted for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">When this was ascertained, an order for payment might at once have been made against these sureties; but for their benefit, hoping that something might be obtained from Bonham, administrator of Henderlite, and he not objecting to this mode of proceeding, an order was made for Bonham, administrator, to pay out of the assets, in his hands, of Henderlite\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">It was only when he did not pay that an order was made upon the sureties of Henderlite, as receiver, to pay, and this we think the circuit court of Wythe had the right to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">The pretension now made for the first time in the appellate court, that the receiver did not give bond, will not avail them, for from the <em>real, </em>record, which is before the court, and which alone this court can consider, the presumption will be that the . receiver did give the hond. The <em>gratuitous </em>certificate of the deputy clerk of the Wythe circuit court, made a. month after the decree appealed from was rendered, cannot he considered by this court. This straw cannot save the drowning appellants. If it he- true, and this ohjection had been made in the court helow, <em>that court </em>could have seen that these sureties were fully protected. See upon the point of this gratuitous certificate, <em>Cahill, Ex\u2019or of Quinn, </em>v. <em>Pintony, </em>4 Munf. 371; <em>Humphrey\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>West\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>3 Rand. 520-21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">Upon the whole case the decree of the court below should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Lewis, P.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">By a decree of the circuit court of Wythe county, entered at its September term, 1878, in the chancery cause therein pending of \u201c Henderlite, trustee, against Thomas and others,\u201d Geo. W. Henderlite was appointed receiver with authority to collect a certain bond and invest the proceeds. The decree required the receiver, before proceeding to act under it, to enter into a bond before the clerk of the court, with good security, in the penalty of $8,000, conditioned according to law. Henderlite executed the required bond with the appellants as his sureties. He after-wards died, having made no report of his acting as receiver, and at the December term, 1882, one V. S. Morgan, the appellee, was appointed receiver as his successor. At the same term a rule was awarded against the administrator of Henderlite to report to the court at its next term what had been \u201c the dealings \u201d of Henderlite as receiver. At the following March term, the administrator, in answer to the rule, reported that no part of the fund had come into his hands, and that he was unable to report what steps had been taken by Henderlite in respect thereto. At the same term William H. Bolling was appointed a commissioner to take certain accounts, who, having taken the same, reported that the sum due from Henderlite, \u201c commissioner or receiver,\u201d was $3,683.53, with interest thereon from September 3d, 1878. The report was confirmed, and a decree entered against Henderlite\u2019s administrator and the sureties on his receiver\u2019s bond for the sum so ascertained to be due, and directing execution to issue for the same. At a subsequent day of the term so much of the decree as authorized execution to issue against the sureties was set aside, and the receiver, V. S. Morgan, was authorized, in the' event of the failure of the administrator to pay the said sum, with interest, within thirty days, to withdraw his predecessor\u2019s bond for suit, or, \u201c at his option, a rule \u201d was awarded him against the sureties, to show cause at the next term why a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>decree should not be entered against them for the said sum with interest and costs. The receiver elected to take a rule, and accordingly the sureties were summoned to appear and show cause why a decree should not he entered against them as aforesaid. They appeared and moved to quash the rule, but the motion was overruled and a decree entered against them for the sum of $3,663.53, with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">This decree is plainly erroneous. In no just sense were the sureties parties to the suit or officers of the court by reason of their suretyship. There was no fund in their hands, or which ought to have gone into their hands, subject to the order of the court, and they could not, therefore, he summarily proceeded against by a rule to show cause. Their liability, if any, grows out of their undertaking as sureties on the bond, and can he ascertained and enforced only by suit on the bond in a common law court, where full opportunity for making defence and the constitutional right of trial by jury can he had. The circuit court was as plainly without jurisdiction to decree against them upon a rule to show cause as in the same proceeding to have condemned them to he hanged. Such a departure from the established mode of procedure renders the decree not only erroneous, but void. The case of <em>Nulton and others </em>v. <em>Isaacs and others, </em>30 Graft. 726, is an authority in point. There certain .judgments against debtors of certain hanks in the hands of a receiver, obtained on summary rules to show cause in the chancery suit in which the receiver was appointed, were held to he invalid. Judge Moncure, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201cWe are of opinion that where, as in this case, the creditors, instead of proceeding by the common law action of debt to recover their claims, obtain an order for their payment on a mere summary rule to show cause, such' an order, though no defence he made to the rule, has not the force and effect of a judgment. The order is void on its face. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of a common law action, in which he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>regularly mate his defence and have the benefit of a trial by jury. An order might, no doubt, have been made in that suit for the collection of debts due the defendant and liable to the claim of the plaintiff. But such collection, if it could not be made without legal proceedings, would have to be made by action at common law.\u201d The decree is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
