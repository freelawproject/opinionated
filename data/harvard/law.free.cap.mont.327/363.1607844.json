We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the Municipal Court violated Alum\u2019s right to trial by jury through its method of jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the Municipal Court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the elements of criminal trespass correctly stated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">\u00b65 3.

Whether the store manager had authority to ask Alum to leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">\u00b67 5. Whether the criminal trespass statute is vague and overbroad. \u00b68 6. Whether other procedural irregularities prejudiced Alum\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">\u00b69 7. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting extra time for the prosecution to file its appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">\u00b610 8. Whether the Municipal Court properly ordered Alum to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-19\">\u00b611 The Smith\u2019s Food and Drug grocery store (Smith\u2019s) in Bozeman houses a branch of Wells Fargo bank. Alum entered this branch on January 29, 2002. Alum wanted to cash a $2,000 check that was drawn on Wells Fargo. Because Alum did not hold an account at Wells Fargo, a teller told him that, per company policy, he would have to stamp his thumbprint on the check if he wished to cash it. Alum was outraged by this policy and demanded to see the branch manager. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>manager repeatedly told him that she would not allow him to cash the check without giving a thumbprint. When he continued to object the manager asked him to leave the bank. Allum then moved just outside of Wells Fargo\u2019s leased area within Smith\u2019s and continued his argument with bank personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b612 At this point two police officers had arrived, and one of them went to tell the manager of Smith\u2019s about the situation. Allum asked one of the officers to issue a police report because, as he explained, he wanted to use the report in a future federal lawsuit. The officer stated that because the bank had not violated any laws he would not issue a report. The Smith\u2019s manager came to the scene of Allum\u2019s commotion and asked Allum to leave the store. After Allum repeatedly refused to leave, the officers arrested him and charged him with criminal trespass. They briefly detained him in a police car in the Smith\u2019s parking lot before he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b613 The Bozeman Municipal Court held a jury trial on July 9, 2002. Allum was convicted and sentenced to six months suspended and a $500 fine. The court also imposed witness and jury costs on Allum of $952.95 and $364.88. Allum appealed his conviction to the District Court where his conviction was affirmed. He now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b614 We review the giving of jury instructions for \u201cwhether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 51, \u00b6 13, 106 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Bowman, </em>2004 MT 119, \u00b6 49, 321 Mont. 176, \u00b6 49, 89 P.3d 986, \u00b6 49). The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review to determine whether the interpretation is correct. <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 396, \u00b6 5, 50 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 5 (citing <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6 17, 307 Mont. 172, \u00b6 17, 36 P.3d 922, \u00b6 17). Whether a statute is unconstitutional is a question of law. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>2003 MT 112, \u00b6 8, 315 Mont. 378, \u00b6 8, 68 P.3d 756, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the Municipal Court violated Allum\u2019s right to trial by jury through its method of jury selection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">\u00b616 Allum contends that the Municipal Court violated his right to trial by jury through its method of selecting jurors. We do not reach this issue because Allum did not object to the seating of the venire at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>time it was sworn. <em>State v. Parrish, </em>2005 MT 112, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 88, \u00b6 12, 111 P.3d 671, \u00b6 12. Allowing Allum to object to the selection process after the impaneling of the jury (indeed, in this case, after it has been dismissed) would deprive the Municipal Court \u201cof the ability to correct any error in the proceedings in a timely fashion.\u201d <em>State v. Ford, </em>2001 MT 230, \u00b6 27, 306 Mont. 517, \u00b6 27, 39 P.3d 108, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the Municipal Court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the elements of criminal trespass correctly stated the law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b618 In its written instructions to the jury the Municipal Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Issues in Criminal Trespass</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">To convict the defendant of Criminal Trespass, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">1. That the defendant entered or remained unlawfully in an occupied structure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">2. That the defendant entered or remained unlawfully in or upon the premises of another; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">3. That the defendant acted knowingly;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Directly below these elements, the instruction contained some additional language. However, in two places the words \u201call of these\u201d and \u201cany of these\u201d were crossed out with pen and \u201cthe necessary\u201d was handwritten above them. Therefore, the revised version read as follows, with the stricken language in parentheses and the handwritten language emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">If you find from your consideration of the evidence that (all of these) <em>the necessary </em>elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">If, on the other hand, you find from your consideration of the evidence that (any of these) <em>the necessary </em>elements have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt then you should find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">Allum asserts that by not requiring the jury to find Allum guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements, the court allowed the jury to pick and choose which elements the State had to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">\u00b619 As is obvious from a reading of the elements themselves, Allum\u2019s argument is incorrect. The State does <em>not </em>have to prove elements 1 <em>and </em>2 and 3 beyond a reasonable doubt. It has to prove 1 <em>or 2, </em>plus 3. For Allum\u2019s argument to make sense we would have to assume that the jury could have read \u201cthe necessary elements\u201d to mean that it could convict Allum through merely finding 1 and 2 but not 3, or by merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>finding a single element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, but not any of the others. Allum provides no reason to think the jury would have made such a tortured reading of the instructions. Instead he merely cites to cases where we have held that all elements of a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Allum is correct that we have recognized that due process \u201crequires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a crime charged in a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>See State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 24, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 24, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 24. However \u201cevery element\u201d does not mean \u201call elements\u201d that are included in a statute when the statute gives alternative elements that may constitute the underlying offense. Allum\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s jury instruction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b620 The Dissent contends that this instruction was not a correct statement of law because \u2018there was no specific unanimity instruction given by the court in this case.\u201d Allum does not raise this argument on appeal, and we therefore decline to address the issue. The Dissent argues that we should address the issue because it is the duty of the trial court to give a unanimity instruction even if not requested by the parties. However, again, not only did Allum not raise the issue at trial, but he does not raise it here. The cases the Dissent cites for the proposition, that the failure to request a unanimity instruction does not prejudice raising the issue on appeal, all involve just that-the raising of the issue on appeal. <em>See Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2002 MT 215, \u00b6 34, 311 Mont. 312, \u00b6 34, 55 P.3d 387, \u00b6 34; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6 25; <em>Billings Leasing Co. v. Payne </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 217, 219, 577 P.2d 386, 388. The above cases do not suggest that an appellate court should, <em>sua sponte, </em>raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b621 <em>Whether the Municipal Court should have given the jury an entrapment instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b622  The Municipal Court refused to give Allum\u2019s proposed instructions regarding an entrapment defense. He argues this was reversible error. This argument has no merit. Both the manager of the bank and the manager of the store asked Allum to leave and Allum insisted on staying. Allum contends that the police officers \u2018incited or induced\u201d him into committing trespass by summoning store managers to the scene so that the managers could ask him to leave. <em>See </em>\u00a745-2-213, MCA (defining entrapment). Locating a person with authority over the property in order to peacefully resolve a dispute does not constitute action inciting or inducing a crime. The Municipal Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>was within its discretion in not instructing the jury on entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>\u00b623 Whether the store manager had authority to ask Allum to leave the premises.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b624 Under the criminal trespass statute, \u00a7 45-6-201(1), MCA, the owner of a property or an \u201cauthorized person\u201d may ask an individual to leave the property. Allum asserts that an \u201cauthorized person\u201d must be someone with <em>written </em>authorization. Therefore, he continues, the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an authorized person asked him to leave the store because it did not prove that the manager of Smith\u2019s had written authorization. He draws this rather novel claim from \u00a770-15-304, MCA, which states, \u201cA power can be executed only by a written instrument which would be sufficient to pass the estate or interest intended to pass under the power if the person executing the power were the actual owner.\u201d A \u201cpower\u201d is separately defined as \u201can authority to do some act in relation to real property or to the creation or revocation of an estate therein or a charge thereon, which the owner granting or reserving such power might himself perform for any purpose.\u201d Section 70-15-301, MCA. At trial, the manager of the store, who is not the owner, admitted that he did not know if his job description stated that he had authority to ask people to leave the property. Allum argues there was reasonable doubt as to whether the manager had such authority, and therefore reasonable doubt as to whether Allum committed trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b625 Allum\u2019s argument has no merit. Under this inventive reading of this State\u2019s statutes governing estates in land, any act concerning real property involving a non-owner would have to be authorized in writing. This is not what Montana\u2019s real property laws require. Section 70-15-304, MCA, is directed toward the transfer of interests in real property such as easements, leases, or executory interests, not the granting of permission or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b626  When the police arrived at the scene of Allum\u2019s commotion, they properly located employees to ascertain who was an \u201cauthorized person\u201d to make decisions regarding the property. We hold that the store manager did not need explicit written authority from the owner in order to exercise the specific power of asking someone to leave the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b627 <em>Whether the criminal trespass statute is vague and overbroad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0H\">\u00b628 Section 45-6-201(1), MCA, states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>A person enters or remains unlawfully in or upon any vehicle, occupied structure, or premises when he is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to do so. Privilege to enter or remain upon land is extended either by the explicit permission of the landowner or other authorized person or by the failure of the landowner or other authorized person to post notice denying entry onto private land. The privilege may be revoked at any time by personal communication of notice by the landowner or other authorized person to the entering person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Allum claims that this statute is vague and/or overbroad. He argues that \u201cauthorized person\u201d must be narrowly construed so as not to violate his rights to due process and free speech. If \u201cauthorized person\u201d is not limited to mean someone who has written authority from the landowner, he continues, the term, and thus the statute, is vague and/or overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b629 The overbreadth doctrine \u2018is an exception to the general rule that statutes are evaluated in light of the situation and facts before the court.\u201d <em>State v. Lilburn </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 258, 264, 875 P.2d 1036, 1040 (citing <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 377, 411, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2558, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, 336 (White, J., concurring)). \u201c[A] statute which can be applied to constitutionally protected speech and expression may be found to be invalid in its entirety, even if it could validly apply to the situation before the court.\u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 264, 875 P.2d at 1040 (citing <em>City of Whitefish v. O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 433, 704 P.2d 1021). However, a statute cannot be challenged just because it might result in an unconstitutional abridgment of speech in a hypothetical case. Rather, the unconstitutional overbreadth must be \u201c \u2018real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 264-65, 875 P.2d at 1040 (quoting <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2918, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 842).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b630 Allum asserts that if \u201cauthorized person\u201d is not limited to mean a person whom the landowner has explicitly given permission in writing then, \u2018Police, prosecutors and judges have unfettered and undefined ability to decide what person might be authorized by a landowner to rescind privilege to enter.\u201d How this might occur Allum does not say. Allum\u2019s challenge is based purely on speculation and does not rise to the level of real and substantial. Therefore, Allum\u2019s overbreadth challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b631  Related to the overbreadth doctrine is that of vagueness. \u201cA statute is void for vagueness on its face if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the statute does not permit his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>contemplated conduct.\u201d <em>Yurczyk v. Yellowstone County, </em>2004 MT 3, <em>\u00b6 </em>33, 319 Mont. 169, \u00b6 33, 83 P.3d 266, \u00b6 33 (citing <em>State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 150, 902 P.2d 14, 18). Section 45-6-201, MCA, gives fair notice. A person of ordinary intelligence who reads the statute will have fair notice that he will have committed trespass if he refuses to leave a store when the manager of the store asks him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">ISSUE SIX</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b632 <em>Whether other procedural irregularities prejudiced Allum\u2019s trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0j\">\u00b633 Allum makes additional claims that his conviction violated due process. First, citing <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, Allum argues that he was denied access to crucial evidence and witnesses for his defense. <em>See State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 52, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 52, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 52 (discussing <em>Brady </em>violations). Under Brady, a defendant must demonstrate that \u201c(1) the State possessed evidence, including impeachment evidence, favorable to the defense; (2) the petitioner did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it with reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 52 (quoting <em>Gollehon v. State, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 6, \u00b6 15, 986 P.2d 395, \u00b6 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b634 On February 6, 2002, eight days after his arrest, Allum filed a discovery request asking the Municipal Court to order the State to obtain the security camera video from the day of his arrest. On February 7,2002, the court issued an order which, among other things, ordered the State to obtain the video. Allum filed the request after discussing the matter at length with the city prosecutor, who advised Allum that the State did not possess a copy of the video, and that the quickest way for Allum to obtain a copy would be to request an Investigative Subpoena from the District Court. A few days after the State received the order, around February 13,2002, the city prosecutor had a conversation with the manager of the bank and learned for the first time that the video in the bank is recorded digitally and that the data is destroyed five to fourteen days after it is recorded. The manager made inquiries and discovered that the data, indeed, had been destroyed. In addition, the city prosecutor learned that even if the State had inquired the day it received the discovery order (no earlier than February 8, 2002), the data would already have been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b635 These facts demonstrate that the State did not commit a <em>Brady </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>violation because the State did not \u201csuppress\u201d the evidence. Neither the State nor Allum knew that the data would be destroyed five to fourteen days after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b636 Allum also claims that the State committed a <em>Brady </em>violation when it successfully moved to quash some of Allum\u2019s subpoenas. These subpoenas were for various witnesses to attend pretrial depositions and trial itself. The Municipal Court granted the State\u2019s motion and quashed Allum\u2019s subpoenas. It quashed the deposition subpoenas because Allum had not demonstrated that the witnesses would be unavailable for trial as required by \u00a746-15-201(1), MCA. Regarding the subpoenas for trial, the court quashed them because the anticipated testimony of the witnesses was either irrelevant or duplicative. Allum sought to call various City of Bozeman officials to testify to police policies. The court concluded that this information was irrelevant under Rules 401-403, M.R.Evid., and that any information they might provide that was germane to Allum\u2019s case was available through other witnesses. We conclude that the State did not commit a <em>Brady </em>violation in moving to quash these witness subpoenas because, again, the State did not seek to suppress favorable evidence, but was merely raising valid statutory and evidentiary concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b637 Allum correctly points out that the State did not file a sworn complaint when it commenced its prosecution. An officer signed the complaint, but it was not sworn to. Allum argues that \u00a746-11-102, MCA, and \u00a7 46-11-110, MCA, require the State to file a sworn complaint at the commencement of a prosecution. This is incorrect. Section 46-11-110, MCA, states, \u2018When a complaint is presented to a court charging a person with the commission of an offense, the court shall examine the sworn complaint or any affidavits, if filed, to determine whether probable cause exists to allow the filing of a charge.\u201d This language does not require a sworn complaint to be filed. Instead, it requires the court to examine a sworn complaint if one is filed. Furthermore, \u00a7 46-11-102, MCA, does not require a sworn complaint. It states that the prosecution of offenses not charged in district court \u201cmust be by complaint.\u201d A \u201csworn\u201d complaint is not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b638  In arguing that our statutes require a sworn complaint in a prosecution such as in the instant case, the Dissent appeals to \u00a746-11-110, MCA, along with the language of \u00a746-11-401(3), MCA (2001). The Dissent concedes that the 2001 legislature amended \u00a746-11-401(3), MCA. However, it points out that the legislature replaced \u201csigned on oath by a peace officer,\u201d \u00a746-11-401(3), MCA (1999), with \u201csigned by a sworn peace officer.\u201d Section 46-11-401(3), MCA (2001). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>with this amendment the legislature eliminated the statute\u2019s requirement that a complaint filed by a peace officer be sworn, it did not alter the above-quoted \u00a746-11-110, MCA. Therefore, reasons the Dissent, Tn amending statutes in piece-meal fashion, the 2001 legislature confused the statutory scheme\u201d and we should conclude that because the legislature did not alter \u00a7 46-11-110, MCA, a complaint filed by a peace officer still must be sworn. However, here we must disagree with the Dissent on two counts. First, the legislature obviously did mean to change the requirement that a peace officer swear to a complaint. <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District </em>Court, 2000 MT 266, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 39, \u00b6 18, 22 P.3d 166, \u00b6 18 (\u201cIt has long been the law that, when the Legislature amends a statute, we will presume that it meant to make some change in the existing law.\u201d). Second, we must restate our above conclusion that \u00a746-11-110, MCA, itself does not require a complaint to be sworn. Therefore, we conclude that a peace officer may file a complaint without swearing to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b639 The Dissent also argues that the complaint should be dismissed because it was not sufficient to allow the court to determine the existence of probable cause. However, Allum does not raise this argument on appeal, and we therefore decline to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Axt\">\u00b640 Finally, Allum points to the fact that the Municipal Court did not hold an omnibus hearing, as required by \u00a746-13-110, MCA. This Court will not reverse a conviction for failure to hold an omnibus hearing without a showing of prejudice. <em>State v. Hildreth </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 423, 427, 884 P.2d 771, 774. Allum has not demonstrated any prejudice regarding the lack of an omnibus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">ISSUE SEVEN</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b641 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting extra time for the prosecution to file its appellate brief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b642 In Allum\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court to the District Court, the State asked for an extension of time to file its brief. The District Court granted this motion and ordered the State to file its brief by December 11,2002. The State did not make this deadline, and the next day, December 12, 2002, asked again for additional time. The court also granted this motion. Allum argues that when the State had not filed its brief by the required date of December 11, the court should have summarily ruled for Allum. Rule 14(c) of the Montana Uniform Municipal Court Rules of Appeal states that the failure to timely file a brief \u201csubjects] the appeal to summary dismissal by the district court.\u201d This language means that the appeal is \u201csubject\u201d to summary dismissal but does not mean that the district court must summarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>dismiss the appeal. Summary dismissal is up to the discretion of the district court, and we conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in allowing an extension one day after the State\u2019s brief was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">ISSUE EIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b643 <em>Whether the Municipal Court properly ordered Allum to pay costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">\u00b644 Allum contends that the Municipal Court improperly imposed witness and jury costs on him. Allum did not make this argument to the Municipal Court, and we therefore decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b645 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Allum\u2019s appeal challenging the judgment and sentence of the Municipal Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Afx\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A10\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u00b646 I dissent to Issues Two and Six. I would reverse and order the charges in this case be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u00b647 Taking Issue Six first, I disagree with the Court\u2019s discussion at \u00b6 37 regarding the complaint. Allum was charged on January 29, 2002, with criminal trespass to property in violation of \u00a7 45-6-203, MCA (2001). The substance of the charge, written on the standard \u2018Notice to Appear and Complaint\u201d form, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">that said defendant did purposely or knowingly or negligently commit the offense of criminal trespass to property towit [sic]: refuse to leave bank/area of store when asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The complaint is signed by an officer; it is not sworn to.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">\u00b648 As the Court points out, \u00a746-11-102(2), MCA, requires that all offenses not charged in District Court \u201cmust be by complaint.\u201d Section 46-11-110, MCA, however, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">Filing complaint. When a complaint is presented to a court charging a person with the commission of an offense, the court shall examine the <em>sworn complaint </em>or any affidavits, if filed, to determine whether probable cause exists to allow the filing of a charge. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Moreover, \u00a746-11-401, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Form of charge. (1) The charge must be in writing and in the name of the state or the appropriate county or municipality and must specify the court in which the charge is filed. The charge must be a plain, concise, and definite statement of the offense charged, including the name of the offense, whether the offense is a misdemeanor or felony, the name of the person charged, and the time and place of the offense as definitely as can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>determined. The charge must state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation, or other provision of law that the defendant is alleged to have violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">(3) If the charge is by complaint, it must be signed by a sworn peace officer, under oath by a person having knowledge of the facts, or by the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The 2001 Legislature amended this statute in such a fashion that there no longer is a requirement that a sworn peace officer sign the complaint under oath. Sec. 1, Ch. 389, L. 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b649 While it may have been the Legislature\u2019s intention to eliminate the need to have a peace officer sign the complaint under oath, nonetheless, the Legislature did not amend \u00a746-11-110, MCA, which still clearly and unambiguously requires the court to examine \u201cthe sworn complaint.\u201d The Court concludes that this language does not require a sworn complaint to be filed, but rather, it requires the court to examine a sworn complaint \u2018if\u2019one is filed. The statute does not say that. The statute requires the court to examine affidavits \u2018if filed.\u201dBut if the only document filed is the complaint, it must be a \u201csworn complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b650 The Court fails to explain how Allum was charged in this case if not by complaint. At least the charging document says he was charged by a \u201cNotice to Appear and Complaint.\u201d And, under \u00a746-11- 102(2), MCA, a \u201cNotice to Appear\u201d will not suffice as a charging document,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as that statute requires the filing of a complaint. And, as noted, \u00a746-11-110, MCA, requires that the complaint that is filed must be a \u201csworn complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b651 Under \u00a746-11-401(3), MCA, the peace officer must be a \u201csworn\u201d officer. Under \u00a746-11-110, MCA, the complaint must be sworn. In amending statutes in piece-meal fashion, the 2001 Legislature confused the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b652 The majority holds that a \u201csworn\u201d complaint does not have to be signed under oath. That conclusion flies in the face of the law and the language. To \u201cswear\u201d means to administer an oath to a person or to take an oath. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1461 (7th ed. 1999). A \u201csworn statement\u201d is one given under oath. <em>Black\u2019s, </em>at 1417. To \u201cswear out\u201d means to make a charge upon oath. Bryan A. Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage </em>863 (2d ed. 1995). \u2018Swear\u201d or \u201csworn\u201d means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>utter or take solemnly an oath or to assert as true or promise under oath. <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>1190 (10th ed. 1997). Apparently, in Montana, a sworn document, henceforth, does not have to be made under oath. A judge is not to omit what has been inserted into a statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The majority have done precisely that here in simply writing out of \u00a746-11-110, MCA, the requirement that a complaint be sworn-i.e., made under oath. The majority is as confused as the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b653 Given, however, that we must apply the statutes in this confused state, the magistrate must examine a sworn complaint for probable cause before allowing the filing of the charges. I know of no way that a complaint can be \u201csworn\u201d unless the court puts the person signing the complaint under oath first. The magistrate must then examine the complaint for probable cause to allow the filing of the charges. It is undisputed that was not accomplished in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b654 Even if the Court gets past the hurdle of an unsworn complaint, in <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, we dealt with a charging document not unlike the one at issue here. There, the defendant was charged with violating \u00a745-6-301, MCA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">in that said defendant did knowingly or purposely or negligently commit the offense of theft of photo negatives/proof sheets between Oct. 19, 1989 and 28 June 1990 from High Country Independent Press. To wit: wildlife photos.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 217, 496 P.2d at 416. On that charge we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag8\">The complaint, here, sets forth nothing but Dighans\u2019 conclusory statement that Sacco committed the offense of theft of the photo negatives and proof sheets. There was no affidavit of probable cause or other written statement of probable cause before the city judge when the decision was made to issue an arrest warrant nor were there any underlying facts within the body of the complaint itself from which the magistrate could make a judicial determination of the existence of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\"><em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 218-19, 496 P.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b655 We then went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">We hold that what appeared on the face of the complaint is an insufficient basis, as a matter of law, upon which to premise a finding of probable cause. <em>[State ex rel. Wicks v. District Court </em>(1972) 159 Mont. 434, 437, 498 P.2d 1202, 1203-04], If the officer simply swears to his bald conclusions that the defendant committed the crime charged without either orally or in writing swearing to the factual basis for those conclusions, the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>has no legal basis on which to make the statutorily required finding of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant of arrest or summons (\u00a746-6-201, MCA (1989)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 219, 496 P.2d at 417. Here, the officer did not even swear to his bald conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b656 Since \u00a7 46-11-110, MCA, requires that the court examine the sworn complaint to determine the existence of probable cause, and since there was no sworn complaint here, and, to boot, an inadequate statement from which the court could determine the existence of probable cause, in any event, I would hold that the complaint at issue must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b657 Finally, while I would not need to reach the issue, I do not agree with our discussion of Issue Two. The court\u2019s instruction was not a correct statement of the law. The jury could have found Allum guilty of entering or remaining (1) \u201cunlawfully in an occupied structure\u201d or, as the Court points out, entering or remaining (2) \u201cunlawfully in or upon the premises of another\u201d-either or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b658 The point is that the jury had to unanimously agree as to which of those charges Allum was guilty. For all we know, three of the jurors may have agreed to (1) and three to (2); maybe two agreed to (1), one to (2) and 3 to both. While there was a general unanimity instruction given, there was no specific unanimity instruction given by the court in this case. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b659 While the Court is correctAllum did not raise the specific unanimity issue-we, nevertheless, have held that, where, as here, this instruction is required, it is reversible error for the trial court not to give a specific unanimity instruction <em>sua sponte. Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-40.</p>\n<p id=\"Am6\">\u00b660 It is the judge\u2019s sole duty to properly instruct in all cases. Indeed, we have adopted the rule that \u00a3It]he court must instruct the jury properly on the controlling issues in the case <em>even though there has been no request for an instruction </em>or the instruction requested is defective.\u201d <em>Billings Leasing Co. v. Payne </em>(1978), 176 Mont 217, 225, 577 P.2d 386, 391 (emphasis added). This duty cannot be delegated to counsel and is especially important in criminal cases because fundamental constitutional protections are at issue. <em>Billings Leasing, </em>176 Mont. at 224-25, 577 P.2d at 390-91. <em>Accord Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2002 MT 215, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 311 Mont. 312, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 55 P.3d 387, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Because Weaver was handed down in 1998, the trial judge in this case knew or should have known of the necessity for a specific unanimity instruction here and faulting counsel does not forgive that lapse. Under <em>Weaver, </em>the failure to give the instruction <em>sua sponte </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b661 A unanimous jury verdict is a fundamental right. Art. II, Sec. 26, Mont. Const.; <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 26. We are abrogating our own fundamental responsibility to uphold the rights of those accused of a crime by, instead, ignoring the Constitution and genuflecting at the altar of a mere rule of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b662 Unfortunately, it is because of decisions like this that the <em>Weaver </em>rule has simply not sunk in with the defense and prosecution bars and the trial courts across the State. <em>See State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12 (and \u00b6\u00b6 35-41, Nelson, J., concurring); <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6\u00b6 63-72, 307 Mont 139, \u00b6\u00b6 63-72, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6\u00b6 63-72; <em>State v. Pope, </em>2003 MT 330, \u00b6\u00b6 66-69,318 Mont. 383, \u00b6\u00b6 66-69,80 P.3d 1232, \u00b6\u00b6 66-69 (and \u00b6\u00b6 71-78, Nelson, J., concurring). Our decision here to not deal with this obvious, reversible error just gives the practicing bar and the courts one more precedential basis for ignoring the <em>Weaver </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b663 Moreover, the <em>sua sponte </em>addition of the words \u2018the necessary\u201d by the court in the jury instruction did nothing to cure this defect. Half of the jurors may have thought that \u2018the necessary\u201d elements were found on (1) and the other half on (2). The \u201cnecessary elements\u201d of (1) are different than the \u201cnecessary elements\u201d of (2). Who knows what all of the jurors agreed to?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b664 The State, as the Court concedes, must prove every element of a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, that meant that the jury had to agree that every element of (1) or (2) or both was proven. Without the giving of a specific unanimity instruction we have no way of knowing what \u201cnecessary elements\u201d the jury found.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b665 In spite of this Opinion, I sincerely hope that practitioners do not start using this instruction. It misstates the law. It is, no doubt, confusing to the jury. And, I believe, giving this instruction will eventually require reversal of a future conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\u00b666 I would reverse and order the charges against Allum dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"> Actually, the \u2018Notice to Appear\u201d simply takes the place of an arrest warrant, but here Allum was arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
