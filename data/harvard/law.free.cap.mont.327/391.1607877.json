We affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b62 D.S. raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court found on clear and convincing evidence that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder beyond a reasonable medical certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court placed D.S. in the least restrictive environment necessary to permit effective treatment and protect both D.S. and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">\u00b65 When Sheriff Dan Springer (Sheriff Springer) delivered a temporary restraining order filed by K.M., D.S.\u2019s ex-girlfriend, D.S. threatened to kill himself and leave a note on his chest telling K.M. \u2018thanks a lot.\u201d Sheriff Springer placed D.S. under protective custody based on these suicidal statements. John Karath (Karath), a licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>clinical social worker, evaluated D.S. and determined that D.S. suffered from a mental illness-Mood Disorder, NOS-and recommended that D.S. be detained and held at the Hospital because D.S. posed an imminent danger to himself. D.S. told Karath that the only thing that kept D.S. from killing himself that day was not having enough gas in the tank. D.S. also declared that he needed to finish an excavating job for a friend that would delay his suicide for at least one week. D.S. also claimed that a number of people connected to a \u201cmeth ring\u201d conspired to keep him and K.M. apart, including having him committed to the Hospital to silence him.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b66 The State filed a petition, pursuant to \u00a753-21-121, MCA, based on Karath\u2019s report to have D.S. committed to the Hospital. The District Court found probable cause that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder and required treatment, appointed an attorney to represent D.S., and set a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b67 The District Court appointed Amy Rue (Rue), a licensed clinical professional counselor and a representative of the Gallatin County Medical Health Clinic, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-123, MCA, as the professional person to examine D.S. and make a recommendation concerning D.S.\u2019s mental health status. Rue evaluated D.S. for one horn* directly before the hearing. Rue read the petition and Karath\u2019s report and she also spoke on the phone with a person who called with information about D.S. D.S. reiterated to Rue that he had contemplated suicide because he was despondent about breaking up with K.M. and that a \u201cmeth ring\u201d was out to get him.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b68 The District Court held a hearing on July 26, 2004, where Rue testified that D.S. \u201cdefinitely appears to be paranoid\u201d and that D.S. may pose a danger to himself and others if the State released him from protective custody. Rue also testified that she had diagnosed D.S. as suffering from Delusional Disorder, NOS based on his significant preoccupation with the \u201cmeth ring\u201d conspiring against him and \u201ctrying to keep him quiet.\u201d D.S. believed, according to Rue, that several people were \u201calienated from him due to his involvement with the drug task force trying to get people put in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b69 Rue acknowledged that even if she could not state with entire certainty the disorder from which D.S. suffered, that in her opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, D.S. suffered from a mental disorder that required commitment. Rue conceded that she had not confirmed, or investigated, the \u201cmeth ring\u201d or whether any conspiracy truly existed. She based her opinion, however, on D.S.\u2019s strong preoccupation with the \u201cmeth ring\u201d conspiracy in conjunction with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>suicidal tendencies. Rue concluded that regardless of whether a conspiracy existed, D.S. still felt despondent and suicidal about his perceived failed relationship with K.M. and \u201c[t]hat situation doesn\u2019t seem to be going away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b610 Rue finally testified that when determining whether someone should be placed at the Hospital or in a group home setting, her recommendation depends on whether \u201csomeone is stabilizing at the hospital.... then sometimes it appears it\u2019s appropriate to get them just in supervised setting to continue that stabilization process here in the community.\u201dRue conceded that she had not spoken with anyone at the Hospital to determine whether D.S. appeared to be stabilizing.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b611 The District Court concluded that it would take further investigation to determine the validity of the conspiracy ring. The court\u2019s inquiry focused instead on D.S.\u2019s statements of suicidal thoughts. The District Court found that proof existed that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder and required treatment and committed D.S. for a period not to exceed three months at the Hospital. The District Court also concluded that the Hospital administrator could discharge D.S. into an appropriate community program if the administrator believed D.S.\u2019s condition had improved. D.S. appeals his involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b612 We review the sufficiency of the evidence in civil commitment proceedings in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and do not disturb a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 104 P.3d 1065, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). When reviewing the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, we merely determine whether its decision was correct. <em>Matter of Mental Health of L.C.B. </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 1, 5, 830 P.2d 1299, 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b613 Whether the District Court found on clear and convincing evidence that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder beyond a reasonable medical certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b614 D.S. contends that the District Court clearly erred in committing him to the Hospital because the State did not provide clear and convincing evidence that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder beyond a reasonable medical certainty pursuant to \u00a753-21-126(2), MCA. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>disagree. We note at the outset that D.S. did not testify himself and that he did not call any witnesses to testify on his behalf in order to undermine the State\u2019s contentions in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b615  A court in a civil commitment proceeding first must determine that the respondent suffers from a mental disorder, and next, determine that the respondent requires commitment. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. The State must prove that respondent requires commitment because his recent and relevant overt acts and omissions pose an imminent threat of self-inflicted injury or injury to others. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. \u2018imminent threat of injury\u201d can be shown without evidence of actual violence or physical harm. <em>Matter of D.D. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 164, 168, 920 P.2d 973, 975; Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. Such threat of injury, however, must be evidenced by overt acts sufficiently recent as to be material and relevant to the person\u2019s present condition. <em>D.D., </em>277 Mont. at 168, 920 P.2d at 975; Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. An overt act need not be a completed act, and \u201can attempt or threat, or even a failure to act, may suffice.\u201d <em>D.D., </em>277 Mont. at 168, 920 P.2d at 975 (citation omitted). An overt act can be evidenced by a present indication of probable physical injury which is likely to occur at any moment or in the immediate future. <em>Matter of C.M. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 171, 173-74, 635 P.2d 273, 274; <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"APD\">\u00b616  Here D.S. first related his suicidal thoughts to Sheriff Springer. D.S.\u2019s suicidal thoughts caused the Sheriff to place D.S. under protective custody. D.S. then repeated his suicidal statements and added his conspiracy theories about the \u201cmeth ring\u201dto Karath, the first evaluator. This evaluation resulted in Karath\u2019s diagnosis that D.S. suffered from a mental illness along with Karath\u2019s recommendation that D.S. be detained and held at the Hospital because D.S. posed an imminent danger to himself. D.S. again reiterated his suicidal aspiration, despondent feelings, and claims about the \u201cmeth ring\u201d conspiracy to the court-appointed evaluator, Rue, who diagnosed D.S. as delusional and paranoid and recommended that D.S. be committed to the Hospital. We conclude that under these circumstances the District Court correctly determined that D.S. seriously contemplated suicide under the influence of a mental disorder and that he posed an imminent danger to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b617 As for proof of D.S.\u2019s mental illness, the State presented testimony that D.S. continued to want a relationship with K.M. who clearly did not want a relationship. Rue conceded that she could not confirm the validity of D.S.\u2019s fears about the \u201cmeth ring\u201d conspiracy and its alleged attempts to block D.S.\u2019s relationship with K.M. The condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>produced D.S.\u2019s thoughts of suicide, however, wanting a relationship with K.M. -lingered. Rue testified that D.S. likely would continue feeling despondent and that he would be unable to focus on other matters until that situation had been resolved. Rue concluded to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that D.S. had a medical disorder requiring commitment because of his suicidal notions. The District Court related that D.S.\u2019s \u201csuicidal thoughts were serious enough for him to be brought to the attention of the Court and the Court is concerned that if there\u2019s not some intervention here that the thought [of suicide] may become reality and he may kill himself and I\u2019m not convinced here that that wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b618  We conclude that the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, contains clear and convincing evidence that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder beyond a reasonable medical certainty. D.S.\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by his several overt acts of relating suicidal thoughts to anyone who would listen, resulted in an imminent threat of danger at least to himself. The Court in <em>In re Mental Health of E.M. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 211, 214, 875 P.2d 355, 357, affirmed E.M.\u2019s commitment based upon her overt acts of making repeated verbal threats to obtain a gun and kill herself and her neighbor. Similarly in <em>Matter of F.B. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 229, 235, 615 P.2d 867, 870, we affirmed F.B.\u2019s commitment based upon his overt acts of being loud, abusive, throwing food, and sitting on his bed wielding a baseball bat while arguing with police officers. <em>See also D.D., </em>277 Mont. at 168-69, 920 P.2d at 975 (holding that D.D.\u2019s statements to the professional person constituted overt acts); <em>but see, C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 23 (concluding that C.R.C.\u2019s statement that \u201cif she had a gun she had shot somebody\u201d did not constitute an overt act because she did not demonstrate an intent or ability to shoot someone). D.S. repeated his intent to commit suicide to Sheriff Springer and two separate evaluators. This type of behavior constitutes overt acts from which the District Court properly found that D.S. suffered from a mental illness and needed treatment. E.M., 265 Mont. at 214, 875 P.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b619 Whether the District Court placed D.S. in the least restrictive environment necessary to permit effective treatment and protect both D.S. and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b620  The District Court found that D.S. suffered from a mental disorder, required treatment, and committed D.S. for a period not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>exceed three months at the Hospital. D.S. argues that the District Court did not address whether the Hospital represented the least restrictive environment in which to treat him. We agree simply for the reason that the District Court did not make a \u201cdetailed statement of facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment\u201d as required by \u00a753-21-127(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b621 The State urges us to take the court\u2019s remark at the hearing that it \u2018had no other option\u201d to mean that the District Court considered the facilities available. Although the court may have understood that other alternatives existed, an oral pronouncement during a hearing cannot overcome the District Court\u2019s requirement to make findings that include, among other things, alternative environments available for D.S.\u2019s treatment, its consideration of those alternatives for D.S.\u2019s treatment, and the reason that it determined those alternatives to be unsuitable for D.S. Section 53-21-127(8), MCA. The District Court failed in its obligation to provide such findings. We therefore remand for a determination, complete with detailed findings of fact, of the least restrictive environment needed to permit effective treatment and to protect D.S. pursuant to \u00a753-21-127(5) and (8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b622 Affirmed in part and remanded in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b421-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Alb\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b623 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b624 In <em>Mental Health of </em>C.R.C., we quoted from our Opinion in <em>In re Mental Health of E.M. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 211, 213, 875 P.2d 355, 356-57, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">we have recognized ... that commitment is required \u201cwhen there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a present indication of probable physical injury likely to occur at any moment or in the immediate future, <em>coupled with the finding ... </em>that the individual is suffering from a mental disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-11\"><em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">\u00b625 Here, the Court concludes at \u00b6 18 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">D.S.\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by his several overt acts of relating suicidal thoughts to anyone who would listen, resulted in an imminent threat of danger at least to himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Basically, what we have concluded here is that D.S.\u2019s mental disorder exists because he has suicidal thoughts, rather than concluding that he both has a mental disorder and that there is in conjunction with the disorder an imminent threat of self-inflicted injury demonstrated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>overt acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>\u00b626 </em>Rue\u2019s initial diagnosis was \u201cdelusional disorder, NOS (not otherwise specified).\u201d However, when questioned about the diagnosis, Rue admitted that she had not been able to conduct a sufficient investigation to determine whether D.S.\u2019s \u201cdelusions\u201d arising out of the \u201cmeth ring conspiracy\u201d had any basis in fact or reality. She said unequivocally that her evaluation of him was not complete, having taken place for only an hour prior to the hearing, and that she would like to have more certainty about his mental disorder. She further admitted that if his preoccupation with the drug conspiracy and his fear of the people involved in it were valid or true, then her diagnosis would be wrong. However, she then went on to opine that D.S. had a mental disorder connected with his threats of suicide. And it was this \u201cmental disorder connected with threats of suicide\u201d that the court relied upon in determining that D.S. should be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b627 As the Court points out, there must be a determination that the person to be committed suffers from a mental disorder beyond a reasonable medical certainty pursuant to \u00a753-21-126(2), MCA. See \u00b6 14 above. Presumably, a reasonable medical certainty that a disorder existed would encompass a medical determination of the nature of the disorder. Not so here. Rue could not specify what the disorder might be; in fact, she agreed with the District Court that, while she was not entirely certain of the name of the disorder, she was nonetheless certain that D.S. had one that required commitment. With all due respect, nothing reasonably medically certain whatsoever could be gleaned from Rue\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b628 Further, even if there was a determinable mental disorder here, there was a total failure of \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a present indication of probable physical injury likely to occur at any moment or in the immediate future ....\u201d <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 22. In fact, Rue admitted under cross-examination that D.S. told her he had decided against suicide. She also admitted that he expressed the belief that suicide was not a good idea or a solution to his problems. D.S. told Rue that, while he had made previous statements about suicide, the counselor who first interviewed him had taken them out of context. Further, although Rue recommended that he be given medication against his will, she had to admit that D.S. had given no indication that he was not willing to take medication nor did he evidence any unwillingness to address any psychological issues which he might have. In short, there was little proof, much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt, of any overt act that posed an imminent threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>self-inflicted injury, as required by \u00a753-21-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>we acknowledged the \u201ccalamitous effect of a commitment,\u201d which include the loss of liberty and damage to the individual\u2019s reputation. We observed that it is because of these dire effects that the mental health statutes must be strictly construed. <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 13. In my judgment, these statutes were not strictly construed when the court, in reliance upon uncertain medical evidence-both as to the existence of a mental disorder and the probability of imminent self-inflicted injury-committed D.S. against his will for ninety days. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AlN\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
