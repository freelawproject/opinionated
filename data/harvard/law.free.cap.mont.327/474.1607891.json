We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s decision to conduct Clark\u2019s trial in absentia pursuant to \u00a746-16-122, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u00b64 On December 5, 2001, Clark was arrested for careless driving, resisting arrest, obstructing a peace officer, operating a motor vehicle with no liability insurance, operating a motor vehicle while privilege suspended, theft by possession of stolen property, operating a motor vehicle with plates assigned to another, obscuring the identity of a machine, and negligent endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u00b65 At arraignment on December 13,2001, Clark entered pleas of not guilty to all offenses, and the Municipal Court scheduled a trial date for either May 7, 2002, or May 17, 2002, with May 7 subsequently being confirmed as the trial date. On April 16, 2002, Clark provided notice to the court that he was prepared to proceed to trial on May 7, 2002. However, on May 2,2002, Clark requested a continuance, citing pain and discomfort from the gout that was affecting his foot and leg. The State objected, arguing that Clark had a history of continuing trials on the basis of a physical ailment. The following day, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Municipal Court issued an order denying the continuance. The court stated Clark\u2019s gout did not prevent him from participating in the trial, and he would be excused only if a licensed physician verified his inability to be present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b66 On May 7, 2002, the day of trial, Clark checked himself into the Bozeman Deaconess Hospital, complaining of chest pains. The Honorable Patricia Carlson (Judge Carlson), who presided over the trial, was advised by her law clerk, Megan Lundberg (Lundberg), that a nurse had called the court regarding Clark\u2019s admission, that hospital staff had been unable to verify his physical complaints, and that he would be released. The nurse, who had inquired what to advise Clark about reporting to court, was told by Lundberg, as instructed by Judge Carlson, to advise Clark to do whatever he wanted, as he knew when the trial was, and that it was now progressing. The court held a sidebar conference with counsel to inform them of this development, whereupon Clark\u2019s attorney Peter Ohman (Ohman) had a private telephone conversation with Clark. Following the conversation and before jury selection, Judge Carlson put the subject of Clark\u2019s absence on the record, and decided to proceed with the trial in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b67 The jury returned guilty verdicts on all but two charges. Subsequently, the court pronounced sentence and issued an arrest warrant for Clark. On May 21,2002, Clark filed a Notice of Appeal and requested a stay of sentence, which the Municipal Court denied. Clark was released on his own recognizance, with conditions, on June 4, 2002, by the District Court. On August 19, 2003, the District Court entered an order affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s decision to continue the trial in absentia. Clark appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b68 Appeals to district court from municipal court are limited to record reviews and questions of law. A \u201cdistrict court may affirm, reverse, or amend any appealed order or judgment ....\u2019\u2019Section 3-6-110, MCA. \u2018The scope of a district court\u2019s review is a question of law because its power to review a municipal court\u2019s decision is provided pursuant to \u00a73-6-110, MCA.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Robertson, </em>2000 MT 52, \u00b6 14, 298 Mont. 419, \u00b6 14, 998 P.2d 144, \u00b6 14. \u2018This Court reviews legal conclusions to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, Clifton, </em>1998 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 287 Mont. 367, \u00b6 14, 955 P.2d 154, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Court\u2019s decision to conduct Clark\u2019s trial in absentia pursuant to \u00a746-16-122, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b610 In the District Court, Clark argued that the Municipal Court\u2019s decision to try him in absentia should be reversed and the matter remanded for a trial wherein he would have an opportunity to be present. Section 46-16-122, MCA, governs the trial of a defendant in absentia in a misdemeanor case, and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">(1) In a misdemeanor case, if the defendant fails to appear in person, either at the time set for the trial or at any time during the course of the trial and if the defendant\u2019s counsel is authorized to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf, the court shall proceed with the trial unless good cause for continuance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">(2) If the defendant\u2019s counsel is not authorized to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf as provided in subsection (1) or if the defendant is not represented by counsel, the court, in its discretion, may do one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">(a) order a continuance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">(b) order bail forfeited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(c) issue an arrest warrant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">(d) proceed with the trial after finding that the defendant had knowledge of the trial date and is voluntarily absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b611 The parties agree that Ohman was not authorized to act on Clark\u2019s behalf, and, therefore, \u00a746-16-122(1), MCA, is inapplicable and \u00a746-16-122(2), MCA, is at issue. Subsection (2) sets forth the court\u2019s options when defense counsel is not authorized to act on an absent defendant\u2019s behalf. A court\u2019s options in response to a defendant\u2019s failure to appear are limited to those set forth in this statute. <em>See Anderson v. Department of Justice </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 109, 112, 943 P.2d 978, 980 (citing <em>Rickett v. City of Billings </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 339, 864 P.2d 793).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\u00b612 Noting a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation under Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Clark contends a trial court should exercise its discretion under \u00a746-16-122, MCA, in consideration of these rights. He argues the trial court abused this discretion by basing its decision upon information not in the record, and by allowing the trial to proceed without a sufficient factual determination about Clark\u2019s medical condition and his ability to be present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\u00b613 The State responds that the Municipal Court was not required pursuant to \u00a746-16-122(2), MCA, to conduct an on-the-record inquiry into the factual basis of Clark\u2019s medical condition before determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>that Clark\u2019s absence was voluntary and conducting the trial in absentia. The State argues that, in light of Clark\u2019s history of absences, the court imposed a reasonable condition requiring written verification from a doctor regarding Clark\u2019s medical condition. In the absence of such verification, the Municipal Court was justified in determining that Clark\u2019s absence was voluntary and unrelated to any valid medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b614  For the trial court to proceed with a trial in the absence of the defendant, the court must find \u201cthat the defendant had knowledge of the trial date and is voluntarily absent.\u2019\u2019Section 46-16-122(2)(d), MCA. It is uncontested that Clark had knowledge of his trial date, evident from his April 16, 2002, notice to the court that he was aware of and also prepared for trial on May 7, 2002. Therefore, the issue becomes whether Clark was voluntarily absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b615  We note initially that a defendant can waive this fundamental right to be present at trial in two ways: (1) failing to appear, or (2) through an express personal waiver. <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 32, 324 Mont. 1, \u00b6 32, 101 P.3d 288, \u00b6 32 (citing State <em>v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 24, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 24, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 24). Here, the court found that Clark waived his fundamental right to be present by admitting himself to the hospital unnecessarily and not appearing in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b616 Although Clark argues the Municipal Court should have conducted an on-the-record inquiry into the factual basis of Clark\u2019s absences, neither \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, nor case law require such fact finding prior to conducting a trial in absentia. Prior to trial, Clark was advised that any absence for claimed medical reasons not accompanied by verification by a physician would be considered a voluntary absence. Despite this advance warning, Clark chose to admit himself to the hospital on the day of trial and failed to appear at trial when hospital staff did not verify his complaints. Clark failed to provide a medical record, a doctor\u2019s phone call, or any verification of his ailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b617  We conclude that the District Court did not err by affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s decision to proceed with the trial in absentia pursuant to \u00a746-16-122, MCA, after finding that Clark was voluntarily absent, and that Clark\u2019s constitutional trial rights were not infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
