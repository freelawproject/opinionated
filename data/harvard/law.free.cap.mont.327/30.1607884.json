Gullett also appeals an order of the District Court which granted him attorney fees and costs. The Van Dykes cross-appeal the order of the District Court which denied their motion to compel entry of partial satisfaction of judgment. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Van Dykes on the grounds that Gullett could not sue for profits lost to his corporation, and to ALTC on the grounds that there was no contract between the parties?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in its order granting attorney fees and costs to Gullett?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying the Van Dykes\u2019 motion to compel entry of partial satisfaction of judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">\u00b66 Gullett entered into a Buy/Sell agreement with the Van Dykes to purchase certain real property situated in Gallatin County, Montana. Gullett delivered to American Land Title Company (ALTC) a check in the amount of $10,000, made payable to Larry Van Dyke, and drawn on the account of C.W. Performance, Inc., d/b/a Bozeman Motor Sports. These funds were an earnest money payment toward the purchase. Gullett expected that ALTC would hold the check in escrow; instead, ALTC released it to the Van Dykes.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\"><em>\u00b67 </em>The agreement failed before the real property was transferred. When the Van Dykes refused to return Gullett\u2019s earnest money, he filed a complaint, seeking the $10,000 together with lost profits which he alleged his business had suffered by lack of those funds. Gullett\u2019s complaint claimed similar damages from ALTC due to ALTC\u2019s alleged breach of an escrow agreement. C.W. Performance, Inc., was not itself a party to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\u00b68 By order dated February 8, 2002, the District Court granted the Van Dykes\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Gullett\u2019s claim for lost profits, ruling that C.W. Performance, Inc., not Gullett, was the real party in interest. The court also granted ALTC\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>judgment, holding that there was no escrow or agreement which imposed a duty on ALTC. Gullett appeals from these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">\u00b69 The remaining issue-whether the Van Dykes were liable to Gullett for return of the $10,000 of earnest money-^was tried to a jury, and judgment was entered in Gullett\u2019s favor. No party has appealed from that judgment. After hearing, by order dated August 13,2003, the District Court awarded Gullett costs and attorney fees in a lesser amount than he had sought. Gullett also appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b610 Following trial, the Van Dykes paid the $10,000 awarded by the judgment, and interest thereon, to Gullett. They moved the District Court to compel entry of a partial satisfaction of judgment for this payment. Gullett opposed the motion, arguing that the unresolved issue of attorney fees and costs prohibited entry of a partial satisfaction of judgment. The District Court denied the motion, and Van Dykes cross-appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b611 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment is <em>de novo, </em>and we apply the same criteria as the district court, based upon Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Fisch v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., </em>2003 MT 76, \u00b6 6, 315 Mont. 13, \u00b6 6, 67 P.3d 267, \u00b6 6. We set forth our inquiry for summary judgment in <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264- 65, 900 P.2d 901, 903, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACX\">\u00b612 Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees and costs is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Lewistown Propane Co. v. Moncur, </em>2002 MT 349, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 368, \u00b6 19, 61 P.3d 780, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Van Dykes and ALTC on the grounds that Gullett could not sue for profits lost to his corporation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b614  The general rule is that shareholders may not sue upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>cause of action belonging to their corporation. <em>First Security Bank of Glendive v. Gary </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 394, 402, 798 P.2d 523, 528; <em>Malcom v. Stondall Land and Investment Co. </em>(1955), 129 Mont. 142, 145-46, 284 P.2d 258, 260. Gullett claims that ALTC\u2019s forwarding of the $10, 000 earnest-money check to the Van Dykes, and the Van Dykes\u2019 refusal to return the money, deprived the corporation of capital which it would have used to generate revenue. This is a claim which properly belongs to the corporation itself, not to Gullett. <em>Richland Nat\u2019l Bank and Trust v. Swenson </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 410, 816 P.2d 1045. \u00b615 Gullett argues, however, that because C.W. Performance, Inc., is an S corporation, it does not afford him the liability protections traditionally associated with the corporate entity, and he therefore should not be barred from claiming lost profits on the corporation\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b616  However, Gullett\u2019s characterization of S corporations is erroneous. \u201cAs a matter of substantive corporate law, an S corporation is organized and operated as any other corporation. The <em>only </em>difference between S corporations and other corporations is that S corporations receive special treatment for federal income tax purposes.\u201d 14A Fletcher Cyc. Corp. \u00a73970.191 (Perm. Ed. 2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b617 In <em>Smith Setzer &amp; Sons, Inc. v. South Carolina Procurement Review Panel </em>(4th Cir.1994), 20 F.3d 1311, the Fourth Circuit held that the sole shareholder lacked standing to sue for loss of revenue and earnings to the corporation notwithstanding its subchapter S election.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">Finally, the fact that Smith Setzer is a \u201csubchapter S\u201d corporation is of no matter.... While an S corporation is treated differently for taxation purposes, it remains a corporation in all other ways, and it and its shareholders are separate entities. This being the case, [the plaintiff] lacks standing to assert this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Smith Setzer, </em>20 F.3d at 1318; <em>see also Kirby v. Coastal Sales Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>(S.D. N.Y. 2000), 82 F.Supp.2d 193, 198 n.l (individual shareholder lacked standing to sue despite the corporation\u2019s subchapter S status); <em>Green v. Bradley Construction, Inc. </em>(Ala. 1983), 431 So.2d 1226 (shareholder must bring claim derivatively notwithstanding shareholder\u2019s argument that due to corporation\u2019s subchapter S status the net income accrued to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b618  We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Van Dykes on the grounds that C.W. Performance, Inc., not Gullett, was the real party in interest on the claim for profits lost to the corporation. Further, resolution of Gullett\u2019s damage claim moots Gullett\u2019s appeal from the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>entry of summary judgment in favor of ALTC, and we need not address the contract grounds on which the District Court held in ALTC\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court err in its order granting attorney fees and costs to </em>Gullett?</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b620 Each party to a lawsuit generally pays its own costs and attorney fees. <em>Thompkins v. Fuller </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 168, 186, 667 P.2d 944, 954. Where the parties have previously agreed upon a different arrangement regarding costs and fees, however, such contractual provisions will govern. <em>Matter of Estate of Dern Family Trust </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 138, 154, 928 P.2d 123, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b621 The contract entered into by Gullett and the Van Dykes included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">ATTORNEY FEES: In any action brought by the Buyer or the Seller to enforce any of the terms of this agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to actual costs and such reasonable attorney fees as the court or arbitrator shall determine just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b622 Following the trial, Gullett sought an award of attorney fees in the amount of $30,266, and an award of costs in the sum of $7,408.15. The District Court began by deducting those fees and costs related to claims on which Gullett had not prevailed, reducing Gullett\u2019s request for that reason to $20,221.33 in fees and $4,491.97 in costs. The District Court then further reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">However, the Court believes a further discount [in fees and costs] is in order to reach a \u2018just\u201d result in light of Gullett\u2019s shared responsibility for this dispute ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">... [M]uch of this dispute was caused by Gullett\u2019s own maneuvering, including his insistence upon a fake contract, appearing to eliminate all reference to the personal property in order to fool his lender, as well as the lack of definiteness both in the contract which Gullett drafted and in his own conduct (he put nothing in writing about the supposed failures of the contingencies^.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">On these equitable grounds, the District Court then further reduced Gullett\u2019s request by one-half, awarding $10,115.66 in fees and $2,245.99 in costs, for a total award of $12,356.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">\u00b623 Addressing attorney fees first, Gullett argues that the District Court abused its discretion in determining the fee award. However, bearing in mind that for a court to abuse its discretion, it must act arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice, <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6 14, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6 14, we find no abuse in the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Gullett. This impression is strengthened by the fact that the contract itself empowered the District Court to determine the award of attorney fees according to its view of what was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u2018just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b624 We find greater merit in Gullett\u2019s contention that the District Court abused its discretion in its award of costs. The District Court believed the contract allowed it to award a \u2018just\u201d amount of costs, in the same manner as attorney fees. However, the contract provision required an award of \u201cactual costs,\u201d and provided discretionary language only with regard to an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b625 In interpreting contracts, this Court has followed a basic rule of grammatical construction that, absent the manifestation of a contrary intention, \u201cqualifying words and phrases should be applied only to the words or phrases immediately preceding, or in other words, the last antecedent.\u201d <em>American Music Co. v. Higbee, </em>2004 MT 349, \u00b6 18, 324 Mont. 348, \u00b6 18, 103 P.3d 518, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted). Here, the main clause of the subject provision indicates two separate awards to which \u201cthe prevailing party... shall be entitled.\u201dThese are \u201cactual costs,\u2019\u2019and \u201csuch reasonable attorney fees as the court or arbitrator shall determine just.\u201d These awards are separated from one another by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d and the latter award-reasonable attorney fees\u201d-is situated within, and governed by, the relative clause, \u201csuch ... as the court ... shall determine just.\u201d Due to the placement of \u201creasonable attorney fees\u201d within this relative clause, and the remoteness of the phrase \u201cactual costs\u201d therefrom, we think it clear that the provision empowered the District Court to award attorney fees on the basis of what is reasonable and just, but not costs, to which the prevailing party was entitled to the actual amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b626  Thus, it was appropriate under the contract for the District Court to disallow costs Gullett incurred in prosecuting claims on which he failed to prevail (\u201cthe <em>prevailing party </em>in such action shall be entitled to actual costs\u201d). However, it was inconsistent with the contract for the District Court to then halve the amount of actual costs on grounds which the contract reserves for consideration of attorney fee awards. We therefore hold that the District Court erred in reducing Gullett\u2019s actual costs of $4,491.97 by half. The contract grants Gullett his actual costs for the claim on which he prevailed, and we reverse and remand for entry of an order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00b627 <em>3. Did the District Court err in denying the Van Dykes\u2019 motion to compel entry of partial satisfaction of judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b628 On cross-appeal, the Van Dykes argue that \u00a7 25-9-311, MCA, required the District Court to enter partial satisfaction of judgment, since they had paid the $10,000 awarded to Gullett by the verdict, together with the interest which had accrued thereon, and only the award of attorney fees and costs, a subject of this appeal, remains to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b629 Section 25-9-311, MCA, reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">Whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact otherwise than upon an execution, the party or attorney must give such acknowledgment or make such endorsement, and upon motion, the court may compel it or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b630 Gullett argues that \u00a725-9-311, MCA, does not allow the district courts to enter, or to order the entry of, a partial satisfaction of judgment. He contends that satisfaction of a judgment must be total before a trial court may properly compel entry of satisfaction thereof, citing <em>Galbreath v. Armstrong </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 387, 193 P.2d 630. In <em>Galbreath, </em>the defendant tendered to the plaintiff a sum which he claimed fully satisfied the district court\u2019s judgment in the plaintiffs favor. When the plaintiff rejected this tender, the district court ordered him to acknowledge satisfaction. We reversed the district court, not on the grounds that satisfaction was only partial, as Gullett implies, but, rather, because the defendant had failed to follow certain statutorily-mandated procedures to accomplish \u201csatisfaction in fact\u201d of the judgment, and thus had disqualified his tender. <em>Galbreath, </em>121 Mont. at 391-92, 193 P.2d at 632-33. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b631 In AAR <em>Constr., Inc. v. Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 102, 695 P.2d 819, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">When a judgment is <em>partially satisfied in fact, </em>or when, by agreement of the parties a judgment debtor is entitled to a credit against a judgment, it is proper to apply... section 25-9-311, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al\"><em>AAR Constr., Inc., </em>215 Mont. at 107, 695 P.2d at 823 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">\u00b632 The statute requires the party to whom the judgment is due, or his attorney, to acknowledge satisfaction of judgment, whether such satisfaction be complete or partial. In the event the party or attorney fails to acknowledge the judgment\u2019s satisfaction, the statute empowers the district court to compel the acknowledgment, or to order that the entry of satisfaction be made without it. In any case, acknowledgment of a judgment\u2019s satisfaction may be compelled, whether partial or total. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>On remand, if Van Dykes still desire entry of a partial satisfaction of judgment, it shall be so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b633 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
