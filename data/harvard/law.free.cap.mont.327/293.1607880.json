(Liberty) and Montana State Fund (State Fund) appeal from the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC). Cassandra Schmill cross-appeals from the same judgment. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">\u00b63 1. Whether the rule announced in <em>Schmill I </em>applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\"><em>\u00b64 </em>2. Whether Schmill\u2019s attorneys are precluded from requesting common fund fees because they did not request them in their initial petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\"><em>\u00b65 </em>3. Whether <em>Schmill I </em>created a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">\u00b66 4. Whether the common fund established by <em>Schmill I </em>created a global lien in all resulting benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">\u00b67 This is the second time we have seen this litigation. In <em>Schmill v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 80, 315 Mont. 51, 67 P.3d 290 <em>(Schmill I), </em>we held that it was a violation of the equal protection clauses of the Montana and United States Constitutions to allow for apportionment deductions for nonoccupational factors in the Occupational Disease Act (ODA), but not in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA). <em>Schmill I, </em>\u00b6 23. Therefore, we concluded that the ODA\u2019s apportionment provision, \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, was unconstitutional. <em>Schmill I, </em>\u00b6 23. The factual background to this litigation is set out in our opinion in <em>Schmill I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b68 On remand, the WCC addressed two primary questions: whether the rule we announced in <em>Schmill I </em>applies retroactively, and whether <em>Schmill I </em>created a common fund. The court answered both in the affirmative. Pursuant to the latter question, the court also concluded that petitioner Schmill\u2019s attorneys were entitled to common fund attorney fees, and that the common fund attorney fees were limited to claims handled by Liberty and thus did not create a global lien. The Appellants argue that the rule in <em>Schmill I </em>does not apply retroactively, that Schmill\u2019s attorneys failed to plead for common fund fees, and that <em>Schmill I </em>did not create a common fund. Schmill cross-appeals the court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Schmill I </em>did not create a global lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b69 After the close of briefing in this appeal we announced <em>Dempsey v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>2004 MT 391, 325 Mont. 207, 104 P.3d 483. <em>Dempsey </em>clarified this State\u2019s rule on the retroactivity of judicial decisions and restricted the circumstances in which a decision may be applied prospectively only. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Because of this change in our retroactivity jurisprudence, we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the question of how <em>Dempsey </em>applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b610 The parties stipulated to a set of facts in their arguments before the WCC. We cite these facts below where appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b611 We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Van Vleet v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties Workers\u2019 Comp. Trust, </em>2004 MT 367, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 517, <em>\u00b6 </em>9, 103 P.3d 544, \u00b6 9. We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Van Vleet, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the rule announced in Schmill I applies retroactively.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQf\">\u00b613 In <em>Dempsey </em>we concluded that the opinions of this Court regarding questions of state law are presumptively retroactive. We allowed for an exception to this presumption when an opinion satisfies all three of the <em>Chevron </em>factors. <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31. This conclusion was consistent with our prior holdings, although admittedly not consistent with some of our prior dicta. <em>See Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 30 (recognizing dicta from <em>Poppleton v. Rollins </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 267, 271, 735 P.2d 286, 289, indicating that only one of the <em>Chevron </em>factors must be satisfied). The <em>Chevron </em>factors originate from <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296, and are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u2018First, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Second, it has been stressed that \u2018we must. . . weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u2019 Finally, we have weighed the inequity imposed by retroactive application, for \u2018[w]here a decision of this Court could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively, there is ample basis in our cases for avoiding the \u2018injustice or hardship\u201d by a holding of nonretroactivity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>404 U.S. at 106-07, 92 S.Ct. at 355, 30 L.Ed.2d at 306 (citations omitted)). Even before our decision in <em>Dempsey, </em>rarely did we conclude that an opinion should be applied prospectively only because it satisfied all three <em>Chevron </em>factors. <em>See Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 30 (noting that only in two relevant instances have we concluded that all three factors were satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b614 Liberty and the State Fund argue that <em>Schmill I </em>satisfies all three factors and that it therefore should be applied prospectively only. The WCC, ruling before our issuance of <em>Dempsey, </em>concluded that <em>Schmill I </em>satisfied none of the factors. As discussed below, we conclude that <em>Schmill I </em>does not meet the second factor. Because this conclusion is dispositive, we do not decide whether the decision meets the first and third factors. <em>See Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 33 (declining to address the second and third factors because the decision in question failed factor one). However, we also note below that the State Fund\u2019s arguments for why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Schmill I </em>meets the third factor are very likely inapposite given the rule of finality that <em>Dempsey </em>also established.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b615 The second <em>Chevron </em>factor, again, requires us to \u201c \u2018weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>404 U.S. at 106-07, 92 S.Ct. at 355, 30 L.Ed.2d at 306 (citations omitted)). This Court has boiled this language down to simply asking whether the retroactive application of a rule of law will further or retard its operation. <em>See Benson v. Heritage Inn, Inc., </em>1998 MT 330, \u00b6 25, 292 Mont. 268, \u00b6 25, 971 P.2d 1227, \u00b6 25; <em>Riley v. Warm Springs State Hosp. </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 518, 521, 748 P.2d 455, 457; <em>LaRoque v. State </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 315, 320, 583 P.2d 1059, 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">\u00b616  The rule of <em>Schmill I </em>in question here is that, under an equal protection analysis, the ODA cannot allow for apportionment deductions for nonoccupational factors if the WCA does not allow for such deductions. A retroactive application of this rule will allow for workers whose occupational diseases arose before our decision in <em>Schmill I </em>to receive full workers\u2019 compensation awards. It will place them on an equal footing with workers whose occupational diseases arise after <em>Schmill I, </em>thus furthering the rule\u2019s aim of equal compensation between the ODA and WCA claimants. Further, a retroactive application will not retard the rule\u2019s operation. Future claimants will not find it more difficult to receive non-apportioned awards if <em>Schmill I </em>applies retroactively. We conclude that since <em>Schmill I </em>does not satisfy the second <em>Chevron </em>factor, the decision applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b617 Liberty and the State Fund, in briefing, devoted a considerable time to addressing the third <em>Chevron </em>factor. That factor requires us to weigh \u201c\u2018the inequity imposed by retroactive application....\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>404 U.S. at 107, 92 S.Ct. at 355, 30 L.Ed.2d at 306). Although, in this case, this weighing does not affect the issue of retroactivity (because of our conclusion regarding the second factor), we comment on the State Fund\u2019s treatment of the third factor because it appears that the State Fund, as well as Liberty and Schmill, may not have grasped the full impact of <em>Dempsey. </em>Although <em>Dempsey </em>emphasized a presumption of retroactivity, it also stated that retroactive application does not mean that prior contrary rulings and settlements are void <em>ah initio. Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31. Rather, due to reasons of finality, TT]he retroactive effect of a decision ... does not apply to cases that became final or were settled prior to a decision\u2019s issuance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Thus, if an occupational disease claim was settled or became final prior to our ruling in <em>Schmitt I </em>then <em>Schmitt I </em>does not affect whatever apportionment might have been deducted from the claim\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">\u00b618 Although the State Fund\u2019s argument recognizes the rejection of the void <em>ab initio </em>rule, the State Fund nonetheless raises the specter of the inequities that would result from a retroactive application of <em>Schmitt I. </em>Drawing from the stipulated facts, the State Fund argues that a retroactive application would affect as many as 3,543 claim files dating back to July 1,1987, and would force the State Fund to review each of those files. This would take many hours of labor, especially because many of the claims are closed and inactive and lack the claimants\u2019 current addresses. In addition, the State Fund estimated that the cost of a retroactive application would total as much as $2.8 million in additional benefits for claims arising between July 1,1987, and the date of <em>Schmitt I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b619 As the State Fund admits, many of these claims are settled, closed, or inactive. From the record before us, it cannot be determined how many of the 3,543 claims would, in the context of workers\u2019 compensation law, be considered \u2018final or settled\u201d under our holding in <em>Schmitt I. </em>We leave that initial determination to the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b620 <em>Whether Schmitt\u2019s attorneys are precluded from requesting common fund fees because they did not request them in their initial pleadings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b621 Before we move on to the issue of whether <em>Schmitt I </em>created a common fund, we must decide whether Schmill\u2019s attorneys properly requested common fund attorney fees. At the beginning of this entire proceeding, Schmill\u2019s attorneys did not plead for common fund attorney fees. Instead, her attorneys merely pled for statutory attorney fees. It was only after our decision in <em>Schmitt I </em>that Schmill\u2019s attorneys prayed for common fund attorney fees. Liberty and the State Fund argue that the WCC erred in awarding common fund attorney fees because it does not have jurisdiction to do so. In addition, Liberty and the State Fund contend that Schmill\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to plead common fund attorney fees in their initial petition estops them from seeking such fees on remand and violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b622  On the jurisdiction issue, Liberty asserts that the WCC can only award \u201cpenalties and assessments allowed against an insurer under chapter 71 ....\u201d Section 39-71-2905, MCA. Since common fund attorney fees are not included in Chapter 71, continues Liberty, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>WCC cannot award them. However, the WCC itself correctly noted that common fund attorney fees are not assessed against an insurer but against claimants. <em>See Schmill v. Liberty Nw. Ins. Corp., </em>2004 MTWCC 47, \u00b6 7 (citing <em>Murer v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 210, 222-23, 942 P.2d 69, 76-77). We have previously stated that \u00a739-71-2905, MCA, grants the WCC broad jurisdictional powers including the \u201cpayment of attorney\u2019s fees and related costs.\u201d <em>Kelleher Law Office v. State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 412, 415, 691 P.2d 823, 825. Therefore, we conclude that the WCC had jurisdiction to award common fund attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b623  As for the contentions of Liberty and the State Fund that Schmill\u2019s attorneys should have pled for common fund attorney fees in their initial petition, they ignore the fact that a common fund does not arise until after the initial round of litigation. The timing is similar to that in <em>Kunst v. Pass, </em>1998 MT 71, \u00b6 38, 288 Mont. 264, \u00b6 38, 957 P.2d 1, \u00b6 38. In <em>Kunst, </em>the relevant statute allowed for an award of attorney fees to a \u201c \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kunst, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting \u00a7 70-24-442(2), MCA). The prevailing plaintiffs did not request attorney fees until after the trial court granted them a directed verdict. We held that because the plaintiffs did not become a \u201cprevailing party\u201d until after the directed verdict \u2018ti]t was thus entirely proper and necessary for Plaintiffs to wait until after the court had granted them a directed verdict to file a motion for attorney\u2019s <em>fees.\u201d Kunst, </em>\u00b6 38. In this case, the common fund did not arise until after we issued <em>Schmill I. </em>Therefore, it was proper for Schmill\u2019s attorneys to wait until post-remand proceedings to request common fund attorney fees. Furthermore, again, because the common fund did not arise until after we issued <em>Schmill I, </em>Schmill\u2019s attorneys are not now estopped from requesting common fund attorney fees and there is no due process violation. Since Schmill\u2019s attorneys properly requested common fund attorney fees, we can reach the issue of whether <em>Schmill I </em>created a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b624 <em>Whether </em>Schmill I <em>created a common fund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b625 After an in-depth analysis of the issue, the WCC concluded that <em>Schmill I </em>created a common fund. The State Fund does not challenge this conclusion. Liberty does challenge the conclusion, but only on the assumption that <em>Schmill I </em>does not apply retroactively. Liberty goes so far as to say that if <em>Schmill I </em>does apply retroactively then the decision did create a common fund. Since we have determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>WCC was correct in concluding that <em>Schmill I </em>does apply retroactively, there is no challenge to the court\u2019s further conclusion that <em>Schmill I </em>created a common fund. Therefore, we do not disturb the court\u2019s conclusion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the common fund established by </em>Schmill I <em>created a global lien in all resulting benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>\u00b627 </em><em> </em>Schmill cross-appeals the WCC\u2019s conclusion that the <em>common </em>fund created in <em>Schmill I </em>did not apply a global lien, but only a lien on claimants whose benefits are paid by Liberty. The WCC stated that \u201c[i]n <em>Ruhd v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MTWCC 38, 1 held that the common fund doctrine extends only to the claimants whose benefits are paid by the respondent insurer. I rejected the claim that the petitioner\u2019s attorney is entitled to a fee from all the claimants who may benefit from the precedent irrespective of the insurer liable for the benefits. While my decision in <em>Ruhd </em>has been appealed to the Supreme Court, I find no reason to reconsider or deviate from my decision.\u201d <em>Schmill v. Liberty Nw. Ins. Corp., </em>2004 MTWCC 47, \u00b6 54. Subsequent to the appeal in the instant case, we reversed the WCC\u2019s decision in <em>Ruhd, </em>concluding that the common fund created in that case \u2018Includes fees culled from all claimants regardless of insurer.\u201d <em>Ruhd v. Liberty Nw. Ins. Corp., </em>2004 MT 236, \u00b6 25, 322 Mont. 478, \u00b6 25, 97 P.3d 561, <em>\u00b6 25. </em>Pursuant to the reasoning of <em>Ruhd </em>we likewise reverse the WCC on this issue, holding that the common fund created in <em>Schmill I </em>applied a global lien against all claimants who may benefit from the decision, not just those whose benefits are paid by Liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b628 We conclude that our decision in <em>Schmill I </em>is retroactive to all cases not yet final or settled at the time of its issuance. Schmill\u2019s attorneys properly requested common fund attorney fees and the common fund created in <em>Schmill I </em>results in a global lien.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
