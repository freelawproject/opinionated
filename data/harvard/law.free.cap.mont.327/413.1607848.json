Wetzel (Wetzel) was charged with, and ultimately pled guilty to, felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs. He appeals the Fifth Judicial District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err in denying Wetzel\u2019s Motion to Suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">\u00b63 At approximately 10:30 p.m. on March 12, 2003, officers responded to an attempted shoplifting call from the Montana City Store. The suspects, later identified as Maria and Scott Wetzel, had left the store by the time the officers arrived, but had driven across the street and entered the Jackson Creek Saloon. As the officers entered the Saloon, they recognized Maria-based upon the store clerk\u2019s detailed description-just as she was entering the women\u2019s bathroom. They also noticed Wetzel, again from the clerk\u2019s description, standing near the gaming machines. Responding officer Deputy Grimsrud directed a female Saloon employee to ask Maria to come out of the bathroom. The employee entered the bathroom and returned, reporting that Maria said she would be out shortly. The employee also advised that Maria was putting some things in the water tank of a toilet. Grimsrud entered the bathroom, detained Maria, checked the toilet tank, and seized two spoons from the tank and one liquid-filled syringe from the floor. Subsequent testing established that the liquid in the syringe was methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">\u00b64 Grimsrud escorted Maria out of the Saloon where Officer Rogstad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>had detained Wetzel. The officers conducted weapons searches of both Wetzel and Maria and found no weapons. Both Wetzel and Maria were handcuffed. Maria then gave the officers consent to search her vehicle. Among other incriminating items, the officers found three more spoons and another syringe. Deputy Grimsrud determined that Maria was on probation and following a telephone conversation with Maria\u2019s probation officer, Grimsrud arrested her for the probation violation of being in a bar and for possible possession of dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia. Maria was placed in the back seat of the officer\u2019s patrol car. After determining that Wetzel was not on probation, his handcuffs were removed and he was told that he could leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b65 It is at this point that Wetzel\u2019s report of the events differs from Grimsrud\u2019s. Wetzel maintained that after he was told he could leave, the officers said they needed to search him one more time, and that it was during this search that Officer Rogstad found an unlabeled brown plastic pharmacy pill bottle in Wetzel\u2019s coat pocket. The bottle contained several pills that were visible through the bottle. When asked what the pills were, Wetzel testified that he did not answer because he did not know what they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b66 Grimsrud, on the other hand, testified that after Wetzel was told he could leave, he asked to get into the backseat of the patrol car with his wife before he left. Wetzel had been speaking to his wife through the open back door of the patrol car. Grimsrud stated that he did not want to deprive the couple of the opportunity to speak privately, but determined that he first needed to conduct a contraband search of Wetzel, which had not been done at the time Wetzel was searched for weapons. The deputy asked for Wetzel\u2019s consent to another search, explaining that he would be looking for contraband, specifically drugs, that Wetzel could possibly pass to his wife while in the car. According to Grimsrud, Wetzel agreed to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b67 It is undisputed that Grimsrud did not tell Wetzel he had the right to refuse the search. Grimsrud maintained, however, that Wetzel understood that the only consequence of refusing the search was that Wetzel would not be allowed in the patrol car with his wife. After Rogstad discovered the pill bottle in Wetzel\u2019s pocket, Grimsrud claims that Wetzel told the officers the pills were Benadryl. Grimsrud, who has suffered from allegeries for many years, could tell by looking at the pills that they were not Benadryl.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b68 Both Wetzel and Grimsrud testified that Grimsrud then seized the pills and told Wetzel he was free to go. The officers then left with Maria en route to the Sheriffs Office. After arriving at the Sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Office, Grimsrud called the St. Peter\u2019s Hospital pharmacist. The deputy removed the pills from the pill bottle and read the imprinted numbers and letters to the pharmacist. The pharmacist identified the pills as dextroamphetamine, a highly controlled drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b69 Wetzel was subsequently arrested and charged with criminal possession of dangerous drugs. On November 4, 2003, Wetzel filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence seeking suppression of the pill bottle and its contents. The District Court conducted a hearing on Wetzel\u2019s Motion and after considering the conflicting testimony, ultimately ruled from the bench at the end of the hearing. The court denied the Motion on the grounds that Wetzel had consented to the search and that it was objectively reasonable under the circumstances for the officers to search the closed container. It is from the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Suppress Evidence that Wetzel appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b610 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence is whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. To determine whether a finding of fact is clearly erroneous, this Court ascertains whether the finding is supported by substantial evidence, whether the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and whether the Court is nevertheless left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. We further review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. This Court\u2019s review is plenary as to whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 19, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 19 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b611 It is not this Court\u2019s function, on appeal, to reweigh conflicting evidence or substitute our evaluation of the evidence for that of the district court. <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 24, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 24 (citations omitted). In cases in which the district court must resolve conflicting testimony, if substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s factual findings, then such findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>Bonnie M. Combs-Demaio Liv. </em>Trust v. <em>Colony, </em>2005 MT 71, \u00b6 16, 326 Mont. 334, \u00b6 16, 109 P.3d 252, \u00b6 16. We defer to the district court in cases in which conflicting testimony is presented because we recognize that the court had the benefit of observing the demeanor of witnesses and rendering a determination of the credibility of those witnesses. <em>In re Marriage of Peetz </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 448, 454, 830 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>543, 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in denying Wetzel\u2019s Motion to Suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b613 Wetzel claims on appeal that the officers committed a series of errors on the evening of March 12, 2003, and that these errors led to the discovery of the controlled substance. To the extent that Wetzel failed to present arguments regarding some of these alleged errors to the District Court, we decline to address them. It is well-established that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>Bekkedahl v. McKittrick, </em>2002 MT 250, \u00b6 31, 312 Mont. 156, \u00b6 31, 58 P.3d 175, \u00b6 31 (citing <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15; <em>Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866). We therefore review only the issues presented to and ruled upon by the District Court-did the police legally search Wetzel and seize the pill bottle, and did the police then lawfully identify the bottle\u2019s contents?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b614 Wetzel argues that even if Grimsrud asked for consent to search him-a contention he disputes-Grimsrud failed to \u201cexpress the consequences of failure to consent,\u201d and, as a result, <em>if </em>consent was given, it was coerced and invalid. Wetzel also argues that because the pills were not obvious contraband (Grimsrud did not know what.they were by merely looking at them), Grimsrud had no right to seize the pill bottle or to subsequently open it and have its contents identified without first obtaining a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b615 The State counters that while the deputy did not \u201cexpress the consequences of failure to consent,\u201d Wetzel clearly understood that the only consequence of his refusal to consent to the search was that he would not be allowed in the patrol car with his wife. Additionally, the State points out that whether a defendant is told the consequences of failure to consent to a search is only one factor that courts consider when determining whether a defendant\u2019s consent is voluntarily given and is not definitive of whether consent is voluntary. The State further asserts that after Wetzel gave consent to be searched and Rogstad discovered the pill bottle, Wetzel did not revoke his consent. Therefore, it was reasonable for Grimsrud to seize the bottle, open it and identify its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u00b616 In <em>State v. Rushton </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 248, 257-58, 870 P.2d 1355, 1361, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, warrantless searches and seizures ... are <em>per se </em>unreasonable subject only to a few carefully drawn exceptions. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854; <em>State v. Kim </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 189, 779 P.2d 512. One of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement arises when a citizen has knowledgeably and voluntarily consented to a search. <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 219, 93 S.Ct. at 2043; \u00a746-5-101, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">The <em>Schneckloth </em>Court made clear that the Constitution requires that consent be voluntarily given, uncontaminated by any duress or coercion, express or implied. In order to determine whether consent to a search was given voluntarily, this Court has adopted the same test used by the Supreme Court, which is the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u201d test. <em>Kim, </em>239 Mont. at 196, 779 P.2d at 517.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af-\">\u00b617 In determining whether consent was voluntarily given under specific circumstances, this Court has considered various factors including whether the defendant was under arrest at the time consent was requested <em>(State v. Yoss </em>(1965), 146 Mont. 508, 409 P.2d 452); whether consent was sought <em>after </em>the search had already been conducted <em>(State v. Olson, </em>2002 MT 211, \u00b6 22, 311 Mont. 270, \u00b6 22, 55 P.3d 935, \u00b6 22); whether the defendant had been expressly informed that he or she had the right to refuse to be searched <em>(Olson, \u00b6 21); </em>and whether the defendant was threatened or coerced in any manner <em>(Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 259, 870 P.2d at 1362-defendants were told that they would be held in custody in their home \u2018Tor a number of hours\u201d if they did not consent to a warrantless search).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b618 The District Court analyzed the \u2018Totality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding Wetzel\u2019s consent. In its ruling, the District Court accepted as true Deputy Grimsrud\u2019s testimony that Wetzel had asked to sit in the back seat of the patrol car with his wife. The court also found that after making such a request, the deputy informed Wetzel he had to submit to a \u201ccontraband\u201d search. The District Court noted that before asking to join his wife in the officer\u2019s car, Wetzel\u2019s handcuffs had been removed and he was told he was free to go. Additionally, the court found that, after asking for permission to enter the car, Wetzel was free to refuse consent to another search and was still free to go. Wetzel was neither under arrest nor was he threatened with arrest at the time Grimsrud asked for consent to search him. The court also noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that Wetzel had been speaking to his wife through the open door of the patrol car and could have continued to do so without undergoing another search. Lastly, the District Court found that after consenting to the search, Wetzel did not revoke his consent once the pill bottle was discovered; therefore, it was reasonable for Grimsrud to open the pill container and identify the pills within.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b619 In <em>State v. Stemple </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 409, 412-13, 646 P.2d 539, 541, Stemple-like Wetzel here-argued that his consent to search his truck was involuntarily given because the officers failed to inform him of his right to refuse consent and therefore he could not intelligently give consent. We noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had expressly rejected this argument in <em>Schneckloth, </em>by holding that a subject\u2019s knowledge of a right to refuse is only one of the factors to be taken into account and is not determinative of the questions of voluntariness. We have since applied this analysis and rule <em>in Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 258, 870 P.2d at 1361, and <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b620  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings are amply supported by Grimsrud\u2019s testimony and are not clearly erroneous. Additionally, the court\u2019s legal conclusion that given the facts presented here, Wetzel\u2019s consent was given voluntarily and knowingly, despite his not having been told that he could refuse consent, is a correct interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b621  We farther conclude that Grimsrud was legally authorized by virtue of Wetzel\u2019s consent to open the container and identify its contents. In <em>State v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, 287 Mont. 151, 953 P.2d 692, we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Parker\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained during a vehicle search on the ground that the vehicle owner consented to the search. Parker was a passenger in a friend\u2019s car that was stopped after an officer observed suspicious behavior by some of the occupants of the car. The owner of the car gave the officer permission to search the car and during the search the officer opened a closed fanny pack containing drugs and paraphernalia. It was later determined that the fanny pack belonged to Parker, who was charged with felony possession of dangerous drugs. Parker challenged the introduction of the contents of the fanny pack, arguing that he had not given consent to search the fanny pack. We concluded that the officer could have reasonably believed that the consent to search the vehicle extended to items inside the vehicle. In support, we cited <em>Florida v. Jimeno </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 248, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297, in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that it is not necessary for police who wish to search closed containers in a car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to request permission to search each container in the car. We explained \u201cthat the basic test of objective reasonableness controls and if an individual\u2019s consent could reasonably be understood to extend to a particular container, a more explicit authorization is not required.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>\u00b6 21, citing <em>Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. at 252, 111 S.Ct. at 1804.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b622  Based upon the foregoing, the District Court did not err in concluding that Grimsrud was authorized to open the pill bottle and identify the pills within, by virtue of Wetzel\u2019s unrevoked voluntary and knowing consent. As we stated in <em>Parker, </em>\u2018Monsent which is given knowingly and voluntarily by an individual with the ability to consent is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b623 Finally, we decline to parse Wetzel\u2019s consent, as the Dissent urges. Wetzel, who presumably knew what he was carrying, acquiesced in what was identified for him as a contraband search, and did not in any way qualify his consent. It is illogical to fault the police for seizing articles which are suspected of being contraband, discovered pursuant to a consensual contraband search. Moreover, we note that the Dissent does not question the reasonableness of the contraband search or the manner in which it was conducted. Thus, we are not here confronted with-and need not address-the extreme example of an officer seizing innocuous articles of clothing or personal effects, as described in \u00b6 7 of the Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b624 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Wetzel\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AcH\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AAgB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u00b625 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b626 The Court has given its stamp of approval to a warrantless seizure without any analysis of the appropriate scope of the seizure. Assuming Officer Grimsrud\u2019s version of the facts, Wetzel, after he was told he could leave, asked to get into the backseat of the patrol car to talk with his wife. Grimsrud was amenable to Wetzel getting in the car so long as Wetzel consented to a search to make sure that he did not have contraband that he could pass to his wife. Officer Rogstad conducted the search and seized a pill bottle found in the pocket of Wetzel\u2019s jacket. Wetzel claimed the pills were Benadryl. Grimsrud did not believe that they were Benadryl so he took the pills to the sheriff s office, called the hospital pharmacy with the pill numbers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>discovered that they were dextroamphetamine, a highly controlled drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b627 Under Montana law, a search of a person must be by authority of a search warrant or in accordance with judicially-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. Section 46-5-101, MCA. Here, the Court relies on Wetzel\u2019s consent as the recognized exception to the warrant requirement. I do not quarrel with the conclusion that Wetzel consented to a contraband search. I do quarrel with the scope of the resulting seizure of the pills. A warrantless seizure, no less than a seizure with a warrant, must be \u201creasonable.\u201d Article II, Section 11, Montana Constitution. Officer Grimsrud testified that it was necessary for him to preserve the integrity of the patrol car-that he could not allow one subject to transfer contraband to another person who is in custody in the car. Accordingly, they \u201casked [Wetzel] for consent to search him for any contraband before he went in the backseat of that car. And it was explained to him why we were doing that.\u201d It was reasonable for the officers to search Wetzel before allowing him into to the patrol car. Furthermore, the explanation given to Wetzel (i.e., the need to protect the integrity of the patrol car) defined the scope of Wetzel\u2019s consent to any search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b628 \u2018When the nature and extent of the detention are minimally intrusive of the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests, the opposing law enforcement interests can support a seizure based on less than probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696, 703, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 2642, 77 L.Ed.2d 110, 118. In this case, neither was the nature and extent of the detention minimally intrusive nor did Officer Grimsrud have any specific articulable facts warranting a reasonable belief that the pills were illegal or providing any reasonable basis for seizing them as contraband. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. at 703, 103 S.Ct. at 2642, 77 L.Ed.2d at 118. In order to assure that Wetzel did not pass anything to his wife, all the officers needed to do was empty his pockets of their contents, allow him to visit with his wife, and return the contents to Wetzel when he exited the car. Once the contents of Wetzel\u2019s pockets were in the officers\u2019 possession, there was no further danger of transmittal to the wife and thus no justification for any further snooping. At that juncture, since Wetzel could not pass the pill bottle to his wife, and the bottle was not obvious or apparent \u201ccontraband,\u201d there was no basis for seizing the pill bottle to examine the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">\u00b629 Officer Grimsrud testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Q: So, you didn\u2019t know what the pills were in the bottle at the time that you seized them at the parking lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">Q: So, you had to wait until later and talk to a pharmacist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">Q: So, you didn\u2019t know they were illegal in the parking lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Q: Why didn\u2019t you just give the pill bottles back to Scott and say</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">good-bye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">A: Because he didn\u2019t tell us the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">\u00b630 To satisfy the requirement that law enforcement have specific, articulable facts warranting a reasonable belief that the pills were illegal, <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. at 703, 103 S.Ct. at 2642, 77 L.Ed.2d at 118, the Court relies on the fact that Officer Grimsrud, himself a user of allergy medications, did not believe Wetzel\u2019s claim that the pills were Benadryl. The Benadryl website indicates that there are no fewer than eight different types of Benadryl, including gel capsules, capsules, \u2018Ultratabs,\u201d\u2018Kapsuls,\u201d dissolving tablets, and a topical cream. Pfizer, <em>Benadryl Products for Adults, at </em>http://www.benadrylusa.com/ benadryl/.asp?sec=3&amp;page=40&amp;from=44 (last visited June 8, 2005). There is nothing in the record indicating that Officer Grimsrud was so well versed in pharmacy that he could recognize all eight types. Furthermore, even assuming that Grimsrud was in a position to recognize all types of Benadryl, that merely means that he could conclude that the pills <em>were not </em>Benadryl. Given that there are tens of thousands of legitimate prescription drugs in numbered pills, determining that the pills are not Benadryl is not the equivalent of positively identifying them as contraband. The Court falls victim to Officer Grimsrud\u2019s fallacy of denying the antecedent. The fact that Benadryl is legal, does not imply that pills which are not Benadryl are not legal. <em>Crouse-Hinds Co. v. InterNorth, Inc. </em>(2nd Cir. 1980) 634 F.2d 690, 702-03. (\u2018The proposition that \u2018A implies B\u2019 is not the equivalent of\u2018non-A implies non-B,\u2019 and neither proposition follows logically from the other.\u201d) (citing J. Cooley, <em>A Primer of Formal Logic </em>7 (1942)). Since Officer Grimsrud concedes that he had no specific and articulable facts warranting a reasonable suspicion of contraband, he could have achieved the governmental interest (integrity of the patrol car) with \u201cminimal intrusion\u201d on Wetzel\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests by simply having Wetzel remove his jacket before entering the car or temporarily seizing and holding the contents of his pockets while he was in the car and returning the contents upon his exit. <em>See Place, </em>462 U.S. at 709-10, 462 S.Ct. at 2645-46, 77 L.Ed.2d at 122-23 (holding that a ninety-minute detention of luggage without informing defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the place to which they were transporting the luggage, what the length of time he might be dispossessed of it, and what arrangements would be made for return of the luggage if the investigation dispelled the suspicion, was unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b631 In the present case, it was constitutionally reasonable for the officers to search Wetzel, temporarily hold the contents of his pockets while he visited with his wife in the patrol car, and then return the contents, including the unopened and ostensibly legal pill bottle to Wetzel. Given that the officers did not know the pills were illegal, it was entirely <em>unreasonable </em>for them to seize and indefinitely hold the pill bottle once Wetzel had exited the car and presented no more risk of transmittal. Under the Court\u2019s rationale (unrestricted seizure of property, irrespective of whether it can be passed on to his wife) it would have been equally permissible (and thus equally appalling) for the officers to seize Wetzel\u2019s jacket and wallet and take them to the sheriff s office so that the officers could rip open the lining of the jacket and rummage through the wallet looking for drugs or evidence of contraband. This unwarranted and unjustified \u2018fishing expedition,\u201d <em>FTC v. Am. Tobacco Co. </em>(1924), 264 U.S. 298, 306, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337, 68 L.Ed. 696, 701, violated Wetzel\u2019s rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b632 I would reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
