A Fergus County jury found Long guilty of two felony counts of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs and not guilty of the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>charges. Long appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Long\u2019s motion for a mistrial because during a second re-direct examination of a witness, a prejudicial statement concerning prior offenses was made before the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in allowing \u201cbindles\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that had not been tested to determine if they contained dangerous drugs to be taken into the jury room during deliberations?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b65 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b66 In May 2002 Rebecca Erickson (Erickson) approached law enforcement with information about the distribution of dangerous drugs in Fergus County. This information instigated an investigation into Long\u2019s activities. In June 2002 Erickson contacted the investigating officer; this time informing him that Long had \u2018fronted\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one bindle of methamphetamine to her. The officer went to Erickson\u2019s residence to retrieve the bindle on June 14, 2002, and also scheduled a controlled purchase for the next day. According to the officer, the bindle retrieved from Erickson on June 14, 2002, contained a \u201cwhite powdery substance in it which field tested positive for methamphetamine.\u201d This bindle was later submitted to the Montana State Crime Lab and it was confirmed that the bindle contained methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\u00b67 On June 15, 2002, two law enforcement officers met with Erickson. One officer searched Erickson\u2019s vehicle while the other searched her person and fitted Erickson with a monitoring device. They gave Erickson $110 to pay for the fronted bindle of drugs and instructed Erickson to purchase additional drugs if possible. Erickson then drove, monitored by law enforcement in a separate vehicle, to Long\u2019s residence. Erickson approached Long\u2019s residence and engaged in conversation with Long. The officers, who monitored the conversation via the wire worn by Erickson, could identify the voices as Erickson\u2019s and Long\u2019s. Following Erickson\u2019s interaction with Long, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Erickson turned over three bindles of alleged dangerous drugs to the officers. According to Erickson the entire $110 was given to Long. Law enforcement submitted the three bindles to the Montana State Crime Lab for testing. Pursuant to office policy the crime lab only tested one of the three bindles; that bindle was found to contain methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b68 On June 20,2002, Erickson, again monitored by law enforcement, attempted to make another purchase. Law enforcement provided Erickson with $70 and following Erickson\u2019s interaction with Long, Erickson turned $40 and one bindle over to law enforcement. Law enforcement submitted the bindle to the Montana State Crime Lab for testing and the lab confirmed that the bindle contained methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b69 A search warrant was obtained for Long\u2019s home. On June 21, 2002, law enforcement executed the search warrant and seized further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b610 Long was charged by amended information with three counts of felony criminal distribution of dangerous drugs and one count of misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. A jury found Long guilty of two counts of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, and not guilty of the third count of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs. She was also found not guilty of misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b611 Additional facts are set forth in the discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AeW\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b612  A district court has wide discretion in determining the scope and extent of reexamination regarding matters brought out on cross-examination. <em>State v. Veis, </em>1998 MT 162, \u00b6 19, 289 Mont. 450, \u00b6 19, 962 P.2d 1153, \u00b6 19. We review the District Court\u2019s action in allowing the prosecution to re-examine its witness following its previous direct, defense\u2019s cross, the State\u2019s re-direct and the defense\u2019s re-cross for abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Shaw </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 298, 302-03, 843 P.2d 316, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b613  A motion for a mistrial will be granted when there is either a demonstration of manifest necessity, or where the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Ford </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 353, 359-60, 926 P.2d 245, 249. We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Scheffelman </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 408, 411, 733 P.2d 348, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b614  Once properly admitted, whether particular items of physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>evidence, not proscribed by statute, may be taken into the jury room during deliberations is within the sound discretion of the District Court. <em>See State v. Christenson </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 351, 361, 820 P.2d 1303, 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err in denying Long\u2019s motion for a mistrial because during a second re-direct examination of a witness, a prejudicial statement concerning prior offenses was made before the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b616 As the last witness during the State\u2019s case in chief, informant Erickson was examined by the prosecution and cross-examined by counsel for Long. Re-examination and re-cross examination were also conducted. On the conclusion of the re-cross examination the prosecutor moved the District Court for permission to again re-open the direct examination of Erickson for the stated purpose of asking questions on a subject defense counsel brought up. After inquiry by the District Court concerning why this was necessary, counsel and the District Court had a conversation off of the record at the bench. Thereafter, defense counsel objected to the further questioning. The objection was overruled and the District Court allowed the State to reopen its direct examination and granted the defense a continuing objection to further questions asked of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b617 During the continued questioning of the witness Erickson, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">[By Ms. Perry, (for the prosecution)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Q. And on any occasion did you ever discuss drugs with the Defendant before May 23rd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">Q. And could you tell us just the substance of those conversations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxE\">Mr. Oldenburg [defense counsel]: Your Honor, I believe it asks for hearsay, and I object on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">Ms. Perry: Your Honor, it will be the statements of the Defendant. I believe that\u2019s an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">The Court: Can you tell us the gist of the discussions without reiterating what the Defendant said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">Witness Erickson: I don\u2019t really know how to say that without referring to my written statement. I don\u2019t really know how to put that without saying - -1 can say it in two sentences, but I don\u2019t know how to word it exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The Court: Make a stab at it. I will let you know, somebody will let you know.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">Witness Erickson: All right. Just that with-by law enforcement picking on her she doesn\u2019t sell to children and just basically that\u2019s-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Mr. Oldenburg: Objection, Your Honor. Your Honor, I would like to make a motion outside the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b618 The District Court took a recess. Defendant made a motion for a mistrial arguing that it was procedurally improper for the District Court to allow the State to re-open direct examination of Erickson after it had already examined her on direct and re-direct, and that allowing such examination resulted in an improper, unnoticed statement of prior bad acts. The State argues that the District Court acted within its discretion when allowing the State to reopen its redirect, that it did not intend to elicit the improper testimony and that any error could be cured by the court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b619 The District Court had the reporter read back the witness\u2019s statement, and listened to the tape recording of the statement. The District Court found as a matter of fact that there was no prejudice to the Defendant that could not be cured by a cautionary instruction. The District Court also found that it was not the intention of either counsel or the District Court to elicit the statement that was made. Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied. Defense counsel was given the option of asking further questions of the witness, but declined to do so. The trial was reconvened and the jury was instructed that they were to disregard the statement set forth above. The State then rested. Defendant presented no witnesses, but based her defense on the lack of credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses, including Erickson, and entrapment. The jury then retired to deliberate, and returned verdicts of guilty on two counts of criminal possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b620 Montana Rule of Evidence 611(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Re-examination and recall. A witness may be re-examined as to the same matters to which the witness testified only in the discretion of the court, but without exception the witness may be re-examined as to any new matter brought out during cross-examination. After the examination of the witness has been concluded by all the parties to the action, that witness may be recalled only in the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b621  Beyond the bare assertion that the District Court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>discretion, Long failed to cite any authority supporting her assertion that it was an abuse of discretion to allow the prosecutor to ask further questions of the witness. Under these facts, allowing the State to reopen its re-direct examination was within the discretion of the District Court, and no abuse of that discretion is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b622 Long next argues that the District Court erred in not granting her motion for a mistrial based on witness Erickson\u2019s statement she \u201cdoesn\u2019t sell to children.\u201d Long argues this comment constitutes evidence of prior crimes, and was improper as no notice was given as required by \u00a746-13-109, MCA; <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 273-74, 602 P.2d 957, 963-64 modified by <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b623 The modified <em>Just </em>rule allows admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., only upon the observation of certain procedural protections. One such procedural protection is a notice requirement whereby the prosecution must notify the defense of its intent to use such evidence. <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142-43, 814 P.2d at 56. Long claims that no notice was provided here and therefore she is entitled to a mistrial based upon the witness\u2019s statement. The State argues that the comments were unsolicited and unintended thus it could not provide the notice required.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b624  A mistrial is appropriate when a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissable evidence may have contributed to the conviction. <em>State v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 14, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">The strength of the evidence against the defendant together with the prejudicial influence of the inadmissible evidence and whether a cautionary, jury instruction could cure any prejudice must be considered in determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to the conviction. A mistrial should be denied, however, for technical errors or defects that do not affect the substantial rights of the defendant and the record is sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt. [Internal citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"><em>State v. Brady, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\"><em>\u00b625 </em>The facts here are analogous to those before this Court in <em>State v. Brush </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 247, 741 P.2d 1333. In <em>Brush, </em>the defendant was charged with multiple counts of sexual assault. The counts were severed for trial. At the trial, on count one an officer testified as to his investigation into the charges and specifically his conversations with an alleged victim of the severed count two. The officer responded by asserting that one of the children had indicated that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tried to touch \u2018both of them\u201d in their private parts. The defense objected, the objection was sustained, and the court directed the jury to disregard any testimony concerning any other alleged offense. At the close of the State\u2019s case the defense moved for a mistrial arguing that these comments were evidence of prior crimes and violated the modified <em>Just </em>rule because the county attorney failed to give notice. The trial court denied this motion finding that the officer\u2019s testimony had not been purposely drawn out by the county attorney. <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 249-51, 741 P.2d at 1334-36. On appeal we affirmed stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjY\">We fail to see how <em>Just </em>applies to a case where the county attorney never intended to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s other crimes and where the testimony was an unintentional response to a non-suggestive question as occurred here. Therefore, we conclude that no <em>Just </em>notice was required under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 250, 741 P.2d at 1335. We also noted that the general rule is that where the trial judge withdraws or strikes improper testimony from the record with an accompanying cautionary instruction to the jury, any error committed by its introduction is presumed cured. <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 251, 741 P.2d at 1335; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 364, 375-76, 715 P.2d 1301, 1308; <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 334, 345, 599 P.2d 368, 374. Further, as we discussed in <em>Freeman, </em>the jury cannot be presumed to ignore their duties to respect the instructions of the court and to decide a case based only upon the evidence admitted. <em>Freeman, </em>183 Mont. at 345-46, 599 P.2d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b626 Like the District Court in <em>Brush, </em>the District Court here found that it was not the intent of counsel nor of the court to elicit the statement complained of. Further, as in <em>Brush, </em>procedural protections were followed to safeguard defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial: the defense objected and moved to make a motion outside the presence of the jury, the court entertained the defense\u2019s motion and denied it finding that a curative instruction would suffice to cure any prejudice, and the court so instructed the jury to disregard the last statement made by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b627  Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the jurors and determine the effect of questionable testimony, it is given a latitude of discretion in its rulings on prejudicial evidence. <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 252-53, 741 P.2d at 1336. Any prejudicial effect the statement may have had was promptly cured by the court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury. <em>See Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 253, 741 P.2d at 1336. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We conclude, based on the record of this case, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b628 Did the District Court err in allowing \u2018bindles\u201d that had not been tested to determine if they contained dangerous drugs to be taken into the jury room during deliberations?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b629 Long was tried on three counts of felony criminal distribution of dangerous drugs and one count of misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. State\u2019s Exhibit 1 contained three bindles, the contents of one bindle had been tested by the State Crime Lab and was found to contain methamphetamine, and no testing had been done on the contents of the other two. The entire exhibit was admitted into evidence, and was viewed by the jury during the trial. At the conclusion of the evidence, Long objected<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Exhibit 1 going into the jury room, and especially objected to allowing the two untested bindles into the jury room during deliberations. The reason given by defense counsel for the objection was that the jury could experiment with the exhibit, and speculate whether the untested bindles contained methamphetamine, and thus they should not have it available.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b630 The District Judge asked counsel for both parties if they were aware of any precedent which would prohibit the Exhibit from being in the jury room during deliberations, and none was forthcoming. The judge overruled the objection and allowed the exhibit to be delivered to the jury. The Court also instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">You are instructed that State\u2019s Exhibit 1 contains three paper bindles. The contents of only one of the bindles was analyzed or tested by the Montana State Crime Lab and alleged to contain methamphetamine. You shall not speculate as to the contents of the other two bindles\u2019 contents as they were not tested nor analyzed by the Montana State Crime Lab.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b631 Although we have never squarely addressed the issue of whether exhibits allegedly containing dangerous drugs should be allowed in the jury room, we have noted that permitting the jury to examine physical evidence in conjunction with trial testimony \u2018is not only permissible but enlightened.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 415, 424, 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>P.2d 1115, 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b632 Long again argues on appeal that allowing the untested bindles in the jury room could lead to juror experiments and speculation about whether the untested bindles contained dangerous drugs. Long further argues, for the first time on appeal, that because the District Court did not expressly find that the physical evidence of the three bindles was necessary for the jury to deliberate on, it failed to comply with \u00a746-16-504, MCA, and therefore, the items were improperly allowed in the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b633 Conversely, the State argues that the criminal distribution charge was supported by the tested bindles and that any untested bindles, in addition to other physical evidence, supported the paraphernalia charge. Further, the State argued that the District Court\u2019s discussion with counsel and ultimate ruling allowing the materials into the jury room complied with \u00a7 46-16-504, MCA, and the court\u2019s cautionary instruction cured any prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b634 Section 46-16-504, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Upon retiring for deliberation, the jurors may take with them the written jury instructions read by the court, notes of the proceedings taken by themselves, and all exhibits that have been received as evidence in the cause that in the opinion of the court will be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b635 Here, even though the District Judge requested authority on the point, \u00a746-16-504, MCA, was not called to his attention. It would be unfair to the District Court to reverse a discretionary decision on a point of law that was not raised and was argued for the first time on appeal. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (stating \u201c[t]he general rule in Montana is that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. The basis for the general rule is that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b636 Further, Long directs us to no authority in which we have ever required that the District Court make an express finding that a particular exhibit, which has been admitted into evidence, is necessary before allowing that evidence to be in the jury room during its deliberations. We conclude the District Court\u2019s careful consideration of this issue and its cautionary instruction complied with the requirements of \u00a746-16-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u00b637 The jury had viewed the entire exhibit during the trial. The jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>were instructed that they were not to speculate that the untested bindles contained dangerous drugs. Long was charged with sale of dangerous drugs, and one of the bindles was proven to contain such. Long did not contest the fact that methamphetamine was in one of the bindles that Erickson delivered to the Sheriffs deputies. Rather, her defenses were an attack on the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses and entrapment. Under these circumstances we fail to see how Long could have been denied a fair trial by allowing the untested bindles to be taken into the jury room during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b638  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the entire State\u2019s Exhibit 1 into the jury room during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b639 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-11\"> A \u201cbindle\u201d is a piece of paper or similar material onto which a powdered substance is placed and the material folded so that it encloses the substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\"> In this context fronting means that the item is given now and payment is expected later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> Long did not object to Exhibits 2 and 3 going to the jury room during deliberations. Exhibit 2 and 3 each contained one bindle. Each Exhibit was tested by the Montana State Crime Lab and was found to contain methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b272-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A3x\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\"><em>\u00b640 </em>I concur in our Opinion with one caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b641 Here, the two untested bindles were largely irrelevant as to the distribution charges. Distributing one bindle accomplished the same result as distributing three. That said, I suggest that it suspends the laws of human nature to expect that jurors, presented with three similar bindles, only one of which was tested, will not speculate that the other two contain dangerous drugs as well-an instruction to the contrary notwithstanding. Any error in admitting the untested bindles here, however, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u00b642 My concern is that the rationale of this case not be applied in cases where the charges involve a certain quantity or certain quality of a dangerous drug. For example, under \u00a745-9-102, MCA, possessing more than a certain quantity of marijuana or hashish (\u00a745-9-102(2), MCA) can turn a misdemeanor into a felony (\u00a745-9-102(5), MCA). In those cases, I would require the State to actually test each unit of drug that will be used to prove the more serious charge. In those cases, use of the untested units of drugs may well prejudicially affect the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\u00b643 With that caveat, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
