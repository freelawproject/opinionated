We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u00b62 We must address whether the District Court correctly denied Shaw\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from a search of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\u00b63 Cascade County Deputy Sheriff Scott Van Dyken (Van Dyken) stopped Shaw for speeding just past midnight on January 11, 2003. Van Dyken initiated an investigation and discovered that Shaw also had a suspended license and no proof of insurance. Shaw informed Van Dyken that she was 18 years-old and that the car belonged to her mother. Van Dyken became concerned during his conversation with Shaw about the odor of alcohol emanating from her person and her car and asked whether she and her passenger would get out of the vehicle. Van Dyken then asked Shaw whether he could search her car and Shaw consented. Van Dyken\u2019s search resulted in his finding an open container of alcohol, a marijuana pipe, and a scale used for weighing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u00b64 The State charged Shaw with possession of drug paraphernalia and minor in possession of alcohol in addition to the driving-related charges of speeding, driving while license suspended and no proof of insurance. Shaw filed a motion before trial seeking to suppress the evidence seized from the search of her vehicle. She argued that deputy Van Dyken had coerced her consent by threatening to impound her car. Van Dyken testified that he simply asked for permission to search Shaw\u2019s car, which she granted, and that Shaw never revoked her consent to the search. The District Court denied Shaw\u2019s motion to suppress. Thereafter, the court conducted a bench trial and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Shaw guilty on all counts. Shaw timely appeals the minor in possession of alcohol and possession of drug paraphernalia charges on the basis that police illegally obtained the evidence underlying the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of facts prove clearly erroneous and whether its application and interpretation of the law remains correct. <em>State v. Dewitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 21, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 21. It remains within the province of the trial court to resolve conflicting testimony based upon its assessment of the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and credibility and this court will not resolve such conflicts on appeal. <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, \u00b6 24, 294 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 982 P.2d 421, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>Matter of T.N. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 81, 85, 881 P.2d 1329, 1332).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b66 Shaw argues that evidence obtained during the vehicle search proves inadmissible due to the involuntary nature of her consent. She claims that Van Dyken coerced her consent by threatening to have her mother\u2019s car impounded until he could procure a valid warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b67 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456. Warrantless searches and seizures remain <em>per se </em>unreasonable absent a few carefully drawn exceptions. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 39. A warrantless search of a vehicle in Montana requires both the existence of probable cause and a generally recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b68  Probable cause exists when facts and circumstances within an officer\u2019s personal knowledge prove sufficient \u201cto warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Dolan </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 245, 253, 940 P.2d 436, 440. Deputy Van Dyken possessed the requisite probable cause to initiate a search of Shaw\u2019s vehicle. <em>Dolan, </em>283 Mont. at 253, 940 P.2d at 440. Van Dyken smelled the odor of alcohol on Shaw. Van Dyken knew that Shaw was not of the legal drinking age based on her statement that she was 18 years-old. The odor of alcohol also proved sufficient, based on Van Dyken\u2019s experience as an officer, to warrant a reasonable belief that Shaw remained under the influence of alcohol while operating a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>vehicle and could have alcohol in her possession. <em>Dolan, </em>283 Mont. at 253, 940 P.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b69 An individual\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent to a search constitutes one of the generally recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Olson, </em>2002 MT 211, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 270, \u00b6 20, 55 P.3d 935, \u00b6 20. An individual\u2019s consent remains valid unless contaminated by express or implied duress or coercion. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 20. We determine whether an individual\u2019s consent to a search proves voluntary by examining the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Kim </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 189, 779 P.2d 512 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Cope </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 387, 819 P.2d 1280).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b610 In <em>State v. Rushton </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 248, 870 P.2d 1355, we determined under the totality of the circumstances that the police fostered a coercive atmosphere when they promised that the defendant\u2019s cooperation to a search would avert incarceration and implied that they could sit in defendant\u2019s home for a number of hours without a warrant regardless of the scope of defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 259, 870 P.2d at 1362 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Hermes </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 446, 904 P.2d 587).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b611  Shaw knowingly and voluntarily consented to a search of her vehicle. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 20. The District Court received testimony at the suppression hearing from both parties concerning Shaw\u2019s consent. Between the testimony presented, the court found more reliable testimony from Van Dyken that Shaw consented to a search of her vehicle and that she never revoked her consent. The court found that the \u201cdefendant gave up equivocal specific consent to search... [that] is supported not only by the officer\u2019s testimony, but by the defendant\u2019s testimony that she didn\u2019t believe there was any alcohol or drugs in the vehicle.\u201d The court further determined that Van Dyken\u2019s <em>alleged </em>threats to impound Shaw\u2019s vehicle, even if true, failed to amount to coercion. Indeed, unlike the officers\u2019 conduct in <em>Rushton, </em>Van Dyken made no promises to Shaw regarding averting incarceration if she consented to a search and Van Dyken did not threaten to circumvent the scope of Shaw\u2019s consent absent a warrant. <em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 259, 870 P.2d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b612  It falls within the trial court\u2019s domain to resolve conflicts in the evidence based on its assessment of the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses before it, and this Court will not impose its own resolution of these conflicts on appeal. <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 24. We therefore conclude based on the evidence presented at the suppression hearing that Van Dyken had probable cause to search Shaw\u2019s vehicle and Shaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b613 Thus, the District Court correctly denied Shaw\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from a search other vehicle. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
