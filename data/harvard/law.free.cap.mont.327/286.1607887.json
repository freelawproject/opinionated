Hudson appeals his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding Hudson\u2019s actual physical control of the vehicle violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the admissibility of Hudson\u2019s refusal to submit to field sobriety tests constitutes an improper comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b65 Paramedics responded to a call in the early morning hours of August 17, 2003, regarding a person passed out in a vehicle that was parked the wrong way in a ditch along Highway 312 near Huntley, Montana. The paramedics arrived at the scene and found Hudson asleep in the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, with the motor running, the window partially rolled down, and the headlights shining and the radio playing. Hudson, though asleep, remained upright in the driver\u2019s seat until paramedics reached through the window and contacted him. Hudson, once awakened, attempted to put the car in drive before the paramedics seized the keys and turned off the ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b66 The paramedics called for police assistance after observing that Hudson smelled of alcohol, slurred his speech, and swayed noticeably while standing. Officers arrived at the scene ten minutes later and questioned Hudson regarding his whereabouts over the course of the evening. Hudson admitted to drinking with a friend for most of the afternoon and evening, but denied driving the vehicle. He claimed instead that his friend had abandoned him alone with the car after an argument had arisen between the two. Hudson refused to perform field sobriety maneuvers upon the officers\u2019 requests and the officers arrested and later cited Hudson for being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b67 The State filed an Information on August 22, 2003, charging Hudson with driving while the under the influence of alcohol, a felony, in violation of \u00a761-8-401, MCA, that makes it unlawful for a person who is under the influence of alcohol to drive or be in \u201cactual physical control of a vehicle\u201d upon public roadways. Hudson admitted at trial that he remained intoxicated and asleep in the driver\u2019s seat with the keys in the ignition at the time police arrested him. Hudson testified, however, that he did not operate, and did not intend to operate, the vehicle at any time and stayed in the car merely to \u201csleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u00b68 The parties submitted proposed jury instructions to the District Court at the conclusion of the trial. Hudson objected to the State\u2019s proposed instruction that defined \u201cactual physical control\u201dpursuant to \u00a761-8-401, MCA, as \u2018ta] person is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle if the person is not a passenger, and is in a position to, and had the ability to, operate the vehicle in question.\u201d Hudson objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>instruction on the grounds that it misstated the law in Montana. Hudson argued instead for an instruction that permitted the jury to find whether the defendant drove to where the authorities found the vehicle and whether the defendant intended to drive. The court refused Hudson\u2019s proposed jury instruction. Hudson also objected to the State\u2019s proposed instruction regarding the admissibility of his refusal to submit to field sobriety tests on the grounds that it improperly commented on the evidence. The court adopted the State\u2019s proposed instructions on \u201cactual physical control\u201dand Hudson\u2019s refusal to submit to field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b69 The jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of driving while under the influence of alcohol. The District Court sentenced Hudson to thirteen months in a community-based program for alcohol treatment, with eligibility for parole upon successful completion of the program. The court further sentenced Hudson to prison for a term of three years, all suspended, with conditions to run consecutively to the conditions of his treatment program. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s jury instructions to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. </em>Baker, 2000 MT 307, \u00b6 26, 302 Mont. 408, \u00b6 26, 15 P.3d 379, \u00b6 26. The district court maintains broad discretion when instructing the jury. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2001 MT 236, \u00b6 10, 307 Mont. 34, \u00b6 10, 36 P.3d 405, \u00b6 10. The instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights to constitute reversible error. <em>State v. Goulet </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 38, 41, 938 P.2d 1330, 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b611 Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding Hudson\u2019s actual physical control of the vehicle violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b612 Hudson argues that the District Court erred when it instructed the jury that actual physical control of a vehicle only requires that the person remains in a position to and has the ability to operate the vehicle. Hudson maintains that the \u201cactual physical control\u201d instruction proposed by the State does not properly set out the law in Montana. Hudson invites the Court to modify the \u201cactual physical control\u201d instruction to address whether the trier of fact believed the person under the influence drove the vehicle to the location and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>whether the person intended to operate the vehicle. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b613  To convict a person of driving under the influence, the State must prove that the defendant was: (1) driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle; (2) upon the ways of the state open to the public; and (3) while under the influence of alcohol. <em>State v. Hagen </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 156, 939 P.2d 994 (citing \u00a761-8-401, MCA). A person has \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a vehicle when he or she \u201chas existing or present bodily restraint, directing influence, domination or regulation\u201d of a vehicle. <em>State v. Robison </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 64, 66, 931 P.2d 706, 707 (citations omitted). We impose absolute liability for felony DUI convictions. <em>State v. Ellenburg </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 136, 938 P.2d 1376. \u00b614 In <em>Robison </em>we rejected a court\u2019s jury instruction that expanded</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">the definition of \u201cactual physical control\u201d to encompass any intoxicated passenger in the vehicle. <em>Robison, </em>281 Mont. at 68, 931 P.2d at 708. We reasoned that the court\u2019s instruction misstated the law by including intoxicated passengers who were \u201cphysically inside an operational motor vehicle with the potential to operate or drive that motor vehicle\u201d but who actually had never driven while intoxicated. <em>Robison, 281 </em>Mont. at 68, 931 P.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b615 [2] The District Court correctly instructed the jury regarding Hudson\u2019s \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle. The court\u2019s instruction proves identical to the Model Criminal Jury Instruction produced by the Criminal Jury Instruction Commission and accurately reflects the law as developed by judicial interpretation. <em>See State v. Ruona </em>(1958), 133 Mont. 243, 321 P.2d 615; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 284, 661 P.2d 33; <em>State v. Ryan </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 7, 744 P.2d 1242; <em>Turner v. State </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 151, 795 P.2d 982. The court\u2019s jury instruction, therefore, does not suffer from the same defects as <em>Robison </em>as the court correctly communicated the appropriate law requiring that a person remain \u2018In a position to, and have the ability to, operate the vehicle in question.\u201d Further, the offense of driving while under the influence remains a strict liability offense that does not require an intent element and we will not add one here. <em>Ellenburg, </em>283 Mont. at 137, 938 P.2d at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b616 The evidence at trial demonstrated that Hudson remained in a position to exert actual physical control over the vehicle. Paramedics found Hudson behind the wheel of the vehicle, with the motor running, the window partially rolled down, and the headlights and radio on. Hudson attempted to put the vehicle in drive when paramedics awoke him and Hudson himself testified that he remained in the driver\u2019s seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>with the keys in the ignition when the paramedics approached. We held in <em>Taylor, </em>that a motorist remains in a position to regulate a vehicle while asleep behind the steering wheel of a vehicle stuck in a borrow pit. <em>Taylor, </em>203 Mont. at 287, 661 P.2d at 34. Hudson satisfies this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b617  An instruction must be supported either by direct evidence or some logical inference from the evidence presented. <em>State v. Miner </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 260, 267, 546 P.2d 252, 256. Under the given instructions, if the jury believed Hudson\u2019s theory of the incident, they could have found in his favor. It remained the jury\u2019s duty to determine, however, which account of the incident, the State\u2019s or Hudson\u2019s, they believed more credible and worthy of belief. <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 290, 294, 546 P.2d 518, 520 (holding it remains the function of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony). No error occurs where the district court adequately instructed the jury. <em>State v. Kirkaldie </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 283, 293, 587 P.2d 1298, 1304. We conclude that the District Court fully and accurately instructed the jury and Hudson had ample opportunity to argue the merits of his defense. Accordingly, we determine that the District Court properly instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cactual physical control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b618 Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the admissibility of Hudson\u2019s refusal to submit to field sobriety tests constitutes an improper comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b619 Hudson next argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it instructed the jury that evidence he refused to submit to field sobriety test remained admissible. Hudson contends that the court\u2019s jury instruction amounted to an improper comment on the evidence and should have been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b620  Evidence of a refusal to submit to field sobriety tests, including the breathalyzer, remains admissible in any criminal action or proceeding. <em>City of Helena v. Barrett </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 35, 37, 798 P.2d 544, 545 (citing \u00a761-8-404(2), MCA). Any person who operates a motor vehicle within the State shall be deemed to have given his implied consent to a chemical test to determine the alcohol content of his blood if arrested by a police officer on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>City of Missoula v. Forest </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 129, 133, 769 P.2d 699, 701-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b621  The District Court correctly instructed the jury regarding the admissibility of Hudson\u2019s refusal to submit to the field sobriety tests. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Hudson argues that evidence of his refusal tends to be only marginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt. Hudson cites to our decision in <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, 297 Mont. 111, 991 P.2d 929, in which we suggested that the evidence of flight by a defendant more properly should be left for counsel to argue to the jury rather than for the court to instruct the jury. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 46. We conclude, however, that <em>Hall </em>proves inapposite here as a statute specifically provides that evidence of refusal remains admissible. Section 61-8-404(2), MCA. Moreover, the court instructed the jury that evidence of refusal simply constitutes another factor to be considered along with all other relevant, competent evidence in determining whether a person remains guilty. The District Court\u2019s jury Instruction mirrored the language of the statute and thus correctly set forth the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b622  It remains the function of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. <em>State v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 28, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 28, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 28. Once again, no error occurs where the district court adequately instructed the jury. <em>Kirkaldie, </em>179 Mont. at 293, 587 P.2d at 1304. We conclude that the District Court fully and accurately instructed the jury and Hudson had ample opportunity to argue the merits of his defense. We determine that the District Court properly instructed the jury on the admissibility of Hudson\u2019s refusal to submit to field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
