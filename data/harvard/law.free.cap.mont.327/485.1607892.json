We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting photographs of Stuart\u2019s stab wounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">\u00b64 Did Kearney\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance by calling Dr. Bentzel as a witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">\u00b65 Kearney and Stuart met in Pennsylvania, became romantically involved with each other, and moved to Montana together. Shortly after the move, the romantic relationship soured and eventually ended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In the early morning hours of April 6, 2003, approximately three weeks after the relationship ended, Stuart returned to their home in Billings around 1:30 a.m. after meeting with a friend. Kearney and two neighborhood teenagers were at the residence when Stuart returned.</p>\n<p id=\"APk\">\u00b66 Kearney and Stuart exchanged heated remarks, one of which angered Kearney, who then punched Stuart. Stuart then threw Kearney into a chair and held Kearney down by her shoulders. Kearney then began scratching and kicking Stuart as she was being held down. Stuart testified that she was telling Kearney to calm down. However, Kearney testified that Stuart began to choke her. The two teenagers left during the melee. Stuart eventually let go of Kearney and sat down in a love seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b67 Stuart and Kearney presented differing depictions of what occurred thereafter, which led to Stuart\u2019s stabbing. Stuart testified that Kearney went into the kitchen, returned with a knife, and said, \u201cdon\u2019t close your eyes tonight, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Stuart testified that she then walked toward Kearney, told her to give her the knife, after which Kearney repeated the threat that she intended to kill Stuart. Stuart claims she placed her hand on Kearney\u2019s hand, and that Kearney then pulled the knife away and started to jab Stuart\u2019s arm with it. Stuart testified that she turned to walk away and that Kearney then stabbed her twice in the back. Stuart claimed she then quickly turned around and Kearney stabbed her in the shoulder and neck area.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b68 Kearney testified that Stuart cornered her in the kitchen and repeatedly said, \u2018you\u2019re going to have to kill me, or I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Kearney claims that Stuart would not let her out of the kitchen and repeatedly pushed Kearney into the counter top. Kearney testified that she was afraid for her life and claimed that after she asked Stuart to let her pass, she noticed blood on the tip of the knife. Thereafter, Stuart showed Kearney her sweater and said, \u201cthat\u2019s what I was waiting for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b69 Stuart called 911 and reported that Kearney had stabbed her. Several officers arrived at the home, and eventually handcuffed Kearney, who was being uncooperative, and transported her to jail. Deputy Sheriff Roger Bodine testified that Stuart\u2019s sweater was saturated in blood, and Deputy Mickey Eckart testified that he placed a towel on one of Stuart\u2019s wounds which was bleeding profusely. Thereafter, Stuart was taken to Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Billings for treatment of the wounds, and Doctor George Bentzel (Dr. Bentzel) determined that surgery was required to control the bleeding in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>laceration in Stuart\u2019s neck area.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b610 On April 9, 2003, Kearney was charged by Information of assault with a weapon, a felony. The State\u2019s trial brief advised the District Court that it intended to introduce numerous photographs, including photos of Stuart\u2019s injuries. On July 31,2003, Kearney filed a motion in <em>limine </em>to exclude the photographs from being introduced into evidence because \u201ctheir prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.\u201d The jury trial began on August 4, 2003, and on the following day, the jury found Kearney guilty of assault with a weapon. On October 9, 2003, Kearney was sentenced to the Department of Corrections for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b611 On November 25, 2003, Kearney filed a notice of appeal and obtained an order appointing Gary Wilcox as counsel for purposes of appeal-the Public Defender\u2019s Office was removed as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b612 In general, district courts have broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Larson, </em>2004 MT 345, \u00b6 29, 324 Mont. 310, \u00b6 29, 103 P.3d 524, \u00b6 29. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Brasda, </em>2003 MT 374, \u00b6 14, 319 Mont. 146, \u00b6 14, 82 P.3d 922, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u00b613  Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are analyzed under the two-prong test adopted from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, which includes: (1) that the defendant bears the burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below the objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) the defendant must show that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>State v. Lucero, </em>2004 MT 248, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 42, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1106, \u00b6 15. Prejudice is established when the defendant shows reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 18, 311 Mont. 117, \u00b6 18, 53 P.3d 885, <em>\u00b6 </em>18.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">\u00b614 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting photographs of Stuart\u2019s stab wounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">\u00b615 Kearney contends that the District Court erred in admitting the photographs of Stuart\u2019s stab wounds because \u201cbodily injury\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>conceded by the parties and was therefore not at issue in the trial. Kearney argues that the photographs were unnecessary to prove the bodily injury element of assault with a weapon, and instead prejudicially affected the jury. Conversely, the State claims that Kearney did not concede to Stuart\u2019s injuries, and therefore, the photos were relevant to establish the element of bodily injury beyond a reasonable doubt. The State also argues that Kearney provided no transcript of the pre-trial hearing in which the issue was argued, failed to provide the photographs on appeal, has not set forth the prejudice she suffered as a result of the photos, and is therefore procedurally barred regardless of whether she conceded to Stuart\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b616  This Court will not consider unsupported arguments, locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Flowers, </em>2004 MT 37, \u00b6 44, 320 Mont. 49, \u00b6 44, 86 P.3d 3, \u00b6 44 (citations omitted). Additionally, Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that Tt]he argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d While Kearney contends the photographs were prejudicial and unnecessary to prove the injury element of the case, she offers no explanation as to how or why the photographs prejudiced her case, nor does she explain how the District Court\u2019s ruling to include the photographs constituted an abuse of discretion that exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. Moreover, the transcripts and photographs were not provided on appeal, further inhibiting our review. Because we will not consider unsupported arguments on appeal, we need not further address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b617 Did Kearney\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance by calling Dr. Bentzel as a witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b618 Kearney argues that her trial counsel had \u2018ho legitimate reason\u201d to call Stuart\u2019s emergency room physician, Dr. Bentzel, as a witness since the existence of the injuries were not in dispute. Kearney contends that where existence of the injury is not in dispute, there must be \u201csome other logical, strategical, reasonable\u201d basis for that decision, and claims there was no such \u201cother\u201d reason applicable here. Kearney acknowledges the fact that the record is silent as to why her trial counsel called the witness, but nevertheless urges this Court to conclude that there is no justification for counsel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b619 The State responds that, even assuming Kearney\u2019s counsel was ineffective, she failed to argue how Dr. Bentzel\u2019s testimony prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>her case. The State argues that Dr. Bentzel\u2019s testimony was merely \u201ccumulative to the evidence\u201d that had already been presented by the State which included photographs of Stuart\u2019s injuries, testimony from Stuart that Kearney had stabbed her, and testimony from Deputy Jeff Nedens as to Stuart\u2019s injuries. Consequently, the State asserts that Kearney was not prejudiced by Dr. Bentzel\u2019s testimony, and that her ineffective assistance of counsel argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b620 We have previously held that the two prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test need not be addressed \u2018in the same order ... if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one ....\u201d <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 21, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 21, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699). Additionally, \u201c[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice . .. that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b621  The record here does not demonstrate why Kearney\u2019s trial counsel decided to call Dr. Bentzel as a witness. However, even assuming that this was a decision that fell below the standard of reasonableness, we are unable to conclude that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the outcome of the proceedings would be different. <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 18. After review of the record, it is clear that based upon the admission of the photographs, testimony from various deputies at the scene as to the Stuart\u2019s injuries, and testimony from Stuart that Kearney stabbed her, the testimony provided by Dr. Bentzel was merely cumulative and therefore not prejudicial. Thus, we conclude that Kearney\u2019s trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance pursuant to the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
