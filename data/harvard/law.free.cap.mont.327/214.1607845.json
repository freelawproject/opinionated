He appeals the sentence imposed by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">\u00b62 Wiedrich presents the following two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">\u00b63 Are the sentencing conditions imposed in the District Court\u2019s written judgment invalid since these conditions were not discussed or imposed during the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err when it included a $1,000.00 fine in its written judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">\u00b65 On April 6,2002, at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon, Wiedrich turned the wrong way on a one-way street in Billings, Montana, and struck a vehicle stopped at a red light. The police were already en route having received a \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d (DUI) call just before the accident. Upon arriving at the scene, the responding officer asked Wiedrich for his license and proof of insurance. Wiedrich answered that he had no license and did not know where his insurance information was. It was later determined that he had no insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">\u00b66 The officer smelled alcohol and asked Wiedrich to step out of his vehicle. Wiedrich\u2019s speech was badly slurred, his eyes were red and glassy and he was unable to stand. The officer ultimately had to drag him to an adjacent grassy spot to minimize Wiedrich\u2019s risk of injury should he fall again. Also to minimize the risk of injury, the officer chose not to administer field sobriety tests that involved balance and walking. However, on a field-administered Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test, Wiedrich displayed the maximum number of clues for intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">\u00b67 Wiedrich refused to take a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test (PAST) but, upon subsequent instruction from his probation officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>provided a breath sample on the Intoxilizer 5000 at the Yellowstone County Detention Center. The result demonstrated that Wiedrich\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was .250. Wiedrich was charged with one count of felony DUI and two misdemeanor counts-driving on a suspended or revoked license, and operating a vehicle without liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><em>\u00b68 </em>At Wiedrich\u2019s April 10, 2002, arraignment, he pled not guilty. Additionally, on April 10, 2002, the State filed notice of its intent to designate Wiedrich a persistent felony offender (PFO). In August 2002, Wiedrich entered into a plea agreement and changed his plea to guilty. As part of the plea agreement, the State agreed to drop the misdemeanor charges against Wiedrich and agreed to recommend a sentence of ten years at Montana State Prison (MSP). The District Court accepted the change of plea and ordered a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI). The PSI, dated October 29, 2002, was submitted to the court on the morning of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b69 On November 18, 2002, the District Court held a sentencing hearing during which the State, pursuant to agreement, recommended ten years at MSP. Wiedrich\u2019s counsel in turn argued for five years at MSP, to run consecutive with the ten months remaining on a previous conviction for which Wiedrich had been on parole prior to the April 6 incident. The District Court, noting that this was Wiedrich\u2019s eleventh DUI, sentenced Wiedrich as a PFO to fourteen years at MSP, with five years suspended. The court also prohibited Wiedrich from driving during the entire fourteen years and retained jurisdiction of the case to review the no-driving condition. On November 20, 2002, the District Court issued its written judgment. Wiedrich appeals on the ground that the written judgment contained terms and conditions that were not expressly articulated at the time the District Court pronounced the oral sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a criminal sentence for legality. On sentencing questions regarding statutory interpretation, we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. McDanold, </em>2004 MT 167, \u00b6 12, 322 Mont. 31, <em>\u00b6 12, </em>97 P.3d 1076, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b611 In <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9, we held that the oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence is the legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>effective sentence. In issuing that ruling, the Court analyzed relevant statutes and Montana\u2019s Constitutional provision that provide a criminal defendant with the right to be present in the courtroom at the time of sentencing. The Court also observed that a \u201csubstantial number of the federal circuit courts and state supreme courts subscribe to the principle that when a conflict exists between a court\u2019s unambiguous oral pronouncement of sentence and a written judgment, the oral pronouncement, as correctly reported, must control.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 39. As a result of our decision in <em>Lane, </em>we concluded that the written judgment would serve \u201cas evidence of the sentence orally pronounced.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"AN2\">\u00b612 Wiedrich maintains that because the written judgment contains terms and conditions that were not orally pronounced, these extra conditions are invalid and should be removed from his sentence. Wiedrich requests that we reverse and remand this case to the District Court with orders that the District Court conform its written judgment to the oral pronouncement of sentence, thereby removing the majority of parole conditions contained in his current written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b613 The State counters that, while the District Court judge did not read every term and condition contained in the PSI, it is evident from the transcript that the judge imposed, with some expressed variations, the PSI-recommended sentence, and that Wiedrich understood this during the sentencing hearing and at the time the sentence was pronounced. As a result, the State avers, the written sentence does not conflict with the oral sentence and should not be modified. Moreover, the State argues, the majority of the conditions imposed on Wiedrich were \u201cstock\u201d conditions that did not infringe on Wiedrich\u2019s liberty or property interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b614 Because our ruling is based upon the specific colloquy that occurred during the sentencing hearing, we recite the relevant portions. After the District Court asked if there was any legal reason that sentencing should not go forward at that time, Wiedrich\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">Counsel: No, Judge. We have received a copy of the presentence investigation report. I have gone over that report with Mr. Wiedrich. I do have a couple of changes to point out to the Court. District Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b615 Counsel for Wiedrich then identified specific pages and lines in the criminal history section of the PSI and requested changes or corrections. After obtaining the State\u2019s concurrence, the District Court judge entered the changes on his copy of the PSI in his handwriting. The court then requested the State\u2019s recommendations. The State recommended ten years at MSP, emphasizing that this was Wiedrich\u2019s eleventh DUI and that his BAC was more than double the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u00b616 Wiedrich\u2019s counsel then requested a five-year MSP sentence emphasizing her client\u2019s age (57 years) and his significant health problems. Wiedrich also asked to be allowed to attend the WATCH program. Counsel for Wiedrich then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">I would respectfully ask that the Court consider imposing that sentence. I\u2019d also like to, regarding the conditions of probation on page 7 of the PSI report, number 7 is that the defendant will obtain permission from probation and parole before financing or operating a vehicle, property, or engaging in business. I ask that you strike that, that\u2019s [sic] it\u2019s not rationally related to a DUI sentence. And secondly, on page 8, number 21 [of the PSI], is that the defendant will abide by a curfew as determined necessary and appropriate by probation and parole, and I would ask that that be stricken considering that Mr. Wiedrich is 57 years old. And with that-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The District Court responded: \u2018Maybe if he would abide by curfew he would be less likely to be drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b617 The District Court subsequently asked if Wiedrich wished to say anything. Wiedrich declined. The court then noted from the criminal history section of the PSI that Wiedrich had three prior felonies, twenty-three prior misdemeanors and eleven DUIs. The District Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">The sentence recommended is appropriate, but we are going to make it a little longer so that we can watch over you at least until you\u2019re 72. It will be the sentence as to a persistent felony offender that the defendant be sentenced to 14 years at the Montana State Prison, 5 suspended. No driving at any time during this entire 14-year period, which is, when you tack it on to the parole that you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s going to be 15 years from now before you can drive again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">I\u2019ll retain jurisdiction to review that just in case your probation officer thinks you ought to be allowed to drive. I will not strike the curfew. On number 7,1 will not require that you have permission to finance or purchase property or engage in business, but you do have to have permission from your probation and parole officer before purchasing a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b618  As these transcript excerpts reveal, the District Court utilized the PSI when pronouncing sentence. The court clearly adopted the sentence recommended in the PSI, with some variations, and Wiedrich and his attorney were fully aware of this. We therefore decline to remand for re-sentencing. We nonetheless caution judges once again to carefully articulate, at pronouncement of sentence, each \u201caspect, term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>requirement and condition\u201d of an imposed sentence. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 61 (Nelson, J., concurring). The risk of a written sentence differing from the oral sentence would be thereby minimized, if not eliminated, as would the likelihood of a sentence being later challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b619  Second, Wiedrich argues, and the State agrees, that the court failed to give Wiedrich credit against his $1,000.00 fine as is required under \u00a746-18-403(2), MCA, for the period of time he was incarcerated prior to his conviction. Section 46-18-403(2), MCA, requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">[a]ny person incarcerated on a bailable offense who does not supply bail and against whom a fine is levied on conviction of the offense must be allowed a credit for each day of incarceration prior to conviction, except that the amount allowed or credited may not exceed the amount of the fine. The daily rate of credit for incarceration must be established annually by the board of county commissioners by resolution. The daily rate must be equal to the actual cost incurred by the detention facility for which the rate is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">It is undisputed that Wiedrich served at least 227 days prior to his conviction. The daily rate of credit for incarceration in Yellowstone County at that time was $50.00. Therefore, the credit the District Court was required to grant Wiedrich far exceeded the $1,000.00 fine. As a result, the $1,000.00 fine is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of conditions contained in the preliminary sentencing investigation. We vacate the court\u2019s imposition of the $1,000.00 fine.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
