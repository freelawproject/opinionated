(hereinafter collectively referred to as VIG) and William Martel (Martel) appeal the judgment of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, that the termination of Plaintiff David G. Cole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(Cole) as the hockey coach for the Bozeman Ice Dogs (the Ice Dogs) was without cause. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b62 This Court issued its original Opinion in this case on February 9, 2005. Valley Ice Garden filed a Petition for Rehearing on February 24, 2005. Cole filed his Objections to the Petition for Rehearing on March 9, 2005. In its Petition, VIG correctly argued that this Court applied the wrong standard of review in its February 9 decision. On April 6, 2005, we issued an Order withdrawing our February 9,2005, Opinion. We replace it with this superceding Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b63 The standard of review this Court applies in appellate cases identifies the level of deference we must accord a district court\u2019s decision. When a district court judge is presented with and resolves conflicting evidence, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence and whether they are clearly erroneous. We typically explain that this deferential standard is warranted because the decision-maker, i.e., the district court judge in this example, is present throughout the course of the trial, and is able to analyze first-hand the demeanor and credibility of each witness. <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, 294 Mont. 367, 982 P.2d 421; <em>State v. Whiteman, </em>2005 MT 15, 325 Mont. 358, 106 P.3d 543 (The trier of fact resolves conflicts in the evidence before it, and this Court will not reevaluate this same evidence on appeal). <em>See generally </em>Kelly Kunsch, <em>Standard of Review (State and Federal): A Primer, </em>18 Seattle U. L. Rev. 11,13-14 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b64 Conversely, when we have before us review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion, we review <em>de novo, </em>meaning \u201canew.\u201d We apply the non-deferential <em>de novo </em>standard because of the nature of a summary judgment. A summary judgment is \u201ca judgment granted on a claim about which there is no genuine issue of material fact and upon which the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>Seventh Edition (1999). In other words, the parties are not arguing over what happened or presenting conflicting evidence; they merely need to know which of them, under the uncontested facts, is entitled to prevail under the applicable law. In such a case, the district court judge need not weigh evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess credibility of the witnesses. He or she must identify the applicable law, apply it to the uncontroverted facts, and determine who wins the case. On appeal, the reviewing court has access to the same facts and can put itself in the same position as the district court judge when reviewing his or her purely legal rulings. If, after a <em>de novo </em>review, we determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>that a district court\u2019s legal conclusion is correct, we will affirm. On the other hand, if we conclude that the district court\u2019s legal ruling is incorrect, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b65  In our original decision, we incorrectly stated that the District Court\u2019s determination that VTG\u2019s termination of Cole\u2019s employment was without cause was a \u2018finding of fact.\u201d As a result, we applied the deferential \u201cclearly erroneous\u201dstandard. However, the District Court\u2019s determination of this issue was a legal conclusion based on uncontested facts and issued in the form of a summary judgment. As a result, we should have reviewed the court\u2019s conclusion <em>de novo. </em>In this case, the absence of issues of fact and application of the appropriate standard of review makes all the difference. Our application in this superceding Opinion of the non-deferential standard of review leads us to reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Cole\u2019s termination from employment was made \u201cwithout cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b66 VIG presents five issues on appeal and Cole presents two issues on cross-appeal. We conclude the dispositive issue is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Cole was terminated without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b67 In June of 1997, Martel purchased the Ice Dogs, a Junior A, American West Hockey League team. Because of the time in the season that Martel purchased the Ice Dogs, he needed to find a coach immediately. Hence, Martel met with and ultimately hired Cole as the Head Coach and General Manager of the Ice Dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b68 Martel asked Cole to draw up an employment agreement, which Cole did after consulting an attorney. The applicable portion of this employment agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">TERM: That the term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years, commencing on the 1st day of June 1997, and continuing thereafter, uninterrupted, unless employee is terminated for cause. In the event of the termination of employee for other than cause, employee shall receive one (1) full calendar year salary and a bonus equal to that paid to him for the preceding year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\u00b69 The above-quoted provision of the agreement was subsequently amended in March 1998 to add the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">Further, the term of this Agreement shall automatically renew, so as to have five (5) years remaining, each year on the 1st day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>June, unless employer notifies employee in writing prior to the 1st day of May of that Year of the non-renewal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Cole\u2019s annual base salary was fixed at $50,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b610 The 1997-1998 hockey season was fairly successful, but the following 1998-1999 season was not. The Ice Dogs ended that season with a record of 18 wins, 35 losses, and 7 ties. The Ice Dogs did not qualify for the playoffs, Cole did not receive any performance bonuses, and the game attendance declined to approximately 1,000 fans per game.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b611 Thereafter, during the off-season and at Cole\u2019s suggestion, Martel expended substantial sums of money in an effort to improve the team. In particular, Martel increased his recruitment efforts; entered the Ice Dogs in pre-season tournaments and in games in Canada; and hired a goalie coach and a new trainer. Despite these efforts, the 1999-2000 season again started out poorly, with the Ice Dogs winning one game and losing six.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b612 On October 3,1999, Martel terminated Cole due to the Ice Dogs\u2019 poor performance. Martel then told Cole that because he had cause to fire him, he felt he was not obligated to provide him severance pay. However, Martel did offer Cole $15,000 in severance pay, which Cole accepted. When Cole arrived to pick up his check, Martel asked him to sign a release from liability form, which Cole declined to sign. Cole then sought the advice of an attorney, and thereafter requested that Martel provide him with a written statement regarding his reasons for terminating him. Martel complied with Cole\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b613 After receiving Martel\u2019s explanation, Cole brought an action for breach of the employment contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Cole filed a motion for partial summary judgment. VIG also filed a motion for summary judgment. The District Court denied VIG\u2019s motion, and it granted Cole\u2019s motion as to liability, holding, in part, that Cole was terminated without cause. Subsequently, a bench trial was held as to damages and Cole\u2019s bad faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b614 Ultimately, the District Court determined that VIG did not violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; that the liquidated damages clause in the employment agreement was void because Cole\u2019s damages were both certain and ascertainable; that Cole\u2019s damages included lost wages and fringe benefits based on a five-year term of employment; and that the evidence concerning Cole\u2019s INS Visa status was inadmissable in that it was irrelevant, speculative, and not pled in VIG\u2019s Answer to Cole\u2019s Complaint. The District Court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>calculated Cole\u2019s damages, accepting the viability of certain damage claims while rejecting others, and awarded damages to Cole in the sum of $199,193.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b615 VIG now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment, and Cole cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b616 Our standard of review in summary judgment appeals is <em>de novo. </em>We use the same standards used by the trial court: first, whether issues of material fact exist and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In cases such as this one, where the parties agree on the facts, we review only the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Mesa Communications v. Yellowstone County, </em>2002 MT 73, \u00b6 11, 309 Mont. 233, \u00b6 11, 45 P.3d 37, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in concluding that Cole was terminated without cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u00b618 The facts relevant to the question of whether Cole was fired for cause are undisputed. VIG fired Cole from his job for unsatisfactory job performance. The contract Cole drafted allowed for certain payments to be made to him in the event he was terminated for \u201cother than cause.\u201d\u2018Cause\u201dwas not defined in the contract. The District Court was therefore required to determine whether discharge for an unsatisfactory job performance constituted sufficient \u201ccause\u201d for discharge, so as to relieve VIG of the obligation to pay Cole upon termination of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u00b619 VIG contends it had good cause to terminate Cole, and that the District Court erred in concluding that Cole was discharged without cause. In this connection, it presents several arguments. First, VIG argues that under Montana law, if any uncertainty in a contract exists, that uncertainty must be construed against the drafter. As such, VIG contends that any uncertainty as to the meaning of \u201ccause,\u201d as contained in the contract, must be construed against Cole, as he drafted the employment agreement. In addition, VIG maintains that the ordinary meaning of \u201ccause\u201d should apply, and that VIG had several \u201cgood or adequate\u201dreasons for terminating Cole\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">\u00b620 VIG likens the present case to one brought under Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (the WDEA). While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>acknowledging that the WDEA does not apply here, VIG argues that since \u201cgood cause\u201d is defined in the WDEA, that definition provides this Court with a guideline for \u201ccause\u201din the present case. Namely, the WDEA defines \u201cgood cause\u201d as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or other legitimate business reason[s].\u201dSection 39-2-903(5), MCA. VIG maintains that based on this definition, we have before upheld termination for \u201cgood cause\u201d on the basis of poor job performance and we should do so here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b621 As VIG notes, Cole admits he was not terminated for a capricious or false reason; in fact, he concedes his termination was the result of his losing record. Thus, there is no allegation of a pre-textual or otherwise improper motive for the discharge. VIG further maintains that firing a coach for a poor win/loss record is hardly unusual in the sports industry. Indeed, VIG contends that the expectation for Cole to win was evident by the built-in bonuses for winning listed in the employment agreement. VIG argues that it is hypocritical for Cole-who drafted the employment agreement \u2014 to claim he should be financially rewarded for winning, yet not penalized for a poor win/loss record.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b622 Cole contends that because the plain language of the employment agreement does not list as one of Cole\u2019s duties the need to maintain a specific win/loss ratio, this Court need not analyze the contract any further, as it cannot insert terms into the contract that are not there. Hence, because the win/loss ratio was not delineated in the employment agreement, the fact that Cole was terminated because of it proves that he was not terminated \u201cfor cause.\u201d He then maintains that Tt]he fundamental issue in this case is not whether VIG had a right to discharge Coach Cole.\u201dRather, he argues that because coaches are commonly terminated for failing to maintain a winning record, it follows that VIG is obligated to pay off the remainder of a coach\u2019s contract, as is the case here. Cole further maintains that the WDEA\u2019s definitions do not apply to the present case. Finally, he asserts that the employment agreement should not be construed against him because VIG, as the employer, was in the superior bargaining position and took unfair advantage of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b623 Neither the District Court nor the parties identified any issues of material fact as to the issue of Cole\u2019s termination. Therefore, we need only determine whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion-that Cole\u2019s failure to maintain an acceptable win/loss ratio was not just \u201ccause\u201dfor terminating his contract-is correct. <em>Mesa, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u00b624  \u2018The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide.\u201d <em>Schwend v. Schwend, </em>1999 MT 194, \u00b6 36, 295 Mont. 384, \u00b6 36, 983 P.2d 988, \u00b6 36 (citing <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34). The law thus imposed on the District Court, and this Court on appeal, the duty of interpreting, as a matter of law, the employment agreement entered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded that because Tt]he condition to have a winning percentage or an adequate win/loss record ratio was not in the contract ... the Plaintiffs termination was without \u2018cause.\u2019\u201d The District Court noted that the contract included \u201ccoaching\u201d as a duty, but, stating there were no Montana cases addressing the termination of a coach\u2019s employment for a poor win/loss record, reasoned therefrom that permitting the termination of Cole\u2019s employment for this reason would require the insertion of \u2018language into the contract which was not agreed upon by the parties.\u201dThus, according to the District Court, because (1) there are no previous cases on point, and (2) \u201ccause\u201d is not defined by the contract, then (3) poor team performance cannot be \u201ccause\u201d for termination of employment, despite Cole\u2019s contractual duty of \u201ccoaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b626 Although the District Court may have believed it was avoiding the insertion of language into the contract, what it actually did was substantially eliminate an agreed-to provision of the contract: that Cole was subject to termination for \u201ccause.\u201d Cole\u2019s failure to define \u201ccause\u201d when drafting the agreement does not mean that the term has no meaning, or that the parties intended the term to have a narrow, specific meaning. Indeed, Cole concedes that coaches are routinely terminated for failing to maintain a winning record, and argues that the question is not whether VIG could fire him, but rather, whether it ought to be required to pay out the term of his contract. See \u00b6 30. He acknowledged in the District Court that the \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d of a team\u2019s performance is its record, and that the win/loss record is a \u2018big factor\u201d in assessing a coach\u2019s performance. In essence, Cole is not disputing management\u2019s right to fire him for poor performance; he simply wants to be paid upon the occurrence of that discharge. He asks that we uphold his compensation not because the discharge was wrongful, but rather because the contract he drafted does not specify it as so.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b627  The lack of any definition of \u201ccause\u201d in the contract Cole drafted meant that it was incumbent on the District Court to decide what the term means. In doing so, the court must be guided by \u00a728-3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>501, MCA, which provides: \u2018The words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense ....\u2019\u2019Where the parties\u2019 contract fails to define a term, we look to this rule of construction, as well as to the general rule that unclear language in a contract should be construed against the drafter. <em>See, </em>\u00a728-3-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b628 VIG offers a number of cases we have decided pursuant to the WDEA, which defines \u201cgood cause\u201d as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties ... or other legitimate business reason.\u201d Section 39-2-903(5), MCA. Acknowledging that this is not a WDEA case, we nonetheless find that these cases offer persuasive guidance in this matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">It is well settled in our pre-[wrongful discharge] Act cases that courts should not intrude in the day-to-day employment decisions of business owners. ... An employer\u2019s legitimate right to exercise discretion over whom it will employ must be balanced, however, against the employee\u2019s equally legitimate right to secure employment. ... The balance should favor an employee who presents evidence, and not mere speculation or denial, upon which a jury could determine <em>that the reasons given for his termination were false, arbitrary or capricious, and unrelated to the needs of the business.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Morton v. M-W-M, Inc. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 245, 250, 868 P.2d 576, 579 (emphasis added) (alteration in original) (citing <em>Kestell v. Heritage Health Care Corp. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 518, 525, 858 P.2d 3, 7-8). We further explained in <em>Kestell </em>that we had defined \u2018legitimate business reason\u201d as \u201ca reason that is neither false, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, and it must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Kestell, </em>259 Mont. at 525, 858 P.2d at 7 (quoting <em>Buck v. Billings Montana Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 276, 281-82, 811 P.2d 537, 540).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b629 Similar standards have been applied in other jurisdictions for similar situations, including the discharge of a coach employed pursuant to a contract which allowed discharge only for good cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARa\">The term \u201cgood cause\u201d is \u2018largely relative in [its] connotation, depending upon the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d \u2018Essentially, [it] connote[s] \u2018a fair and honest cause or reason, regulated by good faith on the part of the party exercising the power.\u2019 [CitationJ\u2019The employer does not have a right to make an arbitrary or unreasonable decision about terminating an employee when there is an agreement to terminate only for good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Wood v. Loyola Marymount University </em>(1990), 218 Cal.App.3d 661, 670, 267 Cal.Rptr. 230, 235 (citations omitted) (alterations in original) (addressing discharge of University\u2019s head baseball coach).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b630  Cole did not establish, nor even assert, that the reasons for terminating his employment \u201cwere false, arbitrary or capricious, [or] unrelated to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Morton, </em>263 Mont. at 250, 868 P.2d at 579. Neither did he establish, nor even assert, that VIG\u2019s reasons were \u2018false, whimsical ... [or did not] have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Kestell, </em>259 Mont. at 525, 858 P.2d at 7. As we have defined the term in both WDEA and nonWDEA cases, VIG had a \u2018legitimate business reason\u201d to terminate Cole, a reason \u2018logically related to the needs of the business.\u201d Discharging the coach of a professional sports team which is performing poorly, despite management\u2019s good faith efforts, is a discretionary decision related to the legitimate needs of the business and constitutes \u201ccause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b631  Had the District Court concluded on the basis of disputed facts, and after a trial on the merits, that Cole was not discharged for \u201ccause,\u201d we would rightly be reluctant to disturb such a finding and conclusion on appeal. This was essentially our holding in the withdrawn opinion. However, applying our <em>de novo </em>standard of review to a conclusion of law reached from undisputed facts, we are compelled under the law set forth above to reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Cole was fired without cause. As a matter of law, VIG had \u201ccause\u201d to discharge Cole. Therefore, Cole is not entitled to recover under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b632 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
