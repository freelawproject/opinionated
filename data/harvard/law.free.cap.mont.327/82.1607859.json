We remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u00b62 Kay raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b63 1. Are the trial court\u2019s findings clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the trial court err in failing to provide specific findings as to the presumption specified in \u00a740-4-219(3), MCA, and in failing to apply that presumption?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">\u00b65 3. In the alternative, should this matter be remanded to the trial court for a parenting evaluation?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">\u00b66 The District Court entered a Decree of Dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage on January 9, 2002, granting the parties joint custody of their daughter, Jamie, bom December 10, 1996. Jim was designated the primary custodial parent and Kay was awarded reasonable and liberal visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">\u00b67 Sometime in the fall of 2002, Jim was terminated from his job as a police officer in Cut Bank. Jim contacted Kay and informed her that he was on medication and unable to care for Jamie. Consequently, on October 30, 2002, Kay and Jim entered into a Stipulated Modified Parenting Plan wherein they agreed that Kay would become the primary custodial parent. The new parenting plan specified that Jamie would reside with Kay during the school year and that Jamie would visit Jim for eight weeks each summer. Each parent was entitled to have Jamie on alternating weekends during the custody of the other parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">\u00b68 In addition, the new parenting plan stipulated that neither parent was to pay child support to the other during the time Jim remained unemployed. However, once Jim became employed, he was to pay child support as provided in the Montana Child Support Guidelines. The parenting plan also required that both parents notify the other parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>in writing of any changes in residence, of employers, or of health insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b69 On February 24, 2004, Kay sought a modification of the parties\u2019 Stipulated Modified Parenting Plan, requesting that Jim\u2019s visitation rights be changed from unsupervised to supervised. The time and duration of the visits were to remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b610 The District Court granted Kay\u2019s motion on an interim basis and directed that Jim appear on March 17, 2004, to show cause why the interim plan should not be made permanent. The order further specified that Jim was not to contact his daughter pending the hearing on Kay\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b611 At the hearing in this matter, Kay testified that from October 2002, to the time of the hearing, Jim moved from place to place and worked at several jobs for short periods of time. Contrary to the provisions of the parenting plan, Jim failed to notify Kay each time he changed residences or jobs. Kay stated that this became a significant problem in the summer of 2003 when Jim failed to return Jamie to Kay after Jim\u2019s summer visitation ended. Kay testified that since she had no address for Jim, she had to enlist the aid of the police who were able to locate Jim and Jamie after randomly searching the neighborhood where relatives thought Jim lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b612 During part of this summer 2003 visitation, Jim rented a house in Great Falls next to Kandi Gaskins (Gaskins). Gaskins testified at the hearing that she became friendly with Jim and Jamie during the time they lived next door and that from what she observed, Jim was not properly providing for Jamie. Gaskins stated that she provided Jim and Jamie with groceries after Jamie complained on several occasions that she was hungry or that she had not eaten. In addition, Gaskins testified that she bought Jamie a pair of shoes because Jamie\u2019s shoes had become too small and that Gaskin\u2019s mother bought $80.00 worth of clothing for Jamie.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b613 Gaskins further testified that she loaned Jim several pieces of furniture because, other than a bed for Jamie, he had none. After Jim received an eviction notice and prior to his moving away, Jim sold the furniture Gaskins had loaned him to surrounding neighbors to raise money. After some difficulties, Gaskins was able to retrieve the furniture from the neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b614 Gaskins also testified to an incident in August 2003, when Jim entered her home uninvited. Consequently, Gaskins filed a report with the Great Falls Police Department. In that report, Gaskins stated that Jim seemed very depressed and that he acted as if the world was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>against him. She also stated in that report that Jim had told her that he wanted to become a truck driver and that once he did that, he planned to steal Jamie away from Kay. Moreover, Gaskins testified that after Jamie was removed from his custody, Jim alluded to suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">\u00b615 Kay testified at the hearing that there were other problems during the 2003 summer visitation. According to the parenting plan, Kay was entitled to custody of Jamie on alternating weekends during Jim\u2019s summer visitation, however, except for one weekend, Jim denied Kay the right to see Jamie. In addition, during the 2003 summer visitation, Kay testified that Jim\u2019s brother informed her that he was taking care of Jamie for a few days because Jim had been hospitalized for drinking while using medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b616 Jim did not testify at the hearing. Instead Jim, acting <em>pro se, </em>called two witnesses, William Barron (Barron) and Daniel Burns (Burns). Barron, the Lake County Sheriff Coroner, testified that he had known Jim for many years and that he had never seen Jim abuse alcohol or use illegal drugs. Barron also testified that he had observed Jim and Jamie together and that they seemed very close.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b617 Bums, who employs Jim at both the motel and the car dealership that Burns owns in Cut Bank, testified that he had never had the opportunity to observe Jim and Jamie together. Burns did testify that Jim was a great employee and that he had never seen Jim abuse alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b618 The District Court issued its Order Denying Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Modify Parenting Plan on March 22, 2004. The District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">1. That Petitioner presented no facts that have arisen since the prior parenting plan which cause a change in the circumstances of the minor child of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">2. That there has been no change of circumstances that both parties continue their vindictiveness toward the other party contrary to the best interest of their daughter as previously determined by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Based on these findings, the court concluded that Kay had failed in her burden under \u00a740-4-219, MCA, to show that facts had arisen since the prior parenting plan which would constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to necessitate an amendment of the parenting plan to serve the best interests of the child. Consequently, the court denied Kay\u2019s motion to modify and ordered that the Stipulated Modified Parenting Plan remain in full force and effect. Kay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b619 Kay argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous; that the District Court erred in failing to provide specific findings as to the presumption specified in \u00a740-4-219(3), MCA, and in failing to apply that presumption; and, in the alternative, that this matter should be remanded to the District Court for a parenting evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b620  We review a district court\u2019s findings relating to custody modification to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Custody of Arneson-Nelson, </em>2001 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 36 P.3d 874, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Johnson </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 158, 166, 879 P.2d 689, 694). Findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it that a mistake has been made. <em>Arneson-Nelson, </em>\u00b6 15. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are unable to determine from the District Court\u2019s cursory findings whether they are supported by substantial evidence or whether the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b621  Moreover, \u00a740-4-219(1), MCA, provides that a district court may amend a parenting plan if it finds that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In this case, the court found that Kay had presented \u2018ho facts that have arisen since the prior parenting plan which cause a change in the circumstances of the minor child of the parties.\u2019The court made this determination without any reference to \u00a740-4-219(3), MCA, which provides that \u2018[t]he court shall presume a parent is not acting in the child\u2019s best interest if the parent does any of the acts specified in subsection (l)(d) or (8).\u201d Subsection (8) of \u00a740-4-219, MCA, is not applicable here, however, subsection (l)(d) is. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">In determining the child\u2019s best interest under this section, the court may, in addition to the criteria in 40-4-212, also consider whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">(d) one parent has willfully and consistently:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">(i) refused to allow the child to have any contact with the other parent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">(ii) attempted to frustrate or deny contact with the child by the other parent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Section 40-4-219(l)(d), MCA. Nothing in the findings of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>indicate that it considered these presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b622 Accordingly, we remand this case to the District Court for detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b623 Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
