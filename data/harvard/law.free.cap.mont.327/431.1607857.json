We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b63 The marriage of Kuipers and Martha Kuipers (Martha) was dissolved in 1998. The dissolution decree included a restraining order prohibiting Kuipers from, among other things: going to a residence and four-plex identified by addresses; following, harassing, intimidating, telephoning or threatening Martha; and contacting his teenaged sons Colter and Dustin. The restraining order was amended in 2001 and again in January of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\u00b64 In October of 2002, Kuipers and Martha each gave Colter $2400 to purchase two snowmobiles. Colter obtained titles to the snowmobiles in his name. On November 14,2003, Kuipers called Colter and Martha and told them he intended to take a snowmobile from the four-plex where Colter lived. Upon receiving messages from Kuipers, Colter called Martha from his work and asked her to go to the four-plex. Martha did so, observed Kuipers\u2019 truck and called 911 from a neighbor\u2019s driveway. She then watched Kuipers drive off with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>snowmobile. Gallatin County Sheriffs Deputy Mark Murphy responded to the 911 call and questioned Kuipers, who stated he owned the snowmobile. After learning the snowmobile was registered to Colter, Murphy arrested Kuipers.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b65 The State of Montana charged Kuipers with theft, a felony, and violating an order of protection, a misdemeanor. Colter, Martha, and Murphy testified for the State at trial. Kuipers, Dustin, and Kuipers\u2019 sister, Terry Carlson, testified for the defense. The jury found Kuipers guilty of both charged offenses, and the District Court subsequently sentenced him. Kuipers appeals. We include additional facts as necessary in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b66 We review whether the evidence is sufficient to support a verdict of guilty in a criminal case to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. That review encompasses whether the verdict is supported by sufficient evidence, not whether the evidence would support a different verdict. <em>See State v. Larson, </em>2004 MT 345, \u00b6 52, 324 Mont. 310, \u00b6 52, 103 P.3d 524, \u00b6 52 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b67 <em>Was the evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u00b68 Kuipers first asserts the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty of theft. Section 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA, provides that a person commits theft by purposely or knowingly obtaining or exerting unauthorized control over property of the owner with the purpose of depriving the owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u00b69 Kuipers asserts the State did not prove he purposely or knowingly had unauthorized control of the snowmobile, because he believed he owned or partially owned it. He points to evidence that he paid $2400 toward the snowmobiles\u2019 purchase, the snowmobiles were for the family s use and he did not know Colter held the titles to the snowmobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">\u00b610 As stated above, the question is not whether the evidence could support a different verdict, but whether sufficient evidence supports the verdict rendered. <em>See Larson, </em>\u00b6 52. At trial, Colter testified the $2400 check from Kuipers was a gift. Martha stated the snowmobiles were purchased for Colter and Dustin\u2019 s use, and Colter was more likely to take care of the paperwork than Dustin. Dustin testified he assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Colter\u2019s name was on the titles because Colter \u201ctook care of [the snowmobiles], used them most.\u201d Kuipers stated he was in drug treatment when the snowmobiles were titled, and he had assumed the snowmobiles were titled to Martha and himself. Kuipers admitted on cross-examination that, rather than giving Colter a check, he could have purchased the snowmobiles himself and had them registered in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b611  Weighing evidence, assessing witness credibility and resolving conflicting evidence are within the province of the trier of fact. <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>2004 MT 363, \u00b6 18, 324 Mont. 488, <em>\u00b6 </em>18, 104 P.3d 1051, <em>\u00b6 </em>18 (citations omitted). Here, the jury assessed witness credibility and resolved conflicting evidence. Viewing the testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude the jury had sufficient evidence to find Kuipers purposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over property owned by Colter beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b612 Kuipers also argues, however, that the State did not establish his purpose was to deprive Colter of property. He asserts he had the same right to use the snowmobile as the rest of the family. In addition, he contends that \u201cbeyond the insinuation that [Kuipers] intended to sell the snowmobile, the State failed to prove that he... intended to dispose of the property.\u201d He also contends \u2018it is highly unlikely\u201d that he would have \u2018forewam[ed]\u201d Martha and Colter of his plan to take the snowmobile if he intended to dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b613  Again, the question is not whether evidence would support a different verdict, but whether sufficient evidence supports the verdict rendered. <em>See Larson, </em>\u00b6 52. Martha testified at trial that, on November 14, 2003, Kuipers called her twice at work, indicating he \u201cwas desperate for money\u201d and stating he wanted to get the snowmobiles to sell. Colter testified the family could use the snowmobiles \u201cin a responsible manner,\u201d but \u2018hot to sell [them] to get drugs.\u201d Kuipers testified that he had left a message for Colter on November 14, stating he had told Martha the night before that he \u201cwas broke and she was only willing to give [him] $5 and nothing more\u201d and he was going to take one of the snowmobiles. Viewing this testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude the jury had sufficient evidence to find Kuipers\u2019 purpose was to deprive Colter of property beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b614 Next, Kuipers asserts the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty of violating an order of protection. Section 45-5-626(1), MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>violates an order of protection if the person, with knowledge of the order, purposely or knowingly violates one of the order\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Agkv\">\u00b615 The 1998 dissolution decree provided that a prior restraining order would remain in effect and set forth the order\u2019s terms, including a provision that Kuipers \u2018is hereby excluded from the [four-plex] rental property ... and from the grounds thereof.\u201dThe order was amended in 2002, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">to allow telephone, mail and personal contact between Martha Kuipers and Dustin Kuipers and Respondent, Dennis Kuipers, so long as Dennis Kuipers is under the custody of the Montana State Department of Corrections. All other parts of the Restraining Order not conflicting are to remain in full force and effect[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In the 2002 amendment, the court noted a 2001 amendment that is not of record, which apparently allowed \u2018full contacfl\u2019between Kuipers and Colter. Kuipers does not contest that he was aware of the 1998 order and the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b616 Noting the State charged him with going to the four-plex, Kuipers asserts the amended order is \u2018hot clear\u201d and \u2018ii]t begs reason that a Court would allow all parties to enjoy contact with each other and maintain a provision that prohibits them from going to specific property.\u201d Pointing to evidence that he lived with Martha and Dustin at the residence listed in the amended restraining order and stored a boat he co-owned with Colter at the four-plex, he asserts it is \u201cunreasonable\u201d to hold him responsible for going to the four-plex when the other family members previously allowed him to do so. He argues \u201cthe only logical reading\u201d of the amended order is that it only prohibited his following, harassing, intimidating or threatening Martha.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b617 The issue before us is not whether the restraining order begs reason or is logical. In 2002, the parties-including Kuipers-stipulated to certain amendments to the restraining order and left \u201cother parts ... not conflicting ... in full force and effeet[.]\u201dThe provision from the 1998 order excluding Kuipers from the four-plex does not on its face conflict with the amendments allowing contact between Kuipers, Martha, Colter and Dustin. Moreover, the jury apparently did not believe Kuipers\u2019 testimony that he thought the amended order \u201cwas in effect while [he] was under the hands of Montana State Prison system, and that when [he] was through with [his] prison term or [his] sentencing, the restraining order was then not in effect.\u201d As stated above, credibility determinations are within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Gilmore, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u00b618  In reviewing a jury verdict, we do not decide whether we would have reached the same result. We conclude the jury had sufficient evidence to find Kuipers guilty of violating the protective order beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b619 We hold the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AAH\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
