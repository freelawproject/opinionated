We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b63 Whether a special relationship existed between the County and Zachary such that the County had a duty to protect him from harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">\u00b64 Zachary voluntarily committed himself to the Montana State Hospital (Hospital) at Warm Springs in late 1996. On March 3,1997, Zachary, without telling anyone, left the hospital grounds and walked into the countryside. The temperature that day was approximately 37 degrees, and snow was on the ground. Once the Hospital\u2019s staff discovered Zachary had left, the nursing supervisor telephoned local law enforcement to report his disappearance. She reported to the dispatcher that she was concerned with Zachary's ability to care for himself and asked if county police could locate him. The dispatcher told the nursing supervisor that, because Zachary was a voluntarily committed patient, the police had no legal basis to stop and detain him. County police officer Daniel Blume was notified of Zachary\u2019s disappearance, but he did not initiate a search. Instead, Blume kept lookout for Zachary during his routine patrol of the general area where Zachary was believed to be. Blume did not see any signs of Zachary. The nursing supervisor did not ask for a search and rescue operation, nor is there any indication that the dispatcher advised against such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">\u00b65 Zachary\u2019s body was found several weeks later in a field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>approximately six miles from the Hospital. An autopsy report stated that he died of exposure one to three days after he left the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"Az_\">\u00b66 Helen Eves brought this suit against the County asserting wrongful death and survivorship claims against the County. She argued that the County owed a duty to try to find Zachary and that it breached that duty. The County moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted its motion. Eves now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b67 We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>We apply the same criteria as the district court according to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Gullett v. Van Dyke Const. Co., </em>2005 MT 105, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 30, \u00b6 11, 111 P.3d 220, \u00b6 11. Summary judgment shall be granted if the evidence filed with the court \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether a special relationship existed between the County and Zachary such that the County had a duty to protect him from harm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abu\">\u00b69  Generally, government officials do not owe a duty to specific members of the public, but only to the public as a whole. This rule of law is known as the \"public duty doctrine.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21. Ordinarily the County would not have owed Zachary a duty, such as searching for him and making sure no harm came to him. However, this Court has recognized exceptions to the doctrine. Specifically, an exception \u201carises when there exists a special relationship between the police officer and an individual giving rise to a special duty that is more particular than the duty owed to the public at large.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22 (citations omitted). We have recognized four circumstances where a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d may arise. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\u00b610 Eves argues that County officials established such a relationship under two of these circumstances, namely \"when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property,\u201d and \u2018by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public ....\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22 (citations omitted). <em>Nelson v. Driscoll </em>informs our decision regarding both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\u00b611 In <em>Nelson, </em>an officer stopped a motorist and sought to administer a sobriety test, but due to inclement weather conditions was unable to do so. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Although the officer did not believe he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>probable cause to arrest the driver, Trina, he advised her that, given the weather and that she had been drinking, he did not think it safe for her to drive home. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 10. Trina and her husband then exited the car and stated that they would call a friend for a ride. The officer then drove around the block three times to check on them before leaving the couple for good. Soon afterwards a motorist struck and killed Trina as she walked between lanes of traffic on the highway. <em>Nelson, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b612 We concluded that, in pulling Trina over and directing how she and her husband could go home, the officer assumed a duty to protect her from harm. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 40. The County\u2019s actions in this case, however, were qualitatively different. Officer Blume did undertake to look for Zachary during his routine patrol. However, since Blume did not see or have any contact with Zachary, his actions did not influence how Zachary behaved, as in <em>Nelson, </em>nor did Zachary rely, to his detriment, on Blume\u2019s actions. The same is true for the actions of the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b613 Eves additionally argues that the dispatcher misinformed the Hospital in stating that the County had no authority to detain Zachary if an officer found him. She contends that under \u00a7 53-21-129, MCA (1995), in an emergency <em>\u201ca </em>peace officer may take any person who appears to be seriously mentally ill and as a result of serious mental illness to be a danger to others\u201d and briefly detain them to assess their mental health. Without ruling on whether this provision could have applied if a County peace officer had found Zachary, we note that, even if a peace officer could have detained Zachary under this statute, the statement by the dispatcher to the nursing supervisor would still not have created a special relationship between the County and Zachary because Zachary was in no way involved in this exchange. The reliance exception to the public duty doctrine quoted above would not apply because it would have been the Hospital which relied on the statement, not Zachary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b614  Therefore, we conclude that there was no special relationship that arose out of the actions of County officials such that those officials owed a duty to Zachary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b615 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
