We affirm the District Court. Rardon raises the following issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b62 1. Did the prosecutor breach the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u00b63 2. Did Flathead County Attorney Ed Corrigan violate this Court\u2019s instructions on remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u00b64 3. Did the sentence violate Rardon\u2019s right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\u00b65 This is Rardon\u2019s third appeal from the sentence imposed by the Eleventh Judicial District Court. A detailed discussion of the facts regarding the first two appeals may be found in <em>State v. Rardon, </em>1999 MT 220, 296 Mont. 19, 986 P.2d 424 <em>(Rardon I), </em>and <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, 313 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132 <em>(Rardon II). </em>In order to provide a context for the resolution of this appeal, we recount the pertinent facts from those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">\u00b66 Rardon was charged with one count of sexual intercourse without consent, and two counts of sexual assault. The victims of these offenses were two minors; Rardon\u2019s own daughters, D.N. and J.T. While Rardon pled not guilty at his arraignment, he subsequently entered into a written plea agreement with the State whereby he agreed to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>guilty to one count of sexual assault against his eldest daughter, D.N. In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss the other charges and recommend a sentence in conformity with the recommendation resulting from the Sexual Offender Treatment Amenability Evaluation (SOTA Evaluation) and the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSI Report) to be performed prior to sentencing. The District Court accepted Rardon\u2019s guilty plea, ordered a SOTA Evaluation and PSI Report, and dismissed the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b67 The SOTA Evaluation recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>that Rardon be accepted into an outpatient treatment program on a probationary status without any term of years, to be completed in Great Falls according to the treatment standards of the Montana Sex Offender Treatment Association. The PSI Report, on the other hand, recommended that Rardon be sentenced to serve forty years at the Montana State Prison (MSP), with twenty years suspended. The PSI Report further recommended that Rardon remain ineligible for parole until he completed all available phases of the Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) at MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b68 Rardon\u2019s first sentencing hearing was held in December of 1997 before the Honorable Ted O. Lympus. The State called Rardon\u2019s two daughters and his ex-wife to the stand where they expressed their fear of Rardon and their desire that he be incarcerated for the rest of his life. The State recommended that Rardon be sentenced to serve seventy years at MSP, and that he be ineligible for parole until he had served at least thirty years and completed all phases of the SOTP. The District Court sentenced Rardon to seventy-five years at MSP with fifteen years suspended, and provided that Rardon would not be eligible for parole until having served at least thirty-five years and completed all phases of the SOTP.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b69 Rardon appealed the sentence and this Court reversed the District Court in <em>Rardon I. </em>In doing so, we concluded that the State had breached the plea agreement by recommending a sentence that was not in conformity with the recommendations of either the SOTA Evaluation or the PSI Report. <em>Rardon I, </em>\u00b6 17. Consequently, we held that the District Court had abused its discretion when it failed to require the State to abide by the terms of the plea agreement. <em>Rardon I, </em>\u00b6 17. We remanded with instruction that the District Court either allow Rardon to withdraw his guilty plea, or require specific performance of the plea agreement and order a new sentencing hearing before a different judge. <em>Rardon I, </em>\u00b6 18. Rardon chose to have the plea agreement specifically performed. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00b610 In March of 2000, a second sentencing hearing was held before the Honorable Katherine R. Curtis. The same Flathead County Attorney involved in the original sentencing proceeding, Mr. Ed Corrigan (Corrigan), represented the State. Again, Rardon\u2019s two daughters and his ex-wife testified at the proceeding, expressing their fear of Rardon and their desire that he be incarcerated for the rest of his life. While the prosecutor opined that Rardon deserved a lengthy sentence, he ultimately recommended that Rardon be sentenced to serve forty years at MSP with twenty years suspended, subject to the conditions set forth in the PSI Report. Rardon\u2019s court-appointed attorney, in accordance with Rardon\u2019s request, recommended a sentence of forty years with no time suspended. The District Court did not accept the proffered recommendations, but imposed a sentence of seventy-five years at MSP with twenty-five years suspended, and provided that Rardon would not be eligible for parole until he had served at least half of the non-suspended sentence and completed all phases of the SOTP.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b611 Rardon appealed the second sentence. In <em>Rardon II, </em>this Court reversed the District Court because the prosecutor had breached the plea agreement by aggressively eliciting testimony that was clearly intended to undermine the agreement and convince the District Court that the plea bargained sentence recommendation should not be accepted. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 22. We stated that although the District Court had the statutory authority to impose a lengthy sentence, the court should have had the benefit of making that decision based on a good faith and fair presentation of the State\u2019s <em>case. Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 25. Thus, we remanded with instructions that the District Court either allow Rardon to withdraw his guilty plea, or require specific performance of the plea agreement and order a new sentencing hearing before a different judge, with the State to be represented by a different prosecutor. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 26. Rardon again chose to have the plea agreement specifically performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b612 On June 30,2003, a third sentencing hearing was held before the Honorable Deborah Kim Christopher. Pursuant to this Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Rardon II, </em>Corrigan did not participate. Instead, the State was represented by Flathead County Attorney Daniel Guzynski (Guzynski). Again, J.T. and Rardon\u2019s ex-wife both testified. D.N., the victim of the crime for which Rardon was convicted, did not appear at this portion of the proceeding. In order to provide her another opportunity to testify, the District Court continued the hearing until July 14, 2003, at which time she did appear and testify. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>recommended that Rardon be sentenced to serve forty years at MSP, with twenty years suspended, subject to the conditions set out in the SOTA Evaluation and the PSI Report. Rardon\u2019s counsel recommended a sentence of thirty years, with fifteen years suspended. The District Court did not accept the proffered recommendations, but imposed a sentence of fifty years at MSP, with thirteen years suspended, and provided that Rardon would not be eligible for parole at any time during his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b613 Rardon now appeals from the third sentence, arguing that: (1) the prosecutor again breached the plea agreement; (2) Flathead County Attorney Ed Corrigan violated this Court\u2019s instructions on remand in <em>Rardon II; </em>and (3) the sentence violated his right to due process. Upon these contentions, Rardon requests that we reverse the District Court and remand this matter with a recommendation that the court impose a sentence of forty years, with twenty years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b614 In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial error, we employ a <em>de novo </em>standard, considering the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the context of the entire proceeding. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 15. Our review of the constitutional issue of due process involves a question of law, and our review of such questions is plenary. <em>In re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 29 P.3d 485 \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b615 <em>1. Did the prosecutor breach the plea </em>agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b616 Rardon argues that the prosecutor breached the plea agreement in two ways. First, Rardon argues that a breach occurred when the prosecutor elicited improper testimony fromD.N.,J.T.,andhis ex-wife. The specific portions of testimony which Rardon designates as improper include accounts of the physical and sexual abuses which Rardon subjected his family to over a period of years, general testimony regarding Rardon\u2019s violent nature, and J.T.\u2019s stated opinion that he should be \u201cput away for a very, very long time.\u201d Rardon claims that the conduct referred to in this testimony \u2018had nothing to do with the charge of sexual assault to which he plead guilty.\u2019\u2019Further, Rardon asserts, this testimony was improper because it was elicited for the purpose of inducing Judge Christopher to reject the State\u2019s recommended sentence and impose an increased sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">\u00b617  In determining a proper sentence, the sentencing judge may consider any relevant evidence relating to the nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>circumstances of the crime, the character of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s background and history, mental and physical condition, and any evidence the court considers to have probative force. <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 117, \u00b6 23, 82 P.3d 903, \u00b6 23. This includes evidence of other acts, even those resulting in acquittal or which are dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain agreement. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 23. As well, it is entirely appropriate for a prosecutor to elicit testimony from the victims at a sentencing hearing, and for the victims to express their fears and feelings. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 22. Moreover, we observe that nothing in the plea agreement between the State and Rardon limited the State\u2019s ability to present the testimony at issue. Thus, the fact that Rardon\u2019s abusive history and violent tendencies came out during the proceeding does not establish a breach of the plea agreement. Nor is a breach established by virtue of the fact that Rardon\u2019s daughter stated her opinion that he should receive a lengthy sentence. The portions of testimony which Rardon complains of fit squarely within the parameters of acceptable evidence. As such, we conclude that the sentencing judge was entitled to consider this evidence in determining an appropriate sentence. Thus, we hold that the plea agreement was not breached by the mere introduction of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b618  A plea agreement is a contract between the State and a defendant which is subject to contract law standards. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 18. The State may not retain the benefit of such an agreement while avoiding its obligation thereunder. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 18. Indeed, prosecutors must meet \u201cstrict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance\u201d in fulfilling such agreements. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 18. As such, a prosecutorial violation of a plea agreement is unacceptable, even if made inadvertently in the good faith pursuit of a just result. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b619 Thus, although a prosecutor enjoys wide latitude in submitting evidence to a sentencing judge, the presentation of the State\u2019s case must be tempered by any obligations or restrictions created by way of a plea agreement. In Rardon\u2019s case, the plea agreement required the prosecutor to recommend a sentence in conformity with the recommendation resulting from the SOTA Evaluation and the PSI Report. This component of the agreement obligated the prosecutor to present the State\u2019s case in a way that would not undermine the recommendation he ultimately made to the sentencing judge. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 22. A failure in this regard would constitute a breach of the plea agreement. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 22. As we have previously noted, although a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>sentencing judge has the statutory authority to reject a plea bargained sentencing recommendation, such a decision should be made pursuant to a good faith and fair presentation of the State\u2019s case. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b620  We hold that the prosecutor\u2019s presentation of the State\u2019s case did not undermine the plea bargained sentence recommendation. In doing so, we note that there are no hard and fast criteria to apply in making such a determination. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 21. Rather, each case must be decided on its own unique facts. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 21. Here, the testimony at issue was particularly relevant because it described conduct that was part of Rardon\u2019s pattern of abusive and violent behavior which was directly related to his crime of sexual assault, and was in fact facilitative of that offense. Further, this conduct occurred during the same time period in which Rardon committed the crime for which he was convicted. The prosecutor appropriately encouraged the witnesses to testify about their experiences so that the sentencing judge was properly informed in determining an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AEh\"><em>\u00b621 </em>More importantly, however, the prosecutor did not use this testimony to undermine the State\u2019s sentence recommendation. In <em>Rardon II, </em>we held that the prosecutor had effectively undercut the plea agreement by repeatedly eliciting inflammatory testimony which was clearly intended to convince the sentencing judge that the plea bargained sentence recommendation should not be accepted. <em>Rardon II, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>19-22. For example, the prosecutor explained to a witness that if the State\u2019s recommended sentence were accepted, Rardon could be eligible for parole within just a few years. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 19. Then the prosecutor asked the witness what she thought of the State\u2019s recommended sentence. <em>Rardon II, \u00b6 </em>19. The witness, not surprisingly, opposed the recommendation. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b622 Here, however, nothing of that sort occurred, and Rardon\u2019s bare assertions to the contrary are unpersuasive. The fact that some testimony elicited in the third hearing was similar to that of the first and second hearings does not establish a breach of the plea agreement. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that none of the prosecutorial improprieties identified in the previous proceedings were present in the third sentencing hearing. Further, Rardon has not demonstrated that any other form of prosecutorial impropriety occurred. We hold that the prosecutor did not elicit improper testimony or undermine the State\u2019s recommended sentence. Thus, we hold that the prosecutor did not breach the plea agreement when he questioned Rardon\u2019s family members at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00b623 Additionally, Rardon argues that the prosecutor breached the plea agreement by subpoenaing D.N. to testify at the continuation of the sentencing hearing after she had declined to attend the hearing two weeks earlier. This action, Rardon argues, constitutes a breach because the District Court already had her statements from the PSI Report as well as her testimony from the prior hearings, and thus the prosecutor\u2019s purpose could only have been to \u201csend the message to the court that the recommended sentence in the plea agreement is insufficient.\u201d Rardon cites no authority for the proposition that this Court could or should draw such an inference. This Court simply can not infer that the prosecutor intended to undermine the plea agreement by the mere fact that he subpoenaed D.N. to testify. Nor do we infer an improper intent from any other evidence in the record. Further, setting aside any speculation as to the prosecutor\u2019s intent, we observe that the subpoena had no actual impact with regard to the hearing because D.N. testified that she had decided to appear and testify before the subpoena was issued. Indeed, she expressed gratitude for the opportunity to testify, explaining that her prior failure to appear was simply due to her apprehension about the proceeding. In short, Rardon\u2019s argument is utterly without merit. We hold that the prosecutor did not breach the plea agreement by subpoenaing D.N. to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b624 <em>2. Did Flathead County Attorney Ed Corrigan violate this Court's instructions on remand?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b625 Rardon argues that Corrigan\u2019s involvement in this matter violated the instructions we issued in <em>Rardon II </em>which specified that Corrigan was not to represent the State in the third sentencing hearing. In support of this argument, Rardon points to a meeting where Corrigan introduced Guzynski to D.N., J.T., and Rardon\u2019s ex-wife, and explained that Guzynski would thereafter represent the State. Further, Rardon asserts that when D.N. called the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office regarding her subpoena, Corrigan \u201cchastised\u201d her for not testifying. Finally, Rardon insinuates that Corrigan\u2019s involvement had some effect on D.N.\u2019s decision to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b626 We hold that Corrigan\u2019s contacts with D.N. and her family do not amount to a violation of this Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Rardon II. </em>While we specified that Corrigan could not represent the State in the third sentencing hearing, <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 26, we did not bar him from all contact with Rardon\u2019s family. Corrigan did not represent the State on remand, and he was not present at the third sentencing hearing. As for the brief phone conversation between Corrigan and D.N., the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>does not indicate that Corrigan \u201cchastised\u201dD.N. for not testifying, nor does it demonstrate in any way that he prompted her to testify. Moreover, D.N. clearly stated that she had decided to testify before this conversation took place. As such, we hold that Corrigan did not violate this Court\u2019s instructions given in <em>Rardon II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b627 <em>3. Did the sentence violate Rardon\u2019s right to due process?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">\u00b628 Rardon argues that his right to due process was violated when he received a harsher sentence than was issued in either of the prior proceedings. In support of this argument, Rardon suggests that he was penalized for twice exercising his right to appeal and prevailing both times. Upon this contention, Rardon asks this Court to infer that Judge Christopher acted vindictively in rendering the sentence, thus implicating his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b629 Rardon\u2019s third sentence is significantly shorter than either of his first two sentences. In the first proceeding, Judge Lympus imposed a sentence of sixty years and declared Rardon ineligible for parole for thirty-five years. <em>Rardon I, </em>\u00b6 9. In the second proceeding, Judge Curtis imposed a sentence of fifty years and declared Rardon ineligible for parole for twenty-five years. <em>Rardon II, \u00b6 12. In </em>the third proceeding, Judge Christopher imposed a sentence of thirty-seven years with no chance of parole. Thus, parole eligibility is the only sentencing component which is more harsh in Rardon\u2019s third sentence than in either of his first two. However, the change in the parole component of the sentence is offset by the reduction in the overall term of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b630  Although the third sentence guarantees that Rardon will serve more time than did either of the first two, the third sentence also guarantees that Rardon will not serve as much time as he could have served under either of the first two. Rardon will now serve exactly thirty-seven years, whereas he may have ultimately served sixty years under the first sentence or fifty years under the second sentence. When we consider the reduction in the overall term of Rardon\u2019s sentence, together with the difference in parole eligibility, we determine that the third sentence, in its entirety, is not more harsh than either of the first two sentences. In other words, the third sentence was not more harsh than either of the first two because it precluded the possibility of Rardon serving sixty or fifty years at MSP, a possibility that was present in the first and second sentences respectively. Thus, we do not accept the premise of Rardon\u2019s argument supporting his due process claim. As such, we hold that Rardon\u2019s right to due process was not implicated by the third sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b631 In summary, the first two sentencing proceedings were tainted by the prosecutor\u2019s breach of the plea agreement. In the third proceeding, however, the prosecutor honored the State\u2019s obligation under the agreement. We hold that the prosecutor did not breach the plea agreement, Corrigan did not violate this Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Rardon II, </em>and the sentence did not violate Rardon\u2019s right to due process. Therefore, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
