We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b63 Did the WCC err by denying the claimant\u2019s petition for provision of a handicapped accessible van?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b64 On May 3, 1999, while working as a glazier for Bozeman Glass, Simms suffered a laceration to the radial artery of his right forearm. Immediately following his injury, Simms was treated at the Bozeman Deaconess Hospital emergency room where the laceration was repaired. The following day, May 4, 1999, Simms developed volar compartment syndrome, which was treated with a fasciotomy, arterial repair and secondary closure. Subsequently, Simms developed complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). At the time of the injury, Bozeman Glass was insured by State Fund, who has accepted liability for Simms\u2019 industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b65 RSD is a malfunction of the central nervous system which involves the sending of abnormal pain signals from non-painful stimulae. RSD initially affected Simms\u2019 arms and was treated by the implantation of a spinal cord stimulator in his cervical area, but the condition thereafter progressed to his legs and a second spinal cord stimulator was implanted near his lumbar spine. Although Simms is primarily confined to a wheelchair, Dr. John C. Oakley (Dr. Oakley) testified that Simms is able to make some standing transfers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Oakley, who testified by deposition, is a board certified specialist in neurosurgery and pain management and has treated Simms since 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u00b66 In late January 2002, at the request of State Fund, Simms was examined at Progressive Rehabilitation Associates (PRA) in Portland, Oregon. Simms went through a four-week out-patient multidisciplinary pain management program to determine an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>treatment plan to help him function. PRA diagnosed Simms\u2019 whole person impairment to be 71 percent, but determined that he was capable of performing full-time sedentary work. PRA also indicated a vehicle with a wheelchair lift would be very helpful in assisting Simms with his transportation needs, and would give him the opportunity to get out of the house more often. Dr. Oakley concurred with Simms\u2019 diagnosis, but disagreed with PRA\u2019s determination that Simms was employable, deeming him permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b67 On July 30, 2002, Dr. Oakley wrote a prescription for a handicapped accessible van, noting Simms\u2019 need for physical therapy in Bozeman and follow-up visits in Billings every one to three months. Dr. Oakley testified that a van would help Simms obtain psychiatric counseling, if an appropriate psychological resource was found, and further stated a van would enable Simms to get out more, thereby improving his mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b68 Simms is now deemed permanently totally disabled with no reasonable prospect of performing gainful employment. Although Simms suffered a vertebral compression fracture in the summer of 2003, Dr. Oakley testified that Simms remains at maximum medical improvement (MMI) and there is no curative treatment for RSD on the horizon. Simms\u2019 compression fracture was due to bone density loss, a result of his immobility, and, as a result, he needs physical therapy three times a week to minimize bone density loss. Bozeman is the nearest appropriate physical therapy facility, because in-home therapy and treatment in Livingston are unavailable, due to the type of exercise equipment needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b69 Simms\u2019 present transportation, outside of his home, is by wheelchair and car. In good weather he is able to drive the wheelchair on and across Livingston streets. While Simms is unable to drive a van or any other vehicle, he does own a car and utilizes the car to travel from his home. Since Simms cannot drive, his wife, after Simms transfers to the car, loads the portable wheelchair and drives the car. Simms goes out in the car six to seven times a month to shop or just for a \u201cdrive.\u201d Livingston also has a public wheelchair accessible van, but Simms states the public van\u2019s schedule makes it inconvenient for him to use, and in snowy weather, the van will not come up the road to his house. Simms offers that he has difficulty making medical appointments due to transportation issues, but he has not asked State Fund to arrange transportation for medical services. Rather, Simms requested State Fund to buy him a handicapped accessible van, which it has denied, resulting in the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u00b610 A hearing was held on December 17,2003. On March 15,2004, the WCC issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment concluding that Simms was not entitled to a handicapped accessible van to be furnished by State Fund. The WCC dismissed the petition without prejudice, noting that \u2018future circumstances could conceivably justify a renewed request.\u201d Simms appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b611 This Court employs two standards of review for decisions of the WCC. We review the findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 15, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Geiger v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2002 MT 332, \u00b6 13, 313 Mont. 242, \u00b6 13, 62 P.3d 259, \u00b6 13). In <em>S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, 303 Mont. 364, 15 P.3d 948, this Court defined substantial evidence necessary to support a finding of fact as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201c[E]vidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A26\"><em>S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 42 (quoting <em>Swain v. Battershell, </em>1999 MT 101, \u00b6 34, 294 Mont. 282, \u00b6 34, 983 P.2d 873, <em>\u00b6 </em>34).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did the WCC err by denying the claimant\u2019s petition for provision of a handicapped accessible van?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u00b613 This case is governed by the 1997 version of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the law in effect at the time of Simms\u2019 industrial accident. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hospital </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Simms bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the benefits sought. <em>Ricks v. Teslow Consolidated </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 469, 512 P.2d 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\u00b614 While Simms maintains the WCC erred in concluding that State Fund did not have to furnish him a handicapped accessible van to travel to and from medical appointments, State Fund contends that \u00a7 39-71-704(l)(d), MCA (1997), unequivocally provides that an insurer is not liable for a claimant\u2019s transportation for medical appointments, except for those appointments requested by the insurer. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">The insurer shall reimburse a worker for reasonable travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>expenses incurred in travel to a medical provider for treatment of an injury <em>only if the </em>travel is incurred <em>at the request of the insurer. </em>Reimbursement must be at the rates allowed for reimbursement of travel by state employees. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b615 Relying on this provision, and noting the directive that, \u2018[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted,\u201d \u00a71-2-101, MCA, the WCC held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Under [\u00a739-71-704(l)(d), MCA (1997)] the insurer is not liable for travel expenses except to appointments it requests. Purchase of a van for travel to and from medical appointments stands on no better ground than any other form of travel. Therefore, I conclude that the section affirmatively excludes liability for a van based on the claimant\u2019s need to travel to and from medical appointments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1u\">This Court must discern the intent of the legislature from the text of the statute when the words are clear and plain. <em>S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 17. We concur with the WCC\u2019s conclusion of law. To hold Simms\u2019 attendance at medical appointments is \u201cat the request of the insurer\u201d simply because the medical care is legitimate would impose a travel expense obligation on State Fund that contradicts the plain wording and meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b616 However, Simms also argues that provision of a handicapped accessible van is authorized by the statutory provisions providing for payment of necessary medical treatment. These provisions, found in \u00a739-71-704, MCA (1997), state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">(1) In addition to the compensation provided under this chapter and as an additional benefit separate and apart from compensation benefits actually provided, the following must be furnished:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(a) After the happening of a compensable injury and subject to other provisions of this chapter, the insurer shall furnish reasonable <em>primary medical services </em>for conditions resulting from the injury for those periods as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(b) The insurer shall furnish <em>secondary medical services </em>only upon a clear demonstration of cost-effectiveness of the services in returning the injured worker to actual employment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u00b617 Simms maintains the WCC erred in reaching the conclusion that he was not entitled to a handicapped accessible van because the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>to provide \u2018^primary medical services\u201dis the principal obligation of each employer, which forms the foundation for the <em>quid pro quo </em>underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Simms notes that \u00a739-71-704(1)(a), MCA (1997), provides that medical services are \u201can additional benefit separate and apart from compensation benefits\u201dprovided elsewhere in the statute. He argues \u00a739-71-704(1)(d), MCA (1997), which requires an insurer to pay for reasonable travel expenses to a medical provider only if requested by the insurer, does not affirmatively exclude liability for handicapped accessible transportation if such transportation can be said to meet the definition of \u201cprimary medical services\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a739-71-704(1)(a) and 39-71-116(26), MCA (1997). Simms asserts that a handicapped accessible van falls under the definition of \u201cprimary medical services,\u201d because a van is a medical appliance necessary to sustain MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b618 We initially note that the statute requires provision of \u201csecondary medical services\u201d only upon a showing that they enable a worker to return to actual employment. Neither party disputes that Simms is permanently totally disabled and is unable to return to work, and, thus, \u201csecondary medical services\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-704(l)(b), MCA (1997), are inapplicable. While \u201csecondary medical services\u201d does include medical services or appliances within the scope of treatment, \u201ctreatment\u201dunder \u201cprimary medical services\u201d is not defined. \u2018Primary medical services\u201d itself is defined as the \u201ctreatment prescribed by a treating physician, for conditions resulting from the injury, necessary for achieving medical stability.\u201dSection 39-71-116(26), MCA (1997). In <em>Hiett, </em>this Court addressed \u2018^primary medical services,\u2019\u2019and interpreted the Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">[T]he phrase \u201cachieving\u201dmedical stability and \u201cachieved\u201d medical stability as used in \u00a7\u00a7 39-71- 116(25) and 39-71-704(l)(f), MCA (1995), respectively, [means] the <em>sustainment </em>of medical stability. Given this interpretation, a claimant is entitled to such \u201cprimary medical services\u201d as are necessary to permit him or her to <em>sustain </em>medical stability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\"><em>Hiett, </em>\u00b6 35 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b619 However, even if this Court would conclude that a handicapped accessible van is a \u201ctreatment\u201d that could qualify as \u201cprimary medical services,\u201d Simms would nonetheless need to carry his burden to prove that a handicapped accessible van is necessary for medical reasons, and not merely for transportation. The WCC noted the proof that was required, and concluded that Simms had failed to carry his burden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Z\">[T]here are obstacles even under the primary medical services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>rule. First, as already noted, the claimant must prove that a van is necessary for reasons other than transportation to and from medical appointments. Second, he must demonstrate that the van is necessary for him to \u201csustain\u201d MMI. Third, he must show it is in fact medically necessary. He has satisfied none of these requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b620 Simms maintains the WCC erroneously concluded, against substantial credible evidence, that a handicapped accessible van is not a \u201cprimary medical service.\u201dHe argues that the WCC\u2019s finding that he failed to prove handicapped accessible transportation was medically necessary for him to sustain MMI is contrary to two medical opinions and the overwhelming evidence. He refers to evidence that he misses treatment appointments, is forced to consult with medical providers by telephone, and his physical condition is deteriorating due to immobility and an inability to travel to Bozeman and Billings for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b621 State Fund replies that the WCC\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence and that the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Specifically, State Fruid argues that a handicapped accessible van is neither a primary nor a secondary medical service under \u00a739-71-704(1), MCA (1997), and, in any event, Simms will not relapse into a non-MMI state without a van. Noting Dr. Oakley\u2019s testimony, State Fund argues that, at most, a van would promote Simms\u2019 general mental health by allowing him to leave home more often, and would be an added convenience. Lastly, State Fund contends there are several transportation alternatives available to Simms, including his personal automobile, a public wheelchair accessible van, and the motorized wheelchair he uses within Livingston, weather permitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b622 The WCC concluded that Simms failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that a handicapped accessible van qualified as a \u201cprimary medical service,\u201d because Simms did not establish the van was medically necessary to sustain his MMI. The WCC determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Medical necessity also encompasses a requirement that the treatment be reasonable ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">[T]he claimant already has a means of transportation available to him and is able to use it. He and his wife own a car. He is able to transfer into and out of the car and to take his portable wheelchair with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Moreover, the claimant has not shown that alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>transportation is not available. There is a publically operated handicap accessible van available to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b623 Dr. Oakley did not testify how a handicapped accessible van is necessary for Simms to maintain his MMI status, or indicate how the lack of a van would cause Simms\u2019 status to deteriorate. As the WCC noted, the fact that Dr. Oakley wrote a prescription and recommended a van is not conclusive as to medical necessity. Dr. Oakley\u2019s opinion that a handicapped accessible van would allow Simms to get away from his house and improve his mental health is insufficient to establish that a van is necessary for sustainment of MMI. The question is not what might generally improve Simms\u2019 mental health and well-being, but what is medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b624 Although Dr. Oakley did testify that a handicapped accessible van would make Simms\u2019 transfers more convenient, and, certainly, a handicapped accessible van would provide more convenient transportation for Simms, convenience is not synonymous with necessity. Dr. Oakley testified Simms is able to do some standing transfers, meaning he is able to stand up and move from his wheelchair to a car seat and vice-versa, thereby allowing Simms to travel in the car he currently owns, as he presently does several times a month to shop and take drives with his wife, in addition to medical appointments. Moreover, Simms is unable to drive, and, therefore, the purchase of a handicapped accessible van would not alleviate his need for a driver or his wife\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b625 Alternative means of transportation are also available to Simms. While the public handicapped accessible van may not be able to go up the road to Simms\u2019 house in bad winter weather, the WCC found that Simms had provided no details as to how often that occurs and concluded that it was \u201cunpersuaded that the public van is unavailable during the entire winter, or even for significant periods of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\"><em>\u00b626 </em> We conclude that the WCC\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial credible evidence, and that the WCC\u2019s conclusion of law that Simms is not entitled to have State Fund furnish him with a handicapped accessible van is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b627 Lastly, Simms offers that insurers have an affirmative duty to investigate workers\u2019 compensation claims and, in the absence of such an investigation, the denial of a claim for benefits is unreasonable, citing <em>S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 50. He notes that State Fund failed to ask its peer review doctor about his request, failed to write the treating physician or panel for clarification, and failed to seek a second opinion from another provider, and, therefore, asserts that a 20 percent penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>should be assessed against State Fund pursuant to \u00a739-71-2907, MCA, based on these failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">\u00b628  Section 39-71-611, MCA, allows costs and attorney fees to be payable only on denial of a claim or termination of benefits later found to be compensable. Because Simms\u2019 claim was properly found not to be compensable, his request for penalties is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b629 The order of the WCC is affirmed, and Simms\u2019 request for attorney fees is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> While Simms takes issue with this finding in a footnote, he does not challenge the finding with argument, stating only that the \u201cerror is of little or no import.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
