On appeal, husband contends the trial court erred (1) in classifying the marital residence, which he conveyed during the marriage by deed of gift to wife and himself as tenants by the entirety, as wholly marital property and (2) in dividing the value of that property equally. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The parties married on August 23, 1987. On September 13, 1988, husband executed a deed of gift conveying the marital residence, which husband had obtained prior to the marriage, to himself and wife as tenants by the entirety with the common law right of survivorship. The deed of gift provided that the conveyance was made \u201cfor and in consideration of the love and affection of [husband] for [wife]\u201d and that the \u201cconveyance [was] exempt from recordation taxes pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 58.1-811(D).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties separated on June 28, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Husband argued at the equitable distribution hearing on December 7, 2000, that the marital residence was not transmuted into marital property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(d) because his separate portion of the property was retraceable and was not a gift. The transfer by deed of gift, he argued, was a mere conveyance of title necessary to obtain refinancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>on the property. He proffered deposition testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of gift to show that he did not intend to make a gift of his separate interest in the property to wife. Wife, who argued the deed of gift was sufficient by itself to prove husband\u2019s donative intent, renewed the objection she had raised at the deposition to husband\u2019s testimony, asserting that, under the parol evidence rule, husband could not introduce parol evidence to refute the donative intent clearly and unambiguously expressed in the deed of gift. The trial court agreed with wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">By letter opinion dated January 26, 2001, the trial court ruled that, in conveying the marital residence by deed of gift to himself and wife as tenants by the entirety, husband made a gift of an interest in the marital residence to wife. Finding the deed of gift \u201cclear and unambiguous on its face,\u201d the trial court excluded husband\u2019s evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of gift. Such parol evidence, the trial court held, was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule to \u201crebut the intent expressed within the four corners of the deed.\u201d Finding the deed sufficient on its face to establish husband\u2019s donative intent, the trial court concluded that the marital residence was transmuted wholly into marital property under Code \u00a7 20-103.7(A)(f). The trial court then, \u201c[a]fter fully considering the evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the factors in [Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) ],\u201d awarded each of the parties half of the value of the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On May 22, 2001, the trial court entered a final decree of divorce incorporating the equitable distribution award. - This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u201cIn making an equitable distribution, the court must classify the property, assign a value, and then distribute the property to the parties, taking into consideration the factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E).\u201d <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Va.App. 557, 564, 471 S.E.2d 809, 812, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>28 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996). \u201cFashioning an equitable distribution award lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.... \u201d <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">Unless it appears from the record that the chancellor has abused his discretion, that he has not considered or has misapplied one of the statutory mandates, or that the evidence fails to support the findings of fact underlying his resolution of the conflict in the equities, the chancellor\u2019s equitable distribution award will not be reversed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Smoot v. Smoot, </em>233 Va. 435, 443, 357 S.E.2d 728, 732 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f) provides that \u201c[w]hen separate property is retitled in the joint names of the parties, the retitled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property, ... [unless] it is retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence and was not a gift.\u201d Hence, an interspousal gift of jointly retitled separate property \u201cbecomes marital property subject to division pursuant to the factors listed under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E).\u201d <em>Kelln v. Kelln, </em>30 Va.App. 113, 122, 515 S.E.2d 789, 793 (1999) (citing <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 567-69, 471 S.E.2d at 813-14). However, no presumption of gift arises from the fact that the \u201cproperty is conveyed or retitled into joint ownership.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g). Thus, when separate property that has been transferred into joint title is shown to be retraceable, \u201cthe party seeking to have [the] property acquired by interspousal transfer retain its classification as marital under [Code] \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g) must prove the property was a gift.\u201d <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 578, 471 S.E.2d at 819 (Annunziata, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Here, the evidence is uncontroverted that husband brought the marital residence into the parties\u2019 marriage as separate property. During the marriage, however, husband executed a deed conveying the marital residence to himself and wife as tenants by the entirety. Thus, assuming husband could prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>separate portion of the marital residence was retraceable,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the burden was on wife to prove that husband made a gift of an interest in the property to her. Only then could the marital residence be classified as marital property under subsections (f) and (g) of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">To establish the existence of a gift, the donee must prove by clear and convincing evidence: \u201c(1) the intention on the part of the donor to make the gift; (2) delivery or transfer of the gift; and (3) acceptance of the gift by the donee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 471 S.E.2d at 813; see <em>also Dean v. Dean, </em>8 Va.App. 143, 146, 379 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1989) (holding that one who claims ownership of property by virtue of a gift bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the donor\u2019s donative intent and delivery of the gift). In this case, the only element necessary to prove a gift that was in dispute before the trial court was husband\u2019s donative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Wife argued that the terms of the deed showed husband intended to make a gift of his separate interest in the marital residence to the parties jointly. She pointed to the words \u201cdeed of gift\u201d and \u201cconsideration of love and affection\u201d in the deed. Husband denied he intended, in executing the deed, to make a gift of his separate property to wife. He proffered parol evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed to show he intended to transfer the marital residence into joint title solely to obtain refinancing on the property. Wife objected to this testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Relying on the fact that the instrument used to convey the marital residence was termed a deed of gift and that the conveyance was expressly exempt from recordation taxes because it was without consideration, the trial court found that the deed clearly and unambiguously established husband\u2019s donative intent. The trial court refused, therefore, to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>husband\u2019s parol evidence and held that husband\u2019s conveyance of the marital property to the parties jointly constituted a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On appeal, husband contends the trial court erred in finding the deed sufficient on its face to establish his donative intent under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f) and in refusing to consider parol evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the deed\u2019s execution that he proffered to show he did not intend to make a gift of his separate interest in the marital residence to wife. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">To determine whether a deed \u201ccontains sufficient evidence of donative intent\u201d to transform separate property into marital property for purposes of equitable distribution, the court charged with that determination must construe the deed in accordance with the applicable rules \u201cgoverning the construction\u201d of deeds, including, if appropriate, the parol evidence rule. <em>Kelln, </em>30 Va.App. at 122, 515 S.E.2d at 793; <em>see also Langman v. Alumni Ass\u2019n of the Univ. of Virginia, </em>247 Va. 491, 498, 442 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1994) (noting that the parol evidence rule applies to deeds).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The prime consideration [in construing a deed], as with any writing, is to determine the intention of the parties executing the instrument. The intention ... should be ascertained from the language used in the deed, if possible. If the language is explicit and the intention is thereby free from doubt, such intention is controlling, if not contrary to law or to public policy, and auxiliary rules of construction should not be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Camp v. Camp, </em>220 Va. 595, 597-98, 260 S.E.2d 243 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Thus, \u201cwhen the language of a deed is \u2018clear, unambiguous, and explicit,\u2019 a court interpreting it \u2018should look no further than the four corners of the instrument under review\u201d \u201d to ascertain the donor\u2019s intent. <em>Pyramid Dev., L.L.C. v. D &amp; J Assocs., </em>262 Va. 750, 754, 553 S.E.2d 725, 728 (2001) (quoting <em>Langman, </em>247 Va. at 498-99, 442 S.E.2d at 674). \u201cOnly when the language is ambiguous may a court look to parol evidence, or specifically, to the language employed \u2018in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>light of the [surrounding] circumstances ... at the time the deed was executed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gordon v. Hoy, </em>211 Va. 539, 541, 178 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1971)). \u201cAn ambiguity exists when language is of doubtful import, admits of being understood in more than one way, admits of two or more meanings, or refers to two or more things at the same time.\u201d <em>Allen v. Green, </em>229 Va. 588, 592, 331 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201c[T]he question whether a writing is ambiguous is not one of fact but of law.\u201d <em>Langman, </em>247 Va. at 498, 442 S.E.2d at 674. \u201cOn appellate review, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions regarding an instrument\u2019s ambiguity because we are provided with the same opportunity as the trial court to consider the written provisions of the deed in question.\u201d <em>Pyramid Dev., L.L.C., </em>262 Va. at 754, 553 S.E.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Guided by the foregoing principles, we turn to the deed in question here. It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM4\">THIS DEED OF GIFT made this 13th day of September, 1988, by and between [husband], homme sole, party of the first part, and ... husband and wife, parties of the second part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">WITNESSETH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">That for and in consideration of the love and affection of [husband] for [wife] and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the party of the first part does hereby grant and convey ... unto parties of the second part as tenants by the entirety with rights of survivorship as at common law the [marital residence].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u2756 5k * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">This conveyance is exempt from recordation taxes pursuant to \u00a7 58.1-811(D) of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Plainly, the language of the deed makes it clear that husband intended to transfer legal title of the marital residence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>himself and wife jointly without consideration. It does not necessarily follow, however, that husband intended to convey the property into the marital estate and thus relinquish his separate interest in the property for purposes of equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As we pointed out in <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 410, 451 S.E.2d 713, 716 (1994), \u201c[h]ow the property is titled generally is not dispositive of its classification.\u201d In other words, \u201cwhether the property is separate or marital is determined by the statutory definition and is not determined by legal title.\u201d <em>Garland v. Garland, </em>12 Va.App. 192, 195, 403 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1991). Hence, \u201c[a] party claiming entitlement to rights and equities in marital property by virtue of an interspousal gift must prove the donative intent of the donor spouse <em>and </em>the nature and extent of the donor\u2019s intention.\u201d Lig<em>htburn v. Lightburn, </em>22 Va.App. 612, 617, 472 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1996) (emphasis added). Absent clear and convincing evidence that the donor spouse intended to convey the jointly retitled property into the marital estate, the transfer of separate property into joint title will not constitute a gift under Code \u00a7 20\u2014107.3(A)(3)(f). <em>See generally Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 137, 480 S.E.2d 760, 766-67 (1997) (holding that the husband\u2019s statement to the wife that the home conveyed into joint title was hers was evidence that husband intended to make a gift for equitable distribution purposes); <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 566, 471 S.E.2d at 813 (holding that the husband\u2019s giving the wife cards when his separate property was jointly retitled indicating that the property was now \u201cour home\u201d was evidence of husband\u2019s donative intent under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Accordingly, in considering equitable distribution, a trial court must consider all tendered competent evidence of the context in which a deed is executed and delivered in order to determine whether that deed effects a donative intent under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f). It cannot ignore the context as a whole simply because the deed, standing alone, says \u201cgift\u201d and clearly and unambiguously appears to reflect the donor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>spouse\u2019s intention to transfer title to the parties jointly without consideration. By statute, \u201c[n]o presumption of gift shall arise ... where ... property is conveyed or retitled into joint ownership.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(8)(g). The events and circumstances giving rise to the retitling of property must be considered in determining the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201c[I]t is ... elementary that the [parol evidence] rule does not apply where the \u2022writing on its face ... does not embody the entire agreement. In such a case, parol evidence is always admissible, not to contradict or vary the terms, but to establish the real contract between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>Prospect Dev. Co. v. Bershader, </em>258 Va. 75, 84, 515 S.E.2d 291, 296 (1999) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Georgiades v. Biggs, </em>197 Va. 630, 634, 90 S.E.2d 850, 854 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Deeds generally do not address the underlying issue of donative intent relative to property division, but some do. In <em>McDavid, </em>the parties executed a deed transferring the wife\u2019s interest in marital property to the husband. 19 Va.App. at 411, 451 S.E.2d at 717. The deed recited that it was a deed of gift and provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">the property was to be held by husband \u201cin his own right as his separate and equitable estate as if he were an unmarried man ... free from the control and marital rights of his present ... spouse\u201d and \u201cwith full and complete power ... [to] dispose of the ... property ... during his lifetime ... [or by] devise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations in original). On appeal, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the deed\u2019s language \u201cclearly and without ambiguity ... grant[ed] title to [husband] <em>as his separate property.\u201d Id. </em>at 412, 451 S.E.2d at 717 (second alteration in original) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Here, however, unlike in <em>McDavid, </em>the deed does not explicitly set forth the nature and extent of the donor\u2019s donative intent. The deed says it is a \u201cdeed of gift.\u201d It is not clear from the language of the deed, however, whether husband, in transferring title to the parties jointly, intended to make a true gift to wife such that the marital residence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>transformed from separate property into marital property for purposes of equitable distribution, as wife claims, or intended merely to convey legal title into joint ownership in order to obtain refinancing on the property without affecting the parties\u2019 equitable distribution rights, as husband claims. <em>See </em>Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 5.18, at 187 (2nd ed. Supp.2001). Furthermore, while evidence, certainly, of the former intent, the fact that the conveyance instrument is a deed of gift, the stated consideration for the conveyance is \u201clove and affection,\u201d and the deed states the conveyance is not subject to recordation tax under Code \u00a7 58.1-811(D) is not conclusive proof of that intent, foreclosing consideration of other competent evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We find, therefore, as a matter of law, that, although the deed is clear and unambiguous on its face as to husband\u2019s intent to transfer legal title of the marital residence to himself and wife jointly as tenants by the entirety without consideration, it is not clear and unambiguous with regard to husband\u2019s intent to make a gift of the marital residence to the marital estate. Thus, the fact finder must consider not only the terms of the deed itself, but also other competent evidence of the circumstances surrounding its execution and delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Consequently, we conclude the trial court erred in finding the language of the deed of gift unambiguous, in finding the deed of gift conclusive on its face to establish husband\u2019s donative intent, and in excluding the introduction of parol evidence relating to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of gift. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court and remand for reclassification of the marital residence after consideration of parol evidence and for adjustment of the division of the. value of that property, as appropriate under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-107.3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AF8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\">.
