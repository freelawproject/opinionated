Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">The worker sustained an injury on February 23, 1988 for which he received compensation until April 11, 1994. The employer ceased paying benefits at that time because it received a letter from the worker stating that he had begun working at a wage greater<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> than his pre-injury wage. By letter dated June 13, 1994, the insurer requested the worker to provide the name of his current employer, the date he started working, and copies of his pay stubs. The worker did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The commission sent form letters annually noting an outstanding award and directing, \u201cif payments have ceased, an executed Agreed Statement of Fact or an Employer\u2019s Application for Hearing must be filed to end the Award.\u201d The insurer did not respond to the commission\u2019s letters, but it wrote the worker\u2019s counsel on July 27, 1995 acknowledging the worker\u2019s return to work and requesting, \u201cplease contact me so that we may discuss terminating the outstanding award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On September 20, 1999, the commission wrote the insurer to inform that the worker \u201chad now received the maximum 500 weeks for compensation benefits\u201d and requested the total amount of compensation the employer paid to him. The insurer responded that it had paid $58,871.40. The commission then advised the employer had underpaid by $58,049.30. On June 7, 2000, the worker asserted this claim for compensation from April 11, 1994 through December 31, 1997 and imposition of the 20% penalty for non-payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The deputy commissioner denied the claim, and the full commission affirmed under its general equitable power to do full and complete justice. The worker contends he is entitled to the unpaid benefits because the insurer failed to file an application to terminate the award and unilaterally ceased making payments. We conclude that the commission properly exercised its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">When a worker does not suffer a loss of wages, receipt of compensation benefits would unjustly enrich the worker and result in manifest injustice. It is \u201c \u2018[n]either logical, reasonable, [n]or within the spirit of the Act\u2019 \u201d to award benefits when a worker is not entitled to them. <em>Collins v. Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Beverage Comm., </em>21 Va.App. 671, 680, 467 S.E.2d 279, 283 (quoting <em>Harris v. Diamond Contr. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946)), <em>aff\u2019d en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 625, 472 S.E.2d 287 (1996). The commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>applied this principle in <em>Goodman v. Tricorp, Inc., </em>01 WC UNP 1702161 (July 23, 2001) (worker barred from receiving windfall even though employer failed to properly terminate award), and in <em>Kline v. Newport News Shipbuilding, </em>00 WC UNP 1706454 (May 9, 2000) (benefits denied when \u201cthe occurrence of some mistake or unfair conduct ... would render strict application of the Act unjust\u201d). Interpretations of the act by the commission are entitled to great weight. <em>Peyton v. Williams, </em>206 Va. 595, 600, 145 S.E.2d 147, 151 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The worker returned to work April 11, 1994 and remained continuously employed at a wage greater than his preinjury wage. He did not provide the insurer with the necessary details of his change in employment, identify his new employer, or provide salary information or residential address changes when the insurer requested the information. The worker did not dispute that he neglected to comply with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-712. He testified he did not think he needed to provide that information because he was not asking the insurer \u201cto make up the difference.\u201d The worker sought to enforce the award six years after he last received a compensation payment when he received the commission\u2019s letter indicating that the employer had underpaid the award by more than $58,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">While we do not condone the employer\u2019s failure to file an application to terminate the award,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we note the full commission found, \u201c[t]here is no evidence ... that the employer has flaunted the Commission requirements that it file a memoranda when accepting the claim.\u201d The equitable power of the commission, as exemplified in the doctrine of imposition, includes the power to \u201c\u2018render decisions based on justice shown by the total circumstances even though no fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mistake or concealment has been shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Odom v. Red Lobster </em># <em>235, </em>20 Va.App. 228, 234, 456 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1995) (quoting <em>Avon Prods. Inc. v. Ross, </em>14 Va.App. 1, 7, 415 S.E.2d 225, 228 (1992)). The purpose of the Act \u201c \u2018is to compensate injured workers for lost wages, not to enrich them unjustly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins, </em>21 Va.App. at 678, 467 S.E.2d at 282 (quoting <em>Harris, </em>184 Va. at 717, 36 S.E.2d at 576).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Because the worker was not entitled to benefits, no penalty was applicable. Accordingly, we affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-13\">. The letter stated the worker had returned to work as a truck driver but indicated, incorrectly, a wage which was below his pre-injury wage. The letter also incorrectly gave the date of employment as March 1993. The parties have stipulated throughout these proceedings that the worker was employed and earned wages higher than his pre-injury wages at all times after April 11, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-524 provides in part, \"If any payment is not paid within two weeks after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty percent thereof....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">. The employer was unsuccessful in its attempts to get documentation from the worker. An application for the termination of benefits must be based on documentation \"sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to believe [his] ... grounds for relief are meritorious.\u201d <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Scotece, </em>28 Va.App. 383, 386, 504 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1998) (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
