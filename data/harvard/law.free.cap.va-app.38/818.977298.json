The trial court sentenced him to twelve years in prison, with nine years suspended, and fined him $60,000, with $50,000 suspended, on the transportation conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">On March 6, 2001, several months after his conviction and sentence by the trial court, Gordon filed a motion to set aside his conviction for transporting marijuana into the Commonwealth for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court found that Gordon\u2019s argument related to venue and was, therefore, waived by his failure to raise it before trial. The court entered final judgment on April 18, 2001. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On July 17, 2000, State Trooper James Robinson noticed a tractor-trailer without taillights on Interstate 66 in Prince William County. Robinson stopped the vehicle, which Gordon drove. Gordon told Robinson that he knew his taillights were not functioning properly, but he hoped to reach Maryland before stopping. He claimed he was delivering produce he picked up in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The trooper wrote a traffic summons for the defective taillights and asked Gordon to step down from his truck to sign the summons. The trooper asked to search the truck, and Gordon consented. The trooper found six boxes that were different in appearance and color from the remainder of the boxes. He discovered that these boxes were packed with 145 pounds of marijuana. He also found $7,767 in cash. Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Gordon of transporting marijuana into the Commonwealth and of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">In his post-trial motion and on appeal, Gordon argues that the Circuit Court of Prince William County lacked jurisdiction to try him for transporting marijuana into the Commonwealth because it failed to prove that his offense occurred within the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or boundaries of Prince William County. He bases his claim on Code \u00a7 19.2-239, which provides the circuit courts with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction for the trial of all presentments and informations for offenses committed within their respective circuits.\u201d He does not base his claim on Code \u00a7 19.2-244, which governs the venue of trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or Code \u00a7 17.1\u2014 513, which governs the subject matter jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>circuit courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court treated Gordon\u2019s claim as one involving improper venue, and not subject matter jurisdiction, and found the claim to be untimely. Although we find that the claim is one of territorial jurisdiction, not venue, we affirm Gordon\u2019s conviction because his objection to the circuit court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-239 was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Gordon claims that the import of the term jurisdiction in Code \u00a7 19.2-239 is analogous to that of subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore not subject to waiver. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is the authority granted to a court by constitution or by statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Earley v. Landsidle, </em>257 Va. 365, 371, 514 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999) (citation omitted); <em>accord Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 169, 387 S.E.2d 753, 755 (1990).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subject matter jurisdiction over the class of felonies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>that the court may hear is provided by Code \u00a7 17.1-513. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-513; <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 326, 330 n. 1, 549 S.E.2d 648, 650 n. 1 (2001) (noting that Code \u00a7 17.1-513 provides the Circuit Courts with jurisdiction over all felonies committed in the Commonwealth). There is no question that the Circuit Court of Prince William County had subject matter jurisdiction to the felony case at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Rather, Gordon\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth did not prove that his offense occurred within the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the Circuit Court of Prince William County, is essentially a claim that the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction. The term, \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 19.2-239, refers to the circuit court\u2019s \u201cauthority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area,\u201d which is properly categorized as \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d rather than \u201csubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 169, 387 S.E.2d at 755; <em>see Thomas, </em>36 Va.App. at 333, 549 S.E.2d at 651 (finding defendant\u2019s claim that his offense did not occur within the county of the circuit court in which he was convicted, in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-239, \u201cwas, in the strictest sense, an issue of territorial[, and not subject matter,] jurisdiction ----\u201d); <em>accord Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 430, 440, 477 S.E.2d 759, 764 (1996); <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 622, 629, 414 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Morrison, </em>a defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction is generally waivable. <em>See </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 756. However, where the defendant claims that the evidence failed to prove that the offense occurred in the Commonwealth, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>have found the claim is not subject to waiver. <em>See Thomas, </em>36 Va.App. at 332-33, 549 S.E.2d at 651 (finding territorial jurisdiction claim not waived by defendant\u2019s failure to raise it preverdict because the Commonwealth failed \u201cto prove that [Thomas\u2019] offenses occurred within the Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d); <em>see also Healy v. The Beer Institute, </em>491 U.S. 324, 336 n. 13, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 2499 n. 13, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989) (noting that \u201cto assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would offend sister States and exceed the inherent limits of the State\u2019s power\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)). In this case, it is undisputed that Gordon\u2019s offenses occurred in Virginia. Gordon claims only the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction to try him because the Commonwealth failed to prove that his offense occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Prince William County. Therefore, his claim, like that based on improper venue, is \u201cwaived unless raised in the pleadings filed with the trial court and properly preserved on appeal.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 756 (citing Rule 5:25). Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-244 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-9\">Except as otherwise provided by law, the prosecution of a criminal case shall be had in the county or city in which the offense was committed. Except as to motions for a change of venue, all other questions of venue must be raised before verdict in cases tried by a jury and before the finding of guilty in cases tried by the court without a jury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\">. Code \u00a7 17.1-513 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">The circuit courts shall have ... original jurisdiction of all indictments for felonies and of presentments, informations and indictments for misdemeanors.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. In <em>Morrison, </em>where the Supreme Court was faced with a similar attempt to classify a procedural error as one of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">The term jurisdiction embraces several concepts including subject matter jurisdiction, which is the authority granted through constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies; territorial jurisdiction, that is, authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area; notice jurisdiction, or effective notice to a party or if the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>seizure of a <em>res; </em>and \"the other conditions of fact must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the prerequisites of the authority of the court to proceed to judgment or decree.\u201d <em>Farant Investment Corp. v. Francis, </em>138 Va. 417, 427-28, 122 S.E. 141, 144 (1924). While these elements are necessary to enable a court to proceed to a valid judgment, there is a significant difference between subject matter jurisdiction and the other \"jurisdictional\u201d elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">s\u00ed\u00ab s\u00a1: sjs #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-11\">[T]he lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time in the proceedings, even for the first time on appeal by the court <em>sua sponte. Thacker v. Hubard, </em>122 Va. 379, 386, 94 S.E. 929, 930 (1918). In contrast, defects in the other jurisdictional elements generally will be considered waived unless raised in the pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>filed with the trial court and properly preserved on appeal. Rule 5:25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">One consequence of the non-waivable nature of the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction is that attempts are sometimes made to mischaracterize other serious procedural errors as defects in subject matter jurisdiction to gain an opportunity for review of matters not otherwise preserved. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 11 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-10\"><em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 169-70, 387 S.E.2d at 755-56.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
