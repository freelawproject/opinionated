In proof of the predicate prior felony, the Commonwealth relied upon the earlier conviction of defendant by general court-martial for \u201cHousebreaking,\u201d in violation of Article 130, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 930 (1998),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while he served in the armed forces. For purposes of sentencing, the trial court classified the previous offense a \u201cviolent felony\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and companion Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C), thereby triggering the attendant \u201cminimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years.\u201d On appeal, defendant contends the predicate offense was not a felony within the intendment of the statute but, if so, not a violent crime. Finding the prior offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>constituted a felony, we affirm the conviction. However, because the crime was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d contemplated by statute, we reverse the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">For purposes of appeal, defendant does not dispute he was found in possession of a firearm on July 3, 2000, by Southampton County Deputy Sheriff Joseph M. Blythe. An initial investigation by Blythe \u201cto see if [the weapon] was stolen\u201d \u201ccame back negative,\u201d and it was returned to defendant. Blythe also \u201ccheck[ed] [defendant\u2019s] record,\u201d but the evidence does not disclose the results. However, \u201cafter the case was sent to the Commonwealth,\u201d defendant was charged with the instant offense, and Blythe recovered the firearm from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Following indictment, the Commonwealth filed a pretrial motion seeking \u201ca ... determination ... concerning whether a military court-martial for housebreaking constitutes a \u2018violent felony\u2019 as contemplated by Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2 and 17.1-805.\u201d Testifying for the Commonwealth at the related hearing, Thomas J. Lambert, \u201clegal and hearing services officer for the Virginia Department of State Police,\u201d explained, without objection, that military \u201coffenses,\u201d \u201crules of evidence\u201d and \u201cthe like\u201d are \u201cset out\u201d in the \u201cRules of Courts-Martial,\u201d \u201cthe regulatory authority based upon Title 10 of the United States Code,\u201d the UCMJ. Lambert noted that military justice does not identify offenses as felonies or misdemeanors, but jurisdictional distinctions between a \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d court-martial differentiate crimes by tribunal. A general court-martial, \u201cthe ... military equivalent of a jury,\u201d \u201cmay award any punishment ... up to and including the death penalty\u201d and \u201cdishonorable discharge,\u201d while penalties before a \u201cspecial court-martial\u201d are limited to \u201c[s]ix months confinement,\u201d loss of pay, and \u201cbad conduct discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Upon review of the \u201cpaperwork\u201d incident to the \u201cgeneral court-martial\u201d of defendant, Lambert testified defendant was convicted of \u201cunlawful entry ... housebreaking,\u201d a crime with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>a \u201c[mjaximum punishment\u201d under the UCMJ of \u201cfive years confinement.\u201d Accordingly, the Commonwealth contended the offense was a \u201cserious crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year ... or by death,\u201d the \u201cstandard definition\u201d of a felony consistent with Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-8, -9 and -10. In response, defendant argued \u201cHousebreaking\u201d under the UCMJ was not a felony contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and clearly not a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The court initially ruled the UCMJ offense constituted a felony under Virginia law, although \u201cnot a violent felony\u201d implicating the attendant mandatory punishment. However, upon motion to reconsider by the Commonwealth on the morning of trial, the court found \u201cHousebreaking\u201d was \u201ca substantially similar offense to statutory burglary, ... a violent offense by definition under [Code \u00a7 ] 17.1-805, and therefore, ... a violent felony as defined by ... [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-308,\u201d \u201cset[ ] aside\u201d the earlier ruling and proceeded with trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In proof of the requisite prior conviction, the Commonwealth relied upon the UCMJ conviction in issue, introducing into evidence, without objection, copies of a \u201cCharge Sheet,\u201d a \u201cSJA [Staff Judge Advocate] Post-Trial Recommendation,\u201d and a \u201cGeneral Court-Martial Order,\u201d a document described by Lambert as \u201cthe equivalent of a conviction order.\u201d The order recites defendant was found \u201cGuilty\u201d of \u201cHousebreaking\u201d in violation of Article 130, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 930 by a \u201cgeneral court-martial\u201d of the United States Army, resulting in punishment that included \u201creduction] to the grade of El, confinement for two months and a bad-conduct discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Defendant testified he joined the Army in August of 1997, \u201cgot caught housebreaking in 1998,\u201d was \u201ccourt-martialed\u201d and received a \u201cbad conduct discharge.\u201d He did not \u201cremember\u201d mention of \u201ca felon/\u2019 during the proceedings. Defendant admitted purchasing the offending firearm from Norman E. Fanny, a licensed dealer, completing the \u201cforms\u201d necessary to the transaction and returning the following day to \u201c[p]ick[ ] it up,\u201d the sale having been approved without incident. Fanny corroborated defendant\u2019s testimony with respect to his pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>chase of the offending weapon and recalled a like transaction with defendant several months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant renewed an earlier motion to strike, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to establish either the existence of a requisite prior felony conviction or an offense implicating the related mandatory punishment. The trial court, however, overruled the motion and submitted the case to the jury upon instructions that included the \u201cfixed punishment of five years in the penitentiary,\u201d mandated by prior conviction for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The jury subsequently found defendant guilty of the instant crime and, consistent with the instruction, recommended the required punishment. After considering a presentence report, the court imposed the prescribed sentence, resulting in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Defendant first contends the court erroneously determined \u201cHousebreaking,\u201d as proscribed by the UCMJ, a \u201cfelony\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), arguing, \u201cany conviction other than a crime labeled as a felony would go beyond the plain language of the statute.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">A \u201cfelony\u201d is generally defined as \u201c[a] serious crime usually punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>633 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>456 (1983) (defining \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201ca crime for which the punishment in federal law may be death or imprisonment for more than one year\u201d); 1 Charles E. Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 19 (15th ed. 1993) (\u201cAn offense ... is a felony if it is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year .... \u201d). Accordingly, \u201cthe grade of the offense is fixed by the punishment.\u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 526, 531, 189 S.E. 441, 443 (1937). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Thus, in Virginia, \u201c[ojffenses are either felonies or misdemeanors. Such offenses as are punishable with death or confinement in a state correctional facility are felonies; all other offenses are misdemeanors.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-8.Code \u00a7 18.2-9 categorizes felonies from \u201cClass 1\u201d to \u201cClass 6,\u201d with related sentencing ranges from \u201cimprisonment for not less than one year\u201d to \u201cdeath, or imprisonment for life.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Here, a conviction for \u201cHousebreaking\u201d under Article 130, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 930 (1998), carries a \u201c[m]aximum punishment\u201d of \u201cconfinement for five years,\u201d together with \u201c[djishonorable discharge, [and] forfeiture of all pay and allowances,\u201d a penalty clearly consistent with a felony in Virginia. The trial court, therefore, correctly classified the UCMJ offense a \u201cfelony\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Defendant next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Because his purchase of the offending weapon from Fanny had been approved following the requisite \u201clegal procedures,\u201d and Deputy Blythe did not arrest him \u201con the night in question,\u201d and \u201cthe term \u2018felony\u2019 was never discussed throughout the Army Court Martial,\u201d defendant maintains \u201cthere was reasonable doubt as to whether or not [he] was a convicted felon.\u201d We find his argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The record does not disclose the results of any \u201ccriminal record check\u201d that attended either the handgun purchases or Blythe\u2019s investigation. Thus, assuming, without deciding, that any related conclusions would be relevant to the issue of reasonable doubt under the circumstances, the record is silent on the data provided to authorities in each instance, thereby preventing proper appellate consideration of the question. With respect to a misunderstanding by defendant of the import of the UCMJ conviction, his \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 727, 731-32, 492 S.E.2d 482, 485 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Lastly, insisting the crime of \u201cHousebreaking\u201d is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d embraced by Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and 17.1-805(C), defendant contends the trial court erroneously instructed the jury and imposed the sentence mandated by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">In fixing punishment for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), the statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-9\">Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, any person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was <em>previously convicted, of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years. </em>Any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of any other felony shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of two years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">(Emphasis added). Companion Code \u00a7 17.1-805(0 directs, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">For purposes of this chapter, violent felony offenses shall include any violation of ... [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90, 18.2-91, 18.2-92 ...; or any conspiracy or attempt to commit any offense specified in this subsection, and <em>any substantially similar offense </em>under the laws of any state, District of Columbia, the United States or its territories.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Defendant first contends that a \u201cproper and grammatical reading of Code \u00a7 17.1-805(0 clearly indicates that the phrase \u2018and any substantially similar offense under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories\u2019 applies only to conspiracies or attempts to commit the offenses specified.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">\u201cWhen statutory construction is required, we construe a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly [against the Commonwealth], they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201ca statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>14 Va.App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Limiting the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d to \u201cconspiracies or attempts,\u201d as defendant suggests, would require a \u201cnarrow or strained\u201d construction of Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C), inviting an absurd result. <em>See id. </em>Adopting defendant\u2019s logic, a person convicted of attempted murder in another jurisdiction would suffer the mandatory five-year sentence prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), while a convicted murderer would escape the harsher penalty. A reasonable construction of the statute would include as violent felonies those offenses enumerated in Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C), together with a \u201cconspiracy or attempt to commit\u201d such crimes, <em>and </em>offenses in other jurisdictions \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those specified by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Defendant next complains the crime of \u201cHousebreaking\u201d is not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to any offense designated in Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C). In response, the Commonwealth contends the offense is \u201csubstantially similar to ... Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-91 and -92,\u201d \u201cstatutory burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Manifestly, to prove \u201cHousebreaking\u201d under the UCMJ among those crimes embraced by the punishment provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), \u201c[t]he Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that an out-of-state conviction was obtained under [a] law[ ] substantially similar to those\u201d enumerated in Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C). <em>Shinault v.
