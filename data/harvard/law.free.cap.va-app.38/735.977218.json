B.P. was ordered to spend ten days in a juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>detention center for violating the order. On appeal, B.P. contends the JDR court lacked authority to order her to attend school. Therefore, she contends the court\u2019s order was void as a matter of law and that she cannot be found in contempt of a void order. For the following reasons, we disagree and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">On January 27, 2000, a petition was filed in the Rappahannock County JDR court alleging B.P., age fourteen, was a child in need of supervision because she was \u201chabitually and without justification absent from school.\u201d The JDR court appointed a guardian ad litem for B.P. and an attorney to represent her. In a hearing on March 23, 2000, B.P. entered a \u201cguilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The JDR court issued an order that day of \u201cFound guilty (Interim Disp)\u201d and directed that a report on the child\u2019s needs be compiled and filed with the court. The matter was continued to May 11, 2000. The JDR court also included in the order the requirement that B.P. \u201cattend school unless medically excused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">On June 1, 2000, October 13, 2000, and January 5, 2001, show cause summonses were issued by the JDR court, each alleging B.P. had failed to attend school in dereliction of the March 23, 2000 JDR court order. The JDR court considered all three matters on March 8, 2001, when B.P. admitted she had not attended school as previously ordered by the court. The JDR court found her guilty of violating its order on three separate occasions. B.P. was sentenced to spend ten days in a juvenile detention center for being in contempt of the order. B.P. appealed the JDR decision to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">In the circuit court, B.P. admitted she had not attended school as the JDR court had ordered. She contended, however, that the JDR court lacked authority on March 23, 2000, to order her to attend school because no final disposition had been made pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5 regarding the original petition. She asserted the \u201cinterim disposition\u201d order was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>void because the Code of Virginia does not authorize the JDR court to so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The circuit court found Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-227 and 16.1-241(A) provide the JDR court with \u201cinterlocutory authority\u201d to order a juvenile to attend school prior to the entry of a final disposition. The court also found Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A) provides the presiding JDR court judge with the authority to enforce such an order and place a juvenile in detention for violating that order. The circuit court incorporated these findings into its July 5, 2001 order, which affirmed the JDR court order and is now the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">B.P. challenges the authority of the JDR court to issue and enforce an interlocutory order, prior to a final disposition of her case, requiring her attendance at school. She argues such an order is not authorized because Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5 requires final disposition to occur only after an agency report assessing her needs has been filed. We disagree with B.P.\u2019s contention that the JDR court lacked authority to issue an interlocutory order requiring her to attend school and that the court could not enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The purpose of Chapter 11 of Title 16.1 of the Code, the \u201cJuvenile and Domestic Relations District Court Law,\u201d is crime prevention and juvenile rehabilitation. <em>See Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14 (1957). To achieve this purpose, JDR courts are vested with (1) jurisdiction over a juvenile \u201cwho is alleged to be ... in need of supervision,\u201d and (2) \u201call necessary and incidental powers and authority, whether legal or equitable in their nature.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1), 16.1-227. Through these powers, the JDR courts are to act \u201cto reduce the incidence of delinquent behavior.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-227(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">It is pursuant to this clear grant of statutory authority that the JDR court lawfully issues an interlocutory order. Such an order, as in this case requiring B.P. to comply with the Commonwealth\u2019s compulsory school attendance requirement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>can be made while awaiting the preparation of an agency report before final disposition in a proceeding for a child in need of supervision. Nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5 voids the inherent powers of the court, granted under Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-227 and 16.1-241(A)(1), to issue an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">To hold otherwise would require the JDR court to permit a juvenile to be absent from school for an indeterminate period of time in dereliction of Code \u00a7 22.1-254<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while the court awaited the generation of a report on how best to supervise the juvenile. Such a result would permit a juvenile, already found to be habitually absent from school, to continue to disregard the Commonwealth\u2019s compulsory school attendance requirement at will. We will not place a construction upon a statute which leads to an absurd result or one plainly contrary to the expressed intent of the General Assembly as set out in Code \u00a7 22.1-254. <em>See Ragan v. Woodcroft Village Apartments, </em>255 Va. 322, 325-26, 497 S.E.2d 740, 742 (1998) (a statute should never be construed so that it leads to an absurd result); <em>see also Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 757, 761, 105 S.E. 531, 532 (1921) (a statute should not be construed to \u201cenervate, impede and paralyze the administration of the ... laws of the state ... unless the legislative intent to produce such a result is clearly indicated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Therefore, we hold the JDR court possessed authority to issue an interlocutory order requiring B.P. to comply with the law of the Commonwealth mandating her attendance at school. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-227 and 16.1-241(A) provide such authority. We further hold that as the interlocutory order to attend school was properly issued, Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the JDR court and circuit court to enforce that order. This statute provides a court with the authority to punish for contempt the violation of its order. As the record clearly supports the circuit court\u2019s finding that B.P. violated the school attendance order, Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A) specifically provides for the penalty adjudicated in this case: \u201c[CJonfinement ... in a secure facility for juveniles .. . not to exceed ten days....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision that the JDR court had authority to issue the interlocutory school attendance order and to hold B.P. in contempt when she failed to obey that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">. Code \u00a7 22.1-254 requires children between the ages of five years old and eighteen years old to attend school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this chapter shall deprive the court of its power to punish summarily for contempt for such acts as set forth in \u00a7 18.2-456, or to punish for contempt after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>contempt except that confinement in the case of a juvenile shall be in a secure facility for juveniles rather than in jail and shall not exceed a period of ten days for each offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b788-7\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AvA\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The record establishes that the child properly came within the purview of the juvenile court and was declared a \u201cchild in need of supervision,\u201d as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228. I agree with the majority opinion that the juvenile court judge had the authority pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241 to order the child to attend school pending final disposition of her status pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5. Thus, the order requiring her to do so was not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">I dissent because I do not believe the juvenile court judge was authorized by statute to order the child to detention prior to entry of a final disposition under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5 for a status offense. The circuit court judge found, however, that \u201cpursuant to ... Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A), ... the [juvenile court] judge does have the authority to enforce its decree.\u201d The Commonwealth contends on appeal that Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A) authorizes this detention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">That portion of the statute provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>Any person violating an order of the juvenile court entered pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.19, </em>including a parent subject to an order issued pursuant to subdivision 3 of \u00a7 16.1-278.8, may be proceeded against (i) by an order requiring the person to show cause why the order of the court entered pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.19 has not been complied with, (ii) for contempt of court pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-69.24 or as otherwise provided in this section, or (iii) by both. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this chapter shall deprive the court of its power to punish summarily for contempt for such acts as set forth in \u00a7 18.2-456, or to punish for contempt after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the contempt except that confinement in the case of a juvenile shall be in a secure facility for juveniles rather than in jail and shall not exceed a period of ten days for each offense. However, if the person violating the order was a juvenile at the time of the original act and is eighteen years of age or older when the court enters a disposition for violation of the order, the judge may order confinement (i) in jail, or (ii) in a secure facility for juveniles provided the judge finds from the evidence that the presence of the person in such a facility is consistent with assuring the safety of the children confined in the facility and the staff of the facility and the finding is in writing and included in the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A) (emphasis added). When three \u201ccriminal\u201d show cause summonses were issued by the juvenile court, no final disposition had been entered under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5. Moreover, I see no language in Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.5 or 16.1-292(A) permitting detention of the child as an available sanction prior to disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Because the courts below acted pursuant to subsection (A), they did not make any findings as would be required by subsections (C), (D), and (E) of Code \u00a7 16.1-292. In any event, those provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-292, which read as follows, are not applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>C. Notwithstanding the contempt power of the court, the court shall be limited in the actions it may take with respect to a child violating the terms and conditions of an order to those which the court could have taken at the time of the court\u2019s original disposition pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.10, except as hereinafter provided. However, this limitation shall not be construed to deprive the court of its power to (i) punish a child summarily for contempt for acts set forth in \u00a7 18.2-456 or (ii) punish a child for contempt for violation of a dispositional order in a delinquency proceeding after notice and an opportunity for a hearing regarding such contempt, including acts of disobedience of the court\u2019s dispositional order which are committed outside the presence of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">D. In the event a child in need of services is found to have willfully and materially violated for a second or subsequent time the order of the court pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-278.4, the dispositional alternatives specified in subdivision 9 of \u00a7 16.1-278.8 shall be available to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">E. In the event a child in need of supervision is found to have willfully and materially violated an order of the court pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-278.5, the court may enter any of the following orders of disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">1. Suspend the child\u2019s motor vehicle driver\u2019s license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">2. Order any such child fourteen years of age or older to be (i) placed in a foster home, group home or other nonsecure residential facility, or, (ii) if the court finds that such placement is not likely to meet the child\u2019s needs, that all other treatment options in the community have been exhausted, and that secure placement is necessary in order to meet the child\u2019s service needs, detained in a secure facility for a period of time not to exceed ten consecutive days for violation of any order of the court arising out of the same petition. The court shall state in its order for detention the basis for all findings required by this section. When any child is detained in a secure facility pursuant to this section, the court shall direct the agency evaluating the child pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-278.5 to reconvene the interdisciplinary team <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>participating in such evaluation as promptly as possible to review its evaluation, develop further treatment plans as may be appropriate and submit its report to the court for its determination as to further treatment efforts either during or following the period the child is in secure detention. A juvenile may only be detained pursuant to this section in a detention home or other secure facility in compliance with standards established by the State Board. Any order issued pursuant to this subsection is a final order and is appealable to the circuit court as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">By placing the child in detention after a \u201ccriminal\u201d show cause proceeding and before entry of a final disposition pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5, the order effectively reclassifies the child as a delinquent. I believe it is contrary to the spirit of the statutes to interpret the Code in this manner such that prior to a final disposition, a child could be held in contempt and sanctioned for the same type of conduct being addressed by the underlying proceeding, but without the procedural safeguards afforded to the child in the underlying proceeding. Nothing within Code \u00a7 16.1-292(A), permits a juvenile court judge to order the sanctions provided therein for authority exercised pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241 and 16.1-227. Indeed, Code \u00a7 16.1-292(F) specifically provides that \u201c[njothing in this section shall be construed to reclassify a child in need of services or in need of supervision as a delinquent.\u201d I would hold that the juvenile court judge could, at most, order those sanctions provided for under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the portion of the order that orders the child into detention, prior to the entry of a final disposition under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5, for failure to attend school.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
