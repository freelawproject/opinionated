Lawrence temporary partial disability benefits, suspended from September 22, 1999 until September 12, 2000. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company (employer) appeals the commission\u2019s award of benefits after August 24, 1999, contending Lawrence unjustifiably refused selective employment on that date and failed to timely cure that refusal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Lawrence injured his left knee while working for employer on February 23, 1987. Thereafter, he was restricted from climbing, kneeling, squatting, and standing for more than four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Lawrence began vocational testing in a vocational placement program on August 24, 1999. The evidence proved that Lawrence arrived twenty minutes late for testing on that date; his tardy arrival disrupted other members of his class. On one of the tests, he did nothing but fill in his name. He also failed to complete another test and refused an offer of a second opportunity to complete the tests. Lawrence also insisted on tape recording the class, despite the instructor\u2019s direction not to do so and refused to turn his tape recorder off when requested. He also disrupted class by questioning the credentials of several staff members.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">After the first class, Lawrence attended the vocational rehabilitation classes sporadically. He was often late. He failed to attend class on September 1, 1999 and September 3, 1999, and arrived more than two hours late to class on September 2, 1999. Other members of the class voiced complaints about Lawrence\u2019s disruptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>On September 7, he attended class dressed inappropriately for an interview that had been scheduled for him. In addition, he did not attend the interview and failed to offer an explanation. Between September 7 and September 22, Lawrence continued to arrive late for appointments, failed to follow up on job leads, and failed to attend other interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The deputy commissioner found that Lawrence \u201cunjustifiably refused vocational rehabilitation offered by the employer in August and September of 1999.\u201d He held that Lawrence cured this refusal by securing selective employment on March 7, 2000. Because the deputy commissioner found that Lawrence\u2019s refusal was cured, he awarded Lawrence temporary partial disability, suspended from September 22, 1999 until September 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The full commission affirmed, noting that the \u201cdeputy commissioner\u2019s decision that the claimant refused vocational rehabilitation was based on a series of acts that ended on September 22, 1999.\u201d On that ground, it found \u201cno error in the deputy\u2019s decision to suspend benefits as of September 22, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The commission also held that the six-month period for curing a refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510 begins when the employer files its application for hearing. The employer filed its application on October 19, 1999. It held, therefore, that had Lawrence\u2019s refusal occurred on August 24,1999, his cure was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">\n<em>A. Calculation of Time to Cure Refusal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The commission found that Lawrence constructively refused selective employment by failing to cooperate throughout his vocational rehabilitation program, beginning on August 24, 1999 and continuing through September 22, 1999. Reasoning that Lawrence\u2019s refusal of selective employment culminated on September 22, 1999, the commission suspended benefits on that date, making it \u201cthe last day for which compensation was paid before suspension.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the code, the commission calculated the cure period from that date. <em>See id. </em>(providing that an unjustified refusal of suitable employment may be cured within six months \u201cfrom the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension\u201d). It concluded, therefore, that when Lawrence obtained employment on March 7, 2000, less than six months from September 22, 1999, he cured his refusal to obtain selective employment. Alternatively, the commission found that the cure period began on October 19, 1999, the date the employer filed its application, such that Lawrence cured his refusal by obtaining employment on March 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The employer claims that the commission should have suspended Lawrence\u2019s benefits on August 24, 1999, the date, it contends, that Lawrence began to constructively refuse employment. The employer argues, therefore, that Lawrence\u2019s opportunity to cure his unjustified refusal began on August 24. <em>See id. </em>We disagree and affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">An injured employee who refuses employment suitable to his capacity is not entitled to any compensation during the period of refusal unless the refusal is justified. Code \u00a7 65.2-510(A). \u201c \u2018An employer seeking to terminate compensation benefits based on refusal of selective employment must establish \u201c(1) a <em>bona fide </em>job offer suitable to the employee\u2019s capacity; (2) procured for the employee by the employer; and (3) an unjustified refusal by the employee to accept the job.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gallahan v. Free Lance Star Publ. Co., </em>37 Va.App. 114, 117, 554 S.E.2d 685, 686 (2001) (quoting <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 37, 542 S.E.2d 785, 788 (2001) (quoting <em>Ellerson v. W.O. Grubb Steel Erection Co., </em>1 Va.App. 97, 98, 335 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1985))). The employee has an opportunity to cure his unjustified refusal of suitable employment within six months \u201cfrom the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C). If he fails to do so, his benefits shall terminate beginning on the date he refused the offer of employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>We have held that \u201can employee\u2019s unjustified refusal to cooperate with placement efforts of the employer is tantamount to an unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.1-63 [now Code \u00a7 65.2-510].\u201d <em>James v. Capitol Steel Construction, 8 </em>Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 489 (1989); <em>accord UPS v. Godwin, </em>14 Va.App. 764, 767, 418 S.E.2d 910, 912 (1992) (\u201cAn unjustified refusal to attend an interview or an employee\u2019s refusal to cooperate at an interview may constitute an unjustified refusal of employment.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. City of Clifton Forge, </em>9 Va.App. 376, 378, 388 S.E.2d 654, 655 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc) (failure to keep interview suitable for employment, or unreasonable behavior during such an interview may constitute an unjustified refusal (citing <em>Jules Hairstylist, Inc. v. Galanes, </em>1 Va.App. 64, 334 S.E.2d 592 (1985))). In the case before us, we hold that the commission may properly base its conclusion that an employee has constructively refused employment on a course of conduct. <em>See Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374, 380 (1987) (holding that employee\u2019s failure to pursue job referrals procured by employer provides reason to terminate disability benefits); <em>Joyner v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Svcs., </em>502 A.2d 1027, 1031 (D.C. 1986) (same). Furthermore, the commission may suspend benefits and calculate the claimant\u2019s cure period at the culmination of that course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Whether an employee\u2019s failure to cooperate with an employer\u2019s rehabilitative efforts constituted a refusal of employment is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the evidence. <em>UPS, </em>14 Va.App. at 767, 418 S.E.2d at 912; <em>Pettiford v. S &amp; K Famous Brands, Inc., </em>YWC 144-57-87 (1992) (concluding from the totality of the circumstances that claimant\u2019s failure to attend meetings with rehabilitation counselor and failure to follow up on various job leads constituted a refusal of selective employment). Accordingly, the commission\u2019s resolution of this issue, \u201cif supported by credible evidence, [is] conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 672, 508 S.E.2d 335, 340 (1998). Evidence to the contrary in the record \u201cis of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Russell Loungewear v. Gray, </em>2 Va.App. 90, 95, 341 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">In this case, the commission held that the totality of Lawrence\u2019s behavior between August 24, 1999 and September 22, 1999 constituted an unjustified refusal of selective employment. Although the commission considered evidence of Lawrence\u2019s failure to pursue job leads provided by his employer on September 22, 1999, his failure to attend an interview arranged by his employer on September 7, 1999, and his numerous interruptions throughout the vocational rehabilitation program, it did not find that any single act constituted a refusal of selective employment. Rather, the commission calculated Lawrence\u2019s cure period beginning on September 22, 1999, implicitly finding that the totality of Lawrence\u2019s behavior throughout the period demonstrated his unwillingness to cooperate with his employer\u2019s rehabilitative efforts. <em>See James, </em>8 Va.App. at 517, 382 S.E.2d at 490 (upholding commissioner\u2019s determination that claimant unjustifiably refused to cooperate with rehabilitation efforts based on a series of acts and omissions by the claimant, which demonstrated his unwillingness to cooperate). Because the totality of Lawrence\u2019s behavior from August 24 through September 22 constituted an unjustifiable refusal of selective employment, we find no error in the commission\u2019s determination to suspend benefits and calculate Lawrence\u2019s cure period at the culmination of this period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not disturb the commission\u2019s award on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>B. Marketing Residual Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The employer claims the evidence was insufficient to support the commission\u2019s finding that Lawrence made reasonable efforts to market his remaining work capacity and that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>decision to award benefits to Lawrence should be reversed. Specifically, the employer argues that the commission\u2019s reliance on Lawrence\u2019s testimony was error because, as the commissioner noted, his \u201cexaggerations and misstatements demonstrate his repeated willingness to misrepresent facts to pursue a benefit.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">[I]n deciding whether a partially disabled employee has made reasonable effort to find suitable employment commensurate with his abilities, the commission should consider such factors as: (1) the nature and extent of employee\u2019s disability; (2) the employee\u2019s training, age, experience, and education; (3) the nature and extent of employee\u2019s job search; (4) the employee\u2019s intent in conducting his job search; (5) the availability of jobs in the area suitable for the employee, considering his disability; and (6) any other matter affecting employee\u2019s capacity to find suitable employment. The commission, of course, determines which of these or other factors are more or less significant with regard to the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><em>National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 273, 380 S.E.2d 31, 34-35 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In this case, the commission found that Lawrence\u2019s testimony about his marketing efforts and employment history during the period in question satisfied the requirements of <em>McGuinn. </em>The commission took Lawrence\u2019s lack of credibility into consideration, but gave greater weight to his employment history, which corroborated his testimony regarding the marketing efforts he made. Therefore, the commission accepted his testimony on this issue, although rejecting his testimony on several others. Such reliance was within the discretion of the commission and did not constitute error. <em>See Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cIt is well established that the trier of fact ascertains a witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given to their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d (citation omitted)). Accordingly, the evidence, including Lawrence\u2019s testimony regarding his employment efforts and his employment history, supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>commission\u2019s determination that Lawrence adequately marketed his residual capacity, and we will not disturb its decision on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. Because we find that the cure period was properly calculated from September 22, 1999, we need not address the commission\u2019s alternative holding that the cure period began on the date the employer filed its application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
