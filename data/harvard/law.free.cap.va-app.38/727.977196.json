HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">Ginger Lynn Heath (\u201cwife\u201d) appeals the .circuit court\u2019s October 25, 2001 entry of the final decree of divorce. Wife contends the chancellor erred (1) in holding that it was bound by the commissioner in chancery\u2019s determination that no spousal support should be ordered because wife filed no exception to the report, and (2) in entering the final decree of divorce consistent therewith. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm the judgment of the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Under familiar principles, \u201c[w]e review the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the party prevailing below and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So viewed, the facts below established that Jeffrey Burton Heath (\u201chusband\u201d) initiated divorce proceedings against wife in the Newport News circuit court on March 8, 2000. In her cross-bill, wife sought custody of the parties\u2019 minor children, child support, temporary and permanent spousal support, and equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The case was referred to a commissioner in chancery on May 30, 2000, for a recommendation on various issues, as well as \u201cwhether an order for support and maintenance of a spouse shall be modified or vacated.\u201d Subsequently, the circuit court entered a <em>pendente lite </em>order, directing husband to pay wife $500 per month in temporary spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The hearing before the commissioner in chancery was held on January 22, 2001. Husband attended the hearing, with counsel. Wife did not attend the hearing, because of the parties\u2019 minor child\u2019s medical appointment. However, wife\u2019s counsel attended the hearing on her behalf and raised no objection to proceeding in wife\u2019s absence. In addition, wife\u2019s counsel sought no permanent award of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In the commissioner\u2019s May 31, 2001 report, the commissioner found, among other things, that wife failed to attend the hearing, that wife failed to subsequently provide medical evidence in support of her absence, and that because wife sought no permanent award of spousal support, during either the pretrial conference or the hearing, no spousal support should be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Subsequent to the release of the commissioner\u2019s report, wife obtained new counsel, who requested additional time to review the report. The trial court granted wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, granting wife additional time to review the report and a ten-day extension of time to file any exceptions to the report. However, no exceptions were filed within the extension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>On October 25, 2001, the circuit court held a hearing on husband\u2019s motion for entry of the final decree of divorce. The proposed final decree stated, \u201cbecause [wife] did not seek an award of spousal support, none is ordered.\u201d Wife objected to the entry of the proposed decree because of the denial of spousal support. The chancellor overruled the objection and entered the final decree containing no spousal support award, finding that it was \u201clegally bound by the recommendations and provisions of the report relating to the matter because no exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report had been filed within the extended time specified by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">It is well settled that the chancellor has broad discretion in awarding spousal support under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.1 and 20-107.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such awards will not be set aside unless the record shows that some injustice has been done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden is on the party who alleges reversible error to show by the record that reversal is the remedy to which he is entitled.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Further, although the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018an appellate court must give due regard to the commissioner\u2019s ability, not shared by the chancellor, to see, hear, and evaluate the witnesses at first hand.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cA commissioner\u2019s findings of fact which have been accepted by the trial court \u2018are presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>to be correct when reviewed on appeal and are to be given \u201cgreat weight\u201d by this Court. The findings will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201cThe use of commissioners in chancery has been of long standing in Virginia.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, we have found that there is nothing improper about referring \u201cquestions ... to a commissioner in chancery,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as long as the trial court fulfills its \u201cduty to make factual determinations\u201d by either \u201caffirming] or rejecting] the commissioner\u2019s report, in whole or in part, according to the view the court entertains of the law and the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By statute, \u201c[ejxceptions to a commissioner\u2019s report shall be filed within ten days after such report has been filed with the court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_d\">In this instance, the chancellor specifically stated in his decree of reference that, pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint motion under Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the parties were to present the commissioner in chancery with evidence and testimony concerning various issues, including the amount of any monetary award to either party, and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">(a) whether an order for support and maintenance of a spouse shall be modified or vacated, (b) whether any such maintenance and support shall be made in periodic payments or in a lump sum award, or both, and (c) the amount or amounts [and] any other provision(s) thereof, all pursuant to criteria and subject restrictions set forth in Section 20-107.1....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The decree also directed the parties to provide evidence concerning \u201csuch other inquiry as may be agreed upon by the parties or to the Commissioner shall seem meet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Wife raised no objection to the decree of reference referring the case to the commissioner. Further, wife had the opportunity to request and present evidence on the issue of spousal support at the hearing, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Moreover, wife\u2019s claim that the letter sent to the parties by the commissioner, describing the scope of the hearing, did not \u201cmention spousal support as a subject to be covered,\u201d as well as her claim that the issue of spousal support was not \u201ctaken up at the commissioner\u2019s hearing,\u201d simply demonstrates a lack of diligence and/or carelessness in pursuing the issue. The court specifically ordered the commissioner to consider the matter of support, as well as any other matters deemed appropriate by the parties and the commissioner, during them hearing, pursuant to their joint motion for dissolution of the marriage and distribution of the parties\u2019 assets under Code \u00a7 20-107.3.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In addition, wife filed no exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report within the statutorily prescribed time limit, or within the extension of time granted by the trial court. Accordingly, the record provides no indication that wife properly raised in the trial court her question presented. In making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>this ruling, we note that any objection raised for the first time during the hearing on husband\u2019s motion for final decree of divorce, raised approximately four months past the ten-day deadline for filing exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, was not timely raised and was not properly before the chancellor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It has long been settled that \u201c[a] party who believes the commissioner\u2019s report to be in error must except to the perceived error____\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">Finally,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">[t]he rule is that the parts of a report not excepted to, are to be considered as admitted to be correct\u2014both as regards the principles and the evidence upon which they are founded: otherwise the opposite party would be taken by surprise, and, in consequence thereof, injustice might be done. Exceptions partake of the nature of special demurrers, and hence, as the authorities say, the party excepting must \u201cput his finger on the error,\u201d that the court may see what it has to decide. It is too late, however, to do so for the first time in the appellate court, unless the report be erroneous on its face.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Here, \u201c[n]o error appears on the face of the report of the commissioner nor on the face of the decree of the chancellor. Except as to such apparent errors, a report of a commissioner in chancery is <em>prima fade </em>correct.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he conclusion of the commissioner and the adjudication of the court, by the decree complained of based thereon, ... [were] final and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>conclusive upon [wife] and are not open to review in this court.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Thus, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the chancellor in refusing to consider the spousal support issue on the merits, for the first time, during the hearing on the motion to enter the final divorce decree. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">. <em>Anderson v.

Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) gives the trial court discretion to grant a monetary award.
