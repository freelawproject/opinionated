On appeal, Scearce contends the trial judge erred in ruling that the prosecutor laid a proper foundation to admit into evidence a statement under the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">The evidence proved that a police officer arrested Scearce\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Henry Tickle, for driving on September 30, 2000 be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tween 4:00 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., which was outside the restricted hours of Tickle\u2019s driving permit. A grand jury later indicted Scearce for attempting to induce or procure William Wesley Hyler to commit perjury, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-26 and 18.2-436.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">At Scearce\u2019s trial, which occurred February 2, 2001, Hyler testified that Scearce asked him to testify in court that Tickle had been asleep on Hyler\u2019s sofa at 4:00 a.m. Hyler testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t remember the exact date or month\u201d he talked to Scearce and that he \u201cbelieve[d] it was a Saturday or something like that,\u201d but \u201cain\u2019t sure.\u201d Although Hyler testified that he later told a police officer about Scearce\u2019s request, Hyler could not recall, in relation to his conversation with the officer, when he had spoken with Scearce.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The prosecutor informed the trial judge that immediately prior to trial the police officer read to Hyler, who cannot read, the statement the officer had transcribed on October 9, 2000, when Hyler spoke to the officer. Upon the prosecutor\u2019s motion, the trial judge permitted the bailiff to leave the courtroom with Hyler and refresh Hyler\u2019s memory again by reading to Hyler the statement the police officer had written. When questioned by the prosecutor after this attempt to refresh his memory, Hyler testified that Scearce had come to his home \u201cthat Saturday before last, on October the 9th.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201c[t]he Saturday ... before last, when you talked to the police on October the 9th?\u201d After Hyler responded, \u201cyes sir,\u201d the prosecutor asked the judge to take \u201cjudicial notice of the calendar ... that would have been Saturday before last, from October the 9th, would have been September the 30th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In response to further questions by the prosecutor, Hyler testified twice that Scearce \u201cdidn\u2019t say what date\u201d she wanted him to say Tickle was asleep on his sofa. The prosecutor requested leave to prove, as a past recollection recorded, the statement Hyler gave to the officer and then asked Hyler the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Q. [T]his is a statement that you gave to Officer Pace on October the 9th? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">Q. [W]as your memory better then or is it better now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">A. My memory has never been real good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">Q. It\u2019s never been real good?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">A. Yes sir. I\u2019ll be honest with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">Q. Well, would you say it was better on October the 9th, than it was today, about what happened on September 30th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGP\">A. No ... I couldn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">Q. You couldn\u2019t say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">A .... like if somethin[g] happened today ... say something] happened on Monday ... if I had to go the next day and do something], then I mean I can remember it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">Q. Well, but do you remember what [Scearce] told you that day she came to your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-14\">A. Yeah, she said she wanted me to go ... go to Court and tell that [Tickle] was sleep on my couch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-15\">Q. Okay. Do you remember what time she said Henry would have been asleep on your couch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-17\">A. 4:00 A.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">Q. 4:00 A.M. All right, but you don\u2019t remember what date she said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-19\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-20\">Q. But you told the police all of this on October the 9th, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-21\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-22\">Q. And Officer Pace reduced your statement to writing? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-23\">Q. And he read it back to you? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-24\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-25\">Q. Well, was it correct at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On cross-examination, Hyler admitted that his memory was such that he might not remember on Wednesday something that happened on Monday. Scearce\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cso if somebody came to you and told you something, or suggested something, on one day, then certainly nine days later, you may not remember accurately, would you?\u201d Hyler testified that he would \u201cmostly not\u201d remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The prosecutor then recalled as a witness the officer who transcribed Hyler\u2019s statement. The officer testified that he spoke to Hyler on October 9, that Hyler was \u201cclear\u201d in relaying information on that day, that he wrote what Hyler told him, that he read his writing to Hyler, and that Hyler signed it. The officer was then permitted, over the hearsay objection of Scearce\u2019s counsel, to read the statement into evidence. In pertinent part, the statement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cI give the following statement ... on 10/9/2000 at 11:30 A.M., about a conversation between myself and Jerri Scearce. The Saturday before last, around 6:00 o\u2019clock, to 6:30 P.M., Jerri Scearce, and.... I went into my kitchen, where Jerri asked me to go to Court with her, to tell that Henry Tickle was asleep on my couch, at around 4:00 o\u2019clock A.M. that morning. I told Jerri that I could not do that. I won\u2019t lie for my own brother. I ain\u2019t going to lie for anyone. I know that\u2019s perjury, and that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Signed by William Wesley Hyler....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Scearce presented testimony by an agent of a bonding service that she went to th\u00e9 magistrate\u2019s office prior to 5:00 p.m. on September 30 and remained there until after 7:00 p.m. Tickle also testified that he left the jail with Scearce after 7:00 p.m. and remained with her until 8:00 p.m. Scearce testified that she did not see Hyler on September 30 and that she was at the magistrate\u2019s office between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. She also testified that she never asked Hyler to testify about Tickle and would not have done so because Tickle and Hyler were antagonistic to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The trial judge convicted Scearce of attempted subordination of perjury. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u201cThe general rule of past recollection recorded allows, over a hearsay objection, a witness with no independent recollection of an incident to testify directly from notes or reports if certain requirements are met.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 98, 102, 379 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1989). We have held that the memorandum of past recollection recorded need not be made by the witness whose memory is at issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyF\">\u201c[T]he general rule [among courts nationwide] is that it is not essential that the record of past recollection shall have been made by the witness, if he knows that it is true as written. It is sufficient if the memorandum was made by someone else but has been examined by the witness and is known by him to be correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 236, 241, 456 S.E.2d 144, 146 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Under the past recollection recorded exception, the proponent of the statement also must establish each of the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201c(1) [T]he witness must have had firsthand knowledge of the event, (2) the written statement must be an original <em>memorandum made </em>at or near the time of the event and <em>while the witness had a clear and accurate memory of [the event], </em>(3) the witness must lack a present recollection of the event, and (4) the witness must vouch for the accuracy of the written memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\"><em>Scott v. Greater Richmond Transit Co., </em>241 Va. 300, 304, 402 S.E.2d 214, 217 (1991) (emphasis added and citation omitted). Scearce challenged at trial and now on appeal whether on October 9 Hyler had a clear and accurate memory of the events contained in the officer\u2019s memorandum and whether Hyler was able to vouch for the accuracy of the memorandum. We address Scearce\u2019s first contention that the evidence failed to prove Hyler\u2019s memory was clear and accurate on October 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>When accepting testimony under the past recollection exception, the trial judge relies heavily on the witness\u2019 pledge that the witness\u2019 memory was accurate at the time the memorandum was written. The record clearly proves, however, that the prosecutor was unable to establish that Hyler\u2019s memory was clear and accurate on October 9, when the officer\u2019s memorandum indicated that Hyler\u2019s statement was made. Hyler\u2019s own testimony was that he could not say that his memory was accurate on that date. Indeed, Hyler testified that his memory is not good more than one or two days past the happening of an event. Based on Hyler\u2019s own testimony, had Scearce approached him on September 30, he would \u201cmostly not\u201d remember the event on October 9 in order to relay it accurately to the officers. Indeed, Hyler specifically testified that he could not say his memory about the events at issue was better on October 9 than it was at trial. The officer\u2019s testimony that Hyler was \u201cclear\u201d in his statement cannot supplant Hyler\u2019s own testimony about his deficient memory. Thus, we hold that, although Hyler testified that the officer wrote his statement, the evidence fails to establish that Hyler\u2019s memory of his conversation with Scearce was clear and accurate when he spoke to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Furthermore, the trial judge\u2019s error in permitting the officer to read the statement into evidence was not harmless. The defense presented evidence that Hyler had a motive to fabricate his testimony that Scearce wanted him to perjure himself. Scearce presented evidence that Hyler, whom she had dated twenty years ago, disliked Tickle, her fianc\u00e9. Scearce also attempted to discredit Hyler with his admission that he sometimes drank heavily and that he had drunk beer on both September 30 and October 9. Critically, Hyler was not able to testify without some aid as to the date of his conversation with Scearce. In addition, Hyler testified twice that Scearce did not say what day she wanted him to say Tickle was asleep on the sofa, and Hyler did not testify that Tickle had never slept on his sofa. Hyler\u2019s credibility was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The officer who transcribed Hyler\u2019s statement also testified that after he asked Hyler \u201ca few questions ... as to the date and time [the conversation] had happened, ... [he] checked [his] notes to make sure that that was the same date that [he] had seen Mr. Tickle driving. Then ... [he] wrote the statement.\u201d In assessing whether Hyler fabricated the story, the trier of fact clearly could have substantially relied upon the officer\u2019s memorandum of Hyler\u2019s statement to determine that Hyler knew the details of the event. Thus, we cannot say that the conviction was not substantially affected by the admission of the statement. <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 261, 546 S.E.2d 728, 732 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Scearce also challenges whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. \u201cWhen an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant to it \u2018all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 540, 548, 439 S.E.2d 616, 621 (1994) (citation omitted). So viewed, Hyler provided testimony from which a trier of fact could find that Scearce had sought to have him give testimony in court on Tickle\u2019s behalf. Scearce\u2019s \u201cargument is based entirely on the issue of witness credibility.\u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 70, 515 S.E.2d 565, 575 (1999). The critical issue was whether the finder of fact could be persuaded that Hyler was truthful and could accurately recall the events. That is a matter for the finder of fact to consider upon properly admitted evidence. Accordingly, we cannot say the evidence was insufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. We do not address Scearce\u2019s argument that she was improperly convicted of an attempted inchoate crime. She failed to properly preserve this issue for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
