The panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of a judgment against M. Morgan Cherry <em>&amp; </em>Associates (MMCA) in the amount of $9,900. The judgment was based on a violation of a court order, issued pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1, directing MMCA to withhold and pay out of the disposable income of M. Morgan Cherry, an employee and shareholder of MMCA, a deducted amount for spousal support due the appellee, Natalie W. Cherry. The trial court found that MMCA had violated the income deduction order and entered judgment against it. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Under familiar principles, we state the evidence in the light most favorable to Ms. Cherry, the party prevailing below. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>30 Va.App. 341, 349, 516 S.E.2d 726, 730 (1999). MMCA is a Virginia corporation that provides private investigation services. Mr. Cherry owns 60% of the outstanding stock of MMCA. MMCA\u2019s other two shareholders, Robert M. Puglisi and Thomas G. Byrne, each own 20% of the stock. Puglisi and Byrne are not related to Mr. Cherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Ms. Cherry filed her bill of complaint for divorce against Mr. Cherry on January 31, 2000. The parties entered into a Consent <em>Pendente Lite </em>Support Order on May 8, 2000, which provided that Mr. Cherry would pay Ms. Cherry $3,300 per month in spousal support. Mr. Cherry ceased making spousal support payments in July 2000. On July 17, 2000, Mr. Cherry instructed MMCA to stop paying him a salary and they complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On August 28, 2000, at Ms. Cherry\u2019s request, the court issued an income deduction order pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1. The income deduction order identified MMCA as the \u201cemployer\u201d and required MMCA to withhold and pay out of the disposable income of Mr. Cherry a deducted amount for spousal support for Ms. Cherry. It also provided that MMCA \u201cshall be liable for payments which [it] fails to withhold or mail as specified in the Order.\u201d The amount of the deduction was set at $3,300 per month, subject to a limitation based on Mr. Cherry\u2019s disposable income. Thus, depending upon the amount of disposable income it paid to Mr. Cherry, MMCA would be obligated to make payments of up to $3,300 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">On September 22, 2000, Ms. Cherry filed a motion for satisfaction of judgment by defendant\u2019s interest in his corporate entities. By that motion, Ms. Cherry asked the court to require MMCA to directly satisfy, in whole or in part, judgments and other obligations of Mr. Cherry in the case. The court denied the motion without prejudice, holding that it could not be heard on an abbreviated motions day.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Ms. Cherry proceeded to an equitable distribution hearing before the trial court on October 31, 2000. MMCA filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>motion to intervene to protect itself against discovery requests served by Ms. Cherry. It claimed that Ms. Cherry sought privileged and confidential information relating to the company. The trial court denied the motion, and MMCA did not participate in the hearing. As part of the equitable distribution hearing, Ms. Cherry again asked that the court require MMCA to pay judgments entered against Mr. Cherry. The court again denied the request without prejudice, holding that Ms. Cherry had to file a separate lawsuit to pursue the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">At the hearing, the trial court also <em>sua sponte </em>issued a rule to show cause why MMCA should not be held in contempt for its failure to comply with the income deduction order. The trial court set a return date of November 3, 2000 for the rule to show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The trial court conducted the show cause hearing on November 3 and November 17. The evidence proved that Mr. Cherry had instructed MMCA to stop paying a salary to him on July 17, 2000 and that MMCA complied, but that Mr. Cherry continued as an employee of MMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Ms. Cherry contended that MMCA had a continuing liability to Mr. Cherry. She relied, in part, on the testimony of Puglisi, MMCA\u2019s sole witness. Puglisi acknowledged that MMCA had approved the response to the income deduction order filed on September 1, 2000, which stated that \u201cMr. Cherry instructed [MMCA] not to make any further payments of salary or any other amounts to him. Mr. Cherry is still an employee of [MMCA].\u201d Further, Puglisi testified that Mr. Cherry is co-founder and majority shareholder of the company, that some clients choose MMCA based on Mr. Cherry\u2019s reputation, that Mr. Cherry may have clients that he solicits, and that he has marketing responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Counsel for Ms. Cherry indicated three times throughout the show cause proceeding that she was basing her argument, in part, on the testimony of Ms. Cherry from the equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>distribution hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No transcript of evidence from the equitable distribution hearing was introduced, however. MMCA did not object to the references by counsel and did not produce the evidence referred to by Ms. Cherry\u2019s counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Ostensibly treating the referenced evidence from the prior hearing as before her, the trial court judge specifically stated that, in entering judgment against MMCA, she was relying upon it, in part, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the evidence regarding \u201cthe nature of [MMCA\u2019s] business, the kind of work that it does, its ownership, its structure, and ... the way Mr. Cherry operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.\u201d MMCA failed to object, on due process or other grounds, to the court\u2019s consideration of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The trial judge concluded that \u201cMMCA continues to be liable to Max Cherry for his salary whether MMCA is paying it or not ... and inasmuch as it\u2019s an obligation that MMCA owes to Mr. Cherry, it\u2019s an obligation that MMCA under this Court\u2019s income deduction order owes to Ms. Cherry.\u201d She did not find MMCA in contempt, but entered judgment against MMCA for $9,900, representing the amount the court deemed due from MMCA to Ms. Cherry under the income deduction order for the months of September, October, and November 2000. MMCA objected to the amount of the judgment, but registered no other objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">MMCA now appeals the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\n<em>Threshold Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Although Ms. Cherry presented three threshold issues for our consideration, one of them is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We address the remaining issues. First, Ms. Cherry maintains that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear MMCA\u2019s claims. We disagree. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405, which states, \u201c[a]ny aggrieved party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from ... [a]ny ... domestic relations matter arising under Title 16.1 or Title 20.\u201d Because the court issued the income deduction order pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1, this case involves a domestic relations matter arising under Title 20 and comes within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Second, Ms. Cherry contends that MMCA\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to intervene in the divorce case is untimely. We need not address this issue because we find MMCA did not appeal the denial of its motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">\n<em>MMCA\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">MMCA contends that: (1) the trial court improperly considered evidence from an earlier proceeding; (2) the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the trial court\u2019s finding that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry; (3) the trial court violated MMCA\u2019s right to due process of law; and (4) the trial court lacked authority to enter judgment on a rule to show cause. We consider appellant\u2019s allegations <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\n<em>A. Consideration of Evidence from Previous Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">MMCA alleges for the first time on appeal that the trial court improperly relied on evidence from the equitable distribution hearing in reaching its decision to enter judgment against MMCA. Therefore, this claim is procedurally barred. Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 808, 88 S.E. 166, 167 (1916); <em>cf. Hess v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 738, 739-44, 441 S.E.2d 29, 30-33 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">At trial, MMCA did not object on due process or other grounds to the court\u2019s consideration of the evidence when Ms. Cherry directed the judge to testimony from the earlier hearing or when the trial judge stated she took it into account. Nor did MMCA properly raise the objection in closing by stating that \u201con the evidence that\u2019s before Your Honor here today, the rule to show cause should be dismissed.\u201d <em>See Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 225, 228, 416 S.E.2d 25, 27 (1992) (holding that a closing argument satisfies the contemporaneous objection rule only where the trial court \u201cconsidered the issue\u201d and \u201chad an opportunity to take corrective action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Finally, MMCA\u2019s failure to object does not fit within either the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to the rule. First, because MMCA failed to utilize several opportunities to make its objection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find no \u201cgood cause\u201d for MMCA\u2019s failure to raise the issue at trial. <em>See Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000) (holding that where \u201cthe defendant had the opportunity to object but elected not to do so,\u201d his claim is not preserved).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Second, the \u201cends of justice\u201d do not require us to consider MMCA\u2019s claim that the trial judge improperly considered evidence from the equitable distribution proceeding be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>cause MMCA did not present a record on appeal that affirmatively demonstrates that such consideration \u201cclearly had an effect upon the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989); <em>see Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (\u201cIn order to avail oneself of the exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u201d (citing <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987))); <em>see also Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 503, 520-21, 513 S.E.2d 431, 440 (1999). Without the evidence MMCA claimed the judge erroneously considered, we cannot perform the necessary calculus to determine whether the error was clear, substantial and material. <em>See Jenkins v. Winchester Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>12 Va.App. 1178, 1185, 409 S.E.2d 16, 20 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Because MMCA failed, without good cause, to object to the court\u2019s use of evidence from the prior proceeding and has not proven that a manifest injustice resulted, we will not consider the merits of this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">MMCA also contends the trial court erred in its finding that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry. Our standard of review requires that we presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct, <em>Broom v. Broom, </em>15 Va.App. 497, 504, 425 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1992), and that we sustain its finding unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Dodge v. Dodge, </em>2 Va.App. 238, 242, 343 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Furthermore, MMCA bears the burden of proving that the evidence did not justify the conclusion that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry, including presentation of a record that demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record. <em>Justis v. Young, </em>202 Va. 631, 632, 119 S.E.2d 255, 256-57 (1961); <em>Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1185, 409 S.E.2d at 20; <em>Steinberg v. Steinberg, </em>11 Va.App. 323, 326, 398 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1990); <em>Kaufman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Kaufman, </em>7 Va.App. 488, 499, 375 S.E.2d 374, 380 (1988). \u201cIf the appellant fails to do this, the judgment will be affirmed.\u201d <em>Justis, </em>202 Va. at 632, 119 S.E.2d at 257. The appellant must present to the appellate court <em>all </em>the evidence considered by the trial judge, including evidence that may have been considered improperly but without objection. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 522, 499 S.E.2d 263, 266 (1998) (\u201cSince the handwritten notation on the discharge summary was received without objection as evidence in the case, the Court of Appeals erred in disregarding that portion of the exhibit in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Because MMCA has not met its burden of producing the challenged evidence for our review on appeal, we cannot say the evidence before the trial judge was insufficient as a matter of law to support her finding. Therefore, we affirm her decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><em>C. Due </em>Process<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We find no merit in MMCA\u2019s claim that the trial court violated its due process rights because it lacked reasonable notice that its financial interests were at stake at the show cause hearing. The trial court twice notified MMCA that it could issue a money judgment against it. First, the trial court issued an income deduction order, which, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.3(11), specifically provided that MMCA \u201cshall be liable for payments which [it] fails to withhold or mail.\u201d Second, we have previously held that a trial court may issue a money judgment on a rule to show cause. <em>See Shoup v. Shoup, </em>31 Va.App. 621, 627-28, 525 S.E.2d 61, 64-65 (2000). MMCA was properly served with the rule to show cause and was chargeable with the knowledge that, under Virginia law, its financial interests were at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Likewise, we find no merit in MMCA\u2019s contention that the trial court, at the show cause hearing, improperly denied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>right to a jury trial and its right to cross-examine evidence against it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is uncontested that MMCA participated as a party in the show cause hearing. At no time during the hearing did MMCA request, or make an effort to implement its right, to cross-examine or a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">\n<em>D. Entry of Judgment on Rule to Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">MMCA also argued, for the first time in its reply brief, that the trial court had no legal basis to enter judgment against it to enforce the terms of the income deduction order in the context of a contempt hearing on the rule to show cause. Because this issue was not presented below, we do not consider it on appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. First, on November 3, she noted Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony that she had not received support from either Mr. Cherry or MMCA since June 2000. Again on that date, counsel referred to Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony regarding the methods by which Mr. Cherry generates profits for MMCA: \"[Mr. Cherry] goes around the United States and the world and he gets business and then he has his network of subcontractors do the business. They don\u2019t need billing from Mr. Cherry.\u201d She also stated that MMCA did not controvert Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony. Finally, at the second session of the hearing on November 17, Ms. Cherry\u2019s counsel reminded the court that Ms. Cherry had testified at the equitable distribution hearing that Mr. Cherry controlled MMCA. Ms. Cherry did not testily at the show cause hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"><em>. </em>Our order dated December 22, 2000 mooted MMCA\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s December 1, 2000 order denying a supersedeas bond. We suspended execution of the judgment, and a bond was issued pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">. Before making its ruling, the trial court described the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing she considered, then asked the plaintiffs counsel to prepare a judgment order in her favor. In addition, opposing counsel made three references to it in support of her argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\">. As discussed in Section I of this opinion, we do not find that MMCA appealed the denial of its motion to intervene. Therefore, we do not address the claim that the denial violated due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\">. For reasons discussed in Section 11(A) of this opinion, we do not address MMCA\u2019s argument that it could not cross-examine the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">BENTON, Judge., with whom FITZPATRICK, Chief Judge, BRAY, BUMGARDNER, and AGEE, JJ., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">M. Morgan Cherry &amp; Associates, Ltd., a Virginia corporation, was not a party to the divorce proceedings between Natalie W. Ch\u00e9rry and her husband, Max Morgan Cherry, III. Yet, in November 2000 hearings to determine whether the corporation violated an income deduction order, which was entered in the divorce proceeding, the trial judge judicially recognized facts that apparently were proved in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. Based substantially on those facts, the judge entered a money judgment against the corporation for violating the income deduction order. I would hold that the judge committed reversible error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cThe general rule is that the court will not travel outside the record of the case before it in order to take notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>proceedings in another case, even between the same parties and in the same court, unless the proceedings are put in evidence. The reason for the rule is that the decision of a cause must depend upon the evidence introduced. If the courts should recognize judicially facts adjudicated in another case, it makes those facts, though unsupported by evidence in the case at hand, conclusive against the opposing party; while if they had been properly introduced they might have been met and overcome by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><em>Bernau v. Nealon, </em>219 Va. 1039, 1043, 254 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The record establishes that the managing principal officer, who is one of the three shareholders of the corporation, was the sole witness at the hearing from which this appeal arises. He testified that in February 2000, he had a discussion with the husband about his decreased participation in the corporation\u2019s business. He told the husband \u201cthat the drop in his hourly contribution was significantly impacting the company and ... that it wasn\u2019t quite fair that the compensation he was receiving was based on ... 1997, 1998 involvement.\u201d In July 2000, he again discussed with the husband the lack of justification for paying the husband when \u201cno income [was] coming from [the husband].\u201d At that time, the husband had only 100 billable hours for all of the year 2000. Based on those discussions, the husband agreed in July 2000 that the corporation should stop paying his salary. The corporation did so on July 17. The managing principal officer testified that the husband, who owns 60% of the corporation\u2019s stock, continues to be one of the three shareholders of the corporation and is an inactive, unpaid employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In September 2000, seven months after the managing principal officer confronted the husband about his unproductivity, the corporation first received notice of the income deduction order. The corporation promptly filed in the circuit court its response that it \u201chas made no payments of salary or any other amounts to [husband] since July 17, 2000.\u201d In response to questions from the wife\u2019s attorney at the show cause hearing, the managing principal officer was clear that the husband was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>not participating in the affairs of the corporation. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">Q And sometimes [the husband] is a director of operations and does marketing and business management and so forth, too, doesn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">A He has, yes, in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">Q And the operations that are the source of revenue for [the corporation] are investigations, are they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">Q And [the husband] conducts those investigations, doesn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">A He has in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">Q And in fact [the husband] is [the corporation\u2019s] primary investigator, isn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">A No, that\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">sK \u00cd<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">Q But nobody has ever compelled him to go out and work, have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">A We have in the past tried to get him to\u2014as a matter of fact, this summer, get him to work cases for us and he just hasn\u2019t been able to do it. I don\u2019t know the reasons why. I\u2019ve retained the responsibilities for those matters and Mr. Burn has also for those matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-15\">It would be difficult to say we could force him to do work when he\u2019s not physically here.

He testified that the minority owners had no power \u201cto fire\u201d the husband because the husband was the majority stockholder. Their only \u201coptions or alternatives were to ... dissolve or separate [themselves] from the company.\u201d He testified that the coming December would be the end of the fiscal year and that decisions would then be made about bonuses. He also testified that the corporation has \u201cnever had a dividend.\u201d No other witness testified, and no other documentary evidence was presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In argument to the trial judge at the conclusion of that testimony, the corporation\u2019s attorney asserted that \u201con the evidence that\u2019s before your Honor here today, the rule to show cause should be dismissed.\u201d The judge took the matter under advisement for two weeks. At a later hearing, which consisted only of further argument by the attorneys, the judge ruled from the bench. In pertinent part, she stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuN\">Well, I recall all the evidence that was adduced at the hearing last time, primarily through [the managing principal officer], but <em>I have also considered the evidence that was received during the equitable distribution case about [the corporation], the nature of the business, the kind of work that it does, its ownership, its structure, and I also rely upon the evidence that I heard during the equitable distribution case regarding the way [the husband] operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">:j\u00ab sfc <em>% v</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">So today, pursuant to the income deduction order that was entered by this Court on August 28th of 2000,1 am entering a judgment against [the corporation] in the amount of $9,900 for its failure to make payments for September 1, October 1, and November 1 of the year 2000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(Emphasis added). Immediately at the conclusion of the hearing, the judge entered an \u201cOrder Pertaining to Rule Against MMCA,\u201d which incorporated the judge\u2019s \u201cbench ruling\u201d and \u201cawarded a judgment against [the corporation] in the ... amount of $9,900,\u201d plus interest, in satisfaction of the income deduction order. The corporation\u2019s attorney \u201cobjected to [the order] on the grounds stated in open Court and on the record herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\u201c[I]t was plain error for [the trial judge] to go outside the record to find another reason to support [her] decision.\u201d <em>Russell County School Bd. v. Anderson, </em>238 Va. 372, 385, 384 S.E.2d 598, 605 (1989). Moreover, this is not a case such as <em>Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 808, 88 S.E. 166, 167 (1916), where the trial judge \u201cpermit[ted] the evidence ... given in the [other] case ... to be read in evidence\u201d in this case. <em>See also Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000) (noting that the trial judge \u201cmade the letter part of the file and the record\u201d). Neither party offered as evidence any matters proved on the record in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. Moreover, the corporation was not a party to the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because no matters concerning the equitable distribution proceeding were offered as evidence in the show cause proceeding, the corporation\u2019s attorney had no occasion to object. Indeed, after the evidence described above was proved by the testimony of the corporation\u2019s managing principal officer, the trial judge entertained \u201cargument\u201d by the attorneys. Although the majority opinion recognizes that references to the extraneous \u201cevidence\u201d first occurred when the wife\u2019s attorney, during summation argument, made references to the wife\u2019s divorce proceeding testimony, the record clearly establishes that no evidence was then being offered and the only issue before the trial judge concerned the import of the evidence in the show cause proceeding. I believe, therefore, that the corporation\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument adequately preserved for review both the objection to the judge\u2019s reliance on evidence not in the record and the objection to insufficiency of the evidence. He informed the judge that \u201con the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>that\u2019s before Your Honor here today\u201d there was no evidence to prove the corporation owed any monetary obligation to husband. In addition, the attorney noted the same objection on the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">\u201cThe primary function of Rule 5A:18 is to alert the trial judge to possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992). The contemporaneous objection requirement may be satisfied by an attorney\u2019s closing argument that touches upon the matter at issue. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 498, 504, 507 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1998); <em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 225, 228, 416 S.E.2d 25, 27 (1992); <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 593, 596, 413 S.E.2d 354, 355-56 (1992). That was done in this case. Moreover, the judge, who had tried the divorce case and had denied the corporation\u2019s motion to intervene in the divorce case, knew the corporation was not a party to the divorce proceeding. The attorney\u2019s argument, which directed the judge\u2019s attention to \u201cthe evidence that\u2019s before Your Honor here today,\u201d clearly put the judge on notice that she was limited to considering \u201cthe evidence ... before\u201d her at the show cause proceeding. I would hold, therefore, that the attorney preserved for appeal both the issues of insufficiency of the evidence and the limitation of evidence to that which was contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s \u201cends of justice\u201d discussion, I would hold that, in any event, to attain the ends of justice we should consider this issue of the judge\u2019s reliance on facts not in evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. \u201c \u2018An appellate court may ... take cognizance of errors though not assigned when they ... are fundamental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 883, 889, 140 S.E.2d 688, 693 (1963) (citation omitted). The judge\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d deprived the corporation of a fundamental right because the only evidence before the trial judge in this limited proceeding was the uncontradicted testimony of the managing principal officer that the corporation did not owe the husband income, as defined in the income deduction order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and by Code \u00a7 63.1-250. The evidence before the judge in the November hearings, the only proceeding to which the corporation was a party, did not contain a scintilla of proof concerning the evidence previously given in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. <em>Cf. Hansel, </em>118 Va. at 808, 88 S.E. at 167 (noting that the trial judge permitted the evidence from the other case \u201cto be read in evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Moreover, the corporation had no opportunity to know, challenge, or rebut evidence from the prior hearings that the wife or the judge considered significant. The corporation, therefore, was denied the essence of due process. <em>See Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 267-71, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020-22, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (holding that notice and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting and cross-examining adverse witnesses are components of the right to due process); <em>Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, </em>492 U.S. 257, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 2926, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989) (holding that \u201ca corporation is entitled to due process ... of law\u201d). \u201cThe denial of due process involves the denial of a fundamental constitutional right and falls within the ambit of Rule 5A:18 to attain the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 334, 338-39, 549 S.E.2d 652, 654 (2001). Applying these principles, we may invoke the ends of justice exception in a case such as here, where the due process violation results in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See id. </em>at 339, 549 S.E.2d at 654. A miscarriage of justice is apparent in this case because the evidence properly before the judge affirmatively proved that the corporation owed no income or other monetary obligation to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">I would hold further that the judge\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d in considering evidence outside the record was not harmless. The trial judge generally stated that she also was relying on evidence she heard \u201cduring the equitable distribution case, about [the corporation], the nature of the business, the kind of work ... it does, its ownership, its structure, and ... [about] the way [the husband] operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.\u201d This error was significant because it impacted upon the lack of credit the judge gave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the unimpeached testimony of the corporation\u2019s managing officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">While a jury, or a judge trying a case without a jury, are the judges of the weight of the testimony and the credibility of witnesses, they may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with the facts appearing in the record, even though such witnesses are interested in the outcome of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">Here [the] evidence was uncontradicted; it was not inherently incredible; and it constituted the only facts appearing in the record. Even ... [if] the trial judge did not believe [the] testimony, [her] mere belief or speculation is not sufficient to disregard the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\"><em>Hodge v. American Family Life, </em>213 Va. 30, 31-32, 189 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1972). <em>See also Cheatham v. Gregory, </em>227 Va. 1, 4-5, 313 S.E.2d 368, 370 (1984). The judge\u2019s decision to enter the judgment was substantially swayed by her erroneous consideration of facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Additionally, the majority opinion\u2019s sufficiency analysis operates upon the faulty premises that an argument by an attorney to the judge concerning the incidents of the case and the judge\u2019s notice of facts adjudicated in another proceeding constitute evidence. Those premises are contrary to well established principles. <em>See Bernau, </em>219 Va. at 1041, 254 S.E.2d at 84 (holding that \u201c[individual and extrajudicial knowledge on the part of a judge will not dispense -with proof of facts not judicially cognizable, and cannot be resorted to for the purpose of supplementing the record\u201d); <em>Waye v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 691, 251 S.E.2d 202, 206 (1979) (approving the judge\u2019s instruction to \u201cthe jury that the [attorney\u2019s] statement was not evidence\u201d); <em>Cook v. Hayden, </em>183 Va. 203, 226, 31 S.E.2d 625, 634 (1944) (holding \u201cthat the statements [of the attorney concerning facts to be proved] were not evidence\u201d); <em>Cummings v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 248, 251-52, 481 S.E.2d 493, 494 (1997) (holding that the attorney\u2019s discussion with the judge about facts to be proved is not evidence). Relying upon these faulty premises, the majority misapplies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 255 </em>Va. 516, 499 S.E.2d 263 (1998), and misconstrues its holding as requiring an appellate court to accept all extraneous matters \u201cconsidered\u201d by the trial judge. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the Supreme Court held that in reviewing an appeal for sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe reviewing court must consider all <em>evidence properly admitted </em>at trial.\u201d 255 Va. at 522, 499 S.E.2d at 266 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The facts of this case reveal that, after the evidence had been established at an evidentiary hearing, the wife\u2019s attorney referred during summation argument to testimony apparently made at the earlier equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding to which the corporation was not a party. Neither the attorney\u2019s statements nor the judge\u2019s bench remarks are evidence. Moreover, the wife\u2019s attorney neither proffered as evidence nor read into evidence the record from the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding upon which the trial judge relied. Although it is the responsibility of the corporation, as appellant, to present this Court with a full record, that responsibility does not include presenting documents not in evidence. <em>See Bernau, </em>219 Va. at 1043, 254 S.E.2d at 85. The record before us clearly establishes that evidence from the equitable distribution proceeding in the divorce case was not admitted into the record of this hearing. Accordingly, on review for sufficiency of the evidence, the majority opinion incorrectly concludes that the record on appeal includes \u201cevidence [from the equitable distribution hearing] referred to by [the wife\u2019s] counsel\u201d in argument to the trial judge. I would hold that <em>Jenkins </em>does not require us to consider in a sufficiency analysis that which was not offered and accepted into evidence. Simply put, arguments made by the wife\u2019s attorney and statements by the judge in a ruling from the bench are not evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in judicially noticing facts which were proved in a proceeding where the corporation was not a party and which were not introduced as evidence in the proceeding at bar. This error substantially affected the trial court\u2019s ruling. I would also hold that the evidence which was properly admitted was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>uncontradicted and insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the judge\u2019s rulings. <em>See Cheatham, </em>227 Va. at 4-5, 313 S.E.2d at 370. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
