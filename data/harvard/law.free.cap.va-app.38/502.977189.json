McCarter of burglary, grand larceny of firearms, two counts of grand larceny, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The court sentenced McCarter in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, ordering that several of the sentences run concurrently so that the active sentence totaled twenty years and six months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">McCarter appeals his convictions on the ground that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence his Notice of Alibi Defense. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">On appeal, we state the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. In accordance with Rule 8A:ll(c)(2), McCarter filed a Notice of Alibi Defense. The notice indicated that at the time of the offense he was traveling to and from, and working at, the home of Mandy Druckenbrod in Maryland and, that upon completion of his work at Druckenbrod\u2019s home, he returned to his home in Amissville, Virginia. At trial, however, McCarter\u2019s -wife, called as a witness by the defendant, testified that she and her husband spent the entire day in question at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">With the stated purpose of contradicting that testimony, the Commonwealth offered into evidence McCarter\u2019s Notice of Alibi Defense. The defendant objected on the grounds that McCarter did not testify and that the prosecutor could not impeach the witness, who had become his witness. The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the notice as substantive evidence in the case, as well as to impeach the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">McCarter claims that the trial court erred in admitting his Notice of Alibi Defense into evidence to impeach the witness. Specifically, he argues that our rule permitting the introduction of the defendant\u2019s notice of alibi as impeachment evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>is inapposite because he did not testify. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 614, 617, 484 S.E.2d 607, 609 (1997). Although we agree that the rule in <em>Thomas </em>is inapplicable, it does not follow that the notice was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In <em>Thomas, </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth could use a defendant\u2019s notice of alibi to impeach the defendant. 24 Va.App. at 617, 484 S.E.2d at 609. Because the defendant \u201ctestified differently, and had the opportunity to explain on either cross or redirect examination the inconsistencies in his several statements,\u201d we concluded that his notice of alibi was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In this case, the Commonwealth sought to use the defendant\u2019s notice of alibi to impeach the defendant\u2019s witness by contradiction. Because the notice in <em>Thomas </em>was offered as the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement, it is not applicable on the issue before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the rules of evidence pertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ing to impeachment by contradiction govern our determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Evidence is admissible if it is relevant to an issue in the case and is not precluded by a specific rule. <em>Peacock Buick v. Durkin, </em>221 Va. 1133, 1136, 277 S.E.2d 225, 227 (1981). When a witness takes the stand, she puts her credibility at issue in the case. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 675, 676, 187 S.E.2d 191, 192 (1972). Thus, the opposing party may impeach the witness by \u201cdrawing] into question the accuracy of the witness\u2019s perception, recordation, recollection, narration, or sincerity.\u201d Strong, <em>1 McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 33 n. 5, at 123 (5th ed.1999) (citations omitted). \u201cAny evidence which would tend to convince the jury that the witness\u2019s perception, memory, or narration is defective or that his or her veracity is questionable is relevant for purposes of impeachment.\u201d Friend, <em>Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 4-1, at 101 (5th ed.1993) (citing 3A Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 874 <em>et seq. </em>(Chadbourn rev.1970)); <em>see also Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993) (noting that evidence is relevant if \u201cit has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">A party may impeach a witness through a variety of methods, including contradiction. <em>See Jones v. Ford, </em>263 Va. 237, 258, 559 S.E.2d 592, 603 (2002) (\u201cContradiction can be a form of impeachment....\u201d); Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4-1, at 103, and 4-9, at 136; Sinclair, <em>Virginia Evidentiary Foundations, </em>\u00a7 5.3 (1998) (\u201cProving the opposite of what a witness has testified to is a form of impeachment.\u201d); Strong, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45 (describing impeachment by specific contradiction); <em>see also United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>72 F.3d 224, 227 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing impeachment by contradiction). To impeach a witness by contradiction, the opposing party introduces \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>trinsic evidence\u201d to show that the witness\u2019 testimony may not be accurate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 136. In the usual case, contradiction is accomplished through the testimony of a subsequent witness who testifies to facts contrary to the first witness; the law, however, imposes no such restriction. <em>See Jones, </em>263 Va. at 258, 559 S.E.2d at 603 (holding that plaintiff may impeach defendant\u2019s witness with contradictory depositions); Strong, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45 (explaining that specific statements by a witness may be contradicted in \u201cseveral ways,\u201d including the same witness\u2019 later testimony, the testimony of another witness, and judicial notice of contradictory facts); Sinclair, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.3 (describing contradiction of one witness\u2019 testimony through another witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">McCarter\u2019s statement, his notice of alibi, \u201csquarely contradicts\u201d his witness\u2019 testimony. McCarter\u2019s wife testified that she and her husband spent the entire day in question at home in Amissville, Virginia. McCarter stated in his Notice of Alibi Defense that he was in Maryland working at Mandy Druckenbrod\u2019s home on that day. Although the contradiction between the notice and the witness\u2019 testimony does not prove that the witness lacked credibility, \u201c[t]he [defendant\u2019s] contradictory [statement in his notice of alibi] places in doubt ... at least the accuracy of [his wife\u2019s] testimony ... and leaves the jury with the task of weighing the [statements] of each to determine which[, if either,] will be believed.\u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 136; <em>see also Epperly v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 230, 294 S.E.2d 882, 891 (1982) (\u201cEvery fact, however remote or insignificant, that tends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue, is admissible.\u201d); <em>Wynn v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 283, 291, 362 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1987). Accordingly, the notice was relevant to impeach the witness, the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>McCarter also argues that the Commonwealth could not impeach Mrs. McCarter with his Notice of Alibi Defense because: 1) the witness had become the prosecution\u2019s witness and the prosecution may not impeach its own witness; and 2) the notice constituted inadmissible hearsay. We find no merit in either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">First, assuming without deciding that McCarter\u2019s wife became the Commonwealth\u2019s witness on cross-examination, the rule against impeaching one\u2019s own witness is inapplicable in this context. <em>See Washington and O.D. Ry. v. Jackson\u2019s Admr., </em>117 Va. 636, 639, 85 S.E. 496, 497 (1915) (\u201c[I]t is very clear that one producing a witness may prove the truth of material facts by any other competent evidence, even though the effect of such [evidence] is to directly contradict his own witness.\u201d); Friend, <em>supra, </em>at 136 (noting that where extrinsic evidence is introduced to show that the witness\u2019 testimony was not accurate, the rule against impeaching one\u2019s own witness does not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Second, the alibi statement is not excluded by the hearsay rule because it was the defendant\u2019s admission. \u201cAny statement by a party to the proceedings, including an out-of-court statement by a defendant in a criminal case, is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule when offered against that party.\u201d <em>Alatishe v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 376, 378, 404 S.E.2d 81, 82 (1991) (citing E. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 262 (3d ed.1984); Fed. R. Evidence \u00a7 801(d)(2)); <em>accord Land v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 176 S.E.2d 586 (1970). Party admissions are admissible regardless of whether they are inculpatory or incriminating when made, <em>id. </em>(citing C. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>Hearsay \u00a7\u00a7 252-53 (3d ed.1988)), or whether the party testifies. <em>See, e.g., Quintana v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 148, 295 S.E.2d 643, 654 (1982) (upholding admission of defendant\u2019s out-of-court statements under the party admissions exception to the hearsay rule where defendant did not testify). Because, McCarter\u2019s Notice of Alibi Defense may be properly considered his statement, it cannot be excluded on hearsay grounds. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>Thomas, </em>24 Va.App. at 616-17, 484 S.E.2d at 608-09 (concluding that statements within defendant\u2019s alibi notice should be treated as his declarations); <em>Asbury v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 101, 107, 175 S.E.2d 239, 243 (1970) (considering pleading as defendant\u2019s statement because it was filed with his authority and upon information furnished by him (citing <em>Browder v. Southern Ry. Co., </em>107 Va. 10, 57 S.E. 572 (1907))); <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 779, 783, 433 S.E.2d 489, 492 (1993) (holding that statements in suppression motion were properly attributable to the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In short, because the notice was relevant to the witness\u2019 credibility and not excludable on the grounds raised at trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting it into evidence. <em>See Peacock Buick, </em>221 Va. at 1136, 277 S.E.2d at 227 (noting that relevant evidence is admissible unless a specific rule, which the defendant raised at trial, precludes its admission); <em>Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 378, 384, 470 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1996) (\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm McCarter\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">. McCarter also argues that decisions in two of our sister states support his theory that a Notice of Alibi Defense is inadmissible when the defendant does not testify. <em>See State v. Lumumba, </em>253 N.J.Super. 375, 601 A.2d 1178 (1992) (reversing conviction because, <em>inter alia, </em>the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to refer to the defendant's notice of alibi); <em>People v. Shannon, </em>88 Mich.App. 138, 276 N.W.2d 546 (1979) (reversing conviction because prosecutor referred to defendant\u2019s failure to call an alibi witness). McCarter\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">In <em>Lumumba, </em>the prosecution referred to the defendant\u2019s notice of alibi and his failure to call witnesses listed therein to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s alibi was not true. The court relied on <em>State v. Gross, </em>216 N.J.Super. 92, 523 A.2d 212, 214 (1987), which held that such implications \"are unfair, since the failure to produce the named witness may have any number of innocent explanations which cannot readily or appropriately be exposed at trial.\u201d Similarly, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because the prosecutor unfairly prejudiced the defendant by improperly commenting on his \"failure to produce an alibi witness\u201d referenced in his notice of alibi. <em>Shannon, </em>276 N.W.2d at 548. Like the court in <em>Lumumba, </em>the Michigan court reasoned that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant as it permitted the jury to draw an impermissible inference of guilt, which the defendant's decision did not warrant. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">In this case, the Commonwealth did not refer to the defendant\u2019s failure to call his proposed alibi witnesses or his failure to present his intended alibi; rather, the prosecutor offered the notice of alibi for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>purpose of contradicting the testimony of the defendant's witness. The notice, therefore, was relevant to the witness' credibility and accuracy. Neither sister court held, as McCarter contends, that the prosecutor can never mention a defendant\u2019s notice of alibi when the defendant does not take the stand. The cases, therefore, are not pertinent to the issue before us.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">. Contradiction should not be,confused with prior inconsistent statements. While both are methods of impeachment and, thus, place in doubt the accuracy and/or the veracity of the witness\u2019 testimony, the latter does so through evidence produced by that witness, while the former may involve any admissible evidence that contradicts the witness\u2019 testimony.
