HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Demetrius Deangelo Askew appeals his convictions after a bench trial, for possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, and possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A). Askew contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence against him, and in ruling that a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A) requires a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">On September 14, 2000, at approximately 10:45 p.m., Newport News Vice and Narcotics Division Detective D.M. Best received a telephone call from a known informant. The informant told Best that he had observed a \u201cblack male sitting on the steps\u201d at 811 36th Street, Apartment No. 1, in Newport News and that he had observed that the man had cocaine in his pocket. The informant described the man as five feet six inches in height, 145 pounds, with a medium brown complexion, a medium length \u201cafro,\u201d wearing a gray T-shirt and black or dark blue pants. This particular informant had worked as a paid informant for the previous three years, and information from the informant had led to over 200 arrests involving drug-related charges. The informant had never relayed unreliable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Best immediately contacted officers in the vicinity, who responded to the scene within six minutes. They observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Askew, who matched the informant\u2019s description, seated on the steps next to a woman. The officers handcuffed Askew, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and told him they had information he was in possession of cocaine. One officer then asked Askew if he wanted to tell him where the cocaine was, and Askew motioned by nodding his head toward the left front pocket of his pants. The officer then recovered the cocaine from Askew\u2019s pocket. Upon searching Askew, the officer also recovered a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, Askew argued that the evidence should be suppressed as the information received from the informant, although reliable, did not convey when the informant had observed the information relayed to Officer Best. The trial court denied the motion, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">I think it\u2019s fairly clear. He said he was outside standing on the steps at this address and they went there within five or six minutes and there he was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">After the subsequent trial, the court convicted Askew of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">During the sentencing hearing of July 18, 2001, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court should impose the \u201cmandatory\u201d five-year sentence on the firearm charge, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A). The court ruled, \u201cI\u2019m going to go with not mandatory,\u201d and sentenced Askew to five years in prison, with four years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The following day, the Commonwealth filed a motion for re-sentencing, arguing that the trial court should have imposed the mandatory minimum five-year sentence for the firearm conviction. Following the August 1, 2001 hearing on the matter, the trial court modified the sentence to reflect the full five-year sentence. Although Askew argued that the mandatory minimum sentence did not apply to his firearm conviction, he did not object to the trial court\u2019s ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">On appeal, Askew contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence against him, and in re-sentencing him on the firearm, conviction, ordering that he serve the full five-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, the Commonwealth in this instance, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cUltimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search\u201d involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. In performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Moreover, \u201c[o]n appeal, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show \u2018that the denial of [the] motion to suppress constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cOur review of the record includes evidence adduced at both the trial and the suppression hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201ca tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if [his] allegations turn out to be fabricated\u201d may, standing alone, provide \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to provide an officer with reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, \u201cthe test of constitutional validity [of a <em>warrantless </em>arrest] is whether at the moment of arrest the arresting officer had knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant a reasonable man in believing that an offense has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the factual basis for probable cause is provided by an informer, the informer\u2019s (1) veracity, (2) reliability, and (3) basis of knowledge are \u2018highly relevant\u2019 factors in the overall totality-of-the-circumstances probable cause analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">[t]his totality-of-the-circumstances approach is far more consistent with our prior treatment of probable cause than is any rigid demand that specific \u201ctests\u201d be satisfied by every informant\u2019s tip. Perhaps the central teaching of our decisions bearing on the probable-cause standard is that it is a \u201cpractical, nontechnical conception.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). \u201cIn dealing with probable cause, ... as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR-\">Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">[i]f, for example, a particular informant is known for the unusual reliability of his predictions of certain types of criminal activities in a locality, his failure, in a particular case, to thoroughly set forth the basis of his knowledge surely should not serve as an absolute bar to a finding of probable cause based on his tip.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Here, Askew does not dispute the veracity of the informant, or his or her reliability. Instead, Askew\u2019s sole contention is that because Officer Best did not testify that the informant relayed to him the particular time during which he or she observed the \u201cblack male\u201d sitting on the steps and observed that he had cocaine in his possession, the tip was insufficient to support probable cause for Askew\u2019s arrest. We disagree and hold that based on the informant\u2019s undisputed history of reliability and under the totality of the circumstances, the predictive nature, as well as the accuracy and detail of the informant\u2019s tip and accompanying description, compensated for the alleged deficiency in the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge and provided probable cause for Askew\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, the record establishes that the officers observed Askew in the subject location only minutes after receiving the tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Askew also contends that the mandatory minimum punishment provided for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, which is contained in the third, unlettered paragraph of the code section, applies only to violations of subsection (B) and not to violations of subsection (A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 provides as follows, in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">A. It shall be unlawful for any person unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1 to simultaneously with knowledge and intent possess any firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>B. It shall be unlawful for any person to possess, use, or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, or the possession with the intent to manufacture, sell, or distribute a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or Schedule II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1 or more than one pound of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person convicted thereof shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony, shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years, which shall not be suspended in whole or in part. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">To construe the statute as Askew urges would have us attribute to the General Assembly the creation of a criminal offense without providing punishment for a violation of that offense, a result that is irrational and which we will not ascribe to the legislature.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, the plain language of the statute makes the punishment provided for in the third paragraph applicable to the entire statutory <em>\u201csection,\u201d </em>not to merely one of the subsections contained therein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Lastly, and contrary to Askew\u2019s contention, the legislative history of the statute supports such a construction. Prior to the 1999 amendment of the statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 provided that a violation of subsection (A) was a Class 6 felony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that a violation of subsection (B) was a separate and distinct felony punishable by a mandatory three-year term of imprisonment for the first offense, and by a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment for a subsequent offense. Thus, each subsection provided for a separate penalty for each separately defined offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, when the legislature amended Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 in 1999, it provided that a \u201c[violation of this <em>section </em>shall constitute\u201d a Class 6 felony punishable by a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the General Assembly declared that a violation of either subsection shall be a Class 6 felony subject to a mandatory minimum five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Accordingly, Askew\u2019s contention that the legislature\u2019s refusal to entertain House Bill 1607 in 2001, which contained a proposed amendment to change the wording of the third paragraph to \u201cViolation of subsection A or B shall constitute ...,\u201d has no merit. As with any proposed but unsuccessful legislation, there may be a host of reasons for the legislature\u2019s failure to pass a proposed bill. Thus, while we are bound by the legislative intent discernable from the enactment of a statute that becomes law following passage in both houses of our bicameral legislature, we decline to accept the corollary proposed by Askew. We will neither speculate as to possible reasons, nor ascribe a specific intent to the entire legislature, for the failure of proposed legislation to successfully run the legislative gauntlet. Therefore, we hold that the penalty provision of the statute proscribes the penalty for a violation of either subsection (A) or (B), and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. <em>Commonwealth v.
