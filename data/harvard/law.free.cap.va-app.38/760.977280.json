(Porter) under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for an award of compensation consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the employer, who prevailed below. <em>See Westmoreland Coal v. Russell, </em>31 Va.App. 16, 20, 520 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1999). The commission\u2019s factual findings are conclusive and binding on this Court when those findings are based on credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989); Code \u00a7 65.2-706. \u201c What constitutes an employee is a question of law; but, whether the facts bring a person within the law\u2019s designation, is usually a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Intermodal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 600, 364 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1988) (quoting <em>Baker v. Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 298, 147 S.E. 246, 247 (1929)). \u201cConclusions of the [c]omission upon questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, are not binding on appeal.\u201d <em>Sinclair v. Shelter Constr. Corp., </em>23 Va.App. 154, 156-57, 474 S.E.2d 856, 857-58 (1996) (internal citations omitted). A person seeking benefits under the Act bears the burden of proving he or she is an \u201cemployee.\u201d <em>Behrensen v. Whitaker, </em>10 Va.App. 364, 366, 392 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The evidence established that Johnny Stanley was beaten, shot and killed during a robbery while driving a taxicab for Porter on April 25; 1999. His killers admitted calling a taxicab for the sole purpose of robbing the driver. After robbing Stanley of $39, they shot and killed him when he refused to get in the trunk of his cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">At the time of the murder, Stanley was operating a taxicab owned by Neil Fairley (Fairley). Fairley and Stanley divided evenly the cost of the gas used and the fares received when Stanley drove Fairley\u2019s cab. Fairley\u2019s cab was dispatched through Porter. Fairley paid Porter a weekly fee that was calculated by totaling all Porter\u2019s expenses for the week and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>dividing it proportionately on a per cab basis among all the cab owners. The fee was posted as a \u201crent card\u201d on Friday of each week, and the owners could not place their cabs in service again until the amount due on the \u201crent card\u201d was paid to Porter. This fee allowed Fairley\u2019s cab to carry the name Porter Cabs, Inc., use Porter\u2019s cab stand, be dispatched through Porter dispatchers and to use Porter advertising. All cabs were painted with the Porter name and the rate schedule provided by Porter. There were no written agreements between Porter and Fairley or Fairley and Stanley, and Porter did not pay any wages to Stanley or Fairley.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Drivers who worked in a cab affiliated with Porter were required to fill out an application for Porter and interview with Porter before beginning to drive the cabs. If accepted by Porter, the driver had to obtain a \u201crate card\u201d (a type of permit) from the permit section of the police department. Porter has monthly meetings as necessary with all the drivers. Porter also provides a list of rules the drivers must follow while driving a cab affiliated with or owned by Porter. These rules address, <em>inter alia, </em>length of breaks, cab maintenance, and the drivers\u2019 relationship with the dispatcher. If drivers violate the rules, Porter can \u201cput them in the hole,\u201d which allows the dispatcher to suspend the driver temporarily or fire him or her. Drivers are not allowed to drive for other companies while driving for Porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The deputy commissioner found the accident arose out of and in the course of Stanley\u2019s work as a cab driver. He determined Stanley to be an employee of Porter because Porter \u201cexercised the right to control the means and methods of the work[, and] ... some control over who was hired to drive and, significantly, could fire a driver....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">There is no dispute that Mr. Fairley, ... worked as [an] independent [contractor] for Porter Cabs. Each owner, including Mr. Fairley, had a business license and paid Porter Cabs a monthly fee that allowed it to conduct business under the Porter Cabs name, and helped pay the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>associated with running the taxi stand. The owners received no money from Porter Cabs. The owners received their money by collecting a percentage of the fares generated by their own drivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">The issue before us is whether Mr. Stanley was an employee of Porter Cabs. We find no contract of hire between Porter Cabs and Mr. Stanley. The evidence establishes that when Mr. Stanley collected a fare, ... he and Mr. Fairley would divide the fare. Porter Cabs had nothing to do with the business relationship between Mr. Stanley and Mr. Fairley. Mr. Fairley paid Porter Cabs a stand fee and other fees relating to the overhead. Thus, we find no contract of hire between Mr. Stanley and Porter Cabs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">Moreover, we find that there was insufficient control by Porter Cabs over Mr. Stanley to make Mr. Stanley an employee of Porter Cabs. There is no evidence that Porter Cabs hired, paid, or controlled Mr. Stanley. The evidence shows that while Porter Cabs specified the overall result, the company did not specify the means and methods by which Mr. Stanley drove the taxicab. The dispatchers gave the drivers instructions of the ultimate destination, and the driver decided what route to take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">Mr. Stanley had a great deal of freedom with regards to employment hours. Mr. Stanley could place the cab on the stand whenever he wanted, could drive the cab on the days and hours he desired, and could refuse fares he did not want. Porter Cabs could not compel Mr. Stanley to work. The fact that the cab displayed the Porter Cabs logo and information does not transform the driver into an employee of the cab company. Nor does the fact that Porter Cabs could put a driver \u201cin the hole\u201d or forbid that driver from driving for Porter Cabs. As the employer points out, Porter Cabs was simply a broker of business, a service for which it was paid a fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Claimant appealed that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the commission\u2019s findings are not supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Claimant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the commission erred in finding Stanley was not an employee of Porter pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-101.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She argues that the evidence established that Stanley was an employee of Porter because Porter had the right to control the means and methods of the work. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The \u201c[determination of the relationship [of employee and employer] involves a mixed question of law and fact which is reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>County of Spotsylvania v. Walker, </em>25 Va.App. 224, 280, 487 S.E.2d 274, 276 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">One who seeks benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must show that he is an employee within the definition of Code \u00a7 [65.2-101]. He bears the burden of proving his entitlement. The elements of an employment relationship are: (1) selection and engagement of the employee, (2) payment of wages, (3) power of dismissal, and (4) power of control of the employee\u2019s action. The most important of these is the element of control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\"><em>Behrensen, </em>10 Va.App. at 366, 392 S.E.2d at 509 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">But ... the first, second and third of these elements are not essential to the relationship.... The \u201cpower of control\u201d is the most significant element bearing on the question.... In many of the cases the power of substitution or discharge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the payment of wages, and the circumstances bearing upon the relation, are dwelt upon. They, however, are not the ultimate facts, but only those more or less useful in determining whose is the work and where is the power of control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aof\"><em>Stover v. Ratliff, </em>221 Va. 509, 511-12, 272 S.E.2d 40, 42 (1980) (internal citations omitted). \u201cThus, [o]ne is an employee of another if the person for whom he or she works has the power to direct the means and methods by which the work is done.\u201d <em>Mount Vernon Builders, Inc. v. Rotty, 28 </em>Va.App. 511, 514, 507 S.E.2d 95, 97 (1998) (citing <em>Craddock Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Settles, </em>16 Va.App. 1, 4, 427 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>247 Va. 165, 440 S.E.2d 613 (1994)). \u201cThe right of control is the determining factor in ascertaining [whether one is an employee or not].\u201d <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGL\">[T]he right of control over results does not distinguish an employee from an independent contractor; by definition of the relationship, a principal exercises certain control over results whether those results are accomplished by employee or independent contractor. The relevant and determinative distinction lies in the <em>right to control the means and methods chosen to accomplish the result.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\"><em>Walker, </em>25 Va.App. at 230, 487 S.E.2d at 277 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Porter had the power to hire drivers for its own cabs as well as cabs affiliated with Porter but owned by others. Each driver had to interview with Porter. If the driver passed the interview, Porter notified the permit section of the police department that a rate card could be issued to that driver under the aegis of Porter. At hearing, Ms. Teresa Martin, a supervisor for Porter, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">[Ms. Martin:] You come in and you apply to be a taxicab driver. They give you a little app [sic] to fill out. Once you fill that out, if they feel like they want to have you after talking to you, what they do is tell you the things you need to get. You need to go to DMV and get a copy of your driving record. You have to go over town [sic] to see Ms. Sue Wells. She handles special permits for the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>department, and then she\u2019ll give you a rate card, and then you become a taxicab driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">[Attorney:] When you go to get that rate card, do you have to take any paperwork from Porter\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQy\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes, you do. You have to take a statement saying that they are going to hire you to work as an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Porter could place a driver on temporary or permanent suspension if the driver failed to comply with Porter\u2019s rules.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At4\">[Attorney:] What else can, in your experience, drivers do, or not allowed to do [sic] that would put them in the hole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOo\">[Ms. Martin:] Stay out of the cab too long, don\u2019t communicate with the dispatcher and let them know what they\u2019re doing and whereabouts they\u2019re at [sic]. <em>A dispatcher must know where a driver is at all times, or then if they\u2019ve been gone for so long and have not contacted the dispatcher, then she has to notify the police. </em>Then that could cause them to get put in the hole. Things like abusive language, getting in arguments with customers, stuff like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">[Attorney:] How about if they get in arguments with the dispatcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">[Attorney:] Are there any other\u2014is there a standard rule book? You said paperwork was given out at these meetings. Is there a standard rule book?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes, we do have rules, a standard book. [Attorney:] Is that given out to all drivers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">[Attorney:] And they\u2019re expected to follow those rules?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-13\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-14\">[Attorney:] And what happens if they don\u2019t follow those rules?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-15\">[Ms. Martin:] They would be placed in the hole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-16\">[Attorney:] And what is that just so that we\u2019re clear on what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>[Ms. Martin:] That means the dispatcher tells you that you can no longer work for us, and you have to park the cab and go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">[Attorney:] And you\u2019re placed on suspension?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">[Attorney:] Can that suspension be permanent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes, it can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">[Attorney:] And who decides whether a suspension is permanent? In other words, who can fire a cabdriver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">[Ms. Martin:] An owner by basically [sic]\u2014me, myself, and Larry Porter has the last say so in it [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The drivers had to accept all fares unless the driver felt he or she was in danger. A driver could not pick up a fare without Porter\u2019s permission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">[Attorney:] When the dispatchers dispatch fare [sic], is the driver who receives that dispatch required to go out and pick up that fare?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-15\">[Attorney:] Required by Porter Cab to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-16\">[Ms. Martin:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-17\"><em>% </em>s{: \u00edj: s\u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">[Attorney:] Does the dispatcher control where the drivers go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-19\">[Ms. Martin:] Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-20\">[Attorney:] Can the driver pick up anybody they see on the street if they want to, or do they have to go through the dispatcher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-21\">[Ms. Martin:] The way that works is you have to ask permission to [sic] the dispatcher. Once you ask the dispatcher permission, it\u2019s up to her to say yes or no. If she says no, then you cannot pick it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-22\">[Attorney:] Are [the drivers] allowed to refuse a fare?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>[Mr. Porter:] No. Yes. That\u2019s a two part question, yes and no. If there\u2019s a reason for safety issues, and they feel as though there may be some personal safety issues, yes, they can decline a fare....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Mr. Porter testified he fired drivers for a variety of reasons and gave the following specific example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">I pulled up to the stand one night in another car so they wouldn\u2019t know my car at approximately 10 p.m. A driver who was driving for the owner by the name of Rick Hughes, Cab 24, I had just pulled up in front of the building. They didn\u2019t know what kind of car I was in. I observed this driver with the car receive a trip. It looked like he was getting ready to pull out, and he drove no further from here to where Your Honor is and stopped right at the edge of the street. I knew it was a problem, and I\u2019m watching this unusual behavior. I approached him. He was so sleepy and so tired that I told him that he no longer can he drive up here because I just felt, even how much money he needed, he was endangering the company and himself and other people, the citizens, so I fired him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Clearly, Porter had the absolute authority to hire and fire Stanley.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The commission\u2019s finding that Porter did not specify the means and methods by which Stanley drove the taxicab because dispatchers only told drivers their ultimate destination and did not specify which route to take to reach the ultimate destination is without merit. The fact that the drivers often chose their specific routes shows nothing more than, due to the nature of the work and as a practical matter, Porter\u2019s control did not extend to dictating each turn the driver was required to make.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When considered with the other indicia of control exercised by Porter, this fact is of little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The evidence showed all parties agreed that Porter interviewed and determined which potential drivers received a rate card that allowed the drivers to drive; Porter had specific rules the drivers had to follow while driving for Porter; Porter could suspend a driver temporarily or fire him or her; and Porter controlled the drivers\u2019 business by directing what fares were dispatched to each driver, preventing the drivers from picking up fares off the street without permission and not allowing drivers to refuse fares unless there were safety issues. These facts establish the requisite exercise over the \u201cselection and engagement\u201d of the driver, the \u201cpower to dismiss\u201d the driver and, most importantly, the \u201cpower of control\u201d over the driver\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">This analysis is consistent with the position taken by several of our sister states. In <em>Nelson v. Yellow Cab Company, </em>343 S.C. 102, 538 S.E.2d 276 (Ct.App.2000), a factually similar case, the driver was killed by a passenger and the Court of Appeals of South Carolina found the cab driver to be an employee of the cab company. Yellow Cab argued that it had a document signed by the driver stating he was not an employee. The driver kept all his fares and tips and paid for his own gas. However, the driver was required to follow Yellow Cab\u2019s dress code, use Yellow Cab\u2019s meter and fare schedule, could not accept fares not approved by Yellow Cab and could be fired by Yellow Cab. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">The fundamental test of the employment relationship is the right of the employer to control the details of the employee\u2019s work. It is not the actual control exercised, but whether there exists the right and authority to control and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>direct the particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">The test is based on the right to control, not the exercise. Most often the distinction is of importance when a skilled or experienced worker appears to be doing his or her job without supervision or interference. By an exercise test, the employee would seem to be uncontrolled; yet, it will often be found that the employer, in any showdown, would have the ultimate right to dictate the method of work if there were any occasion to do so. The right to control does not require the dictation of the thinking and manner of performing the work. It is enough if the employer has the right to direct the person by whom the services are to be performed, the time, place, degree and amount of said services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 280 (internal citations omitted). <em>See also C &amp; H Taxi Company v. Richardson, </em>194 W.Va. 696, 461 S.E.2d 442 (1995) (C &amp; H owned and maintained the cabs and controlled the right to terminate or not renew the lease of the cab; therefore, the drivers were employees and not independent contractors); <em>Walls v.

And that\u2019s for I guess the most expedient way to dispatch cabs. In a lot of different area [sic], the trips are stacked so she may give a specific route.

Porter also argues that the method of payment requires the finding that Stanley was not an employee of Porter. Payment of wages, alone, is not the determinative factor. <em>See Behrensen, </em>10 Va.App. at 366, 392 S.E.2d at 509 (the most important of these factors is the element of control). In the instant case, while Stanley was paid by his fares and the money went from Stanley to Fairley and Fairley to Porter, Stanley kept a portion of his fares as payment for his services. It is the nature of the taxicab business that the money does not travel from company owner to driver but rather from driver to company owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
