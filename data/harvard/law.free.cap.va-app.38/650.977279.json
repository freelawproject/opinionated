He was sentenced to twelve years in prison on each count, with ten years suspended on each count, for a total of four years to serve. He appeals on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">When H., the victim in this case, was eight years old, Benyo, who was about thirty-five years old, married her mother. H. had been \u201clooking for a father figure\u201d because her \u201creal Dad didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to her\u201d and \u201cwas cold.\u201d Benyo testified that he \u201caccepted her as a daughter absolutely and totally.\u201d She called Benyo dad, and he disciplined her.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">When H. was about thirteen years old, Benyo first \u201chad a thought\u201d about her. While they were fishing, he told her to use a cup to urinate and then \u201cpaddled as far into the bushes as [he] could [and thought] [s]he\u2019s growing up, what am I supposed to do about that.\u201d From that point on, he \u201cencourage[d] her to wear less [by telling her] it\u2019s good for you, like you talk to small babies, the best thing they could do was not wear underwear cuz of a diaper rash. She would wear [only] a shirt.\u201d The defendant started \u201cmassaging\u201d H. and \u201cjust got carried away.\u201d \u201cMost of the time, H. would take her clothes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>off,\u201d and he would \u201cmassage\u201d her whole body, including her vagina, breasts and buttocks. He massaged her about six times a month when he \u201cknew mom wasn\u2019t going to be there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">When H. was fourteen, Benyo first inserted his finger inside her vagina. He could not remember when he first \u201chad oral sex with [his] stepdaughter,\u201d but guessed that he had sodomized her thirty times. She never sodomized him. To satisfy himself, Benyo would masturbate with his stepdaughter in the room. He would put a \u201ctowel underneath [them] [and] ball it up and [throw] it in the laundry or [throw] it in the washing machine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Beginning when H. was fifteen, Benyo\u2019s sexual assaults included rape. At trial, he admitted that he had intercourse with his stepdaughter \u201cmore than ten times\u201d and that he only had sex with her when her \u201cmother was out of town,\u201d which was memorialized on a calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Benyo claimed, \u201cat least in the beginning,\u201d that he would stop if H. asked him to. Later, when H. told Benyo that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to,\u201d he \u201cwould put a guilt trip on her,\u201d or \u201cjust power her.\u201d If she \u201cgot upset and scared,\u201d he would say \u201cthis was our little secret and that [her] mom would be upset, ... might not believe [her] and would be upset with [her], ... [and that they] would both be in trouble, he would lose his job, and they would have no money.\u201d He also threatened that \u201cthere would be a chance that he would go to jail if someone knew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">H. testified that she never told Benyo she wanted to have intercourse with him. She said she \u201cwould try [to make him stop] or move away but he would continue.\u201d She did not feel she had the option to refuse to have intercourse with him. She testified that the intercourse \u201cwas against [her] will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AflL\">Benyo testified that he \u201ccertainly\u201d intimidated H. into having sexual intercourse with him. Benyo explained the psychological pressure he used to intimidate his stepdaughter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">[H.] didn\u2019t want her mom to find out because she knew her mom was very happy having me as a husband and she didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>want to ruin that and her father was cold [to] her[.] I think she would have done anything. I didn\u2019t sit around and say I can use this as a lever or anything, but I\u2019m sure that had something to do with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Benyo also testified that he always initiated their sexual encounters and that \u201cH. [never] came to [him] before [he] went to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The evidence also proved that \u201ctowards the end,\u201d Benyo threatened H. with his suicide if she stopped having sex with him. When H. \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do what [Benyo] wanted [her] to do,\u201d he told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">he had gotten some medication from a doctor in the Navy [and] that he would take it and he would commit suicide and he was writing my mother a note and wanted me to help him pick out his uniform that he would wear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Benyo then took out his military uniform. H. believed he was serious and feared that \u201c[the family] would have no money and that my mother would be upset, and it would be my fault that [Benyo] had died.\u201d She testified that she felt \u201cscared\u201d when Benyo would talk to her about attempting suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">One night when H. came home, she discovered \u201ctwo bloody handprints on the sink.\u201d Frightened, H. left the house as quickly as she could and went to the function where her mother and uncle were to tell them. Benyo explained that he had cut himself in the yard but left the mess to \u201cfind out H.\u2019s reaction\u201d and \u201cwhether she cared or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Benyo\u2019s abusive behavior toward H. continued while she visited her biological father during her thirteenth summer. He sent her a series of letters where he spoke of his \u201clove\u201d for H. He referred to himself as Priscilla and H. as Elvis. He told H. that when she returned home on Sunday he would give her a \u201cgiant bear hug, many kisses, and the most special back rub that circumstances will allow when I tuck you in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">In another letter, undated, Benyo asked H. to help him decide his \u201coptions concerning the future,\u201d because she was the \u201conly one in the whole world who knows the whole story.\u201d He said one option was \u201cto continue to take [his] medication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>[Paxil] and for [their] relationship to continue as it is.\u201d He explained that the medication prevented his \u201churting anyone or myself.\u201d He also wrote that he \u201cget[s] angry and hurt that [he] can\u2019t have [H.]. Then [he] get[s] angry at [himself] for feeling that way.\u201d He says another option is to \u201cadmit to the doctor what has really taken place between [them],\u201d and adds, \u201c[o]f course, [that] would land me in jail for a very long time and our marriage would certainly be destroyed by this as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">These letters and the suicide threats \u201cscared\u201d H. such that she felt she could not say no or tell Benyo to stop. She believed she could not leave home in order to escape. She thought her mother would not believe her and that her biological father would not help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">From this evidence, the trial court concluded that H.\u2019s \u201cwill was overborne by intimidation and therefore she did not consent to this sexual intercourse and therefore he is guilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\"> Benyo claims on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to prove he intimidated H. into having sexual intercourse with him. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-61 (providing, in pertinent part, that one who has sexual intercourse against the will of a complainant, \u201cby force, threat or intimidation\u201d of the complainant shall be guilty of rape). Although Benyo admits he accomplished the intercourse through psychological pressure, he contends he did not put H. in fear of bodily harm. Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence does not prove H. feared bodily harm, we note that, as a matter of law, proof of psychological pressure and \u201cemotional domination [may be] sufficient to constitute intimidation.\u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 410, 517 S.E.2d 260, 261-62 (1999). Therefore, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The Supreme Court has defined intimidation, in part, as resulting from \u201cthe imposition of psychological pressure on one who, under the circumstances, is vulnerable and suscepti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ble to such pressure.\u201d <em>Sutton v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 663, 324 S.E.2d 665, 670 (1985); <em>accord Commonwealth v. Bower, </em>264 Va. 41, 44, 563 S.E.2d 736, 737 (2002); <em>Clark, </em>30 Va.App. at 410, 517 S.E.2d at 261-62. Relevant factors include the \u201cvictim\u2019s age, the relative size of the defendant and the victim, and the vulnerable position of the victim.\u201d <em>Bower, </em>264 Va. at 46, 563 S.E.2d at 738. In addition, the paternal relationship is highly relevant. <em>See Clark, </em>30 Va.App. at 410-11, 517 S.E.2d at 262. \u201cThe paternal bond, along with the victim\u2019s age and relative isolation from others, [may] impede[ ] her ability to resist her father.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In <em>Clark, </em>we held that the following circumstances of emotional domination constituted intimidation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">Clark began molesting [the victim] when she was very young.... Even after she learned the conduct was wrong, she allowed it to continue because she was unable to confront her father. He was in poor health. For many years, he had been her primary caregiver. She had always gone to him when she had problems, because her mother was unreliable and was rarely accessible to her. She thought that the other members of her family would reject her if she accused her ailing father. She felt isolated, with nowhere to turn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 410, 517 S.E.2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Similarly, Benyo began to abuse H. when she was very young\u2014thirteen years old. Benyo testified that he intimidated H. into having sexual intercourse with him. He routinely isolated H., waiting until her mother was out of town, to molest and ultimately rape her. When H. resisted, Benyo \u201cwould put a guilt trip on her, ... just power her,\u201d or say things like \u201cthis [is] our little secret and [your] mom would be upset, ... might not believe [you] and would be upset with [you], ... [and we] would both be in trouble, [I] would lose [my] job, and [we] would have no money,\u201d and \u201c[I could] go to jail if someone knew.\u201d He was aware H. did not want her mom to find out and used this as a lever to pressure her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Later, he told H. he would commit suicide if she ended the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">As a result of this course of conduct, H. felt she had no option but to submit to intercourse with Benyo. She believed she could not leave home to escape his advances. She thought her mother would not believe her and that neither of her biological parents would help her. Moreover, she testified that she believed Benyo\u2019s suicide threats and was frightened by them. She feared that her family \u201cwould have no money and that [her] mother would be upset, and it would be [her] fault that [Benyo] had died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">These circumstances support a finding that Benyo\u2019s calculated course of psychological pressure and emotional domination, particularly the important relationship H. believed she and her mother had with Benyo, \u201c[led H.] to submit to the overtures of [Benyo].\u201d <em>Bower, </em>264 Va. at 45, 563 S.E.2d at 738 (noting that \u201c \u2018good relationship\u2019 between parent and child can include the child\u2019s general obedience to the parent\u2019s direction\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Benyo\u2019s convictions for the rape of his stepdaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
