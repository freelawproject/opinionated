On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove his conduct \u201cinterfere[d] with or endanger[ed] the operation of the law-enforcement vehicle or endangered] a person.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">The evidence is uncontroverted. At approximately 10:40 p.m. on the evening of October 27, 2000, State Trooper David Cooper was operating mobile radar while traveling westbound on a two-lane highway in Halifax County. An eastbound red Mustang driven by defendant was detected traveling \u201cseventy-three in a fifty-five mile per hour zone,\u201d and Cooper \u201cimmediately turned around and began to overtake\u201d the car. When \u201cit looked like [defendant] was fixing to\u201d cross a \u201cdouble solid line\u201d and \u201cpass a van,\u201d Cooper activated his \u201cblue lights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>siren.\u201d \u201c[Simultaneously,\u201d defendant entered the westbound lane, passed the van and continued east, \u201cpassing two other vehicles,\u201d with Cooper in pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">When defendant reached the controlled intersection with \u201cUS 860,\u201d a four-lane highway, the \u201clight in his direction of travel was red,\u201d but defendant \u201ccontinued on through without stopping.\u201d Cooper slowed as he approached the intersection, the traffic signal \u201cturned green,\u201d and he continued to follow defendant along State Route 344, reaching speeds \u201cin excess of a hundred and five [m.p.h.] trying to catch him.\u201d The chase continued through Scottsburg, where Cooper again slowed his vehicle, only to resume speeds of \u201ceighty, eighty-five [m.p.h.]\u201d in pursuit of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Beyond Scottsburg, \u201capproximately three-quarters of a mile\u201d from the intersection with U.S. 360, the Mustang \u201cslid off\u2019 the road and into a tree. Before Cooper could reach the vehicle, defendant \u201ccame out from the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d \u201cjumped into the woods and ran.\u201d Apprehended and arrested at \u201capproximately 4:09 a.m.\u201d the following morning, defendant explained he fled because \u201che had just gotten out of jail ... and didn\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, defendant moved the court to \u201cstrike the felony.\u201d Conceding \u201cthere\u2019s no question ... [he] didn\u2019t stop\u201d for Cooper\u2019s \u201caudible and visual sign,\u201d admittedly conduct sufficient to establish \u201cmisdemeanor eluding\u201d and \u201creckless driving,\u201d defendant maintained that such evidence was insufficient to prove a felonious violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B). The court overruled the motion and convicted defendant of feloniously eluding Cooper, resulting in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-817 provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">A. Any person who, having received a visible or audible signal from any law-enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, drives such motor vehicle in a willful and wanton disregard of such signal or who attempts to escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or elude such law-enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">B. Any person who, having received a visible or audible signal from any law-enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, drives such motor vehicle in a willful and wanton disregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger the operation of the law-enforcement vehicle or endanger a person shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">C. When any person is convicted of a misdemeanor under this section, in addition to the other penalties provided in this section, the driver\u2019s license of such person may be suspended by the court for a period of not less than thirty days nor more than one year. However, in any case where the speed of such person is determined to have exceeded the maximum allowed by twenty miles per hour, his driver\u2019s license shall be suspended by the court trying the case for a period of not less than ninety days____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Contending the legislature did not intend \u201creckless driving, without more,\u201d sufficient \u201cto convict a person eluding the police of a felony,\u201d defendant urges us to construe Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B) to require proof that the \u201cdriving actually endangered a person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In support of his argument, defendant points to Code \u00a7 46.2-817(0, which provides an enhanced punishment for a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(A), \u201ca misdemeanor,\u201d when the offense is accompanied by speed in excess of \u201cthe maximum allowed by twenty miles per hour.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-817(0 (emphasis added). Because such conduct is deemed reckless driving by Code \u00a7 46.2-862, defendant reasons reckless driving gives rise only to a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(A), a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> Well established \u201cprinciples of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly [against the Commonwealth], they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Viewed accordingly, Code \u00a7 46.2-817(0 is clearly intended to enhance punishment for a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(A) when such offense is aggravated by specified conduct, coincidentally a species of reckless driving. Code \u00a7 46.2-817(0; <em>see Shaw v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 331, 334, 387 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1990) (finding violations of Code \u00a7 46.2-817 do not \u201cconstitute a reckless driving offense\u201d). Thus, application of the provision is expressly limited to \u201cperson[s] ... convicted of a <em>misdemeanor </em>under [Code \u00a7 46.2-817(A) ]____\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-817(0 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">With respect to the endangerment of persons sufficient to constitute a felonious violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B), a manifest purpose of the statute is to protect the public against a driver eluding police \u201cso as to ... endanger a person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, conduct that raises the specter of endangerment is the evil contemplated and proscribed by the statute. To require the threat to be imminent would engraft an element to the offense, thereby permitting the dangerous operation of motor vehicles until a person is actually imperiled, an absurd result that subverts the salutary purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Here, when defendant, ignoring Cooper\u2019s signal to stop, operated a vehicle at a high rate of speed in gross violation of posted limits, passed three cars, crossing a \u201cdouble solid line\u201d in the first instance, disregarded a red traffic signal at an intersection with a four-lane highway and, moments thereafter, lost control and crashed into a tree, he clearly endangered both Trooper Cooper in the discharge of his duties and others on or about the highway, a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B). Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
