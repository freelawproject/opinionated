Thomas contends the evidence failed to prove the police officer had probable cause to arrest him and that, for this reason, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>trial judge erred in not suppressing his statements. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">When we review a trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we are guided by the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201c[T]he burden is upon [the appellant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d \u201cUltimate questions of ... probable cause to make a warrantless ... [arrest]\u201d involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. In performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial [judge\u2019s] findings of historical fact unless \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or without evidence to support them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\"><em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The relevant facts are essentially undisputed. Sergeant E.S. Jones of the Petersburg Police Department testified that he was patrolling in a high crime area when he saw Thomas and two other men standing near a convenience store talking. The officer observed the men for several minutes and then approached them because the property was posted with a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. As he neared the men, one of them said, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s the police.\u201d The officer testified that when the men began to walk away he \u201cmade contact with [two of] them.\u201d Other officers detained the third man.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Officer Jones spoke to Thomas and one of the men \u201cto find out why they were on the property and ... told them about the trespassing signs\u201d on the store. The officer then requested \u201cchecks to find out if [Thomas] had any [outstanding] warrants.\u201d While the officer was talking to one of the men, he saw Thomas make a throwing motion with his right hand toward the back of a soda machine. Although the officer did not see any item leave Thomas\u2019s hand, he searched the area behind the machine where he \u201cthought the item had gone.\u201d He saw litter in that area but saw no contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>When the officer learned no warrants were outstanding for Thomas, he \u201cgave [Thomas] a warning not to come back on the property\u201d and \u201creleased\u201d him. After Thomas walked away, the officer went to the third man, whom other officers had arrested for \u201cdrug charges.\u201d After two or three minutes had elapsed, the officer returned to the area behind the soda machine and again searched, \u201cmaking small circles.\u201d The officer found a plastic bag containing individually wrapped substances that appeared to him to be crack cocaine. He testified that he found the bag near the machine, but against a fence, where he \u201cdidn\u2019t know it had gone.\u201d The officer then located Thomas on another street and arrested him for possessing the substances. After the officer read Thomas the <em>Miranda </em>rights, Thomas made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In denying the motion to suppress, the trial judge made no specific findings. The evidence proved that the bag contained ten packs of an off-white substance, which was not a controlled substance, and that Thomas made incriminating statements about the bag. The trial judge convicted Thomas of possession of imitation controlled substances with the intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The principle is long standing and \u201cbasic that an arrest ... without a warrant must stand upon firmer ground than mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 479, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The Supreme Court \u201crepeatedly has explained that \u2018probable cause\u2019 to justify an arrest means facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing ... that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979). Thus, the Court has held that \u201c[a]rresting a person on suspicion, like arresting a person for investigation, is foreign to our system.\u201d <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 169, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). \u201c[P]robable cause ... must be based on more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>speculation, suspicion, or surmise.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 674, 454 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Although the officer saw Thomas make a throwing motion, he did not see what left Thomas\u2019s hand, if anything. When he looked where he thought a discarded object might have landed, he saw litter but no contraband. Later, when he returned to the machine and looked in a place where he had not expected a discarded item to land, he saw the plastic bag. The record indicates only that it was against \u201ca chain-link fence ... between the store and the (adjacent] property.\u201d These facts render only a suspicion that Thomas threw the plastic bag the officer found. Thomas\u2019s hand motion \u201cwas not combined with any other circumstance which might have justified a rational belief\u2019 that Thomas had thrown the bag containing the imitation substance. <em>Matthews v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1, 3, 235 S.E.2d 306, 307 (1977). The officer\u2019s conclusion that Thomas threw the bag was grounded only on suspicion because he had found a variety of ordinary litter behind the machine when he looked where he thought Thomas had thrown something. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence failed to establish probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">An arrest made without a warrant or without probable cause is made in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 219, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979). Where there has been an arrest without probable cause, \u201cthe burden of showing admissibility [of an ensuing statement] rests, of course, on the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 604, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (footnote omitted). In meeting its burden, the prosecution must produce evidence \u201cnot merely that the statement meet[s] the Fifth Amendment standard of voluntariness but that it [is] \u2018sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\u2019 \u201d of the unlawful arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 95 S.Ct. at 2260 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 417). Here, the officers arrested Thomas \u201cfor possession of cocaine based on the item ... found [behind the soda machine],\u201d took him to the police station, read him <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>obtained admissions. As in <em>Dunaway, </em>\u201c[n]o intervening events broke the connection between [the] illegal detention and [the] confession.\u201d 442 U.S. at 219, 99 S.Ct. at 2260. The evidence showed that the statement was made temporally proximate to the arrest, that no circumstances of any consequence intervened between the arrest and the statement, and that the questioning flowed directly from the discovery of the cocaine and the officer\u2019s attempt to tie the cocaine to Thomas. Because the evidence does not establish that the connection between the arrest and the statement was so attenuated as to purge the taint of the unlawful arrest, we hold that the Commonwealth did not sustain its burden of showing the evidence was admissible. \u201cTo admit [Thomas\u2019s] confession in such a case would allow \u2018law enforcement officers to violate the Fourth Amendment with impunity, safe in the knowledge that they could wash their hands in the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d of the Fifth [Amendment].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">For these reasons, we hold the trial judge erred in not suppressing Thomas\u2019s statement. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
