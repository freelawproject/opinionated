We affirm the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">A grand jury indicted Corbin for capital murder, robbery, and attempted capital murder. In a pre-trial motion to strike the master jury list, Corbin alleged that the jury commissioners did not prepare the master jury list consistent with the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-345. In particular, he alleged that although the statute indicates \u201cthat a master jury list shall be prepared ... using a current voter registration list, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and where feasible, a list of persons issued a driver\u2019s license ..., [and persons from the] city or county directories, telephone books, and personal property tax rolls,\u201d the Essex County jury commissioners improperly compiled the master jury list \u201csolely by using the voter registration list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">At a hearing held to consider the motion, Corbin\u2019s attorney presented no witnesses. The parties stipulated that 9,300 people reside in Essex County, that 5,517 people are registered to vote in the county, and that 1,656 of the county\u2019s residents are school children. Corbin\u2019s attorney asserted in argument that the jury commissioners prepared the master jury list from the voter registration list only and that the statute\u2019s use of \u201cwhere feasible\u201d imposes a mandatory requirement to use a variety of other lists in addition to the voter registration list.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney argued that the issue turned upon the meaning of \u201cfeasible.\u201d He argued that the voter registration list contained a high percentage of the residents, that the voter registration list was a reliable and \u201csufficient random process\u201d from which to select a master jury list, and that using other lists involved \u201ca huge process which is difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The trial judge\u2019s findings included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">The evidence that I have for the purposes of this motion [is] the stipulation in regard to the number of people in Essex, 9,300 people, approximately, in Essex. It is proffered to the Court approximately 5,517 people were registered to vote. The Court is told that the voter registration list is the list that is utilized by the commissioners in Essex County for selecting the jury panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u00edJ\u00ed ij&lt; \u00ed-\u00ed ;]&lt; :{? &gt;\u00a1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">The Court is being asked to strike the jury list as not being in compliance with this statute ... because by using only the voter registration list, the result is that it does not include potential jurors representative of the broad commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>nity interest that might appear on the list by virtue of the commissioners utilizing these other lists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">The Court notes in that paragraph of the statute where it says, \u201cThe jury commissioners shall utilize random selection,\u201d it makes reference \u201cby manual, mechanical, or electronic, using a current voter registration list.\u201d ... That I would construe as being mandatory. They have to use a voter registration list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">$ ^ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">[T]he purpose of the motion before the Court today is [to determine the meaning of] \u201cwhere feasible,\u201d and [whether] the balance of that sentence is mandatory, or perhaps directory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">I am not of the opinion that it makes it mandatory or otherwise the General Assembly would not have put \u201cwhere feasible.\u201d They would simply have said, \u201cUsing the current voters registration list and from the list from DMV,\u201d ... et cetera. But they chose not to do that but instead put a qualifier by using the words \u201cwhere feasible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">Also, I do not believe that by using the voter registration list that would deprive someone of jurors who represent the broad community\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Thus, the trial judge denied the motion. After a jury convicted Corbin of first degree murder, robbery, and attempted first degree murder, Corbin filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Corbin contends that it was \u201cfeasible\u201d for the jury commissioners to use, in addition to the voter registration list, the other lists mentioned in the statute. The Commonwealth contends that the issue of feasibility poses a factual question and that Corbin failed to present evidence that the jury commissioners did not follow the statute. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">In pertinent part, the statute provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The commissioners shall, not later than December 1 following their appointment, submit a list showing the names, addresses and, if available, the occupations of such of the inhabitants of their respective counties or cities as are well qualified under \u00a7 8.01-337 to serve as jurors and are not excluded or exempt by \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-338 to 8.01-341 and 8.01-342. Such master jury list shall be used in selecting jurors....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The jury commissioners shall utilize random selection techniques, either manual, mechanical or electronic, using a current voter registration list and, where feasible, a list of persons issued a driver\u2019s license as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100 from the Department of Motor Vehicles, city or county directories, telephone books, personal property tax rolls, and other such lists as may be designated and approved by the chief judge of the circuit, to select the jurors representative of the broad community interests, to be placed on the master jury list. The commissioners shall make reasonable effort to exclude the names of deceased persons and unqualified persons from the master jury list. After such random selection, the commissioners shall apply such statutory exceptions and exemptions as may be applicable to the names so selected....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-345.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The statute contains the undisputed mandatory requirement that \u201c[t]he jury commissioners shall utilize random selection techniques ... using a current voter registration list ... to select the jurors representative of the broad community interests, to be placed on the master jury list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The disputed portion of the statute contains the further proviso that commissioners also include in the pool of names to be randomly selected, \u201cwhere feasible, a list of persons issued a driver\u2019s license as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100 from the Department of Motor Vehicles, city or county directories, telephone books, personal property tax rolls, and other such lists as may be designated and approved by the chief judge of the circuit.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-345.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In ordinary parlance, \u201c[t]he term \u2018feasible\u2019 means simply that which is \u2018capable of being done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Dorey Elec. Co., </em>248 Va. 378, 382, 448 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1994) quoting <em>American Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 508-09, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 69 L.Ed.2d 185 (1981). The legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cwhere feasible\u201d in the statute clearly contemplates that jury commissioners will decide, based on facts and circumstances, whether to supplement the voter registration list with other lists to achieve the legislative objective, as clearly expressed in Code \u00a7 8.01-345, of \u201cselect[ing] the jurors representative of the broad community interests.\u201d <em>See Bell, </em>248 Va. at 382, 448 S.E.2d at 624 (ruling that \u201cfeasible\u201d is a term that \u201cprovide[s] sufficient legislative standards to guide the [delegated entity] in establishing regulations, and also establishes] a legally discernible standard by which a court could review subsequent challenges [to the decisionmaking]\u201d). <em>See also Hickory Neighborhood Defense League v. Skinner, </em>893 F.2d 58, 61 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that a decision \u201cthat there were no feasible ... alternatives\u201d is one that must be based on facts). Thus, we conclude that the statutory proviso, \u201cwhere feasible,\u201d is a matter that raises at the first instance an issue of fact that is plainly a matter to be proved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">As the party seeking to establish that the jury commissioners failed to follow the statutory selection process, Corbin had the burden of proving his allegations. <em>Moats v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 349, 354, 404 S.E.2d 244, 246 (1991). <em>See also United Dentists, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 347, 355, 173 S.E. 508, 511 (1934) (stating the general rule that the party \u201chas the burden of proof who seeks to move the court to act in his favor\u201d). At the hearing before the trial judge, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney agreed with the assertion by Corbin\u2019s attorney that the jury commissioners randomly compiled the master jury list from the current voter registration list. The parties also stipulated the population of the county and the number of registered voters. Corbin\u2019s attorney presented no witnesses and no other evidence concerning the process by which the jury commissioners compiled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>master jury list. For example, he presented no evidence to prove whether the jury commissioners considered using other lists, whether after considering other lists the commissioners determined their use to be problematic, or whether the commissioners determined without reason not to use other lists. Whether a matter is \u201cfeasible\u201d turns, however, upon what the facts reveal. <em>See Bell, </em>248 Va. at 382, 448 S.E.2d at 624; <em>see also In re Danny Thomas Properties II Ltd. Partnership, </em>241 F.3d 959, 963 (8th Cir.2001); <em>In re Clarkson, </em>767 F.2d 417, 420 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Morris v. Williams, </em>67 Cal.2d 733, 63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697, 713 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the evidence in the record was insufficient for the trial judge to have concluded that the jury commissioners violated Code \u00a7 8.01-345 in compiling the master jury list. Accordingly, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s order and, therefore, the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
