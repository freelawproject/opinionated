Lawson contends the statute does not apply to his failure to appear for a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing concerning a probation violation. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">A grand jury indicted Lawson for \u201cfeloniously failing] to appear before the circuit court ...., as required after notice, on a felony charge,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-128. At trial, the prosecutor informed the judge that on December 16, 1999, Lawson \u201ccame to court, but then left before his case was called that day.\u201d The prosecutor also informed the judge that Lawson\u2019s attorney contests whether Code \u00a7 19.2-120 \u201ccovers this particular type of event.\u201d The prosecutor presented as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>his only evidence a bond signed by Lawson as a condition of his bail. The prosecutor asserted that Lawson had been admitted to bail pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-120 and argued that Code \u00a7 19.2-128 should be interpreted to include persons granted bail under the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-120.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Lawson\u2019s attorney responded \u201cthat there is no contest on the facts that [Lawson] had in fact appeared on that day and then left before his case was called.\u201d Lawson\u2019s attorney argued that Lawson\u2019s failure to appear was not punishable under the statute, but, rather, \u201cmay be punishable under the contempt power of the Court.\u201d He asserted that Lawson\u2019s \u201ccourt date was for a show cause hearing\u201d concerning a prior felony conviction and that \u201cyou have to draw a distinction between [Lawson] and someone who would come in having been charged with a felony offense for which they are awaiting trial.\u201d He argued that Lawson\u2019s case did not fit within either category of persons described in Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The trial judge ruled that \u201cwhen a person has been served with a show cause notice on a felony conviction, ... [and] fails to appear, it\u2019s a violation of the statute.\u201d He then convicted Lawson of violating Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Any person (i) charged with a felony offense or (ii) convicted of a felony offense and execution of sentence is suspended pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-319 who willfully fails to appear before any court as required shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Lawson contends that his conduct does not fall within the statute\u2019s proscription. The Commonwealth does not contend that subpart (ii) is implicated by the circumstances of this case. Rather, it contends that Lawson\u2019s \u201cconduct violated [subpart] (i) of the statute.\u201d Thus, the Commonwealth argues that, because the circuit court retained continuing jurisdiction over Lawson\u2019s case to address matters involving revocation of probation and suspended sentences, Lawson\u2019s underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>charge was not a final \u201cconviction\u201d and that Lawson was still \u201ccharged\u201d for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In reviewing this statute, we are guided by familiar principles. \u201c \u2018It is the duty of the courts to give effect, if possible, to every word of the written law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 788, 75 S.E.2d 482, 484-85 (1953) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">Our duty is \u201cto construe the law as it is written.\u201d We assume that \u201cthe legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words.... \u201d \u201cTo depart from the meaning expressed by the words is to alter the statute, to legislate and not to interpret.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u00a3 sji * <em>% </em>H* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cWhen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\"><em>Greenberg v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 594, 600-01, 499 S.E.2d 266, 269-70 (1998) (citations omitted). We, therefore, conclude that when the General Assembly used \u201ccharged\u201d in subpart (i) of Code \u00a7 19.2-128 and \u201cconvicted\u201d in subpart (ii), the General Assembly intended two different meanings. In addition, we construe the words in the statute \u201caccording to their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Patterson v. CSX Transportation, </em>245 Va. 483, 487-88, 429 S.E.2d 215, 218 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The evidence did not prove that, when Lawson failed to appear in court on December 16,1999, his status was \u201ccharged with a felony.\u201d The record indicates that Lawson failed to appear at a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing. The parties further agreed that the hearing was a \u201crevocation proceeding\u201d for an underlying felony offense. No evidence establishes, however, that Lawson was \u201ccharged with a felony offense,\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B)(i). Indeed, the Commonwealth represents that \u201ca final sentencing order had been entered prior to his failure to appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Although the Commonwealth argues that the General Assembly intended a broad construction of the statute, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>must be guided by the principles \u201cthat penal statutes must be \u2018strictly construed against the State\u2019 and that such statutes \u2018cannot be extended by implication or construction, or be made to embrace cases which are not within their letter and spirit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Athey, </em>261 Va. 385, 388, 542 S.E.2d 764, 766 (2001). \u201c[BJefore the accused can be punished, \u2018his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waldrop v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 210, 215, 495 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Accepting that the proceeding Lawson failed to attend was for the purpose of considering whether a \u201crevocation\u201d of Lawson\u2019s probation or suspended sentence was warranted, we decline to hold, as suggested by the Commonwealth, that the word \u201ccharged,\u201d which is found in Code \u00a7 19.2\u2014128(B)(i), should be read to mean charged or convicted and that the circuit court\u2019s limited jurisdiction over the revocation proceedings established that Lawson\u2019s conviction was not final. Although an alleged violation of the conditions of either probation or a suspended sentence is a serious matter, such an allegation does not render a person \u201ccharged with a felony offense.\u201d Proof of Lawson\u2019s failure to appear at a hearing to show cause whether his probation or a suspended sentence should be revoked does not plainly fall within the proscription of Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We hold, therefore, that the evidence in the record did not prove that when Lawson failed to appear in the circuit court on December 19,1999, he was \u201ccharged with a felony offense,\u201d as required for a conviction under Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B). Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
