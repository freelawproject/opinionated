On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the existence of two prior convictions at the time of the instant offense, proof he views as indispensable to the felony conviction. Defendant further complains the trial court erroneously admitted a \u201cCertificate of Blood Alcohol Analysis\u201d (certificate) into evidence. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The relevant facts are uncontroverted. On October 18, 1994, defendant was convicted for \u201cDriving While Intoxicated\u201d (DUI) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Thereafter, on March 23, 2000, he was again charged with DUI, second offense, and trial was scheduled in the Richmond General District Court for May 31, 2000. Awaiting trial on the latter offense, defendant was stopped by Richmond police while operating a vehicle on May 19, 2000, at 2:04 a.m. and arrested for DUI at 2:24 a.m. A related analysis of defendant\u2019s breath, conducted at 3:40 a.m. and reported on the disputed certificate, disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.13 grams per 210 liters, and a warrant issued charging him with DUI, second offense, a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On May 31, 2000, defendant was convicted of the DUI committed on March 23, 2000. Learning of the conviction, the Commonwealth successfully moved the Richmond General District Court to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the prosecution then pending for the May 19, 2000 DUI. However, on September 5, 2000, a grand jury of the trial court indicted defendant for feloniously committing the May offense, alleging he had been \u201cconvicted of like offenses on October 18, 1994.\u201d Prior to trial and over defendant\u2019s objection, the Commonwealth was permitted to amend the indictment to charge DUI \u201c[o]n or about May 19, 2000 ... after having been convicted of <em>two like offenses within ten years,\u201d </em>in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and -270. (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Also prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the certificate, arguing Virginia\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, pertains only when an accused is \u201carrested within two hours of the offense.\u201d Because \u201c[t]he <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original arrest and charge terminated the previous arrest,\u201d defendant contended the subsequent \u201carrest[ ]\u201d on the indictment, \u201cmonths after the event,\u201d was without implied consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>to a breath test. The trial court, however, disagreed and overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence the disputed certificate and a DMV transcript that reflected the October 18, 1994 and the May 31, 2000 DUI convictions. Defendant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, arguing that, at the time of the instant offense, May 19, 2000, he had suffered only a single prior DUI conviction, on October 18, 1994, and, therefore, was subject to conviction \u201cof no greater than a misdemeanor driving under the influence ...,\u201d as a second offense. The court overruled the motion and convicted defendant of \u201cDUI, after having been convicted of two like offenses within ten years,\u201d the felony charged in the amended indictment, resulting in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-266 prohibits \u201cany person to drive or operate any motor vehicle ... while such person is under the influence of alcohol.\u201d At the time of the subject offense, Code \u00a7 18.2-270 enhanced the penalty for repeat DUI offenders, providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">Any person convicted of a third or subsequent offense committed within ten years of an offense under \u00a7 18.2-266 shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Defendant maintains such enhancement was \u201cdesigned to impose a higher punishment on those that continue to break the law even after they have been previously convicted.\u201d He, therefore, posits that enhancing punishment for persons, like himself, \u201ccharged with a 3rd offense ... before they have been punished for the 2nd offense\u201d denies \u201cadequate time or incentive to reform before the third conviction.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument, however, is at odds with a recent decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Supreme Court of Virginia, <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 38, 501 S.E.2d 391 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the Court was called upon to construe Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3), a statute that prescribes an enhanced penalty for a \u201csecond or subsequent ... offense\u201d of \u201cdriving while ... an habitual offender.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like defendant, Thomas contended enhancement for the second or subsequent offense was appropriate only for offenses committed after actual conviction for an earlier like offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Court disagreed and affirmed imposition of the enhanced penalty, concluding that the statutory reference to \u201coffense,\u201d rather than \u201cconviction,\u201d evinced the intent of the General Assembly to authorize \u201cpunishment enhancement\u201d for an offense committed before a conviction on the requisite predicate offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 501 S.E.2d at 392. Consistent with such rationale, the Court noted that \u201cthe purpose of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 is to deter criminal conduct by punishing those who repeatedly drive after having been declared an habitual offender, rather than to reform habitual offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 501 S.E.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Here, Code \u00a7 18.2-270, similar to Code \u00a7 46.2-357, enhances the offense and attendant punishment from a misdemeanor to a felony upon conviction of \u201ca third or subsequent <em>offense </em>committed within ten years of an <em>offense </em>under \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>266.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-270 (emphasis added). The statute does not suggest that convictions for the requisite prior offenses must precede commission of the \u201cthird or subsequent offense.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, any third or subsequent DUI conviction within the period prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-270 triggers the enhanced punishment. Otherwise,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atf\">an offender could commit multiple unlawful acts of driving [under the influence of alcohol] without fear of being punished for a felony merely because the offender could not be tried and convicted quickly enough between offenses. An interpretation of the statute that allows a defendant to violate it with impunity would be contrary to the clear legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Thomas, </em>256 Va. at 42, 501 S.E.2d at 393 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, Virginia\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">A. Any person ... who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway ... in this Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is <em>arrested </em>for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or of a similar ordinance <em>within two hours of the alleged offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">(Emphasis added). \u201cThe purpose of the implied consent law requiring the test to be taken is to determine the concentration of alcohol in a driver\u2019s blood or breath sample, and thereby determine the driver\u2019s state of intoxication or sobriety.\u201d <em>Quinn v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 321, 324, 388 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1990). Hence, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 is integral to a statutory scheme of \u201cprocedural requirements for the taking, handling, identifying and disposing of blood samples,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>all of which facilitate the \u201cadmissibility of the results of ... blood [or breath] tests at the trial for a Code \u00a7 18.2-266 offense.\u201d <em>Thurston v. City of Lynchburg, </em>15 Va.App. 475, 478-79, 424 S.E.2d 701, 703 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Generally, failure to comply with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 or companion statutes precludes introduction of the relevant test results in proof of DUI. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 228, 233-34, 527 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2000) (implied consent does not attend an unlawful arrest); <em>Thurston, </em>15 Va.App. at 481, 424 S.E.2d at 704 (admissibility of \u201cresults of tests\u201d is conditional upon adherence to \u201cstatutory mandates\u201d). Thus, because Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 is predicated upon an arrest \u201cwithin two hours of the alleged offense,\u201d defendant reasons that arrest on the indictment, several months after the offense and following <em>\u201cnolle prosequi </em>of the original arrest,\u201d did not comport with the two-hour limitation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, thereby precluding admission of the certificate in issue. In support of his argument, he mistakenly relies upon <em>Armel v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 407, 505 S.E.2d 378 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In <em>Armel, </em>the accused was initially arrested on warrants that alleged he uttered a check with the intent to defraud and feloniously possessed a firearm. Upon motion of the Commonwealth, the charges were <em>nolle prossed </em>in the general district court, but Armel was subsequently indicted for the same offenses, a procedure he claimed impermissibly \u201cdenied him a preliminary hearing on the original warrants in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-218.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 505 S.E.2d at 379. We disagreed, concluding that, \u201cupon <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the offenses charged in the original warrants, defendant was no longer \u2018arrested on a charge of felony\u2019 ... and was thereafter properly indicted without the benefit of a preliminary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 505 S.E.2d at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In contrast to <em>Armel, </em>the instant appeal presents an evidentiary issue, clearly distinguishable and controlled by statute.Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 implied defendant\u2019s consent to a blood or breath test, provided he was \u201carrested within two hours of the [DUI] offense.\u201d Defendant does not challenge the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the original DUI arrest on May 19, 2000, at 2:24 a.m., for an offense committed at 2:04 a.m. He, therefore, does not dispute the attendant compliance with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 and related statutes in testing the alcohol content of his breath. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s consent to the test was properly implied by statute, thereby rendering the resulting certificate of analysis admissible evidence in the instant prosecution, notwithstanding subsequent termination of the original warrant by <em>nolle prosequi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We, therefore, affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. On appeal, defendant does not challenge the form or substance of the amended indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">. Amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-270, effective July 1, 2000, substituted, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthree or more offenses of \u00a7 18.2-266\u201d for \"a third or subsequent offense.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">Any person found to be an habitual offender under this article, who is thereafter convicted of driving a motor vehicle ... shall be punished as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">2. If such driving, of itself, does endanger the life, limb, or property of another, such person shall be guilty of a felony ... and no portion of such sentence shall be suspended except that ... (ii) in cases wherein such operation is necessitated in situations of apparent extreme emergency which require such operation to save life or limb, said sentence, or any part thereof may be suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">3.
