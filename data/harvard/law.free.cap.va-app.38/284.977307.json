Albert (father) appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Modify Visitation and Child Support. He contends the trial court erred in (1) not modifying visitation to reduce childcare costs, (2) faffing to impute income to Cynthia G. Albert (mother), and (3) awarding attorney\u2019s fees to mother. Father also appeals the trial court\u2019s finding that he was responsible for payment of certain medical expenses of the minor children. For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">A. Visitation and Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The parties were divorced in June 2000. Custody of the parties\u2019 three children was given to mother, and a schedule of visitation with father was established. On January 18, 2001, father filed a Motion to Modify Visitation and Child Support.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The motion stated mother works \u201c32 hours a week, 24 hours on weekends and 8 hours on Tuesdays from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.\u201d Also, mother \u201cpays for child care while she works on Tuesdays.\u201d Father proposed he care for the children on Tuesdays, from the end of the school day until the next morning, when he would take the children to school. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>alternative, father suggested the parties\u2019 thirteen-year-old daughter provide childcare for the other two children on Tuesdays. Father indicated in his motion that either alternative would \u201csignificantly diminish child care costs\u201d and, therefore, reduce child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">A hearing on the motion was set for March 22, 2001. No one testified at the hearing, despite the motion\u2019s evidentiary nature. The hearing consisted of a dialogue between the judge and counsel. Neither party objected to this procedure; therefore, we accept the dialogue as \u201cproffered testimony.\u201d However, we can glean only minimal information from this dialogue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for mother indicated she could stop working on Tuesday, thereby saving childcare expenses for that day. Counsel opined this change would eliminate any interruption in the children\u2019s schedules. The children \u201cwouldn\u2019t have to ... go to dad\u2019s, get up early on Wednesday morning and be driven to school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Father\u2019s attorney responded that, if mother did not work on Tuesdays, her salary would be diminished considerably, and the court then must impute that lost income to her. Father\u2019s counsel represented that mother\u2019s total annual salary was $74,828.32, or $6,235.28 per month. Mother\u2019s attorney explained, however, because of a new union contract with increased wages, mother could maintain her old salary without working on Tuesdays.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Father\u2019s counsel stated that if mother continued to work on Tuesdays, and the children spent Tuesday nights with father, the reduction in childcare costs would be $616 per month. No other evidence, by proffer or otherwise, was elicited as to income or the expenses of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The trial court ruled the children would not spend Tuesday evenings with father. The court further ordered, since mother would no longer work on Tuesdays, that both counsel recalculate the amount of child support based on the reduction in her income and the reduction in childcare expenses. The court denied the request for imputation of income, without stating a reason. It also awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $780 to mother. During the ensuing recess, the parties compromised on an amount of child support of $533 per month. The parties did not file any worksheets with the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The trial court entered an order on May 10, 2001, denying the motion to modify visitation, awarding $533 per month in child support,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and awarding mother $780 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">B. Medical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Mother filed a Petition for Rule to Show Cause against father on April 11, 2001, claiming he had willfully failed to pay his share of the children\u2019s medical expenses as provided in the final decree of divorce. She claimed he owed $960.92 for these bills.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">The final divorce decree of the parties provided,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">In the event that the children have extraordinary uninsured medical expenses, including but not limited to deductibles, medicines, therapy, counseling, physical therapy, dental and/or orthodontic expenses, [father] shall be responsible and pay 50% of these expenses. Payment for said expenses shall be made at the time [mother] provides [father] with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>evidence of the expense, or at such time as a doctor or other medical professional requires payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The final decree further ordered father to \u201cprovide health care insurance coverage for the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A consent order entered on July 23, 1999 set forth custody, visitation, and the related issues of health, education, and \u201cgeneral upbringing.\u201d It required each party \u201cnotify the other at the time a doctor, dental or medical appointment is made for the benefit of the children.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The June 29, 2001 show cause hearing also consisted generally of a dialogue between counsel and the court. Mother testified briefly, but not under oath.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Mother apparently submitted five cancelled checks and three credit card receipts, showing payments totaling $1,512.84 for various doctors\u2019 appointments. Additionally, mother apparently presented to father at the hearing, for the first time, another medical bill for $204.50, raising the total medical bills to $1,717.34.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Father\u2019s counsel argued his client should not be responsible for fifty percent of these bills. He contended mother did not have \u201cclean hands\u201d for several reasons. First, contrary to the terms of the consent order, she did not notify father of the children\u2019s appointments that gave rise to these medical bills. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Also, father never received copies of the bills so that he could submit them to his primary or secondary insurance carrier. Father further contended that several medical bills were from visits to medical providers outside of his insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">At the hearing, father confirmed that his counsel\u2019s representations to the court were \u201cthe truth.\u201d Father did not testify. Both the judge and mother\u2019s counsel accepted the representations of fact presented in father\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Although not under oath, mother addressed the trial court and admitted that she took the children to two health providers, Dr. Sharif and Horn* Eyes, who were not on father\u2019s insurance plan. She indicated Dr. Sharif initially was on the plan and only after the services were rendered did she learn that Sharif had dropped the plan. She then began taking the children to another doctor. Mother explained Hour Eyes told her that they \u201ccarry her insurance,\u201d but, apparently, they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The trial court found father was not in contempt of the consent order. The court admonished mother to notify father whenever the children went to a doctor, \u201cin order to give him the opportunity to make sure it\u2019s covered by the insurance,\u201d and to transmit medical bills in a timely fashion, since \u201cit\u2019s better to provide it [to father] sooner as opposed to later.\u201d The trial court did order that father pay $960.92 of the unreimbursed medical expenses, attorney\u2019s fees of $600, and costs of $69.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">A. Visitation and Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Father first contends the trial court erred in not modifying its earlier order to allow him visitation on Tuesdays. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">When determining whether to change visitation, a trial court \u201cmust apply a two-pronged test: (1) whether there has been a change in circumstances since the most recent [visitation] award; and (2) whether a change in [visitation] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>would be in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Visikides v. Derr, </em>3 Va.App. 69, 70, 348 S.E.2d 40, 41 (1986) (discussing this test in the context of custody determinations). \u201cIn matters of custody, visitation, and related child care issues, the court\u2019s paramount concern is always the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 327-28, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990). \u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795. \u201cA trial court\u2019s determination of matters within its discretion is reversible on appeal only for an abuse of that discretion, ... and a trial court\u2019s decision will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, father did not meet his burden. He did not show any change of circumstance had occurred since the last order nor did he show a change in visitation would be in the children\u2019s best interests. Instead, his motion and argument only demonstrated that a change would be in his best interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His rationale for the Tuesday visitation was to reduce his child support payments by saving childcare costs. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to change visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Father next contends, since mother voluntarily reduced her workweek from thirty-two to twenty-four hours by not working Tuesdays, income should be imputed to her. We again must look to the \u201cproffered testimony\u201d to determine if father met his burden.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The dialogue indicated mother was \u201cwilling\u201d to \u201cstop working on Tuesdays.\u201d The record does not reflect whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>did in fact stop working. We, therefore, do not know if she voluntarily reduced her income. In fact, at the time of the hearing, all indications were mother was still working on Tuesdays; her work hours had not changed prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Imputation of income is used by a trial court when deciding whether \u201cto deviate from the presumptive amount of child support, and \u2018any child support award must be based on circumstances existing at the time the award is made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saleem v. Saleem, </em>26 Va.App. 384, 393, 494 S.E.2d 883, 887-88 (1998) (quoting <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 703, 460 S.E.2d 596, 600 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">This Court set forth the parameters for imputing income in <em>Niemiec v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>27 Va.App. 446, 451, 499 S.E.2d 576, 579 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">When asked to impute income to a parent, the trial court must consider the parent\u2019s earning capacity, financial resources, education and training, ability to secure such education and training, and other factors relevant to the equities of the parents and children. <em>See Brooks [v. Rogers], </em>18 Va.App. [585, 592, 445 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1994) ] (citing Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B)). The burden is on the party seeking the imputation to prove that the other parent was voluntarily foregoing more gainful employment, either by producing evidence of a higher-paying former job or by showing that more lucrative work was currently available. <em>See Brody [v. Brody], </em>16 Va.App. [647, 651, 432 S.E.2d 20, 22 (1993) ]; <em>Hur v. Virginia Dept. of Social Services Div. of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Klopp, </em>13 Va.App. 54, 61, 409 S.E.2d 454, 459 (1991); <em>see also Antonelli v. Antonelli, </em>242 Va. 152, 154, 409 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1991). The evidence must be sufficient to \u201cenable the trial judge reasonably to project what amount could be anticipated.\u201d <em>Hur, </em>13 Va.App. at 61, 409 S.E.2d at 459.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The trial court\u2019s decision here, refusing to impute income to mother, will be upheld on appeal unless \u201c \u2018plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>at 703, 460 S.E.2d at 600 (quoting <em>Calvert v. Calvert, </em>18 Va.App. 781, 784, 447 S.E.2d 875, 876 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In the dialogue, father\u2019s counsel indicated that mother\u2019s annual salary was $74,823.32, or $6,235.28 a month, and that prior to the hearing, mother worked thirty-two hours per week. If she did not work on Tuesdays, her workweek would be twenty-four hours. Mother\u2019s counsel responded that her income would not be \u201cdiminished\u201d due to a better union contract, \u201cbecause she works weekends, and because she works late nights, she gets a better deal. Essentially, she works fewer hours and receives money.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel further represented that she would be able to earn the salary \u201cshe had before, without working Tuesdays.\u201d This proffer was not opposed by father.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The trial court instructed both counsel to prepare an order for change of child support payments, \u201cbased upon the change of the salary and day care elements.\u201d After a recess, counsel returned with a figure of $533 per month, but they did not submit any worksheets or explanation of the elements included in the calculation of that number.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not know if the $533 figure reflected a change in income or in day care, nor do we know the amount of change attributable to each. The informality of the procedure leaves a woefully poor record. While father\u2019s counsel continued to argue that income should be imputed to mother, and the trial court indicated it would reconsider the issue, the final order used the $533 figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">From the above, it is not clear that wife has actually suffered a loss of income. We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s decision not to impute income to mother. Father had the burden to prove imputation was appropriate, <em>see Niemiec, </em>27 Va.App. at 451, 499 S.E.2d at 579, and he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Finally, father contends the trial court erred in assessing attorney\u2019s fees against him as his motion was meritorious. He argues the court failed to consider his ability to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>versus mother\u2019s ability to pay. He also argues the fees were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter submitted to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987). The \u201ckey to a proper award of counsel fees\u201d is \u201creasonableness under all of the circumstances.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 338 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1985). To promote this determination, \u201cevidence in the record [must] explain or justify the amount of the award.\u201d <em>Westbrook v. Westbrook, </em>5 Va.App. 446, 458, 364 S.E.2d 523, 530 (1988). \u201cWhere the trial judge finds that a fee award is justified, evidence of time expended and services rendered is a proper basis upon which to fix an award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Although no affidavit was presented to the trial court, mother\u2019s counsel represented to the court without objection that her hourly fee was $200. She then set forth the time expended for two court appearances, telephone calls, drafting documents, etc., for a bill totaling $780. Further, the trial court found father\u2019s motion for modification was not meritorious. Under these circumstances, we hold that the award of counsel fees was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">B. Medical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Father contends he should not have to reimburse mother for the children\u2019s medical bills because she did not notify him of their appointments. Essentially, he maintains notification is a condition of reimbursement. The trial court disagreed, stating, \u201cI do not find ... the language of the order or the agreement to result in a default on the right of ... reimbursement for the expenses incurred for these medical and dental visits.\u201d We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cIt is the firmly established law of this Commonwealth that a trial court speaks only through its written orders.\u201d <em>Davis v. Mullins, </em>251 Va. 141, 148, 466 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1996). Additionally, \u201ctrial courts have the authority to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pret their own orders.\u201d <em>Fredericksburg Constr. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc., </em>260 Va. 137, 144, 530 S.E.2d 148, 152 (2000). <em>See also Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cFurthermore, when construing a lower court\u2019s order, a reviewing court should give deference to the interpretation adopted by the lower court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, no notification language is contained in the final decree\u2019s provisions for health care coverage and reimbursement. Instead, notification language is found in the consent decree, under the title, \u201cHealth.\u201d This \u201cHealth\u201d provision requires the parties consult one another as to \u201cmajor health decisions\u201d and requires notification of illnesses and medical appointments. Similarly, under the provisions entitled, \u201cEducation,\u201d the parties are required to share information concerning the children\u2019s education, grades, and activities. In the context of the consent decree, the trial court ordered the parties to cooperate and share information concerning the children\u2019s welfare and best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Based on this record, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in its interpretation of its own decree. We, therefore, hold the notification requirement was not a condition precedent for father\u2019s obligation to reimburse mother for the medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Father also argues he should be released from any obligation to pay some of these medical bills because the appointments were not with doctors listed by his insurance provider. However, the trial court accepted mother\u2019s explanation of why she took the children to these particular health care providers, and we will not disturb that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>\u201c </em>\u2018[T]he finding of the judge, upon the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their evidence, stands on the same footing as the verdict of a jury, and unless that finding is plainly wrong, or without evidence to support it, it cannot be disturbed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yates v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 140, 143, 355 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1987) (quoting <em>Lane v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 603, 611, 35 S.E.2d 749, 753 (1945)). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>cannot say the trial court was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d in accepting mother\u2019s explanations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Father also argues mother should not be reimbursed because she did not \u201ctimely\u201d send the medical bills to him. However, he does not argue that he suffered any prejudice from the untimely receipt of the bills. Nothing before the trial court indicated father\u2019s insurance carrier would decline to pay the bills of providers covered by the plan if the bills were not submitted in a \u201ctimely\u201d fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Father also asks that we apply the doctrine of \u201cunclean hands\u201d to this case. He argues mother\u2019s actions were improper and, therefore, she should not benefit from her \u201cwrongful\u201d behavior. Assuming, without deciding, that the unclean hands doctrine applies to these circumstances, we do not conclude that mother lacked \u201cclean hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u201c[H]e who asks equity must do equity, and he who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\u201d <em>Walker v. Henderson, </em>151 Va. 913, 927-28, 145 S.E. 311, 315 (1928).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">The withholding of equitable relief to punish a wrongdoer has been approved in other cases involving issues of family law but not where the rights of children were prejudiced by the result. <em>See Davis v. Davis, </em>206 Va. 381, 387, 143 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1965); <em>Gloth v. Gloth, </em>154 Va. 511, 555, 153 S.E. 879, 893 (1930).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"><em>Brown v. Kittle, 225 </em>Va. 451, 457, 303 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The trial court accepted mother\u2019s explanation for her behavior. We will not disturb this factual finding. <em>See Yates, 4 </em>Va.App. at 143, 355 S.E.2d at 16. Because the court found mother was not a \u201cwrongdoer,\u201d implicitly, she has \u201cclean hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Father also argues he should not be responsible for three of the bills, totaling $50, since they are not \u201cextraordinary\u201d bills under Code \u00a7 20-108.2(D),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the child support guidelines statute. The trial court rejected this argument, interpreting its own order as including such expenses. The court opined that the word \u201cextraordinary\u201d in the order referred to \u201ccharges that are not insured, and I think they\u2019re properly recoverable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Again, we defer to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of its own order. <em>See Fredericksburg Constr. Co., </em>260 Va. at 144, 580 S.E.2d at 152. We cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Lastly, we address father\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in awarding counsel fees and costs to mother. Father argues the trial court had no authority to award fees and costs. Essentially, father maintains that counsel fees can only be awarded <em>pendente lite </em>in divorce actions, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-103(A), in a decree in which a divorce is \u201cinstituted or pending,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-79(B), or when a party is found in contempt, <em>see Wilson v. Collins, </em>27 Va.App. 411, 426, 499 S.E.2d 560, 567 (1998). Father maintains that here, given the divorce is concluded, he must be found in contempt before the court can assess attorney\u2019s fees against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Father cites <em>Carswell v. Masterson, </em>224 Va. 329, 295 S.E.2d 899 (1982), as limiting awards of attorney\u2019s fees to cases where contempt is found. However, <em>Carswell </em>involved a failure of the trial court to award fees after finding a party in contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 295 S.E.2d at 900. The Supreme Court explained that trial courts may award attorney\u2019s fees in contempt pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ceedings brought to enforce support and divorce decrees and remanded the case \u201cfor such further proceedings as may be indicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 295 S.E.2d at 901. The Court did not express an opinion as to awards in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The more relevant case is <em>Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>33 Va.App. 743, 536 S.E.2d 925 (2000). In <em>Sullivan, </em>husband agreed in a property settlement to maintain life insurance, naming wife and children as beneficiaries; the settlement agreement was incorporated into a court order. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 536 S.E.2d at 927. Wife filed a show cause because husband failed to maintain the policy. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ordered husband to either purchase the required life insurance policy or post a bond to insure performance of the obligation; the court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to wife, without finding husband in contempt of court. <em>Id. </em>at 747, 536 S.E.2d at 927. On appeal, husband contended, since he was not specifically found in contempt, the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53, 536 S.E.2d at 930. This Court upheld the award. <em>Id. </em>at 753, 536 S.E.2d at 930.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">As explained in <em>Sullivan:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Judges presiding over contempt proceedings in divorce suits have the discretion to award counsel fees. <em>Carswell v. Masterson, </em>224 Va. 329, 332, 295 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1982). The trial judge\u2019s failure to use the word \u201ccontempt\u201d in his order does not alter the effect of his ruling. As in <em>Carswell, </em>the wife had to resort to legal proceedings to secure compliance with a valid court order. In awarding legal fees, the trial judge found that the husband failed to perform a legal duty. Furthermore, simply because the trial judge ordered the husband to comply with the life insurance provision, the alleged impossibility of securing such a policy does not provide a basis for establishing an abuse of discretion by the trial judge in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. The husband\u2019s reliance on <em>Wilson v. Collins, </em>27 Va.App. 411, 499 S.E.2d 560 (1998), does not aid his argument because in that case we held that the trial judge had incorrectly found a party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>contempt and therefore could not order that party to pay attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The case before us is very similar to <em>Sullivan. </em>Mother, for example, \u201chad to resort to legal proceedings to secure compliance with a valid court order,\u201d i.e., the order for father to pay fifty percent of the children\u2019s medical expenses. <em>Id. </em>Here also, the trial court found father failed to \u201cperform a legal duty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We further note that mother\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit to the trial court, showing her time expended on this case. We, therefore, conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings in these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">. We realize many trial issues are resolved with proffered evidence, but counsel and the trial court must ensure the proffers contain all of the information necessary to resolve the issue at trial and to provide a sufficient record for appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">. While the appendix contains worksheets, they were not offered into evidence at the hearing nor were they made part of the proffer. These documents, therefore, are not part of the record and will not be considered by this Court. Rule 5A:10, Rule 5A:25. <em>See also John v. Im, </em>263 Va. 315, 320, 559 S.E.2d 694, 697 (2002) (noting the appellate court is limited to the record before it and cannot consider documents that were not submitted to the trial court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">. The order states the support award is based upon \"the agreement of the parties as to the amount of child support based upon the guidelines set forth by the court.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">. The entire paragraph B, \"Health,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">1. The parties agree to consult with each other on major health decisions, and each parent shall have access to professional consultation and records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">2. If any of the children should become sick, the parent with whom the child is not staying at the time may visit the sick child. Each parent is to notify the other if any child is sick enough to be taken to the doctor or is confined to bed for two days or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">3. In the event that either parent should need to authorize emergency hospitalization, medical care or both for either child, that parent in whose care or presence the child is at the time shall have full authority to do so as a custodial parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">4. The parties shall notify the other at the time a doctor, dental or medical appointment is made for the benefit of the children.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-14\">. Again, father did not object to this procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b340-15\">. Father never questioned or objected to the amount of the medical bills. He objected only to paying some or all of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. While appellant, at oral argument, contended he argued during the hearing that a change in visitation would be in the children\u2019s best interest, we find nothing in the record to support that position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. While father objected to the May 10, 2001 order on a number of bases, including the court\u2019s refusal to hear testimony on the <em>visitation </em>matter, he did not make an objection based on the court\u2019s refusal to hear testimony on <em>imputed income.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. The record does indicate this figure was reached after some negotiation between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\">. While we do not condone a trial court accepting testimony from unsworn witnesses, father did not object to this procedure. As the appellant in this case, he had the responsibility to protect the parts of the record that would support his arguments on appeal. <em>See Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 533, 537, 546 S.E.2d 252, 254 (2001) (\u2018\u2018[Appellant] has the burden to preserve an adequate record on appeal to allow us to consider the propriety of the trial court's actions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. Code \u00a7 20-108.2(D) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Any extraordinary medical and dental expenses for treatment of the child or children shall be added to the basic child support obligation. For purposes of this section, extraordinary medical and dental expenses are uninsured expenses in excess of $100 for a single illness or condition and shall include but not be limited to eyeglasses, prescription medication, prostheses, and mental health services whether provided by a social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
