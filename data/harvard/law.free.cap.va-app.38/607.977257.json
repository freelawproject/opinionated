On appeal, he contends the trial court violated his right of confrontation by allowing the victim to testify by closed-circuit television, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9. For the reasons stated, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion to use closed-circuit television, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9, to allow K.P., the six-year-old victim, to testify outside the presence of appellant. Appellant opposed this motion. At a pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>hearing on the motion, the Commonwealth called Robin Big-ford as an expert witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Upon completion of the <em>voir dire, </em>the circuit court ruled Bigford was qualified to testify as an expert on the sexual abuse of children. Bigford said she was aware of the circumstances surrounding the abuse charges. She testified she met with K.P. on three occasions, and they discussed the upcoming trial, including some trial procedures and terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">According to Bigford, K.P. had a \u201cvery difficult time talking about court.\u201d Indeed, even when Bigford attempted to use dolls and chairs to simulate a courtroom setting, K.P. did not want to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Additionally, when Bigford was playing house with K.P., to determine if the child would \u201cplay out\u201d anything that happened to her in the home, she became very nervous when pretending the father was giving the baby a bath. She told Bigford, who had the father doll, \u201c[N]o, no, stop it.\u201d K.P. then said the father doll was \u201cnaughty or bad,\u201d had him go onto the roof of the dollhouse \u201cfor a long time,\u201d and said he was not allowed to eat with the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">K.P. did verbally express her fear of the courtroom. She told Bigford that she did not want to talk in front of her father, and she appeared \u201c[njervous and distracted.\u201d She ran around the room after making the statement. K.P. also expressed her nervousness about testifying to a school counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">At the most recent session with Bigford, a few days before the hearing, K.P. was \u201cespecially nervous\u201d and was \u201cthrowing doll furniture around.\u201d When Bigford asked if she knew what was going to happen in a few days, K.P. indicated on Wednesday she was going to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Bigford opined K.P. would \u201csuffer severe emotional trauma\u201d if she testified in open court in front of appellant, \u201cbecause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>her young age and her fears and because she is not ready at this point. She does not understand enough about court, for instance.\u201d Bigford explained, \u201cShe is nervous if I bring up anything about court. When I talk about other things she is not nervous, but when I talk about court she is nervous and her eyes got really big when we talked about court.\u201d In fact, the only time K.P. sat quietly and \u201clooked very scared\u201d during a session was when they were discussing court. Bigford later explained that the nature of the charges, together with this fear of court, increased the likelihood of severe emotional trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On cross-examination, Bigford explained her opinion was based on \u201c[KP.\u2019s] behaviors and also what she has stated. Her young age and the fact that she has a short attention span, [and she] does not seem able to deal with stress well from what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d She also noted that the child was not \u201cvery verbal\u201d and possibly suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder, thus making the open court appearance more traumatizing for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">K.P. told Bigford that she had testified in juvenile and domestic relations district court and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it again. She seemed to feel that she had done it once and she shouldn\u2019t have to do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">When asked on cross-examination what specific emotional trauma K.P. would suffer from testifying in front of appellant, Bigford said she could not specify particular \u201csymptoms\u201d or explain the precise effect on her personality. Bigford explained the emotional trauma could manifest itself in nightmares, bed-wetting, \u201cnot doing well at school,\u201d or \u201cnot eating very well____There could be a lot of behaviors that would express this.\u201d She further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">The emotional trauma would be something that she would feel, something that she would have to work out in therapy. I can\u2019t state exactly how this would be displayed. I can just state that it\u2019s my clinical opinion that she would suffer that emotional trauma and that it would be severe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Bigford also opined that K.P. would feel less apprehensive testifying on closed-circuit television and that setting would be less emotionally traumatizing. Bigford further believed K.P. would be able to communicate better using this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to allow K.P. to testify by closed-circuit television. The trial court was satisfied that \u201cthere is substantial likelihood that the child will suffer severe emotional trauma\u201d if she testified in open court in the presence of appellant. The court noted, \u201c[S]he\u2019s a[six]-year-old child, the father is the alleged perpetrator, and we have the opinion of an expert, clinical opinion of an expert, that supports the Commonwealth\u2019s motion .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Appellant does not contest the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> only its application to the facts of this case. Specifically, he contends the trial court erred in allowing the six-year-old victim to testify by closed-circuit television because the evidence did not support the court\u2019s finding that she would suffer \u201csevere emotional trauma\u201d by testifying in open court. He argues \u201cnervousness\u201d is not sufficient proof of \u201csevere emotional trauma\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9. While we agree nervousness by itself is insufficient to establish severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>emotional trauma, the evidence here included more than nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">When reviewing the decisions of a trial court, we give great weight to the court\u2019s factual findings, which will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>See Brooks v. Rogers, </em>18 Va.App. 585, 587, 445 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1994); <em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 203-04, 547 S.E.2d 899, 903 (2001). We also view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 174, 179, 554 S.E.2d 714, 716 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u201cIn determining the weight to be given the testimony of an expert witness, the fact finder may consider the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668-69 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). The credibility and weight of witnesses\u2019 testimony is determined by the fact finder. <em>Byers, </em>37 Va.App. at 179, 554 S.E.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 841, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3161, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a Maryland statute similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9. The Supreme Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">[I]f the State makes an adequate showing of necessity, the state interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of a special procedure that permits a child witness in such cases to testify at trial against a defendant in the absence of face-to-face confrontation with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 855, 110 S.Ct. 3157. We believe the Commonwealth made an adequate showing of necessity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Appellant contends Bigford only opined K.P. would suffer a generalized feeling of nervousness if she testified in front of her father. The record belies this contention. In fact, Big-ford specifically testified that in sexual abuse cases, \u201cmuch more is involved than just someone being uncomfortable about testifying in front of the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Bigford testified she met with six-year-old K.P. on three occasions. Bigford explained K.P. \u201chad a very difficult time talking about court\u201d and did not want to \u201ctalk\u201d in front of appellant, her father. Bigford further testified that, after the victim expressed concern about \u201ctalking\u201d in front of appellant, she became nervous and distracted and threw things around the room. K.P. also became nervous when Bigford pretended a father doll was bathing a baby doll.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">K.P. was not a verbal child and had a short attention span, possibly suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. She did not deal with stress well. Bigford opined K.P. would suffer severe emotional trauma if required to testify in open court. This trauma could manifest itself through, for example, nightmares, bed-wetting, doing poorly in school, and lack of appetite. K.P. was already exhibiting a poor appetite. Bigford further opined that K.P. likely would feel less apprehensive about testifying on closed-circuit television, which would be less emotionally traumatizing and enable her to communicate better.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In his ruling, the trial judge relied on the victim\u2019s age, that her father was the accused perpetrator, and Bigford\u2019s expert testimony. Based on these factors, he found a substantial likelihood existed that K.P. would suffer severe emotional trauma if she testified in open court in the presence of her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The expert\u2019s opinion was based on observations and interaction with the six-year-old victim and on her experience and training as a counselor of sexually abused children. She noted the child\u2019s behavioral responses whenever her court appearance was mentioned. She further noted possible future behavioral problems. She indicated therapy would be needed to resolve this trauma. Bigford, in great detail, explained the clinical basis for her opinion. Based on this record, we cannot say the trial court erred in finding a substantial likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that, based upon expert opinion testimony, K.P. would \u201csuffer severe emotional trauma from so testifying.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Appellant also argues no evidence allowed the court to adduce K.P. was \u201cunavailable to testify,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9, since she had testified in person at the preliminary hearing. While appellant is correct that the victim must be \u201cunavailable\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9, unavailability may be shown by (1) \u201crefusal to testify,\u201d (2) \u201csubstantial inability to communicate about the offense,\u201d or (3) \u201csubstantial likelihood, based on expert opinion testimony, that the child will suffer severe emotional trauma from so testifying.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9. Thus, under the express terms of the statute, if the Commonwealth proves any one of these three situations exists, it has proven unavailability. Since the trial court correctly concluded that the Commonwealth proved \u201csevere emotional trauma\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2\u201467.9(B)(3), we find the victim was \u201cunavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Appellant next contends, even if \u201csevere emotional trauma\u201d was proven, the closed-circuit television arrangements used in this case failed to ensure the reliability of the victim\u2019s testimony and did not impress upon the child the seriousness of the proceeding. Appellant maintains that, on cross-examination, the victim was allowed to color in a coloring book, which distracted the child and prevented her from responding to the attorney\u2019s questions. As the Commonwealth correctly points out, this argument was not made at trial and, therefore, is barred from our review by Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">At no time during trial did appellant object to the child having a coloring book. At no time did appellant object to any procedure involved in the closed-circuit television testimony. Although appellant asked the child to stop coloring on two occasions, he made no objection to the trial court, asking that the coloring book be removed or that the child be instructed to stop coloring or to pay attention. The trial court was not asked to intercede in the progress of cross-examination in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>way, except for appellant\u2019s request for a five-minute break.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At no time throughout the trial did appellant object to the effect of the coloring book on the child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18. <em>See also Jacques v. Commonwealth, 12 </em>Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991). A contrary rule would \u201cdeny the trial court the opportunity to consider and weigh, and, if necessary, reconsider before finally ruling.\u201d <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 584, 249 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1978). <em>See also Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 435, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). The trial court here was never asked to amend the procedures used during KP.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">To avail himself of the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18, an appellant must \u201caffirmatively show ... the error [that has occurred was] clear, substantial and material.\u201d Br<em>own v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). Such circumstances are not demonstrated in this record. While KP.\u2019s testimony was, at times, confusing, inexact, or inconsistent, nothing suggests the coloring book clearly, substantially, and materially contributed to this problem such that a miscarriage of justice occurred. This' witness was six years old, testifying about sexual abuse by her father. She had attention deficit problems and difficulty expressing herself verbally. Rule 5A.18, therefore, prevents our review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-13\">.
