On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions and, further, the court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory sentence prescribed for certain violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Guided by familiar principles of appellate review, we examine \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The credibility of witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely within the province of the fact finder. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). The judgment of the trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Martin, 4 </em>Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Viewed accordingly, the record discloses that, on March 27, 2000, Virginia Beach Police Officer Frederick E. Franks stopped a vehicle for a traffic infraction and noticed the front seat passenger, defendant, was not wearing a seat belt. Intending to issue a summons, Franks obtained identification from defendant and conducted a routine \u201crecord check,\u201d which revealed \u201coutstanding warrants\u201d for defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Franks, then joined at the scene by Officer Nicholas Russo, advised defendant of the warrants and asked that he \u201cstep out of the vehicle.\u201d As defendant exited the car, he removed his jacket and \u201cset it in the seat.\u201d Russo \u201cpicked up the jacket\u201d and, noticing it \u201cfelt heavy,\u201d \u201cwent into the pockets,\u201d and discovered an unloaded \u201chandgun.\u201d A search of defendant\u2019s person by Franks revealed cocaine in a trouser pocket. Defendant, a convicted felon, was subsequently indicted for possession of the controlled substance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> together with the instant firearm offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On December 4, 2000, trial commenced only on the indictments charging possession of cocaine and of a firearm while in possession of the controlled substance. Franks identified the \u201cunique weapon\u201d found in defendant\u2019s jacket as a \u201cCobray .45-.22 over-under,\u201d with the \u201ccapability ... [to fire] either the .22 round or the .45 round.\u201d Testing the pistol prior to trial, Franks placed \u201cmaskin [sic] tape ... between the firing pin and the barrel of the weapon, pulled the trigger\u201d and noted \u201cquite a distinct impression on the tape,\u201d \u201cwhere the firing pin would hit the primer ... of the .45 round.\u201d Similarly, when he placed \u201ca spent shell for a .22 long rifle ... into the barrel for the .22 ... and pulled the trigger[,] ... it did also leave a mark where the firing pin struck the rear of the casing ... consistent with the firing pin striking the .22 long rifle.\u201d Based upon his \u201cexperience and ... training,\u201d Franks opined, without objection, that the indentation evinced a strike by the firing pin on the .22 shell sufficient \u201cto discharge that round.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">At both the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and of all the evidence, defendant moved the court to strike, contending the Commonwealth had not \u201cproven [the weapon] to be operable,\u201d an element necessary to establish a \u201cfirearm\u201d con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>templated by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4. The court, however, overruled the motions, convicted defendant of possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled substance, and deferred sentencing pending the preparation and consideration of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On March 20, 2001, defendant appeared before the court for sentencing and for trial on the unresolved indictment alleging possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. For purposes of trial on the felon/firearm offense, the Commonwealth and defendant agreed to \u201c[stipulate to the evidence and the exhibits\u201d introduced in the earlier prosecution, subject to defendant\u2019s continuing challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish \u201cthe operability of the firearm.\u201d In proof of defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction, the Commonwealth offered into evidence a copy of an order entered in the Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court on September 7,1995, which memorialized a finding of \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201cAssault by Mob,\u201d a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-41, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-805. Attendant records, also in evidence, established defendant was fifteen years old at the time of such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Despite defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the firearm element of the offenses, the trial court also found defendant guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and proceeded to sentencing on both the controlled substance/firearm and felon/firearm convictions. Defendant then argued that the mandatory sentencing provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the felon/firearm offense, was applicable only to an accused \u201cpreviously <em>convicted </em>of a violent felony,\u201d not \u201ca [prior] juvenile <em>adjudication.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial judge disagreed and sentenced defendant to the mandatory term of five years imprisonment for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Defendant first contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he was in possession of an operable firearm within the intendment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2 and -308.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Both Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2 and -308.4 criminalize the possession of a \u201cfirearm\u201d by certain persons. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 proscribes such conduct by \u201c(i) any person who has been convicted of a felony or (ii) any person under the age of twenty-nine who was found guilty as a juvenile fourteen years of age or older at the time of the offense of a delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 prohibits the possession of \u201cany firearm\u201d by \u201c[a]ny person unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 429 S.E.2d 615, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993), and its progeny, we construed Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 to require proof that the offending weapon was operational or the functional equivalent. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 796, 537 S.E.2d 21 (2000); <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 393, 504 S.E.2d 886 (1998). In <em>Timmons v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 196, 421 S.E.2d 894 (1992), we applied a like principle to prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4. <em>Id. </em>at 199-201, 421 S.E.2d at 896-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Later, however, in <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va. App. 312, 549 S.E.2d 641 (2001) <em>(en </em>banc), we revisited <em>Jones, Timmons </em>and a succession of decisions that applied the related operability theory, concluding, \u201c[i]t matters not whether the gun\u2019s current condition is \u2018operable\u2019 or \u2018inoperable\u2019 or whether a can of WD 40 or the local gunsmith could render the firearm fully functional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 549 S.E.2d at 645. Thus, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">In a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, once the Commonwealth proves the accused is a convicted felon who possessed an object made to \u201cexpel a projectile by the combustion of gunpowder or other explosive,\u201d then it has proven all the necessary elements of the crime based on the plain language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 549 S.E.2d at 645. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of Virginia awarded Armstrong an appeal from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>judgment of this Court, thereby rendering uncertain the authority of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Nevertheless, -with <em>Armstrong </em>aside, and assuming controlling jurisprudence required the Commonwealth to prove the weapon in issue was operational, the instant record established the element. Tests of the gun conducted by police demonstrated the efficacy of the trigger, firing pin and related mechanisms, and Officer Franks testified, without objection or contradiction, that it would \u201cdischarge [a .22] round.\u201d Further, the trial judge, after examining the gun, found it was a \u201cheavy weapon ... [with] a very heavy, solid, strong firing mechanism[, which] makes an indentation in the .22-caliber cartridge ... very similar to the indentation that fired the bullet out of that cartridge.\u201d We, therefore, find no merit in defendant\u2019s sufficiency challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Defendant next contends the mandatory sentencing provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is not implicated by a prior \u201cjuvenile adjudication.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">It shall be unlawful for (i) <em>any person </em>who has been convicted of a felony or (ii) <em>any person </em>under the age of twenty-nine who was found guilty as a juvenile fourteen years of age or older at the time of the offense of a delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult, whether such conviction or adjudication occurred under the laws of this Commonwealth, or any other state ..., to knowingly and intentionally possess ... any firearm .... <em>Any person </em>who violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, <em>any person </em>who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(Emphases added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The statute is intended to \u201c \u2018prevents a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 748, 754, 561 S.E.2d 56, 59 (2002) (citation omitted). \u201cAny person\u201d convicted of the offense is subject to punishment as a Class 6 felony. However, to assure additional public protection from \u201cdangerously armed\u201d felons with a demonstrated propensity for violence, the legislature mandated incarceration for <em>\u201cany person ... </em>previously convicted\u201d of a <em>\u201cviolent </em>[predicate] <em>felony.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Defendant urges we construe the statutory reference to \u201cany person ... previously <em>convicted </em>of a violent felony,\u201d which appears in the mandatory sentencing provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), to exclude from such punishment offenders \u201cfound guilty ... of a delinquent act ..., whether such conviction or adjudication\u201d resulted from a violation of Virginia law or otherwise. (Emphasis added.) In support of his argument, defendant notes \u201cthe terms ... used to describe [predicate] juvenile offenses\u201d in defining the crime are distinct from \u201cconvictions\u201d referenced in mandating sentence, thereby evincing legislative intent to limit the mandatory punishment to persons having committed a violent felony as an adult. Defendant\u2019s construction, however, is belied by the clear language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and would subvert the salutary purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Well established \u201cprinciples of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[i]t is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a [term] of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (citations omitted). Because the Code of Virginia is \u201cone body of law,\u201d we may consult other statutes \u201cusing the same phraseology\u201d to assist us in divining legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>14 Va.App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 425. \u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly [against the Commonwealth], they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Here, in fashioning a statute to protect the public from the threat of dangerously armed felons, the legislature expressly included within the statutory proscription all persons previously \u201cfound guilty,\u201d while juveniles, of a \u201cdelinquent act,\u201d deemed felonious. Subsequent reference in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) to \u201cconviction or adjudication\u201d simply recognizes terms that sometimes differentiate determinations of guilt in juvenile and adult prosecutions. Thus, the inclusive language, <em>\u201cany person,\u201d </em>which appears in the punishment provisions of the statute, clearly embraces anyone found in violation of the prohibition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the statutory language promotes inclusion, not exclusion. A different interpretation would exempt dangerous felons, with demonstrated violent propensities, from a mandated punishment intended to enhance public protection, a narrow and illogical construction at odds with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Moreover, treatment of juvenile \u201cadjudications\u201d as convictions for purposes of sentencing considerations comports with other statutes that address the issue. <em>See, e.g. </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-805(B)(1) (\u201cFor purposes of [sentencing guidelines], previous convictions shall include prior adult convictions and juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>convictions and adjudications of delinquency based on an offense which would have been at the time of conviction a felony if committed by an adult....\u201d); Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 (stating that for purposes of sentencing, \u201cdefendant\u2019s <em>prior criminal convictions ... </em>include!] adult convictions and juvenile convictions and adjudications of delinquency\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions, together with the mandatory punishment imposed upon defendant in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">.
