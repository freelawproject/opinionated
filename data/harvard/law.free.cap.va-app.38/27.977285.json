Sprinkle was provided with information concerning Toliver, including a Wanted Poster bearing Toliver\u2019s picture, his physical description, a description of the car he had been driving and a partial license plate number, as well as a list of places where Toliver might be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">At approximately 9:15 a.m. that same day, Sprinkle observed Toliver standing next to an open car door in the 2500 block of Phaupp Street in Richmond, one of the areas where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Sprinkle was advised Toliver might be found. Sprinkle approached Toliver and told him he needed to speak with him. Toliver immediately fled on foot. Sprinkle chased Toliver for \u201c[about a block[,][m]aybe not quite a block,\u201d before arresting him, 261.5 feet from the doors of Fairfield Elementary School.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Sprinkle searched Toliver incident to arrest and found one \u201cbaggie corner\u201d containing .053 grams of heroin, one plastic bag with 17 \u201cbaggie corners\u201d containing .96 grams of heroin, one plastic bag with six \u201cbaggie corners\u201d containing crack cocaine, and loose crack cocaine, totaling .60 grams. Sprinkle also found $418.17 and a cell phone. Toliver was charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, as well as several other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">At trial, Richmond Detective A.J. Jones, an expert qualified to testify regarding drug distribution, testified that the items found on Toliver\u2019s person were not consistent with personal drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Toliver moved to strike the charge of possession with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school, arguing that the distance from the school should have been measured from where Toliver was approached by the officer and began running, instead of from where he was apprehended. The trial court denied the motion, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">This is not a case where the officer said run, or where the officer said run toward the school. [Toliver], by his own motion, placed himself in a position where he was within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, secondary or post-secondary school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Toliver renewed his motion to strike at the close of the evidence, and the trial court again denied it. Toliver was ultimately convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on the charge, all suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On appeal, Toliver does not dispute the fact that he possessed the drugs, nor does he dispute the fact that he possessed them with the intent to distribute them. Instead, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, because the only evidence offered pertaining to his proximity to the school was the distance from where he was apprehended. Toliver argues that the Commonwealth should have offered evidence of his distance from the school from where he was initially approached by the officer, as he claims there was no evidence he intended to possess or deal drugs within 1,000 feet from the school, only that he ran toward the school in an effort to evade Officer Sprinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u201cWhen the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged, we consider all the evidence, and any reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed at trial, which is the Commonwealth in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s judgment will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2 provides as follows, in relevant part: It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell or distribute or possess with intent to sell, give or distribute any controlled substance, imitation controlled substance or marijuana while (i) upon the property, including buildings and grounds, of any public or private elementary, secondary, or post[-]secondary school, or any public or private two-year or four-year institution of higher education; (ii) upon public property or any property open to public use within 1,000 feet of such school property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Toliver argues this statute applies to cases where it is proven that a defendant intended to engage in a drug transaction within 1,000 feet of a school, and not to cases where it is proven only that the defendant intended to engage in a drug transaction outside the designated zone. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cIn evaluating [Toliver\u2019s] arguments, we are mindful that Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2 is a penal statute and, as such, \u2018must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So viewed, it is clear that the statute places a geographic limitation on the necessary elements contained therein. The language plainly prohibits the \u201cmanufacture, [sale] or distribution] or <em>possession] with intent to sell, give or distribute </em>any controlled substance ... <em>while ... upon </em>\u201d the designated property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This particular statute does not state that it prohibits possession of a controlled substance while upon school property, or within 1,000 feet thereof, with the intent to sell, give or distribute the substance elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"> The Commonwealth argues that the legislature intended no such geographical limitation on the terms of the statute and that reading into the statute such a limitation is \u201cpatently ridiculous\u201d and would create a \u201cright to flight,\u201d immunizing a defendant from subsequent crimes committed during flight from authorities. However, it is \u201c[o]ur duty ... to interpret the law, not enact it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[W]hen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u201cthe legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if the legislature had intended this particular statute to punish individuals for merely possessing a controlled substance while on school property, within 1,000 feet of school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>property, or while passing through such property, with the intent to distribute the substance elsewhere, it could have done so. \u201cWe cannot add such additional protection to a statute ..., nor can we rewrite a statute with language not used by the legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Our reading of the statute comports with the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s interpretation of the legislative intent behind it, as set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. Burns.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Bums, </em>the Court reviewed the statute and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">In our opinion, ... implicit in the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2, is the legislative finding that the threat of harm to children is present whether or not school is in session, school-related activities are being held, or children are present <em>when dmg transactions take place within 1,000 feet of a school.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, here it is clear that no evidence established Toliver sold or distributed the drugs while on or near school property. Further, there was no evidence presented to suggest that Toliver possessed the drugs with the intention of selling, giving or distributing them while on such property. In fact, with the exception of Officer Sprinkle\u2019s general statement that he chased Toliver \u201cnot quite a block\u201d before apprehending him, there was no evidence that established Toliver\u2019s proximity to the school when he was first observed by Sprinkle. Indeed, the trial court made no factual finding concerning Toliver\u2019s distance from the school when Sprinkle initially approached him. Thus, there could be no determination, without speculation, that Toliver possessed the controlled substances at issue with the intent to sell, give or distribute them while upon school property, or within 1,000 feet thereof. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s determination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>this issue was plainly wrong and without evidence to support it and reverse his conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In addition, we note that Toliver\u2019s indictment on the charge at issue, labeled \u201c00-F-3227 MPS,\u201d read \u201cLerone Darrell Toliver did feloniously and unlawfully manufacture, sell, distribute, or possess with intent to sell, give or distribute a controlled substance, an imitation controlled substance, or marijuana upon the property of a public or private elementary, secondary, or post[-]secondary school,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2. In convicting Toliver on the charge, the trial court stated \u201cMr. Toliver, the court will find you guilty of the offense! ] in Indictment ... F-00-3227.\u201d However, the conviction order in this case incorrectly states that Toliver was convicted of \u201cpossession of marijuana with intent to distribute near a school.\u201d Additionally, the Conviction and Sentencing Order incorrectly states that Toliver was convicted of \u201cDistribution of Marijuana Near a School.\u201d Accordingly, instead of dismissing Toliver\u2019s conviction for possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, we remand with direction to the trial court to correct the clerical errors in the conviction order, as well as the Conviction and Sentencing Order, and then to dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-13\">. The Conviction and Sentencing Order indicates Toliver was also convicted of possession of heroin, possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of heroin while in possession of a firearm, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, malicious wounding and felony child abuse. These convictions are not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. <em>Byers v.
