(\u201cAquia\u201d). The purchase price was $5,120. Aquia represented that the car was in good condition and had been inspected for safety and emissions. Aquia further represented that it had available and could transfer to Morgan clear title to the car. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Shortly after the purchase, Morgan began experiencing mechanical problems involving the engine, brakes, cooling system, and suspension. He also discovered that the frame was bent and needed repair. Aquia failed to provide registration. Morgan attempted to return the vehicle, but Aquia refused to take it back and assigned the financing documents to Mercury Finance, which subsequently repossessed the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In August 1999, Morgan initiated a lawsuit against Aquia on four grounds: (1) fraud; (2) violation of the Consumer Protection Act, Code \u00a7 59.1-196, <em>et seq.; </em>(3) breach of express and implied warranties; and (4) statutory rescission of the thirty-day temporary certificate of ownership pursuant to Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u00a7 46.2-1542. On April 12, 2000, he was awarded a default judgment against Aquia for actual damages of $9,668.48, exemplary damages of $20,000, expert witness fees of $350, attorney\u2019s fees of $7,285, and court costs of $156. The court awarding the judgment recited evidence that Aquia had caused Morgan loss or damage \u201cby practicing fraud on [Morgan], or by making fraudulent representations to him; or caused loss or damage to [Morgan] by reason of one or more violations of the Motor Vehicle Act, Virginia Code, \u00a7 46.2-1575....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Morgan filed with the Board a claim under the Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund, Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.1, <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He sought satisfaction of the judgment for the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">Actual damages: $9,668.48</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">Expert witness fees: $ 350.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">Attorney\u2019s fees: 87,285.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">Court costs: $ 156.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Recognizing that the maximum recoverable amount allowed by statute was $15,000, he reduced the net amount of his claim to $15,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">On June 7, 2000, the Board notified Morgan that his claim provided insufficient information as to how the court had determined \u201cactual damages\u201d and requested additional information. Morgan provided the following breakdown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">Purchase price of warranty: $5,286.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Mr\">Finance charges: $ 547.37</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASy\">Repair costs: $2,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOf\">Loss of use/rental costs: $1,020.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN4F\">Loss of wages: $ 315.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">The Board concluded that the full amount of Morgan\u2019s judgment was not compensable. It awarded him $5,120, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>purchase price of the car. Based on its prior practice and interpretation of the statutes involved, it held that his attorney\u2019s fees, court' costs, and expert witness fees were not compensable from the Fund. It further held that his repair costs and loss of use/rental costs were merely incidental to ownership and operation and did not result from fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Morgan appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21. The trial court ruled that Morgan was entitled to satisfaction of his judgment by the Fund, including compensation for his \u201cactual damages\u201d and attorney\u2019s fees as ascertained in his lawsuit. It further held that the Board\u2019s decision was \u201cnot substantially justified\u201d and awarded Morgan attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 (recodified as Code \u00a7 2.2-4030).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, it reconsidered its allowance of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21. Recognizing that the Board had followed a long-standing practice and belief that the Fund could not compensate for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, it held that Morgan had failed to show that the Board\u2019s decision not to compensate attorney\u2019s fees and costs was \u201cnot substantially justified.\u201d It denied Morgan\u2019s request for interest on the $15,000 award from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">II. <em>PAYMENT OF ACTUAL DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">Whenever any person is awarded a final judgment ... for (i) any loss or damage in connection with the purchase or lease of a motor vehicle by reason of \u00e1ny fraud practiced on him or fraudulent representation made to him by a licensed or registered motor vehicle dealer or one of dealer\u2019s salespersons ... or (ii) any loss or damage by reason of the violation by a dealer or salesperson of any of the provisions of this chapter in connection with the purchase of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>vehicle ... the judgment creditor may file a verified claim with the Board, <em>requesting payment from the Fund of the amount unpaid on the judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 (emphasis added). The Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">If the judgment debt is not fully satisfied ... the <em>Board shall make payment from the Fund </em>subject to the other limitations contained in this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">Excluded from the amount of any unpaid final judgment on which a claim against the Fund is based shall be any sums representing interest, or punitive or exemplary damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Considering Morgan\u2019s claim against the Fund, the Board reviewed the underlying judgment. It held that it was not satisfied that his judgment against Aquia was based solely on the grounds of fraud. It \u201ccarefully examined each item that was included in the calculation of \u2018actual damages\u2019 \u201d and decided that some of those items related to routine ownership and maintenance. Thus, it reduced the element of actual damages to $5,120, the purchase price of the car. In so doing, the Board exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Morgan\u2019s lawsuit against Aquia was couched in terms of fraud, violation of the Consumer Protection Act, and breach of express and implied warranties. His case was tried and judgment was rendered based on findings of \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cfraudulent representations,\u201d and \u201cviolations of the Motor Vehicle Act.\u201d The court that rendered the judgment tried Morgan\u2019s allegations. It assessed his actual damages as resulting from the proven fraudulent conduct of Aquia. The Board had no authority to retry those issues. Its duty was limited to satisfaction of the judgment, subject to the statutory limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Noting that the Act makes no express provision for the Fund\u2019s satisfaction of a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the Board adhered to its previous position that such elements of a judgment could not be satisfied out of the Fund. In this, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.3 and 46.2-1527.5 provide that a judgment against a motor vehicle dealer for fraud shall be satisfied by the Fund. \u201c[T]he judgment creditor may file a verified claim with the Board, <em>requesting payment from the Fund of the amount unpaid on the judgment.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 (emphasis added). \u201cIf the judgment debt is not fully satisfied ... the <em>Board shall make payment from the Fund </em>subject to the other limitations contained in this article.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 (emphasis added). Thus, the entire judgment against Aquia, including actual damages, court costs, and attorney\u2019s fees, is compensable by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">III. <em>ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES PURSUANT TO CODE \u00a7 9-6.lp.21</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Morgan contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21. He argues the Board\u2019s position was \u201cnot substantially justified.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The Administrative Process Act outlines the criteria for obtaining attorney\u2019s fees when a party contests an agency action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">A. In any civil case brought under Article 5 (\u00a7 2.2-4025 et seq.) of this chapter or \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4002, 2.2-4006, 2.2-4011, or \u00a7 2.2-4018, in which any person contests any agency action, such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency ... reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4030 (formerly Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">The trial court noted that the Board had adhered to its long-standing practice and belief that the Fund could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>compensate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The trial court held that Morgan failed to prove that the Board\u2019s position was \u201cnot substantially justified.\u201d The record supports that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">While the Board\u2019s position on compensability of a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees and costs was rejected by the trial court and is rejected by us, that position was substantially plausible and was based on the Board\u2019s long-standing practice, which had never been tested in court. The same is true of the Board\u2019s review of Morgan\u2019s \u201cactual damages.\u201d Consequently, Morgan is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for the proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">. Effective October 1, 2001, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 was recodified as Code \u00a7 2.2-4030.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-19\">. The Virginia General Assembly created the Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund in 1988. Its purpose is to satisfy unpaid judgments that have been obtained against a licensed motor vehicle dealer or salesperson for fraud, fraudulent practices, or any loss or damage resulting from the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-20\">. Effective July 1, 2001, the statutory recovery limit was increased to $20,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">. <em>See </em>2001 Va. Acts, c. 844.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">. Morgan filed a claim against the Fund on or about May 25, 2000. At that time the statutory limit for recovering from the Fund was $15,000. As a result, the current statutory recovery limit, which was increased to $20,000 on July 1, 2001, is not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
