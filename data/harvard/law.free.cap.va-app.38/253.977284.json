On appeal, employer contends claimant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that her carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was a compensable disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-401 because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>medical evidence failed to provide a sufficient causal link between claimant\u2019s CTS and her employment. We hold that the evidence as a whole, including claimant\u2019s testimony, supported the commission\u2019s finding of causation. Thus, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Claimant began working for employer at Keokee Elementary school as a substitute employee in 1980 and became a regular employee in about 1990. Most of that time, claimant worked as a cook, but for about two years in the mid 1990s, she worked as a janitor. Claimant\u2019s janitorial work required her to shovel more than a ton of coal into the school\u2019s furnaces on a daily basis. She also \u201cworked on the furnace, took ashes out,\u201d mowed grass, used a \u201cweed eate[r],\u201d and installed windows. In about 1996, she returned to working as a cook, and she worked as a cook throughout the remainder of her employment. Claimant described her work as a cook as follows: \u201c[W]e cook hamburger meat which is 40 to 50 pounds in a case. We stock. We put all of our stock away. We put all of our produce away. We\u2019re constantly lifting pans, kettles, washing, mopping, we lift tables.\u201d She agreed her job involved \u201crepetitive lifting, rotating, bending and use of [her] wrist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">About three years prior to the December 2000 hearing, claimant began to experience problems with her arms and wrists. She \u201cthought it was just [the] lifting\u201d causing her \u201cwrists [to] get sore,\u201d and she \u201cnever thought [anything] about it\u201d \u201cbecause [she] enjoyed working.\u201d However, when her \u201chands kept getting worse\u201d and began \u201cgoing numb and drawing up on her,\u201d she decided to seek medical attention. At that time, she was engaged in no hobbies or any other activities outside of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On October 8, 1999, claimant saw Dr. Richard Norton with complaints of pain in her upper extremities. She reported the pain was in her shoulders, elbows and wrists and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>worse in the mornings. After x-rays of claimant\u2019s hands revealed no arthritic changes, Dr. Norton referred claimant to Dr. Mohammed Bhatti, a neurologist. When Dr. Bhatti examined claimant on November 1, 1999, he detected a loss of grip strength in claimant\u2019s hands and noted the loss was greater in her dominant left hand. Dr. Bhatti suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Nerve conduction studies performed on December 3,1999, confirmed \u201cbilateral median nerve compression in carpal tunnel, left more than right.\u201d Claimant\u2019s nerve conduction studies also indicated right ulnar nerve compression in the cubital canal. Dr. Bhatti noted claimant had subcutaneous knots on both arms, but he gave no indication of any connection between the nodules and claimant\u2019s CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">On referral from Dr. Bhatti, claimant then saw Dr. Hossein Faiz, a surgeon, regarding removal of the painful subcutaneous nodules on her elbows. On December 15, 1999, Dr. Faiz removed the nodules. He noted that the right nodule had attached and compressed the right ulnar nerve whereas the left nodule \u201cwas not close to any major nerve structures.\u201d Dr. Faiz directed that a copy of his operative note be sent to Dr. Bhatti.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Dr. Bhatti saw claimant again on December 22, 1999, after Dr. Faiz removed the nodules from claimant\u2019s elbows. Dr. Bhatti recommended that claimant undergo a bilateral CTS release for her \u201c[bjilateral moderate to severe median nerve compression.\u201d Claimant confirmed that Dr. Bhatti told her in December of 1999 that she had bilateral CTS which was worse on the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In early 2000, claimant saw Dr. Robert Evans, an osteopath, for continuing complaints of pain in her hands. He noted she had CTS and was waiting until school was out to have decompression surgery. In his February 26, 2000 office note, Dr. Evans noted \u201c[m]ost of the problem comes during the day while she is working.... [S]he has to use the hands and wrists a big deal at work and it is mostly during this time and shortly afterwards that it bothers her.\u201d When Dr. Evans saw claimant again on April 24, 2000, for \u201cworsening pain,\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>noted she was a cafeteria worker and said, \u201cI know that the repetitive nature of the work that she does, and has for years, is being the deciding factor in these bilateral carpal tunnel syndromes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Claimant subsequently returned to Dr. Faiz for the recommended CTS surgery. However, Dr. Faiz sent claimant back to Dr. Bhatti for repeat nerve conduction studies because the last studies had been performed during the previous year. The repeat nerve conduction studies revealed \u201cnormal ulnar nerve parameters bilaterally\u201d but showed a mild worsening of claimant\u2019s left CTS. Dr. Bhatti examined claimant again on November 16, 2000, and noted no significant changes in her CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Claimant testified that she told Dr. Bhatti about the \u201crepetitive lifting, rotating, bending[,] use of [her] wrist\u201d and \u201cpulling\u201d she engaged in at work and that, sometime in the year 2000, Dr. Bhatti told her that her CTS \u201cwas caused by the work, by the lifting and the tugging all day long seven hours a day,\u201d \u201c[p]ulling all those years.\u201d Dr. Bhatti\u2019s office notes do not reflect this opinion or the communication of such an opinion to claimant. However, Dr. Bhatti opined in a November 22, 2000 letter to employer\u2019s counsel that \u201c[claimant\u2019s] [CTS] is most probably secondary to [the] cumulative effect of several years duration involving repetitive lifting, rotating, bending, and use of wrists, regardless of weight, which may be caused by work done as is required by a cook.\u201d He also noted that \u201cfrequent breaks between [claimant\u2019s] cooking chores were observed [to] alleviate[ ][her] symptoms.\u201d Finally, Dr. Bhatti indicated an awareness of the knots in claimant\u2019s arms but opined the knots \u201cmost probably have no direct bearing on [her][CTS] symptoms unless upon surgical exploration they are found to be in the carpal tunnel region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The deputy commissioner expressed doubts about the sufficiency of the medical evidence, standing alone, to prove causation by clear and convincing evidence. However, he found that the record as a whole, including evidence of the repetitive nature of claimant\u2019s job and the absence of evidence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>non-work-related cause for claimant\u2019s CTS, permitted him to find clear and convincing evidence of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">With one commissioner dissenting, the commission affirmed, noting that the evidence need not prove \u201cconclusively]\u201d that claimant\u2019s CTS resulted from her work. The majority relied on (1) evidence that claimant\u2019s job required \u201cextensive\u201d repetitive use of her hands and that claimant\u2019s treating physicians offered uncontradicted testimony linking her work with her CTS and (2) a lack of evidence to suggest that any non-work-related activities could have caused claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">ANALYSIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) provides that carpal tunnel syndrome is an \u201cordinary disease[ ] of life as defined in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-400(C). For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, a claimant must prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence, (not a mere probability),\u201d that the disease (1) \u201carose out of and in the course of [her] employment as provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-400 ... \u201d; (2) \u201cdid not result from causes outside of the employment\u201d; and (3) \u201cfollows as an incident of occupational disease ... [;] is an infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of [specified types of employment]; or ... is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to such employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-401. Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B) provides that a disease arises out of the employment \u201cif there is[, <em>inter </em>alia,] ... <em>[a] direct causal connection </em>between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease; ... [and][i]t can be fairly traced to the employment as <em>the proximate cause </em>.... \u201d (Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Evidence is clear and convincing when it produces in the fact finder \u201c \u2018a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is ... more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and <em>unequivocal.\u2019 \u201d Fred C. Walker Agency v. Lacas, </em>215 Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975) (quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118, 123 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The commission\u2019s determination regarding causation is a finding of fact. <em>Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>15 Va.App. 544, 551, 425 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1993). A finding of causation need not be based exclusively on medical evidence. <em>Dollar Gen\u2019l Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1996). \u201cThe testimony of a claimant may also be considered in determining causation, especially where the medical testimony is inconclusive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajs\">\u201cTo appraise the true degree of indispensability which should be accorded medical testimony, it is first necessary to dispel the misconception that valid awards can stand only if accompanied by a definite medical diagnosis. True, in many instances it may be impossible to form a judgment on the relation of the employment to the injury [or disease] ... without analyzing in medical terms what the injury or disease is. But this is not invariably so. In appropriate circumstances, awards may be made when medical evidence on these matters is inconclusive, indecisive, fragmentary, inconsistent, or even nonexistent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 177, 468 S.E.2d at 154-55 (quoting 2B Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 79.51(a) (1995) (citations omitted)). Similarly, where the diagnosis is clear but the medical evidence does not provide a sufficient causal link between the ailment and the employment, the commission may rely on the testimony of the claimant to establish this link. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In determining whether credible evidence exists to support the commission\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cthe appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh ... the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). Thus, unless we can say as a matter of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>claimant failed to sustain her burden of proving causation, the commission\u2019s findings are binding and conclusive upon us. <em>Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530; <em>Tomko v. Michael\u2019s Plastering Co., </em>210 Va. 697, 699, 173 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Claimant produced clear and convincing evidence that her CTS (1) arose out of and in the course of her employment, (2) did not result from causes outside her employment, (3) was characteristic of her employment and (4) was caused by conditions peculiar to such employment. As the commission noted, the medical evidence did not conflict and uniformly connected claimant\u2019s condition with her employment. As the deputy commissioner and commission found, claimant\u2019s duties included \u201ccooking, stocking, washing, mopping, shoveling coal, mowing grass, using a weed eater and managing the furnace.\u201d These duties required claimant \u201cto use her hands and wrists a [great] deal,\u201d and claimant reported that \u201cit is mostly during this time and shortly afterwards that [her wrists and hands] bother[] her.\u201d The evidence also indicated that \u201cfrequent breaks between [claimant\u2019s] cooking chores ... alleviate[d][her] symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Credible evidence established that Dr. Evans and Dr. Bhatti were aware of claimant\u2019s job duties and the effect these duties had on her symptoms. Based on this knowledge, Dr. Evans opined that \u201cthe repetitive nature of the work that [claimant] does, and has [done] for years, is being <em>the deciding factor </em>in these bilateral carpal tunnel syndromes.\u201d (Emphasis added). As we previously have held, the requirement that a claimant establish the source of the disease means she must point \u201cnot to a single source [of the disease], to the complete exclusion of all other sources, but to the primary source .... \u201d <em>Ross Labs. v. Barbour, </em>13 Va.App. 373, 377, 412 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1991); <em>see Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530. Dr. Evans\u2019 opinion that the repetitive nature of claimant\u2019s work was \u201cthe deciding factor\u201d in her development of CTS was accepted by the commission and, considered together with claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in the record, constitutes credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ble evidence that claimant\u2019s work was \u201cthe primary source\u201d of her CTS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Dr. Bhatti\u2019s opinion further supports the commission\u2019s finding of causation. Dr. Bhatti did not render his opinion based on \u201ca mere probability,\u201d a standard rejected by the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-401. Rather, Dr. Bhatti opined that claimant\u2019s CTS \u201cis <em>most probably </em>secondary to [the] cumulative effect of several years duration involving repetitive lifting, rotating, bending, and use of wrists.\u201d (Emphasis added). He acknowledged the knots on claimant\u2019s arms but opined that they <em>\u201cmost probably </em>ha[d] no direct bearing on her [CTS] symptoms\u201d unless shown to have infiltrated the carpal tunnel region. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Something that is merely \u201cprobable\u201d has \u201cmore evidence for [it] than against [it].\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1081 (5th ed.1979). Thus, probability may be equated with proof by a preponderance, <em>see Slaughter v. Valleydale Packers, Inc., </em>198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Va. 339, 345-46, 94 S.E.2d 260, 266 (1956), an evidentiary standard lower than the clear and convincing evidentiary standard required by Code \u00a7 65.2-401, <em>see Lucas, </em>215 Va. at 540, 211 S.E.2d at 92. However, Dr. Bhatti\u2019s addition of the word \u201cmost\u201d to his opinion changed its meaning considerably. The adverb \u201cmost\u201d means \u201c[i]n or to the highest degree\u201d and is \u201c[u]sed with many adjectives and adverbs to form the superlative degree [as in] <em>most honest </em>[or] <em>most impatiently.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>1178 (3d ed.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Thus, the commission could reasonably conclude that Dr. Bhatti, by combining the adverbs \u201cmost\u201d and \u201cprobably,\u201d expressed his opinion regarding the cause of claimant\u2019s CTS as \u201ca firm belief or conviction,\u201d the standard required to prove a proposition by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Lucas, </em>215 Va. at 540, 211 S.E.2d at 92 (quoting <em>Cross, </em>120 N.E.2d at 123). Further, in light of the record as a whole, Dr. Bhatti\u2019s statement that the repetitive motion and resulting CTS he described \u201cmay be caused by work done as is required by a cook\u201d was not an equivocation and, therefore, did not diminish the weight the commission could give to Dr. Bhatti\u2019s opinion. As the commission noted, the record reflected claimant\u2019s testimony, which it found credible, that claimant\u2019s job did, in fact, require such activities. Claimant also testified that she had informed Dr. Bhatti, in response to his inquiries, about the repetitive nature of her job duties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the record as a whole, including claimant\u2019s testimony and the opinions of Drs. Evans and Bhatti, contained credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that claimant\u2019s CTS arose out of and in the course of her work for employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Finally, the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant met her burden of proving her CTS did not result from causes outside of the employment. The medical evidence outlined above provided clear and convincing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>dence that claimant\u2019s CTS resulted from repetitive motion rather than from the nodules on claimant\u2019s arms or from any other medical condition, and claimant testified that she engaged in no hobbies or other activities outside her work which involved this type of motion. Although statements from claimant\u2019s doctors that her CTS did not result from any causes outside of the employment may have strengthened claimant\u2019s case, such statements were not critical to the commission\u2019s determination in light of claimant\u2019s own testimony. <em>See Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. at 176-77, 468 S.E.2d at 154-55; <em>see also Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 11-12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988) (where physician could not state \u201c \u2018to a reasonable medical certainty\u2019 that [claimant\u2019s] hearing loss was not caused by non-employment factors\u201d but said \u201c[claimant] did not give me a history of anything [outside of work] I might interpret as having caused it,\u201d the commission \u201ccould and did draw the reasonable inference that [claimant\u2019s] hearing loss was not caused by non-employment factors based on his negative history of noise exposure which would cause such a hearing loss and the nonexistence of genetic or biological factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">For these reasons, we hold the record as a whole contains credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant proved the necessary causal connection between her CTS and her employment and that she did so by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. The dissent appears to construe Dr. Evans' opinion as stating that the nature of claimant\u2019s work was merely <em>a </em>factor which <em>contributed </em>to her development of CTS. On the contrary, Dr. Evans expressly opined that claimant\u2019s work was <em>\"the deciding </em>factor.\u201d (Emphasis added). Giving these words their ordinary import compels the conclusion, as set out in the text, that claimant\u2019s work was \u201cthe primary source\u201d of her CTS, which is all that the law requires. <em>See Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530; <em>Barbour, </em>13.Va.App. at 377, 412 S.E.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </em>585 (1993), the source cited by the dissent, defines the word, \"decide,\u201d as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">vi; to dispel doubt on: a: to arrive at a choice or solution concerning which ends uncertainty or contention c'what to order for breakfast&gt; b: to bring definitively and conclusively to an end esp. in matters relating to war &lt;the victory at San Jacinto <em>decided </em>the war&gt; ... <em>vi: </em>to make a choice or decision esp. a binding or definitive one presumably after consideration....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Under any of the above-quoted definitions of \"decide,\u201d \"the deciding factor\u201d is one which does more than simply contribute; under the second definition above, \"the deciding factor\u201d is the \"definitive\u201d or \"conclusive\u201d factor, rather than merely \"one possible consideration.\u201d Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to claimant, Dr. Evans\u2019 opinion that claimant\u2019s work was \"the deciding factor\u201d in her development of bilateral CTS is sufficient to support the commission\u2019s implicit finding that it was \"the primary source.\u201d <em>See Marcus, </em>15 Va.App. at 551, 425 S.E.2d at 530; <em>Barbour, </em>13 Va.App. at 377, 412 S.E.2d at 208.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">.

Upon a review of the record, I find the claimant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence a direct causal connection between her condition and her employment, which was the proximate cause of her CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the medical narratives of Drs. Evans and Bhatti, reviewed individually or collectively, support a finding that claimant presented clear and convincing evidence that her CTS arose out her employment with the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Dr. Evans\u2019 April 24, 2000 file note stated, \u201cI know that the repetitive nature of the work that she does, and has for years, is being the deciding factor in <em>these </em>bilateral carpal tunnel syndromes.\u201d (Emphasis added). In considering the evidence in the light most favorable to claimant, the commission could construe the term \u201cthese\u201d to refer to claimant\u2019s CTS causation, as opposed to CTS generally. However, I disagree with the majority that use of the term \u201cdeciding factor\u201d constitutes proof by clear and convincing evidence of a direct causal connection and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A \u201cdeciding factor\u201d is a factor used to arrive at a choice or solution which ends uncertainty. <em>See generally Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>585, 813 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While this definition of a \u201cdeciding factor\u201d may meet the standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, it does not meet the clear and convincing standard of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Clear and convincing evidence produces in the fact finder \u201ca firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is ... more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\"><em>Fred C. Walker Agency, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>215 Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975) (citation omitted). Dr. Evans\u2019 term \u201cdeciding factor\u201d begs the question: Was it, or was it not, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>direct and proximate cause? Was claimant\u2019s work simply one of multiple factors relating to CTS causation? If so, was her work the proximate cause, a direct cause or a factor whose weight cannot be quantified? On the record, we simply have no means of ascertaining what Dr. Evans meant when he characterized claimant\u2019s work as a \u201cdeciding factor\u201d in \u201cthese\u201d kinds of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">As such, I do not find Dr. Evans\u2019 note rises to the level of clear and convincing evidence sufficient to provide a fact finder with a firm belief that claimant\u2019s CTS was directly and proximately caused by her employment and, therefore, it does not, by itself, satisfy the first prong as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Bhatti\u2019s written response as to causation meets the clear and convincing standard. Dr. Bhatti wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Her carpal tunnel syndrome is most probably secondary to cumulative effect of several years duration involving repetitive lifting, rotating, bending, and use of wrists, regardless of weight, which <em>may </em>be caused by work done as is required by a cook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">(Emphasis added). Dr. Bhatti <em>did not </em>opine that claimant\u2019s work \u201cmost probably\u201d caused her CTS. To the contrary, he plainly says claimant\u2019s CTS <em>\u201cmay </em>be caused by work.\u201d \u201cMay\u201d means to \u201cbe <em>in some degree </em>likely.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1396 (emphasis added). By definition, Dr. Bhatti\u2019s inability to quantify causation by using the term \u201cmay\u201d cannot rise to the standard of proof by clear and convincing evidence as a matter of law. Consequently, his letter of November 22, 2000, does not meet the standard of clear and convincing evidence to prove the first prong under Code \u00a7 65.2-401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The only evidence in the record that claimant\u2019s employment caused her condition is her own assertion that Dr. Bhatti told her that her work may have caused her CTS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">Q. Just as clarification, Ms. Miller, did Dr. Bhatti, in your conversations and your understanding of your conversations with him, indicate that your work <em>may </em>have been caused by carpal tunnel or was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Q. ... caused by carpal\u2014I mean, excuse me, your work caused carpal tunnel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">A. Well, me and him talked about it and I was telling him about what I did at work and the lifting and the pulling and he said that it was caused by the work, by the lifting and the tugging all day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">While the commission may rely on the testimony of the claimant to establish causation, <em>see Dollar Gen\u2019l Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1996), the claimant\u2019s assertion in this case does not provide clear and convincing evidence of causation. \u201c[A] bare assertion ... does not meet the \u2018clear and convincing standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lanning, </em>37 Va.App. at 708, 561 S.E.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Unlike the claimant in <em>Cridlin, </em>who testified as to how she was injured while performing her job tasks when the medical evidence on causation was inconclusive, claimant did not testify in the case at bar to explain the cause and effect of her work environment on her CTS. Instead, claimant testified as to the medical opinion of her physician, an opinion that was not verified by the physician. While I recognize the commission\u2019s role of assigning credibility and weight to the evidence, claimant\u2019s hearsay rendition of the physician\u2019s opinion cannot be bootstrapped into proof of medical causation when the physician\u2019s own opinion fails to make the causal link. In short, I find no support for the proposition that the nonconclusory medical opinions of the physicians can be rehabilitated to rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence in this case by using claimant\u2019s self-serving version of what the physician\u2019s opinion should have been in order to meet the statutory burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The commission was cognizant of this lack of clear and convincing evidence, but nonetheless assumed a connection. It appears to have based the decision to award benefits on the fact that employer did not present any evidence as to other possible causes of claimant\u2019s CTS. It allowed the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>evidence as to other causes (the second prong), an evidentiaryburden it placed on the employer, to amount to <em>de facto </em>evidence adequate to satisfy claimant\u2019s requisite first prong of proof. The deputy commissioner was fairly candid in making that leap:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">[N]o medical opinion has been offered to help us determine whether or not claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome resulted from her employment with this employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">[W]e have reservations that the evidence meets the clear and convincing standard and not a mere probability as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-401; however, as the record does not indicate any non-work related cause of claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome ... we will resolve all our doubts in claimant\u2019s favor and conclude that she has contracted bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as a consequence of her employment with this employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">While not \u00e1s directly, the full commission adopts a similar approach, although without the deputy commissioner\u2019s degree of candor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">There is simply no statutory or other authority to hold that the employer\u2019s failure to present evidence to disprove the second prong is somehow morphed into evidence sufficient to meet claimant\u2019s burden as to the first prong. It was error for the commission to accord proof of the first prong, an independent statutory element of proof, by implication from lack of counter-evidence associated with the second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">In <em>Lindenfeld v. Richmond Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>25 Va.App. 775, 492 S.E.2d 506 (1997), we affirmed the decision of the commission to deny benefits to a claimant who suffered from tuberculosis, which he alleged he had contracted while working at the City of Richmond Jail because (1) no one in his family or close set of friends had tested positive for the disease and (2) the incidence of tuberculosis is greater among prison inmates than it is in the general population. The record contained the opinions of three physicians regarding the causation of the claimant\u2019s disease, one of which was an opinion \u201cto a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>able degree of medical certainty that [the] claimant contracted tuberculosis while working in the jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781, 492 S.E.2d at 509.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We held the claimant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his employment in the jail caused his tuberculosis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">Although claimant established that his risk of TB infection at the jail was greater than in the general public and he eliminated some possible sources of infection from outside of his employment (which is the second element of a claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-401), these facts alone do not compel the conclusion that he inhaled the TB bacteria while working in the jail. Instead, these facts merely show through an incomplete process of elimination that claimant may have contracted tuberculosis while at work. To hold that this method of proof constitutes clear and convincing evidence as a matter of law of a causal link between employment and a disease ... would effectively shift the burden <em>to the employer </em>to prove that the claimant contracted his disease from a source outside of his employment. The express provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-401 assigning the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence to the employee preclude such a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 787, 492 S.E.2d at 512 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the commission\u2019s award because claimant has not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that her CTS arose out of and in the course of her employment, the first prong of proof she is required to present under Code \u00a7 65.2-401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>B. NO CAUSES OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYMENT: SECOND PRONG \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>claimant\u2019s evidence on the first prong meets the clear and convincing standard, I would hold on this record that claimant failed to prove, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that no activities outside her employment with the employer caused her CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The General Assembly has clearly mandated a claimant affirmatively prove, as an independent evidentiary condition precedent to an award, that her CTS did not result from causes outside of her employment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-401(1). In my view, the commission\u2019s decision rewrites this statutory burden. In effect, the commission held that a claimant meets the statutory burden if the employer fails to produce affirmative evidence that the claimant\u2019s CTS resulted from causes outside of the employment. Such a reading is erroneous and contrary to the plain language of the statute. <em>See Lindenfeld, </em>25 Va.App. at 787, 492 S.E.2d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The commission specifically held that claimant met her burden of proof because \u201cthe evidence did not suggest any non-work related activities that could have caused her condition.\u201d However, as Commissioner Tarr\u2019s dissent correctly noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">the Act requires the claimant prove by clear and convincing evidence that her condition did not result from causes outside her work. The claimant\u2019s affirmative burden of proof is not met if the employer fails to produce a non-work related cause of the condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The majority seems to find support for the commission\u2019s placement of the evidentiary burden and its resulting decision when it notes \u201cclaimant testified that she engaged in no hobbies or other activities outside her work which involved this type of motion.\u201d The record, however, does not support that assertion. The only evidence in the record regarding non-employment activities is the following colloquy on cross-examination of claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Q. Were you involved <em>in a lot of other things </em>outside of work at that time too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Q. Any type of hobbies outside of work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Q. Bowling, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Claimant\u2019s testimony that she had no hobbies and did not bowl does not provide proof by clear and convincing evidence that the myriad of her life activities outside her employment did not cause the CTS. Nowhere in the record does claimant, or anyone else, testify or offer evidence that she engaged in no other activities outside of her work for the employer which involved the type motion that could cause CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Under the statutory burden of proof established by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 65.2-401(1), a claimant must affirmatively produce clear and convincing evidence that her CTS did not result from causes outside of the employment. While that element of proof might be satisfied by a claimant\u2019s testimony that she engaged in insubstantial or no non-work activities with the type of repetitive motion that would cause CTS, no such evidence can be found in this record. Neither the commission nor this Court can supply or assume that evidence or, more importantly, alter the statutory burden of proof. If the General Assembly chooses to change the statutory burden of proof under Code \u00a7 65.2\u2014401(1), it has the power to do so. However, neither the commission nor this Court possesses that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">In this case, claimant failed to adduce affirmative evidence which would satisfy even a preponderance of the evidence standard, much less a clear and convincing evidence standard, as to the second prong of Code \u00a7 65.2^101(1). Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the commission to award benefits to claimant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\">.
