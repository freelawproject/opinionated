Jones (appellant) was convicted in a jury trial of three counts of embezzlement in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-111. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred (1) in admitting hearsay evidence under the \u201cbusiness record exception\u201d because the entry was not made contemporaneously with the event; and (2) in admitting this same material because it was \u201cunduly prejudicial.\u201d For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Appellant worked as a delivery man for Airborne Express. As part of his duties, appellant was responsible for the delivery of three separate shipments of American Express traveler\u2019s checks that were diverted and did not reach their intended destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">At trial, the Commonwealth, in order to trace the traveler\u2019s checks from their point of origin through the shipping process, called Pat Crosetti, Director of the American Express Traveler\u2019s Check Distribution Center in Piscataway, New Jersey. She had worked in that capacity for eight years and had been with American Express for a total of twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Crosetti supervised a staff of about fifty employees who \u201cprocess[], pick[], and pack[] orders for shipments of traveler\u2019s checks that go to banks and credit unions.\u201d Her staff retrieves the checks from the vault, fills the order, packages the checks into shipping cartons, and then \u201chand[s] them off to Airborne [Express], who distributes them the last leg of the journey to the physical locations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The \u201corder-taking unit,\u201d in Salt Lake City, is separate from Crosetti\u2019s \u201corder filling\u201d unit. The order-taking unit generates a \u201ctrust receipt,\u201d which functions as the \u201cpackaging inventory.\u201d The trust receipt is assigned a unique number. The trust receipts indicate the requested denominations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>checks, the quantity of each denomination, and the specific series of check numbers assigned to each denomination. Those specific check numbers are not used again for any other order.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The trust receipt is sent electronically overnight to the New Jersey facility and is downloaded and printed for processing. The printed trust receipt arrives at the assembly line that same morning. The order is filled using a method called \u201cpick- and-pass,\u201d in which five people work together to fill the order. With the trust receipt in hand, the first picker stands alongside a long table and picks the $20 checks as required by the trust receipt. The first picker then passes the trust receipt to the next picker who selects $50 checks and then passes the checks and the trust receipt to a third picker, who is responsible for another denomination. A picker\u2019s \u201cjob is to look at the [] checks\u201d and to \u201cmarry them up with the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">At the end of the line stands a \u201cverifier.\u201d The verifier will \u201cphysically pick up the checks and then they would look at the packing slip, the trust receipt, and verify that it is, in fact, accurate.\u201d The verifier then puts the checks into brown boxes provided by Airborne Express. The brown boxes are placed in a \u201cbig blue bag,\u201d marked with the ultimate destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The bag \u201cstays open until we\u2019re done with the work for the day, and then we seal up each blue bag.\u201d Each bag is sealed with a \u201cred bag tie\u201d that can only be opened with a wire cutter. Two copies of the trust receipt are placed inside the Airborne boxes with the traveler\u2019s checks, one \u201cfor the customer to keep for their records, and the second one [ ] to sign and return [to] American Express.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Airborne assigns each American Express order a specific \u201cair bill number.\u201d Each blue bag also has an air bill number of its own. The air bill number is not printed on the trust receipt. Like the trust receipt number, this air bill number is a \u201cunique number.\u201d At the end of the day, the \u201cblue bags\u201d are loaded into the Airborne containers. Each container is then sealed to avoid tampering or theft during transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Around 7:00 p.m. each night, Airborne dispatches a truck to American Express. The blue bags, sealed with red tags and packaged in Airborne containers, are loaded into the \u201cAirborne tractor trailer\u201d that \u201cgo[es] in the belly of the plane.\u201d The tractor trailer then is padlocked, and a seal is placed through the padlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Three traveler\u2019s checks shipments, dated August 3, 1999, September 1, 1999, and September 22, 1999, did not reach their \u201cfinal destination customer.\u201d Crosetti testified that American Express had \u201caccessed what we call the tracking on the package to determine if someone signed,\u201d and \u201cour research showed us they had, in fact, signed.\u201d The August 3, 1999 package, containing $3,350 in traveler\u2019s checks destined for the Fairfax County Credit Union, was \u201csigned by a name that was not an employee with them\u201d and was signed before the credit union\u2019s mailroom opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The two September packages were destined for a branch of Crestar Bank in Fairfax, Virginia. \u201cT. Bell,\u201d who signed for one of the September packages, was not an employee of the bank. \u201cD. Nester\u201d signed for the other September package at the exact same time that Joyce Tinder signed for a different package. Tinder, who was an employee of an unrelated business, testified she never \u201csign[ed] for and receive[d] a package that was addressed to Crestar Bank.\u201d The two September packages contained checks worth $20,375 and $13,950, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Crosetti testified as to the contents of the three packages from the information contained in the three relevant trust receipts. Appellant objected to her testimony and to the introduction of Commonwealth\u2019s exhibits 1A, 2A and 3A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trust receipts for each of the missing shipments, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ground that the exhibits only show what was ordered, not what was shipped. The objection was limited to the evidence\u2019s admissibility as proof that the items were shipped. The trial court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">A total of 1,171 of the missing American Express checks were cashed, mostly in Baltimore, Maryland. All these check numbers matched the numbers on the trust receipts for the three packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Fairfax Police Detective John Gordon interviewed appellant. Appellant admitted he was the driver for all three shipments from American Express, but \u201cstated that he had made all those deliveries as he was supposed to.\u201d He denied taking any of the packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">A. Business Record Exception<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Appellant argues on appeal that the trust receipts were not made contemporaneously with the events which they describe; therefore, he contends the trial court should have sustained his hearsay objection to the introduction of the trust receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). \u201cOn factual issues relating to the admissibility of evidence, the burden of persuasion is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Rabeiro v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 61, 64-65, 389 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1990). The party seeking to have hearsay declarations admitted \u201c \u2018must clearly show\u2019 \u201d that the evidence falls within an exception to the rule excluding hearsay. <em>Doe v. Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 472, 318 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1984) (quoting <em>Skillern &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Rosen, </em>359 S.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>298, 301 (Tex.1962)). <em>See also Atlantic Coast Realty Co. v. Robertson\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>135 Va. 247, 254, 116 S.E. 476, 478 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The trial court admitted the trust receipts under the business records exception to the general rule excluding hearsay evidence. Virginia has adopted this exception, which \u201callows introduction \u2018into evidence of verified regular [business] entries without requiring proof from the original observers or record keepers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sparks v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va. App. 279, 282, 482 S.E.2d 69, 70 (1997) (quoting <em>Neeley v. Johnson, </em>215 Va. 565, 571, 211 S.E.2d 100, 106 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The party seeking to introduce evidence under this exception must lay a foundation before such evidence can be admitted. As explained in <em>Sparks:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">If the records are kept in the normal course of business and are relied upon in the transaction of the business by the entity for which they are kept, then they have a certain guarantee of trustworthiness and reliability. <em>\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler Corp. v. Coley &amp; Petersen, Inc., </em>219 Va. 781, 792, 250 S.E.2d 765, 773 (1979); <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 456, 418 S.E.2d 343, 344 (1992). \u201cAdmission of such evidence is conditioned, therefore, on proof that the document comes from the proper custodian and that it is a record kept in the ordinary course of business made contemporaneously with the event by persons having the duty to keep a true record.\u201d <em>\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler, </em>219 Va. at 793, 250 S.E.2d at 773; <em>see also Kettler &amp; Scott, Inc. v. Earth Tech. Cos., </em>248 Va. 450, 457, 449 S.E.2d 782, 786 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 282, 482 S.E.2d at 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Appellant does not contest that American Express relied upon the trust receipts in the normal course of business nor does appellant contest Ms. Crosetti\u2019s status to authenticate the records. Appellant instead argues the documents were not created contemporaneously with the packaging of the checks, but instead were created before the packaging began. Therefore, according to appellant, the trust receipts are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>admissible for the purpose of proving the checks were in the missing packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">To determine the scope of \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d in a \u201cshop-book rule\u201d context, we must look to the rationale for this exception. Generally, \u201cthe principal rationale underlying the hearsay rule [is the questionable] ... reliability\u201d of such evidence. <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 57, 59, 441 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1994). Therefore, any exception to this rule must be based on a finding that the hearsay is reliable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZE\">The trustworthiness or reliability of the [business] records is guaranteed by the regularity of their preparation and the fact that the records are relied upon in the transaction of business by the person or entities for which they are kept. <em>See </em>Laughlin, <em>Business Entries and the Like, </em>46 Iowa L.Rev. 276, 276-77, 298 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>\u201cAutomatic\u201d Sprinkler, </em>219 Va. at 793, 250 S.E.2d at 773. <em>See also Lee v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 571, 576, 507 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1998) (\u201cBusiness records are admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule because they have a guarantee of trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cContemporaneous\u201d is defined as \u201cexisting or occurring during the same time.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>491 (1993). However, we do not look at contemporaneousness in the abstract. As this Court has said in a similar context, \u201c[i]n each case, whether the exception applies is dependent upon the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 75, 87, 396 S.E.2d 844, 851 (1990) (discussing \u201ccontemporaneity\u201d as an element of the spontaneous declaration exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 566-67, 318 S.E.2d 386, 392 (1984), the Supreme Court approved the admissibility of taxi meter recordings under the business records exception to prove the amount of money a robbery/murder victim had in his possession at the time of the crime. A bookkeeper testified \u201cto contemporaneous recordings of the meter readings ... taken in the ordinary course of business at the beginning and at the end of the day of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court found these entries were \u201ccontemporaneously made\u201d and admissible as circumstantial evidence of the amount of money in the victim\u2019s possession at the time of the robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 818 S.E.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Contemporaneousness is an indicia of reliability. \u201cThe contemporaneity requirement ... avoids the problem of memory recall associated with the lapse of time, thus making cross-examination and third party verification regarding the event and declaration feasible.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>11 Va.App. at 86-87, 396 S.E.2d at 850. <em>See also Foley v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 149, 161-62, 379 S.E.2d 915, 922 (\u201c\u2018\u201cThe requirement of contemporaneousness, or near contemporaneousness, reduces the chance of premeditated prevarication or loss of memory.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 313, 323, 508 A.2d 976, 980 (1986) (quoting D. Binder, <em>Hearsay Handbook </em>89 (2d ed.1983, Cum.Supp.1985)))), <em>aff'd on other grounds en banc, </em>9 Va.App. 175, 384 S.E.2d 813 (1989). Thus, while in <em>Simpson </em>the length of time between the initial meter reading and the final reading after the taxi was recovered by the police was unknown, the trustworthiness of the data was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Here, the trust receipts were employed to fill orders and the \u201cverifier\u201d used the trust receipts to insure the orders were accurately filled, packaged, and shipped. The receipts were offered into evidence to prove the checks were in fact shipped. The reliability and trustworthiness of the trust receipts were insured by the fact that the employees who filled the orders and the \u201cverifier\u201d who checked the shipment contemporaneously relied upon the trust receipts. The fact that the trust receipts were generated perhaps as much as a day prior to their use in the filling and shipping of the orders does not diminish the trustworthiness of the entries as proof of the shipments\u2019 contents. In the context of this case, it is irrelevant whether the trust receipts accurately reflected the order, i.e., whether the information recited in the trust receipts correctly listed the orders from the financial institutions. The only issue is whether the items shipped were in fact the items listed in the trust receipts. The receipts were offered to prove that the listed checks were packaged and shipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>pursuant to those trust receipts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given Crosetti\u2019s testimony, these records are reliable evidence and were properly admitted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">B. Undue Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Appellant also argues the trust receipts should have been excluded as they were \u201cunduly prejudicial.\u201d However, the cases he cites refer to issues of relevance or sufficiency that are not before this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The trust receipts were relevant to this case. The testimony proved these documents contained information about the packaging and shipping of the stolen traveler\u2019s checks. Crosetti testified regarding the regular business practices followed by American Express to prepare the checks for shipping using the trust receipts and for verification of receipt of those shipments. Lawrence Drayton testified regarding the procedures used by Airborne Express to deliver the shipments. Appellant told the police he \u201cdelivered\u201d the shipments containing the checks to the credit union and the bank. However, other testimony proved those deliveries were not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The trust receipts were no more \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d than any evidence presented by the Commonwealth to prosecute a defendant. <em>See Lee, 28 </em>Va.App. at 577-79, 507 S.E.2d at 632-33. The evidence was admissible under Virginia\u2019s rules of evidence, and, therefore, the trial court did not unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>prejudice appellant by allowing the jury to consider the trust receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. These exhibits were computer-generated copies of the trust receipts. American Express ships both hard copies to the customer. The customer retains one copy and mails the other back to American Express, acknowledging receipt. However, American Express never received the hard copies from these shipments. Appellant does not question the use of these computer-generated copies. <em>See Lee v. Commonwealth, 28 </em>Va.App. 571, 577, 507 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\">. Our analysis assumes, without deciding, the trust receipts were hearsay when offered to prove the traveler\u2019s checks were shipped. The Commonwealth in brief and at oral argument conceded that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. We do not suggest that a twenty-four-hour delay in the creation of a business document always meets the contemporaneous requirement. The facts of the individual case control. <em>See Simpson, </em>227 Va. at 567, 318 S.E.2d at 392.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">. Appellant may be arguing that the \"error\u201d was not harmless when the trial court allowed the evidence to come in under the business record exception. <em>See generally Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 407 S.E.2d 910 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (discussing the harmless error test in the context of a trial court\u2019s error in allowing the jury to consider inadmissible evidence). As we find no error, a harmless error analysis is not necessary here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
