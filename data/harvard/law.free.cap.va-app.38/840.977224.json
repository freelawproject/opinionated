Smith contends the juvenile and domestic relations district court and the circuit court \u201cfail[ed] to obtain subject matter jurisdiction over [him]\u201d by not making a reasonable effort to notify his father of the proceedings. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">On April 28, 2000 and September 22, 2000, the juvenile court issued petitions charging Smith with two counts of robbery and two counts of using a firearm in the commission of the robberies. At a later hearing, a judge of the juvenile court found probable cause to believe Smith was over the age of fourteen and committed the four offenses. Smith\u2019s mother received a summons and was present at the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Smith\u2019s attorney filed a motion in the circuit court to bar the Commonwealth from seeking an indictment and to dismiss the charges because of \u201cfail[ure] to obtain subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d The trial judge denied the motion. After the grand jury issued indictments on all charges, Smith received a jury trial and was convicted of all charges. This appeal followed entry of the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Prior to July 1, 1999, Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) required the juvenile court to issue summonses to \u201cthe parents\u201d of the juvenile. <em>See Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 306, 308, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>504 S.E.2d 894, 395 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>258 Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219 (1999). Effective July 1, 1999, the legislature amended Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) to provide for issuance of a summons \u201cto at least one parent.\u201d The amended portion of the statute, which is pertinent to the issues raised on this appeal, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">After a petition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the juvenile, if the juvenile is twelve or more years of age, and another to at least one parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings. The summons shall require them to appear personally before the court at the time fixed to answer or testify as to the allegations of the petition. Where the custodian is summoned and such person is not a parent of the juvenile in question, a parent shall also be served with a summons. The court may direct that other proper or necessary parties to the proceedings be notified of the pendency of the case, the charge and the time and place for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In <em>Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 552 S.E.2d 73 (2001), the Supreme Court interpreted Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) as it existed before the legislature amended the statute. Overruling one of its prior decisions, the Court held \u201cthat the statutory requirement of notice to parents was not jurisdictional but procedural in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 552 S.E.2d at 77. The <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the <em>Nelson </em>decision applies to the amended statute because the legislature neither enhanced the notice provision nor addressed subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, <em>Nelson </em>answers Smith\u2019s contention that the parental notice requirement in Code \u00a7 16.1-263 implicates \u201csubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Put simply, the notice requirement in the amended statute does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Nelson, </em>262 Va. at 284-85, 552 S.E.2d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Beyond the terminology Smith uses, the substance of Smith\u2019s claim is that Code \u00a7 16.1-263, as amended, continues to require the juvenile court to issue a summons to both parents. Smith concedes his mother received a summons and appeared at all hearings in juvenile court and circuit court. He contends, however, that the courts were required by Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) to make an attempt to locate and notify his father. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The unambiguous language in Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) provides that issuance of a summons \u201cto at least one parent\u201d is deemed to be procedurally sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement. Indeed, further language in subpart (A) of the statute reinforces this conclusion because it provides that \u201c[wjhere the custodian is summoned and such person is not <em>a </em>parent of the juvenile in question, <em>a </em>parent shall also be served with a summons.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Nothing in Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) detracts from these unambiguous provisions. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">No such summons or notification shall be required if the judge shall certify on the record that (i) the identity of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable or (ii) in cases in which it is alleged that a juvenile has committed a delinquent act, crime, status offense or traffic infraction or is in need of services or supervision, the location, or in the case of a parent or guardian located outside of the Commonwealth the location or mailing address, of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit. In cases referred to in clause (ii), an affidavit of a law-enforcement officer or juvenile probation officer that the location of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>fact, provided that there is no other evidence before the court which would refute the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">\u201c[M]indful of the general rule ... that courts should not construe statutory language which is facially unambiguous ... [, we note], however, ... our duty to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u201d <em>VEPCO v. Bd. of County Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983). Although Smith contends Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) \u201cmakes clear that the Commonwealth\u2019s duty to notify both ... parents does not end when it finds one parent,\u201d nothing in the language of this provision supports that contention. Moreover, the provision, which states that a summons may be dispensed with \u201cif the judge shall certify on the record that ... the identity of <em>a </em>parent is not reasonably ascertainable,\u201d is not inconsistent with subpart (A), which requires a summons to be issued to \u201cat least one parent.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) (emphasis added), (A). Indeed, if a juvenile is in the custody of a custodian and the mother has at some previous time executed the affidavit as specified in subpart (E), the trial judge is not required to issue a summons to the juvenile\u2019s father. Thus, the provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) that allows a judge to rely upon \u201can affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable\u201d does not require that both parents be served with a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">We hold that the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-263 were satisfied in this case because a summons was issued to Smith\u2019s mother, who appeared at each hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
