Peacock (claimant) appeals the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) rejecting his request for review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>his claim for benefits. The commission concluded that the claimant\u2019s request for review was untimely because it was not filed within twenty days of his attorney\u2019s receipt by certified mail of a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion, as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A). Claimant contends the commission erred in reaching that conclusion because Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s twenty-day limitation period for filing a request for review begins to run only when, as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A), the party, rather than the party\u2019s attorney, receives a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion by registered or certified mail. We agree with claimant and, therefore, reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand this matter to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The relevant facts and procedural posture of this case are not in dispute. On July 29, 1998, claimant filed a claim with the commission alleging that he had suffered a compensable industrial injury by accident or, alternatively, a compensable occupational disease while in the employ of Browning Ferris, Inc. (employer). On March 2, 1999, following a hearing on claimant\u2019s claim on February 4, 1999, at which claimant was represented by counsel, the deputy commissioner issued an opinion denying claimant\u2019s claim under both theories of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">That same day, the commission mailed copies of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion by certified mail to counsel of record for the parties and by regular first-class mail to the parties. Claimant\u2019s counsel received a copy of the opinion by certified mail on March 4, 1999. Having no prior knowledge of the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling, claimant received a copy of the opinion by regular first-class mail on March 6,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On March 25, 1999, claimant, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a request for review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion by the full commission. By letter dated March 31, 1999, the chief deputy commissioner rejected claimant\u2019s request for review, ruling that the commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>requested review because claimant\u2019s request for review was not filed within twenty days of his attorney\u2019s receipt by certified mail of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Represented by newly retained counsel, claimant appealed the commission\u2019s decision to this Court. We remanded the case to the commission for further factual findings and for \u201csuch disposition deemed appropriate by the commission\u201d of the issue of the timeliness of claimant\u2019s request for review. <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>Record No. 1007-99-2 (Va.Ct.App. January 27, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the deputy commissioner issued his opinion on September 27, 2000. He found that claimant\u2019s attorney received a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion by certified mail on March 4, 1999 and that claimant received a copy of that opinion by first-class mail on March 6, 1999. Relying on the commission\u2019s holding in <em>Clay v. Ogden Allied Building Services, </em>75 O.W.C. 83 (1996), that the sending of a copy of the opinion by certified mail solely to a party\u2019s counsel of record satisfies Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)\u2019s requirement that a copy of the opinion be sent by registered or certified mail to the \u201cparties at issue,\u201d the deputy commissioner concluded that Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s twenty-day limitation period for claimant to file a request for review commenced when his counsel received a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion by certified mail on March 4, 1999. Thus, the deputy commissioner determined that claimant\u2019s request for review filed on March 25, 1999 was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On October 2, 2000, claimant requested review by the commission of the deputy commissioner\u2019s September 27, 2000 opinion. On June 14, 2001, the commission issued an opinion affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Citing <em>Clay, </em>the commission held that receipt by claimant\u2019s attorney of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion on March 4, 1999, triggered the running of Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s twenty-day limitation period. Although one commissioner believed that the commission was required under Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) to send copies of its opinions by registered or certified mail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the parties themselves, the majority of the commission concluded that, because Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-704(A) and 65.2-705(A) and Rule 3.1 of the Rules of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made no specific reference to \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cindividual\u201d parties, sending the opinion by certified mail solely to claimant\u2019s counsel of record satisfied Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)\u2019s mandate that the commission\u2019s opinions be sent \u201cto the parties at issue by registered or certified mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The commission reasoned that the receipt of the copy of the opinion by claimant\u2019s attorney constituted receipt by claimant because, under the principles of agency, the acts and omissions of a party\u2019s attorney are imputed to the party and the party is bound by them. \u201cThus,\u201d the commission noted, \u201cthe required certified or registered copies are sent to a single representative of each party, in most cases an attorney, although <em>courtesy </em>copies are also provided to the individual or \u2018private\u2019 parties .... \u201d \u201cTo hold otherwise,\u201d the commission stated, \u201cwould ... impose an impracticable burden on the Commission, and subject the individual parties to unnecessary states of limbo even after the claim was decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: The Commission or any of its members or deputies shall hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses; shall decide the issues in a summary manner; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>shall make an award or opinion carrying out the decision. A copy of the award or opinion shall be sent immediately to the parties at issue by registered or certified mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">If an application for review is made to the Commission within twenty days after receipt of notice of such award to be sent as provided in subsection A of \u00a7 65.2-704, the full Commission ... shall review the evidence or, if deemed advisable, as soon as practicable, hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">It is well-established that, absent an allegation of fraud or duress, the full commission has no jurisdiction to review an award or opinion if the request for review of that award or opinion was filed with the commission beyond the twenty-day limitation period set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) for seeking review of an award or opinion. <em>McCarthy Elec. Co. v. Foster, </em>17 Va.App. 344, 345, 437 S.E.2d 246, 247 (1993). Claimant did not allege fraud or mistake. Thus, the dispositive question in this case is whether, as the commission concluded, Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s twenty-day limitation period began to run on March 4, 1999, when claimant\u2019s attorney of record received a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion by certified mail. If so, claimant\u2019s request for review filed March 25, 1999 was untimely and the commission had no jurisdiction to review the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The parties agree that, because Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) provides that the twenty-day limitation period for filing a request for review begins to run upon receipt of notice of an award or opinion \u201csent as provided in subsection A of \u00a7 65.2-704,\u201d and because Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) requires that a copy of the award or opinion be sent \u201cto the parties at issue by registered or certified mail,\u201d resolution of the question of when the limitation period began to run in this case turns on the construction of the term \u201cthe parties at issue\u201d as used in the directive set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Claimant contends the plain language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-704(A) and 65.2-705(A) indicates the legislature intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the limitation period start to run only when the party, rather than the party\u2019s counsel, receives a copy of the award or opinion by registered or certified mail. Thus, claimant argues, Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s limitation period never commenced with respect to his request for review filed March 25, 1999, because the commission failed to send him a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion by registered or certified mail. Hence, he concludes, because the running of the limitation period was never triggered, his request for review was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In response, employer contends the legislature intended that the term \u201cthe parties at issue\u201d be construed to include the parties\u2019 counsel of record. Such was the \u201csensible\u201d construction the commission applied in <em>Clay </em>in 1996, employer argues, and, because the legislature has knowingly acquiesced in that construction ever since, it is entitled to great weight. Hence, employer concludes, the twenty-day limitation period began to run when claimant\u2019s attorney of record received a copy of the opinion by certified mail on March 4, 1999, and claimant\u2019s request for review filed on March 25, 1999 was untimely. We disagree with employer\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">While we generally give great weight and deference, on appeal, to the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we are \u201cnot bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u201d <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184,189 n. 1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n. 1 (1998). Indeed, we will withhold the deference we normally accord the commission\u2019s statutory interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when the commission\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the statute. <em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals and Energy v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990). \u201cWe are required to construe the law as it is written. \u2018An erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hurt v. Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, 142 (1981)). We \u201care not authorized to amend, alter or extend the [Work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ers\u2019 Compensation] Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning.\u201d <em>Cross v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., 21 </em>Va.App. 530, 533, 465 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">We are further mindful that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[u]nder basic rules of statutory construction, we examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases. <em>Earley v. Landsidle, </em>257 Va. 365, 369, 514 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1999); <em>Ragan v. Woodcroft Village Apartments, </em>255 Va. 322, 325, 497 S.E.2d 740, 742 (1998); <em>Buonocore v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>254 Va. 469, 472-73, 492 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1997). When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. <em>Earley, </em>257 Va. at 370, 514 S.E.2d at 155; <em>Ragan, </em>255 Va. at 326, 497 S.E.2d at 742; <em>Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. v. Featherstone Assoc., </em>253 Va. 364, 368, 484 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1997). We must determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words appearing in the statute, unless a literal construction of the statute would yield an absurd result. <em>Earley, </em>257 Va. at 369, 514 S.E.2d at 155; <em>Ragan, </em>255 Va. at 325-26, 497 S.E.2d at 742; <em>Abbott v. Willey, </em>253 Va. 88, 91, 479 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001). Furthermore, \u201c[w]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., </em>243 Va. 149, 152-53, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Applying these principles, we hold that the commission\u2019s construction of the term \u201cthe parties at issue\u201d in the second sentence of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) is unfounded. The language of both Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) and Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) is clear and unambiguous. The first sentence of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the commission \u201cshall hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses.\u201d The second sentence of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) reads, \u201cA copy of the award or opinion shall be sent immediately to the parties at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>issue by registered or certified mail.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that, if a request for review is timely filed, the full commission shall \u201chear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses\u201d and, upon reaching a decision, immediately send a copy of the award \u201cto the parties at issue.\u201d This language draws a clear distinction between \u201cthe parties at issue\u201d and \u201ctheir representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Had the legislature intended that the sending of a copy of an opinion or award to the party\u2019s attorney of record be considered the equivalent of sending a copy to the party, the legislature could have so indicated, but it did not. Indeed, in specifically providing in Code \u00a7 65.2-715 that the commission must provide copies of its opinions to the parties and to their counsel, the legislature has indicated otherwise. Code \u00a7 65.2-715 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Whenever, in the course of proceedings in connection with awards, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission issues any written notice, opinion, order or award regarding a specific case, the Commission shall provide copies to the employee, the employer and the compensation carrier, and, if represented, their counsel, at the same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">This statute reinforces the notion that, for purposes of notice, the legislature intended to treat the parties and their counsel as separate entities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We conclude, therefore, that Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) means what it plainly says, namely, that a copy of the award or opinion must be sent by registered or certified mail to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>parties themselves. Such a literal construction does not yield an absurd result. Conversely, affirming the contrary statutory construction employed by the commission, and sought by employer, would require us to extend the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning and to hold that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed. If such a change is to be made, it is for the legislature to undertake, not us. Thus, the sending of a copy of an opinion by certified mail solely to a party\u2019s attorney of record, as occurred in this case, does not satisfy Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)\u2019s mandate that \u201c[a] copy of the award or opinion ... be sent ... to the parties at issue by registered or certified mail,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">As for employer\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)\u2019s mailing requirement in <em>Clay </em>is entitled to great weight because the legislature has acquiesced in that construction for over five years, we find that such a claim is without merit. While it is true, generally, that the \u201clegislature is presumed to be cognizant of an agency\u2019s construction of its statute and when such construction continues without alteration, it is presumed that the legislature has acquiesced therein,\u201d <em>Hudock v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Va.App. 474, 480, 340 S.E.2d 168, 172 (1986), here no such presumptions attach because the commission\u2019s construction in <em>Clay </em>of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)\u2019s mailing requirement was merely dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In <em>Clay, </em>the commission reviewed the deputy commissioner\u2019s suspension of a claimant\u2019s compensation benefits due to the claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate with the job placement services provided by the employer. Upon review, the commission set forth in its opinion the circumstances related to the claimant\u2019s noncompliance and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">We agree with the findings of the Deputy Commissioner that the claimant has failed to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation and job placement services provided by the employer pursuant to Va.Code Ann. Sec. 65.2-603. Accordingly, the August 11, 1995 Opinion suspending payment of compensation under the Commission\u2019s open Award is AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The commission also included in its opinion in <em>Clay </em>a lengthy, unrelated paragraph commencing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">The claimant in her petition for review raised other matters not argued in her written statement, which we therefore consider waived. For the record, however, we find no error in the findings and rulings of the Deputy Commissioner on these issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">(Citations omitted.) Following analyses of several such issues, the paragraph concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">Finally, the claimant by counsel argues that the Deputy Commissioner erred by not sending a copy of the opinion to the claimant. Assuming arguendo this is true, Va.Code Ann. Sec. 65.2-704 directs that \u201c[a] copy of the award shall be sent immediately to the parties at issue.\u201d The copy sent to both counsel satisfied the Commission\u2019s obligation under that Section. Moreover, any such error was clearly harmless, which is demonstrated by the timely application for review that was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The commission\u2019s opinion is void of any facts related to this discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In light of the commission\u2019s statements in <em>Clay </em>that it considered the issue \u201cwaived\u201d and that \u201cany such error\u201d arising from the commission\u2019s alleged failure to send a copy of the opinion to claimant \u201cwas clearly harmless\u201d because a \u201ctimely application for review [had been] filed,\u201d we conclude that the commission\u2019s declaration that a \u201ccopy [of the opinion] sent to both counsel satisfied the Commission\u2019s obligation under [Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A)]\u201d was no more than dicta. Furthermore, we have found, and employer has cited, no opinion, prior to the instant case, in which the commission relied on the language in <em>Clay </em>regarding Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A). We conclude, therefore, that no presumption that the legislature was cognizant of the commission\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A) in <em>Clay </em>or that the legislature acquiesced in that construction arises in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">For these reasons, we hold that Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s twenty-day limitation period for requesting review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>an award or opinion of the commission begins to run when the party, rather than the party\u2019s attorney of record, receives a copy of the award or opinion by registered or certified mail. Thus, because claimant never received a copy of the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion by registered or certified mail, as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-704(A), Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s limitation period never began to run with respect to his request for review filed March 25,1999. Hence, claimant\u2019s request for review was timely, and the full commission had jurisdiction to review the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision rejecting claimant\u2019s request for review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s March 2, 1999 opinion and remand this matter to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">. Although not before us on appeal, we observe that, in apparent contrast to Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A)\u2019s requirement that the commission review an award or opinion if \"an application for review is made to the Commission within twenty days <em>after receipt </em>of notice of such award\u201d or opinion. Rule 3.1 of the Rules of the Workers' Compensation Commission provides that a \u201crequest for review of a decision or award of the Commission shall be filed by a party in writing with the Clerk of the Commission within 20 days <em>of the date </em>of such decision or award.\u201d (Emphases added.) Where a rule of the commission conflicts with a statute, the statute must prevail. <em>See Brown v. United Airlines, </em>34 Va.App. 273, 276, 540 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2001) (noting that the commission has no power to make rules that are inconsistent with the Workers' Compensation Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">.
