On appeal, father contends the court erroneously (1) found a material change in circumstances had occurred since a recently preceding custody/visitation order, and (2) concluded the proposed move was in the child\u2019s best interests, without proper consideration of the attendant statutory factors and related evidence. Finding the decision of the trial court plainly wrong and without the requisite support in the evidence, we reverse the disputed order and remand the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The pertinent facts are substantially uncontroverted. Father and mother were married July 23, 1994, and one child, Kylie, was born to the union on July 13, 1998, following final separation of the parties. By subsequent \u201cProperty Settlement Agreement,\u201d mother and father agreed to share \u201cjoint custody\u201d of Kylie, with \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d in mother, subject to extensive specified visitation in father and \u201cconsultation] with father on major issues involving Kylie\u2019s ... welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement was later \u201caffirmed, ratified and incorporated\u201d into the final decree of divorce between the parties, entered by the trial court on May 24,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">On January 9, 2001, father lodged a \u201cPetition to Modify Parenting Time, and to Clarify Joint Custody Arrangement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>with the trial court, praying the court, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201cexpand\u201d his time with Kylie as a result of \u201ca number of changed circumstances,\u201d including his remarriage and new residence situated only several miles from Kylie\u2019s home, and the child\u2019s age and \u201cexpressed interest\u201d \u201cin spending more time with her father.\u201d A related hearing was conducted June 20, 2001, and, by order entered June 29, 2001, the court granted the requested relief, significantly increasing father\u2019s visitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On September 16, 2001, within three months of the order enlarging father\u2019s visitation, mother advised father of her impending marriage to Steven Jones and intention to accompany him, with Kylie, to the situs of Jones\u2019 recent employment in Summerville, South Carolina, approximately five hundred miles distant. In anticipation of related issues pertaining to father\u2019s visitation with Kylie, mother proposed a revised schedule, which provided father extended but less frequent contacts with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Father objected to mother\u2019s plans and immediately petitioned the trial court to enjoin the move and award him custody of Kylie or, should the court allow the relocation, order \u201csubstantial monthly, holiday and vacation visitation\u201d with father. The court awarded father a \u201cTemporary Restraining Order\u201d pending a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The court subsequently conducted <em>ore tenus </em>hearings addressing father\u2019s petition as well as the merits of mother\u2019s relocation plans. Testifying at the proceedings, mother described Kylie as \u201ca very happy, well-adjusted child,\u201d and acknowledged the \u201cimportance] for [her] to maintain her relationship with ... father.\u201d Mother emphasized her role as Kylie\u2019s \u201cprimary caregiver\u201d since birth and, as a result of recent unemployment, her plans to be a \u201cstay-at-home mother.\u201d She described Summerville as \u201ca nice suburb[,] kind of like Alexandria only not built up,\u201d with \u201cwonderful amenities,\u201d including \u201ca recreation center,\u201d \u201cpools,\u201d \u201ctennis courts,\u201d \u201cbike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>trails,\u201d \u201cwalking trails\u201d and \u201ca [nearby] YMCA.\u201d Although the adequacy of mother\u2019s present home and furnishings is not in issue, the proposed residence is more spacious and located adjacent to a \u201cplayground ... for [the] community.\u201d Mother\u2019s proposed visitation schedule between father and Kylie included an offer to share a portion of the related transportation costs. However, mother expressed a willingness to \u201cdo whatever is in Kylie\u2019s best interest,\u201d including \u201cstaying ... in Northern Virginia,\u201d \u201c[i]f [she] has to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Steven Jones, mother\u2019s husband at the time of the hearings, had recently accepted civilian employment in South Carolina with the Navy, performing \u201clandscape architecture\u201d and \u201cbase facility planning.\u201d Jones acknowledged his \u201cprime motivation\u201d for pursuing the move was to locate nearer the South Carolina residence of his eight-year-old son from a prior marriage, thereby affording him \u201cmore involve[ment]\u201d in the child\u2019s life. Jones could \u201ctransfer\u201d his job site after April 2002, and had already inquired into \u201cpositions in [the northern Virginia] area.\u201d A \u201cRehabilitation Counselor\u201d conversant with Jones\u2019 \u201cbackground, ... experience and salary\u201d researched the employment in the Washington, D.C. market and found comparable job opportunities available to him in the area. Asked if he planned a return to Virginia should the court not permit relocation of Kylie, Jones answered he and mother \u201cwould work it out\u201d and \u201cdo what was necessary ... to remain a blended family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Mother presented the testimony of Dr. Joseph Hawley, a licensed clinical psychologist. Dr. Hawley testified \u201cit would be optimum to have more frequent visitation\u201d between Kylie and her father, but noted \u201ca longer period of time\u201d during each visit \u201ccould offset that some.\u201d He cautioned that changes in the visitation schedule \u201ccould have a negative effect on the child\u201d because \u201cchildren like to have predictability,\u201d \u201cstability\u201d and \u201cconsistency.\u201d However, \u201cadaptation\u201d to the \u201cuse [of] the telephone\u201d or \u201cvideo conferencing\u201d would allow Kylie to \u201cstay in touch with her father.\u201d While he \u201cwould want more frequent contact\u201d between the father and daughter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Dr. Hawley opined, \u201clife isn\u2019t always the best of all possible worlds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Father described his relationship with Kylie following the increased visitation resulting from the prior order as \u201cbetter\u201d \u201cin so many ways,\u201d \u201cmore relaxed,\u201d \u201cnot as hurried.\u201d He testified that Kylie had \u201cresponded] to the routine\u201d and \u201chas an expectation of normalcy.\u201d Exercising \u201c[e]ntirely\u201d the increased access to the child afforded by the June order, father and Kylie had visited \u201cinternational children\u2019s festivals,\u201d \u201cthe Children\u2019s Museum in Baltimore,\u201d \u201cthe Children\u2019s Museum in D.C.,\u201d \u201cthe Museum of Natural History,\u201d \u201cpuppet performances,\u201d the \u201czoo,\u201d and \u201cthe circus,\u201d \u201ca wide range of things.\u201d Father was concerned that removing Kylie from her lifetime residence in Virginia to South Carolina would exclude him from \u201cballet lessons,\u201d \u201csports,\u201d \u201cGymboree,\u201d \u201cschool plays,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll of that,\u201d and deprive her of significant \u201ccultural\u201d opportunities available in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Father presented the expert testimony of Dr. William Zuckerman, also a licensed clinical psychologist familiar with the instant circumstances. Dr. Zuckerman described mother\u2019s visitation proposal as \u201cnot optimal.\u201d Noting the child had developed \u201csecure attachments\u201d \u201cwith both of her parents,\u201d a relationship \u201crelated to the amount of time a child spends with a parent,\u201d Dr. Zuckerman opined that relocation would \u201coccur at the expense of the attachment [she] has with the father,\u201d creating \u201ca loss in terms of security and attachment.\u201d He concluded the child was better served by existing \u201cregular[ ]\u201d and \u201cfrequen[t]\u201d contacts with father, than infrequent contacts of longer duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Cheryl Weitz, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, interviewed father and Kylie and prepared a \u201cparent/child assessment.\u201d Weitz described father as a \u201chighly motivated\u201d parent, \u201cavailable\u201d to Kylie \u201cemotionally ... [and] for the whole range of parenting activities.\u201d Weitz testified that the June order, increasing the frequency of contact between father and Kylie, had brought a \u201cdefinite[ ] improvement in the relationship,\u201d an \u201cattachment relationship,\u201d between the two. Kylie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>\u201cwas initiating more\u201d with father, \u201cleaning on him,\u201d sharing increased \u201ceye contact\u201d and \u201cmuch more relaxed\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court, acknowledging the \u201cburden of proof\u2019 on mother \u201cto prove ... the move ... in the best interest of the child,\u201d commented that mother must follow her husband or suffer an \u201cunnatural\u201d separation, with attendant costs and inconvenience. Thus, the court found mother without an \u201coption[ ]\u201d and reasoned either custody must change or Kylie relocate with mother to South Carolina. Addressing those factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 20-124.8, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">[TJhere is no question ... that both parents are fit, ... have an attachment to the child, [and] ... are prepared to cope -with their child\u2019s changing needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">What the mother has offered ... is generous and considerate, and it shows ... she appreciated the bond that already existed between [the father] and the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">sjs j{c :*\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">I believe that her plan along with modern technology, to some extent, will in fact preserve the relationship between the father and the child in this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-10\">:{\u00ed #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">[T]here will be benefits from her going to South Carolina. The benefits being that she is going to be a stay at home mother. I think there is a certain tranquility of family life that she is describing that will take place in South Carolina that might not be here, by virtue of the frantic pace that we all lead our lives here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-12\">s\u00a1\u00ed \u00ed\u00a1: sj\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-13\">So at this stage I am accepting, allowing the mother to move provided that she follows through on the plan that she has put forth for maintaining the relationship between the child and the father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The court memorialized the ruling by order entered November 30, 2001, which included a substantially revised visitation schedule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and father appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">II. <em>RELOCATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">A trial court may, \u201cfrom time to time ..., revise and alter [a] decree concerning the care, custody and maintenance of ... children and make a new decree concerning the same, as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>Bostick v. BostickBennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 534-35, 478 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1996). In determining whether \u201cto modify a decree denying a custodial parent permission to remove the child from the state, the court must find (1) a material change of circumstance since the [prior] decree; and (2) that relocation would be in the child\u2019s best interests. In accordance with our prior decisions, the moving party bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">A. <em>CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Father first contends the trial court erroneously found \u201ca material change in circumstances\u201d between the court\u2019s prior visitation order, entered June 29, 2001, and the instant proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">\u201c \u2018Changed circumstances\u2019 is a broad concept and incorporates a broad range of positive and negative developments in the lives of the children.\u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>26 Va.App. 566, 573, 496 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999). \u201cWhether a change in circumstances exists is a factual finding that will not be disturbed on appeal if the finding is supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Ohlen v. Shively, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>16 Va.App. 419, 423, 430 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1993) (citation omitted). \u201cIn the absence of a material change in circumstances, reconsideration ... would be barred by principles of <em>res judicata.\u201d Hiner v. Hadeed, </em>15 Va.App. 575, 580, 425 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Here, the evidence established that, following the June 29, 2001 order, mother, the parent in physical custody of Kylie, had become engaged, anticipated marriage within a month and planned to relocate with her husband to South Carolina. Accordingly, the record supports the finding of a material change in circumstances sufficient to warrant further consideration and determination of the child\u2019s best interests with respect to the proposed relocation and companion issues of custody and visitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">B. <em>BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Father next contends the trial court erroneously concluded that the proposed relocation to South Carolina would promote the best interests of Kylie. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">\u201cA court may forbid a custodial parent from removing a child from the state without the court\u2019s permission, or it may permit the child to be removed from the state.\u201d <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. 571, 573, 347 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986) (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n a court\u2019s decision as to the propriety of relocating the children ..., \u2018the welfare of the children is of primary and paramount importance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parish, </em>26 Va.App. at 572, 496 S.E.2d at 94 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">\u201cThe court may consider a benefit to the parent from relocation only if the move independently benefits the [child].\u201d Accordingly, \u201c[i]f the trial court finds that relocation is not in the \u2018best interests of the child,\u2019 the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>must deny the relocation request. If maintaining the <em>status quo </em>is in the \u2018best interests of the child,\u2019 the court shall deny any requests to change custody and order that the <em>status quo </em>be maintained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>Goodhand v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 599-600, 560 S.E.2d 463, 466-67 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We have previously recognized that \u201c[t]he added difficulty in maintaining the parental relationship is not unique\u201d but \u201ccommon to all parents whose children live some distance away.\u201d <em>Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. at 574, 347 S.E.2d at 151. Thus, such circumstance \u201cshould not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent\u2019s residence <em>except </em>where the benefits of the relationship cannot be substantially maintained if the child is moved away from the non-custodial parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The \u201cbeneficial relationship between the child and [parent]\u201d must not be \u201cplaced at risk\u201d to disadvantage the child. <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 534, 478 S.E.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">\u201cIn reaching a decision on the \u2018best interests of the child,\u2019 the court is guided by Code \u00a7 20-124.3,\u201d which specifies a myriad of factors appropriate to the issues of custody and visitation. <em>Cloutier v. Queen, </em>35 Va.App. 413, 427, 545 S.E.2d 574, 581 (2001). However, \u201c[a]s long as the trial court examines the factors, it is not \u2018required to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 702, 460 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1995) (citation omitted). The trial court\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests \u201cis a matter of discretion ..., and, unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, the court\u2019s decree must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 533, 478 S.E.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Here, although mother enjoys physical custody and care of Kylie, father, an exceptionally committed and attentive noncustodial parent, has established and maintained an \u201cattachment\u201d or \u201cbond\u201d with Kylie, which has demonstrably benefited the child. The value of such relationship was recognized and enhanced by the trial court through expanded visitation be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tween the two within months of the instant proceedings, clearly promoting the child\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Accordingly, the expert witnesses agreed that more frequent visitation between father and Kylie was preferable to reduced contacts, albeit for longer periods of time. While Dr. Hawley suggested father might compensate for the loss of \u201cface-to-face contact\u201d with Kylie through technological \u201cadaptation,\u201d he acknowledged such options are \u201cnot as optimal as personal contact.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Zuckerman testified \u201cphone contact\u201d and \u201cvideo cameras\u201d may \u201cmake a positive contribution\u201d to the father-daughter relationship, but are \u201cnot quite the same\u201d and do not \u201ctake the place of ... having somebody ... feed you,\u201d \u201chold you,\u201d \u201cput you to bed,\u201d \u201cplay with you,\u201d and \u201cmake faces at you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Significantly, the proposed relocation was prompted solely by mother\u2019s marriage to Jones and his desire to pursue employment and residence in South Carolina to be nearer his child by a prior marriage, not the unavailability of like economic opportunity in northern Virginia. Similarly, mother\u2019s decision to remain unemployed and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d with Kylie is not precluded by continued residency in Virginia. Thus, both mother and Jones indicated that the relocation plans would yield to an adverse decision by the trial court, thereby preserving the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Accordingly, the evidence clearly established that the proposed relocation reflected the preferences of mother and Jones, not necessitous or other compelling circumstances. While advantages accruing to a custodial parent from relocation oftentimes inure to the benefit of a child and merit consideration by the court, such advantages must be weighed against any deleterious effects, including an adverse impact upon the relationship between the child and non-custodial parent. The instant record demonstrates few, if any, benefits to Kylie, a very young child, from relocation hundreds of miles from her father. To the contrary, the evidence clearly establishes that the move would disrupt the positive involvement and influence of father in Kylie\u2019s life, a result at odds with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>best interests. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the decision to disturb the \u201cstatus quo\u201d was plainly wrong and unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">III. <em>ATTORNEY FEES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Both parties requested an award of those costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incident to appeal. <em>See O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). Upon a review of the record, we find the litigation addressed appropriate and substantial issues and neither mother nor father generated unnecessary delay or expense in pursuit of them respective interests. We, therefore, deny each award of attorney\u2019s fees from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-10\">. The parties further agreed that \"the welfare and best interests of [Kylie] are their paramount consideration,\u201d and both covenanted to \"make every effort to promote the relationship between Kylie and the other party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. The expanded visitation included alternating weekends, alternating Thursday evenings, extended periods during holidays and each summer, and an additional \"uninterrupted week\u201d each year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">. Post-relocation visitation with father included one weekend each month and an optional additional weekend, conditioned upon transportation at his expense and advance notice to mother, extended holiday and summer visits, together with an additional week annually and a further week, with three months notice to mother and payment of transportation costs by father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\">. Moreover, \"whenever the evidence suggests ... that the relocation of the custodial parent may not be in the child's best interests, the relocation of the custodial parent constitutes a material change in circumstances.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Gentry, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 322, 443 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
