On appeal, he contends the conviction followed an earlier conviction for driving on a suspended license arising from the \u201csame act\u201d and, therefore, was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294. We disagree and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The pertinent facts are uncontroverted. On March 5, 2000, Norfolk Police Officer R.N. Johnson observed a vehicle being operated in the city without a valid state inspection decal. Stopped by Johnson, the driver, defendant, produced an \u201cID card\u201d and \u201cstated his license was suspended.\u201d Because police computers \u201cwere down at the time,\u201d Johnson issued defendant a summons for \u201cdriving on a suspended license,\u201d \u201cbased on [his] statement.\u201d On May 1, 2000, defendant appeared before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the Norfolk General District Court (district court), entered a plea of guilty to the offense, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to a 90-day suspended jail sentence, together with a f\u00edne and further suspension of his operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Following trial and conviction in the district court, Johnson learned defendant was adjudicated an habitual offender prior to the traffic stop and, moreover, had been previously convicted of operating a vehicle in violation of such order. Accordingly, Johnson immediately secured a warrant charging defendant with the instant offense, a felony, and defendant was subsequently indicted in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On July 25, 2000, defendant appeared for trial on the indictment and entered a plea of guilty upon arraignment. During the attendant colloquy, the court inquired of defendant if he and his counsel had \u201ctalked about this charge and what the Commonwealth must prove before [he] could be found guilty?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cYes, we have,\u201d adding that \u201cone thing ... caused a problem\u201d for him. Asked by the court, &lt;cWhat\u2019s that?,\u201d defendant disclosed the earlier prosecution and conviction in the district court for driving on a suspended license and explained he \u201cthought the case was done with\u201d until a \u201cfew days later the police officer come [sic] to [his] house with another warrant for the ... same arrest date with a greater charge,\u201d a procedure defendant \u201cthought ... to be unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Defendant\u2019s comments prompted further inquiry by the court and the following exchange among defendant, his counsel, the Commonwealth, and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: ... He essentially has a double jeopardy problem that I thought had been ironed out. I told him that if he has a problem like that about a legal technical point that maybe what he should do is plead not guilty and then we could address the Court on that because he says that he\u2019s guilty of the driving and that he wants to take responsibility for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: ... [Defendant] is confused.... [H]e was never tried for this offense, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t feel confused at all, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">$ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">THE COURT: ... [I]f there\u2019s any question about it, I take it a presentence report is going to be requested here? ... Any question you can get a copy of the misdemeanor summons. If it turns out he was in fact tried on it, then that\u2019s the end of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019ll stipulate on the record if that\u2019s the case, the Commonwealth will be joining in [a] defense motion as we\u2019re not going to try somebody twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Upon additional questioning of defendant, the court accepted his guilty plea, finding the \u201cplea ... has been made freely, intelligently with an understanding of the charge and consequences ____\u201d Without objection, the Commonwealth then summarized the evidence, the court found defendant guilty of the offense and ordered a pre-sentence report, scheduling sentencing for September 19, 2000. Before concluding the proceedings, however, the court admonished defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM7\">I suppose a motion for double jeopardy is a defense motion, not a prosecution motion, so I will leave it up to you to try to determine whether he was tried on the misdemeanor on this very offense and was convicted of it.... You will have to take the initiative on that one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Accordingly, on August 30, 2000, defendant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, alleging \u201cdefendant was found guilty in the [district court] of driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license for the same factual circumstances and events for which he is charged with driving as a[n] habitual offender\u201d in the instant prosecution. At a subsequent hearing on the motion, the Commonwealth acknowledged that the previous misdemeanor conviction and the subject prosecution arose from defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle on the same occasion. However, because each offense required proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201cseparate elements,\u201d the Commonwealth maintained each was amenable to prosecution and conviction without offending principles of double jeopardy. Defendant disagreed, characterizing the prosecutions as \u201cdouble jeopardy, two convictions for the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Withholding a ruling on defendant\u2019s motion, the court requested counsel to \u201cbrief\u2019 the double jeopardy issue and, also, to \u201c[l]ook at Code \u00a7 19.2-294,\u201d and continued both the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion and the pending sentencing to November 21, 2000. Briefs were submitted, and defendant argued at the subsequent hearing that the felony prosecution constituted a successive prosecution for the \u201csame act,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. The court, however, overruled defendant\u2019s motion and imposed a sentence of twelve months in jail, resulting in the instant appeal, which is limited to the implications of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">As a threshold issue, the Commonwealth contends defendant waived error in the trial court by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u2018When an accused enters a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to an offense, he waives all defenses except those jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Savino v. Commonwealth, </em>289 Va. 534, 538, 391 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1990). \u201c \u2018[Njothing is left [to be determined] but the imposition of the prescribed punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1145, 1148, 408 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1991) (quoting <em>Miracle v. Peyton, </em>211 Va. 123, 126, 176 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1970)). However, Code \u00a7 19.2-254 provides that an accused may,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">[w]ith the approval of the court and the consent of the Commonwealth, ... enter a conditional plea of guilty in a felony case, reserving the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the defendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Relying upon the protection afforded by Code \u00a7 19.2-254, defendant contends \u201cthe trial record manifestly establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that the sole promise upon which [the] guilty plea was conditioned was his ability to contest the issue of successive prosecutions.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Defendant himself first objected to the prosecution in response to inquiries of the court during the guilty plea colloquy. Following the attendant exchange among the court and counsel, the court, anticipating subsequent production of the prior \u201cmisdemeanor summons\u201d by the Commonwealth, assured defendant and his counsel, \u201c[i]f it turns out [defendant] was in fact tried on it [in the general district court], then that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d In response, the prosecutor \u201cstipulate^] on the record <em>if </em>that\u2019s the case, the Commonwealth will be joining in [a] defense motion as we\u2019re not going to try somebody twice.\u201d Of significance, at the conclusion of the proceedings, the court instructed defense counsel to \u201ctake the initiative\u201d and pursue the issue, thereafter conducting two related hearings on defendant\u2019s related motion to dismiss, all with the concurrence and participation of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Thus, the record clearly reflects defendant elected to assert the bar of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to preserve a challenge to the prosecution, notwithstanding the guilty plea. The requisite consent of both the court and Commonwealth is manifest in related assurances to defendant and subsequent hearings and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">On appeal, defendant does not rely upon constitutional principles of double jeopardy to bar the instant prosecution but, instead, upon the preclusion of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>If the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, or of two or more ordinances, or of one or more statutes and also one or more ordinances, conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The statute \u201cspeaks to \u2018acts\u2019 of the accused, not elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 859, 365, 388 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1990); <em>see also Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 760, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1978) (stating Code \u00a7 19.2-294 focuses on \u201cthe identity of the act\u201d). \u201cIf the \u2018same act\u2019 is a violation of two or more statutes, conviction under one ... is \u2018a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lash v. County of Henrico, </em>14 Va.App. 926, 930, 421 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-294). Stated differently, \u201cif two offenses involve \u2018two separate and distinct acts,\u2019 conviction of one does not bar a prosecution for the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201ca conviction of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>statutory offense does not bar conviction under another statutory offense if each offense could have been proved without the necessity of proving the other.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 625, 628, 401 S.E.2d 208, 210, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 281, 411 S.E.2d 228 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201cThe test of whether there are separate acts sustaining several offenses \u2018is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Treu v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 996, 997, 406 S.E.2d 676, 677 (1991) (quoting <em>Estes v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 23, 24, 181 S.E.2d 622, 623-24 (1971)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In applying the \u201csame evidence\u201d test, \u201cthe particular criminal transaction must be examined to determine whether the acts are the same in terms of time, situs, victim, and the nature of the act itself.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 898, 421 S.E.2d 455, 459 (1992) (era banc). \u201cThe defendant is required to do no more than to show that the \u2018act\u2019 which served as the basis for the [one] conviction was \u2018the same act\u2019 which was used to convict [him] of [the other charge].\u201d <em>Wade, </em>9 Va.App. at 363, 388 S.E.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, defendant implicitly acknowledges that driving on a suspended license and driving after being adjudicated an habitual offender constitute dissimilar offenses. However, he maintains that because each violation arose from \u201conly one act of driving[,] ... incapable of being broken into smaller parts,\u201d \u201cthe exact same evidence supported both charges,\u201d thereby implicating the statutory bar. Defendant\u2019s argument, however, is belied by the record and contrary to well established jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In <em>Hall, </em>we instructed that determination of an \u201cact\u201d in the context of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 required consideration of the \u201ctime, situs, victim and the nature of the act.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 898, 421 S.E.2d at 459. Here, assuming time, situs and victim coincided, the nature of the specific act peculiar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>each prosecution is distinct. In the first instance, defendant admittedly was unlawfully operating a vehicle while his privileges were in suspension. In contrast, the subject prosecution resulted from such operation after he had been adjudicated an habitual offender. While driving was conduct common and necessary to each offense, the legal disability upon defendant that attended and was integral to the respective acts was significantly different. Thus, the \u201csame evidence\u201d would not produce a conviction for both offenses. Accordingly, the disparate \u201cnature\u201d of the acts saves the instant prosecution from the reach of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We, therefore, affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">.

In undertaking a <em>Blockburger </em>analysis, \"the two offenses are to be examined in the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review.\u201d <em>Blythe v.
