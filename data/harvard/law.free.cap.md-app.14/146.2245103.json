At his arraignment on June 19, 1970 appellant pleaded that he was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crimes. At that time the test of responsibility for criminal conduct was contained in Maryland Code, Article 59, Section 9 (a), <em>viz.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">\u201cA defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct and shall be found insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime if, at the time of such conduct <em>as a result of mental disease or defect, </em>he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ments of law. As used in this section, the terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On June 26, 1970 appellant was referred to Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital for a psychiatric examination to determin\u00e9 his sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Chapter 407 of the Acts of 1970, which became effective July 1, 1970, repealed Article 59 of the Maryland Code in its entirety and enacted in its place a new Article 59. The test for criminal responsibility was set forth in Section 25 (a) of the new Act. It was identical to that contained in the repealed Section 9 (a) except that it substituted the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d for the phrase \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d But unlike the former law, which contained no statutory definition of the terms \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d the new law defined the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d in Section 3 (f) to mean \u201cmental illness or mental retardation or any other form of behavioral or emotional illness resulting from any psychiatric or neurological disorder.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The new Act contained no provision, one way or the other, respecting the applicability of the new Section 25 (a) test for criminal responsibility to the trial of cases which, though commencing after the new Act\u2019s effective date (July 1, 1970), involved criminal acts perpetrated prior to that date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The Perkins State Hospital filed its report on August 27, 1970. It stated that appellant was presented before a medical staff conference on that date, and that it was the unanimous opinion of the medical staff (psychia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>trists Nabors, Adamo, Freinek, and Sauer) that \u201c[appellant] * * * did not suffer from a mental disease or defect at the time of the alleged offense such as to cause him to lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The trial of the case began on October 27, 1970 before Judges Pugh, Mathias, and Moore, sitting without a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The State adduced proof of the <em>corpora delicti </em>and of appellant\u2019s criminal agency, and rested on the presumption of sanity. Four psychiatrists then testified on appellant\u2019s behalf. Each was questioned as to appellant\u2019s responsibility for his criminal conduct in terms of the test set forth in Section 9 (a), <em>viz., </em>whether in September 1969 when appellant allegedly committed the crimes, \u201cas a result of mental disease or defect he * * * [lacked] substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Dr. Hertzberg testified that appellant was driven to commit his criminal acts by an \u201cobsessive compulsive neurosis,\u201d which he classified as a mental disease, but not a psychosis. He said that appellant was suffering from pedophilia \u2014 the inability to gain sexual satisfaction except with very young children. He classified pedophilia as a \u201cmental disorder,\u201d as a \u201cmental illness,\u201d and as a \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d He testified that a person could be just as mentally ill with a neurosis or personality or character disorder as a person with a psychosis. Judge Pugh indicated a belief that a \u201cmental disorder\u201d was not a \u201cmental disease\u201d within the meaning of Section 9; the witness said there was no difference between the two terms. He testified that appellant was not criminally responsible because he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Dr. Crowley agreed with Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s diagnosis. He said appellant was suffering from a very severe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>primitive personality disorder with extreme sexual deviation, namely pedophilia, which he classified as a \u201cmental disorder.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Crowley testified that appellant had a \u201cmental disease\u201d by reason of which he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Dr. Cray testified that appellant suffered from the \u201cmental disease\u201d of latent schizophrenia. He said that while the disease manifested itself in pedophilia, it was but a symptom of appellant\u2019s schizophrenia. Dr. Gray testified that pedophilia was a perversion, not a psychosis. Judge Pugh again indicated a belief that pedophilia was not a \u201cmental disease.\u201d Dr. Gray testified in terms of the test for criminal responsibility outlined in Section 9 (a) that appellant lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Dr. Hamman agreed with Dr. Gray\u2019s diagnosis that appellant was suffering from schizophrenia of a chronic nature and was not responsible for his criminal acts because by reason thereof he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. He testified that schizophrenia was a \u201cmental disease.\u201d Asked whether \u201cpedophilia\u201d was a \u201cmental disease,\u201d Dr. Hamman testified that it was a \u201cmental illness,\u201d and a symptom of basic schizophrenia. He characterized pedophilia as a character neurosis, a character disorder, and a personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">After the court indicated that appellant\u2019s psychiatric evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption of sanity, and that the State would be required to prove appellant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt (see <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 689), the State called three of the four Perkins Hospital phychiatrists who had participated in appellant\u2019s mental examination and who had found him responsible for his conduct at the time of the commission of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Dr. Sauer testified that appellant\u2019s pedophilia was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sexual deviation, a personality disorder, with no evidence of psychotic process. He rejected the diagnosis of the psychiatrists testifying on appellant\u2019s behalf. He said pedophilia was <em>\u201ca </em>definite mental disorder characterized by intense desires to engage in fondling or sexual acts with children.\u201d He said that appellant\u2019s mental disorder was not of such intensity as to cause him to lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. He agreed in a general sense that appellant was \u201cmentally ill\u201d and had a \u201cmental disease\u201d; he said, however, that \u201cpedophilia is not usually considered a disease,\u201d but instead was <em>\u201ca </em>personality disorder, a sexual deviation.\u201d Dr. Sauer testified that there was no difference between a mental disease and a mental disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Dr. Nabors testified that appellant did not have a mental disease or defect rendering him not responsible for his criminal conduct. She said there was \u201cno evidence that he is psychotic, and would, therefore, not be responsible for what he did.\u201d She indicated that the diagnosis of two of appellant\u2019s psychiatrists of \u201cobsessive compulsive neurosis\u201d was only a neurosis (as opposed to a psychosis) and was \u201cnot a mental disease that prevents people from conforming to the law.\u201d Asked what type of \u201cmental disease\u201d would cause a person to lack capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, Dr. Nabors again indicated that a psychosis would constitute such a disease. Asked whether to be insane a person would have to have a psychosis, she replied that he would. She said that appellant suffered from pedophilia, a sexual deviation not classified as a mental illness. She restated her opinion that to be insane or \u201ccrazy,\u201d a person had to have \u201cthat kind of sickness * * * we call psychotic.\u201d Asked whether there were any other functional mental illnesses other than psychosis, Dr. Nabors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>said there were \u201ca few, what they call effective mental diseases that are forms of psychosis, like manic-depressive psychosis and just a few others.\u201d She said that character neuroses are not generally considered mental illness. She said that pedophilia was not a mental disease, but was a mental disorder, the two terms being different. She said that there were \u201ccharacter disorders\u201d and \u201cneuroses\u201d and that in addition \u201cyou have your mental diseases; psychoses and so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Dr. Adamo next testified for the State. Asked in terms of the Section 9 (a) test whether appellant had a \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d Dr. Adamo answered that he \u201cwas not suffering from a mental disorder of such intensity as to cause him to lack capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d He testified that appellant had a sexual deviation, namely pedophilia; that it made no difference whether it was called a \u201cmental disease\u201d or a \u201cmental disorder\u201d; that appellant's disorder was not sufficiently severe to impair his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. He agreed that pedophilia is symptomatic of a more serious mental disorder \u201cas in schizophrenia,\u201d but said that appellant did not suffer from schizophrenia nor did he have an \u201cobsessive compulsive neurosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Two of the three judges of the court concluded that appellant \u201cwas sane at the time of the commission of the offense, as defined by Section 9 of Article 59 of the Code\u201d; the other judge concluded that appellant was not responsible for his criminal conduct under the Section 9 (a) test. Each judge outlined the reasons for his decision. Judge Pugh found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was sane at the time of the commission of the offense because he \u201cwas not suffering from a mental disease as defined by said section [9 (a)].\u201d Judge Moore found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was suffering from a mental disease or defect, but that it did not cause him to lack substantial capacity to conform his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>conduct to the requirements of law. He expressly disagreed with Judge Pugh\u2019s view \u201cthat no mental disease or defect was shown.\u201d Judge Mathias, dissenting from the majority conclusion, stated that he was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was legally sane under Section 9 (a) of Article 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The majority of the court convicted appellant of kidnapping and he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Appellant contends that the majority of the court was clearly erroneous in finding him responsible under Section 9 (a) for his criminal acts. He asserts that the State\u2019s psychiatrists who found him sane had, at best, minimal contact with him. He claims that Dr. Nabors erroneously equated the term \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d with the term \u201cpsychosis,\u201d and that the court should have entirely disregarded her testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">We observe at the outset that both counsel and the court were in error in believing that the test of criminal responsibility contained in Section 9 (a) was applicable at appellant\u2019s trial in October of 1970. As heretofore indicated, that section was repealed effective July 1, 1970 by Chapter 407 of the Acts of 1970, which simultaneously reenacted, in new Section 25 (a), the identical provisions of the repealed Section 9 (a) test of criminal responsibility with two significant differences: First, it substituted the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d for \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d and, second, unlike the term \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d which had never been legislatively defined, the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d was defined with great specificity in Section 3 (f) to mean and broadly encompass \u201cmental illness or mental retardation or any other form of behavioral or emotional illness resulting from any psychiatric or neurological disorder.\u201d No savings clause was included in Chapter 407 extending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>operative effect of the \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d standard formerly contained in Section 9 (a) beyond the effective date of the new Act so as to make it applicable in the post July 1, 1970 trial of cases which involved criminal conduct perpetrated prior to that date. Nor would the general savings statute, Maryland Code, Article 1, Section 3, have that effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And we otherwise find nothing in the provisions of Chapter 407 even remotely indicating a legislative intention to carry over the \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d standard of Section 9 (a) to govern the merits of insanity pleas asserted at trials commencing after July 1, 1970. The fact that under Section 25 (a), as under former Section 9 (a), the validity of an accused\u2019s insanity plea is to be adjudged with reference to his mental condition as it existed at the time the criminal act was committed does not mean that the test for criminal responsibility in effect at that time is controlling. The defense of insanity at the time of the commission of the crime takes on substance and becomes truly meaningful when the case is tried, its merits placed in issue and decided. We think it clear that the Legislature, in repealing Section 9 (a), and its undefined \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d standard, and in en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>acting in its place the carefully defined \u201cmental disorder\u201d standard in Section 25 (a), intended that the latter test would govern in all cases tried after July 1, 1970, regardless of when the offense was committed. <em>Cf. Janda v. General Motors Corp., </em>237 Md. 161; <em>Wittel v. Baker, </em>10 Md. App. 531. To otherwise conclude would be to ascribe to the Legislature an intention to have two separate tests for criminal responsibility in effect at the same time, based on the insignificant criterion of when the criminal act was committed. Had the Legislature so intended, it would not, in our view, have made Chapter 407 effective July 1, 1970, without expressly including in the Act a savings clause or like provision to indicate such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">That the change in the criminal responsibility test introduced into the law by Chapter 407 was intended by the Legislature to be one of substance and not merely one of form is likewise clear. Considering the broad but precise legislative meaning given the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d by Section 3 (f) in juxtaposition with the undefined term \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d formerly contained in Section 9 (a), it is readily evident that the Legislature intended more than a simple substitution of terms commonly understood by psychiatrists, lawyers, and judges as having the same or equivalent meaning. Indeed, as illustrated by the testimony in the present case, there was a considerable conflict of expert opinion among the testifying psychiatrists with respect to whether appellant\u2019s mental condition, which was variously labeled a psychosis, a neurosis, schizophrenia, pedophilia, a character disorder, and a personality disorder, rose to the level of a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d within the ambit of Section 9 (a), or was merely one of a multitude of mental disorders recognized and classified within the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, </em>the so-called psychiatrist\u2019s bible, published by the American Psychiatric Association. Some of the psychiatrists saw no difference between a \u201cmental disease\u201d and a \u201cmental disorder\u201d; others thought there was a difference. Some of the psychiatrists believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that pedophilia was both a mental disease or defect and a mental disorder; others seemed uncertain as to whether it was a mental disease. One of the State\u2019s psychiatrists believed that pedophilia was not a mental disease or defect under Section 9 (a); that only a psychosis could qualify as a mental disease and that since pedophilia was not a psychosis, it could not be a mental disease, although it could be a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We think it not unlikely that it was because of the wide differences of opinion among psychiatrists respecting interpretation of the term \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d as used in Section 9 (a), that the Legislature determined to make use of a more concrete standard that all alike could understand and uniformly apply. Thus, under the Section 25 (a) test of criminal responsibility, recognizing that an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or antisocial conduct cannot qualify as a \u201cmental disorder,\u201d psychiatrists would first be asked the threshold question \u2014 whether the accused, at the time of the crime, had a mental disorder, <em>i.e., </em>a \u201cmental illness or mental retardation or any other form of behavioral or emotional illness\u201d; if so, is it the result of \u201cany psychiatric or neurological disorder,\u201d and, if so, did it cause the accused to lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Granting that error was committed by applying the Section 9 (a) test of criminal responsibility at appellant\u2019s trial in October of 1970, rather than the Section 25 (a) test, the question becomes whether, on the record before us and in view of the testimony, the error was so prejudicial as to require reversal of the judgment. In the circumstances of this case, we cannot find that the error was harmless. As indicated, it was the testimony of one of the State\u2019s psychiatrists, Dr. Nabors, that only a psychosis could be considered as falling within the meaning of \u201cmental disease\u201d and that since pedophilia was not a psychosis, appellant did not have a mental disease. An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>other of the State\u2019s psychiatrists expressed the opinion that pedophilia was not usually considered a mental disease. In view of this testimony, which Judge Pugh appeared by his decision to accept as correct, we think the court\u2019s divided (two to one) conclusion that appellant was criminally responsible under Section 9 (a) was obviously prejudicial to him. Since pedophilia is defined in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, </em>at Section 302.2, as a non-psychotic mental disorder, we cannot say that it would not have qualified, under Section 25 (a), had that test been used, as a form of behavioral or emotional illness resulting from \u201cany psychiatric or neurological disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Two other questions raised on appeal may arise on retrial of the case and merit our attention. First, appellant claims that a three-judge panel, sitting in lieu of a jury, must, like a jury, reach a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides, in pertinent part, that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused has a right \u201cto a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d Nothing in this constitutional provision supports the argument that a defendant who waives a jury trial retains the right to a unanimous decision should he elect trial before a multiple-judge court. In <em>League v. State, </em>36 Md. 257, 266, the Court of Appeals flatly held that if at a court trial the court \u201cis composed of two or more members, a majority of them must concur in rendering the judgment.\u201d We think <em>League </em>controls the question in this case. We note, moreover, that at least three states have provided by statute that the decision of a majority of a multiple-judge court trying a criminal case would be controlling; the statutes have uniformly been upheld on the ground that no constitutional imperative of jury unanimity carries over to panels of judges. See <em>Commonwealth v. Scoleri, </em>202 A. 2d 521 (Pa.) ; <em>State v. Robbins, </em>199 N.E.2d 742 (Ohio) ; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>v. </em>DeCillis, 199 N.E.2d 380 (N.Y.). The <em>DeCillis </em>case holds that the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not affected by split verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Appellant also contends that the court erred in refusing to permit defense psychologists to testify with respect to their professional diagnosis, or comment on the ultimate issue whether appellant was criminally responsible for. his conduct. We held in <em>Saul v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 540, that a psychologist could testify as to the results of psychological tests made by him but could not give an opinion as to the accused\u2019s sanity and criminal responsibility. We said at p. 549:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201c* * * Without question tests by and observations of qualified psychologists are invaluable to the psychiatrist in reaching his opinion as to whether as a result of mental disease or defect an accused is insane and the testimony of such psychologists as to the results of the tests made by him are properly admissible as a means of enlightening the trier of fact, to be considered by it as one of the means by which the psychiatrist reached his opinion as to the sanity or insanity of the accused. But an opinion as to the ultimate fact, whether or not the accused is insane under the test prescribed by \u00a79(a), in fairness both to the accused and the State, should be reached by a medical diagnosis. Thus the opinion must be made by a medically trained psychiatrist in order to be admissible in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Appellant seeks to neutralize the effect of <em>Saul </em>by suggesting that a psychologist should be permitted to give his professional diagnosis when the psychiatrists testifying in the case on the ultimate issue of criminal responsibility base their opinions, at least in part, on the psychologist\u2019s diagnosis. We see no reason to so qualify the reach and rationale of <em>Saul. </em>Nor do we see any sound basis upon which to accept appellant\u2019s claim that since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>a psychologist\u2019s \u201cobservations\u201d concerning the accused are admissible in evidence, his professional diagnosis, necessarily included therein, should similarly be admissible. \u201cObservations,\u201d in this context is a term limited to observations <em>of </em>the accused by the psychologist \u2014 actions, responses, test results, <em>viz., </em>objective, demonstrable phenomena. A diagnosis is by definition an ultimate conclusion <em>about </em>the accused; it is the sum of what all the objective data means. <em>Saul </em>clearly limits the testimony of psychologists, as heretofore outlined, and we think the court below properly excluded the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid, one-half by the appellant, and one-half by the County Council of Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">.

When, by Chapter 709 of the Acts of 1967, the General Assembly changed the test for criminal responsibility from the M\u2019Naghten-Spencer rule to the American Law Institute test (the now repealed Section 9), it specifically provided in Section 2 thereof that \u201cthe provisions of this Act shall be applicable to all cases tried or scheduled for trial on and after the effective date of this Act [June 1, 1967].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">. When Dr. Crowley stated that the test for criminal responsibility had \u201cundergone a slight change as of July 1970,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel indicated during Dr. Sauer\u2019s testimony that the new_ term \u201cmental disorder\u201d was inapplicable because appellant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred prior to the effective date of the new Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. Appellant makes the same claim with respect to Dr. Sauer\u2019s testimony, but nothing in the record supports it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\">. Insofar as pertinent, that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u201cThe repeal, or the repeal and reenactment, or the revision, amendment or consolidation of any statute, or of any section or part of a section of any statute, civil or criminal, shall not have the effect to release, extinguish, alter, modify or change, in whole or in part, <em>any penalty, forfeiture, or liability, </em>either civil or criminal, which shall have been incurred * * * [thereunder] unless the repealing, repealing and reenacting, revising, amending or consolidating act shall expressly so provide; * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In the sense contemplated by this statute, a \u201cpenalty, forfeiture, or liability\u201d is, we think, something in the nature of a criminal or civil sanction actually incurred' by reason of the statute\u2019s operative provisions. See <em>Bell v. State, </em>236 Md. 356; <em>Brooks v. State Board, </em>233 Md. 98; <em>State v. Kennerly, </em>204 Md. 412; <em>State v. Clifton, </em>177 Md. 572; <em>Green v.
