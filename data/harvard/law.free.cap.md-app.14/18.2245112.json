Mackall Childs, sitting without a jury, of four separate offenses: 1) unlawful possession of dilaudid; 2) unlawful carrying of a dangerous and deadly weapon; 3) unlawful possession of marihuana; and 4) unlawful maintenance of a house for the keeping of narcotic drugs. Articles of contraband, clearly sufficient to. sustain the convictions, were found by the police in the home and in the automobile of the appellant. The pivotal issue, raised by the appellant in his motion to quash the search and seizure warrant and resolved against him below, is whether the application for the warrant contained adequate probable cause to justify its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The first, second and sixth paragraphs of the six paragraph application were essentially formal in nature. The heart of the application was in the third and fourth paragraphs, which recited information from and information about three anonymous informants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cI Officer Gray having received information from a reliable informant who has been established as being reliable in the past by information which led to the arrest of eight persons for violation of the narcotic laws and three persons for burglary that one, Patrick Dawson, a white male twenty nine years old, is dealing both Marihuana and Dilaudid in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">Information from a second reliable informant whose reliability has been established in the past by the arrest of two persons for narcotics and one for burglary that one Patrick Dawson is dealing Dilaudid from his auto, a Black Ford approximately a 1963 model in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. in Baltimore City. He further states that Patrick Dawson said that he kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the narcotics at his house in Glen Burnie Anne Arundel County. Information from a third informant whose reliability has been established from the arrest of two persons for narcotic violations that Patrick Dawson lived in a Pink shingled house at 7829 Oakwood Rd. Anne Arundel County, and that he held Dilaudid and Marihuana in his house and in his autos\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">and in the fifth paragraph, which recited the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cI officer Michael Gray have observed this Black 63 Ford in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. in Baltimore City on numerous occasions at approximately nine PM. I also went to 7829 Oak-wood Rd. and observed the person known to me as Patrick Dawson going into this house. I have also observed a Red Chev. Maryland registration GS 7609 sitting in the driveway, the auto is listed to Patrick Dawson, 7888 Crain Highway, to a 1960 Lincoln. I have observed Patrick Dawson in this 60 Lincoln in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. on one occasion. My third reliable informant, told me that Patrick had sold this Lincoln. I further observed the Black Ford, Maryland registration HP 4135 listed to Norma A. Dawson 7888 Crain Highway, the above auto is a 1964 Ford.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Judge Childs, at the suppression hearing, declined to consider, on the issue of probable cause, the information furnished by the first informant and by the third informant. He ruled that no substantial basis was shown to indicate that either informant had come upon his information by direct observation. He ruled, however, that sufficient supporting facts had been furnished by the affiant to the magistrate to satisfy him both that the second informant had come upon his information directly and that the second informant was credible. The appellant here attacks the \u201ccredibility\u201d aspect of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In his affidavit, the affiant set out for the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the fact that his \u201creliability has been established in the past by the arrest of two persons for narcotics and one for burglary.\u201d The affidavit also set out certain independent observations made by the affiant himself, which tended to verify some of the story as told by the informant to the affiant. We hold that the combination of the recitation as to the informant\u2019s demonstrated reliability in the past and the independent, police verification of some of his story was sufficient to supply the magistrate with a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for crediting the hearsay information. The credibility of the informant being established, there is no question but that the affidavit set out sufficient probable cause to justify the issuance of the search and seizure warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">There remains only to consider the appellant\u2019s further contention that the committing magistrate of the People\u2019s Court of Anne Arundel County, who issued the warrant in this case, was without jurisdiction to issue search and seizure warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Article 52, Section 98 B (9), creates the office of committing magistrate for Anne Arundel County. Subsection (a) thereunder provides that the committing magistrates :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">\u201cshall have throughout the county all the powers and jurisdiction vested by law in justices of the peace other than trial magistrates and substitute trial magistrates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Article 27, Section 551 (Search Warrants), spells out just what the powers and jurisdiction are which are vested by law in the justices of the peace with respect to search warrants. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">\u201cWhenever it be made to appear ... to any justice of the peace in this State, by a written application signed and sworn to by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits containing facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant or affiants, that there is probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>cause, the basis of which shall be set forth in said affidavit or affidavits, to believe that . . . any property subject to seizure under the criminal laws of the State is situated or located . . . in or on any such building, apartment, premises, place or thing, then such . . . justice of the peace may forthwith issue a search warrant</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The conferring of power and of jurisdiction is clear. The difficulty in this case arises because Article 52, Section 98B (9) (c), goes on to provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">\u201cThe committing magistrates and deputy committing magistrates shall sit at such times and places and shall perform such duties, including the issuance of warrants, the taking of bail bonds, the acceptance of collateral, and clerical functions as are assigned to them by the chief judge of the People\u2019s Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">At the suppression hearing, Chief Judge Thomas J. Curley, of the People\u2019s Court for Anne Arundel County, testified that it was his policy to request the committing magistrates of the county not to issue search warrants. He took the position because of his feeling that the committing magistrates of the county did not have sufficient legal training to evaluate questions of probable cause. On cross-examination by the State, however, he indicated that his policy was based not on legal authority but was \u201ca matter of personal preference.\u201d He further indicated that it was several years earlier that he had made his feeling \u201cgenerally known.\u201d There was no indication that he had ever communicated to the committing magistrate in this case any direct prohibition against the issuing of search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We feel that Article 52, Section 98B (9) (c), is directory in nature and is intended to foster the orderly administration of the People\u2019s Court of Anne Arundel County by giving to the chief judge thereof the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>to assign duties and caseloads as he sees fit. We do not believe it was intended to diminish the official powers and the jurisdiction of the committing magistrates at the pleasure of the chief judge. We feel further that, in any event, the expression of a \u201cgeneral indication\u201d several years earlier of what was a \u201cpersonal preference\u201d could not be deemed to have divested the committing magistrate in this case of his basic statutory authority to issue search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>Moylan, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Akv\">\n<em>concurring:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">I concur in both the result reached and in the opinion of the Court. I feel constrained, however, to amplify upon the reasons why I feel the warrant before us here was inadequate in one regard but salvageable in another, and also to state the salutary purpose which, I believe, is being served by several recent and controversial Supreme Court decisions, notwithstanding the disesteem in which they are held in most law enforcement and many legal circles.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In <em>Dawson v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 694, we had occasion to treat broadly the two-pronged test for evaluating hearsay information in a probable cause setting as that test was anticipated by <em>Nathanson v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 41, and <em>Giordenello v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 480; necessitated by <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257; articulated by <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108; explicated by <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410; and obfuscated by <em>United States v. Harris, </em>29 L.Ed.2d 723.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>this appropriately entitled sequel (the appellant here is one Patrick Dawson), our focus is narrowed to <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cfirst prong,\u201d and, indeed, to a single aspect of that prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Conceptually, the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>line of cases should pose little difficulty, having been but a natural and logically foreseeable next step in the gradual forging of Fourth Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The clear and unremitting command of the Supreme Court throughout this century has been that search and seizure by authority of a warrant is always to be preferred over a warrantless intrusion and, indeed, wherever feasible is to be required. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Implicit in that command <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>is the concept that any decision as to whether probable cause exists so that a warrant should issue should always be made, where possible, by a \u201cneutral and detached magistrate\u201d rather than by a policeman. The constitutional protection consists of interposing an impartial judicial figure between the investigator and his quarry. Its philosophy was trenchantly expounded by Justice Jackson in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U. S. 10, at 13-14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201cThe point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate\u2019s disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people\u2019s homes secure only in the discretion of police officers. . . . When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or Government enforcement agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">If the constitutional protection as so mandated was to have meaning, it followed that the decision entrusted to the magistrate must be one. of substance and not of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>empty form. His was not to place a summarily-granted stamp of approval upon the policeman\u2019s predetermined course of investigative conduct but rather to make, in truth, an informed judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Although the analogy is less than perfect, the function of the magistrate in determining probable cause is in its fundamental character akin to that of the fact finder in determining guilt. Burdens of proof and rules of admissibility may differ, but basically both determinations call for 1) assessing the credibility of those who furnish information and 2) then weighing such information if it is believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The magistrate assures himself of the credibility of the affiant-applicant both by direct observation of this primary source of information and by the constitutionally-required administering to him of an oath. The threat of perjury (and perhaps of perdition) is a classic trustworthiness device. Even to a then highly-credited affiant, however, the magistrate may not delegate his next burden of responsibility. Not even the credible affiant may offer to the magistrate simply his own sworn conclusion that probable cause exists. He must rather furnish to the magistrate enough raw data so that the magistrate may do his own concluding therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The proscription against the purely conclusory application was enunciated by <em>Nathanson v. United States, supra, </em>with respect to search and seizure warrants and by <em>Giordenello v. United States, supra, </em>with respect to arrest warrants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Nathanson, </em>a Customs agent had sworn to the magistrate \u201cthat he has cause to suspect and does believe that [certain contraband is then reposing in a certain suspect premises].\u201d The Supreme Court held that the application was fatally defective in that, \u201cIt went upon a mere affirmation of suspicion and belief without any statement of adequate supporting facts.\u201d <em>Nathanson, supra, </em>at 46. In <em>Giordenello, </em>a Federal narcotics agent swore that the suspect for whom the arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>warrant was sought had committed the crime. The Supreme Court held that application to be fatally defective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cThe Commissioner must judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on by a complaining officer to show probable cause. He should not accept without question the complainant\u2019s mere conclusion that the person whose arrest is sought has committed a crime. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">The Complaint contains no affirmative allegation that the affiant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained therein; it does not indicate any sources for the complainant\u2019s belief; and it does not set forth any other sufficient basis upon which a finding of probable cause could be made.\u201d <em>Giordenello, supra, </em>at 486.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">A dimension was added and the magisterial task was made somewhat more complicated with the announcement in <em>Jones v. United States, supra, </em>that hearsay information was not only appropriate to be received by the magistrate on the issue of probable cause but that it could be sufficient, unto itself, to establish such probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>followed in rectilinear descent from <em>Jones. </em>The purpose of the so-called \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d as set out in <em>Aguilar </em>and as elaborated in <em>Spinelli </em>was simply to set the constitutional guidelines for the evaluation by the magistrate of this hearsay information. The gist of <em>Aguilar </em>is contained in the single paragraph, at 114:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cAlthough an affidavit may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant, . . . the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u201cBelieving it desirable that the principles of <em>Aguilar </em>should be further explicated,\u201d the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Spinelli. </em>It said, at 415-416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cThe informer\u2019s report must first be measured against <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>standards so that its probative value can be assessed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">Applying these principles to the present case, we first consider the weight to be given the informer\u2019s tip when it is considered apart from the rest of the affidavit. It is clear that a Commissioner could not credit it without abdicating his constitutional function. Though the affiant swore that his confidant was \u2018reliable,\u2019 he offered the magistrate no reason in support of this conclusion. Perhaps even more important is the fact that <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>other test has not been satisfied. The tip does not contain a sufficient statement of the underlying circumstances from which the informer concluded that Spinelli was running a bookmaking operation. We are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>told how the FBI\u2019s source received his information \u2014 it is not alleged that the informant personally observed Spinelli at work or that he had ever placed a bet with him. Moreover, if the informant came by the information indirectly, he did not explain why his sources were reliable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The simple thrust of these decisions is that whatever rules govern the evaluation of information from the primary source \u2014 the affiant \u2014 govern also the evaluation of information from the secondary source \u2014 the non-swearing, non-appearing, off-warrant declarant, i.e., the informant. Whether the magistrate is dealing with a primary, a secondary or even, theoretically, a tertiary source, he must still 1) assess the credibility of that source and 2) then weigh the information furnished if he believes it to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Just as the magistrate must satisfy himself as to the credibility of a primary source by administering an oath to him and by looking at him, so too must he, by some alternative means, satisfy himself as to the credibility of a secondary source. In neither case, may he accept someone else\u2019s conclusion in lieu of arriving at his own. Just as he may not permit an affiant\u2019s assertion as to his own credibility to serve as dispensation for the oath, neither may he permit the affiant\u2019s assertion as to his informant\u2019s credibility to serve as dispensation for the required recital of all necessary data about that informant that will permit the magistrate to draw his own conclusion as to credibility. This is the \u201ccredibility/reliability\u201d or \u201cveracity\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Similarly, the informant operates under the same interdict against offering his unsupported conclusion that the affiant has always operated under by virtue of <em>Nathanson </em>and <em>Giordenello. </em>Both primary and secondary source must ultimately offer to the magistrate direct observations \u2014 the data perceived by the source\u2019s own senses \u2014 so that the magistrate may draw his own con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>elusion therefrom. The affiant may not by indirection\u2014 through the tale of an informer \u2014 offer the bare conclusion that he is forbidden to offer directly. The strictures of <em>Nathanson </em>and <em>Giordenello </em>may not so simply be avoided by resort to hearsay. To permit the informant, no less than to permit the affiant, to offer an unsupported conclusion, would be to usurp the magisterial function which the Fourth Amendment forbids. This is the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar. </em>Anticipating <em>Aguilar, </em>Justice Frankfurter made the point most succinctly in <em>Jones, </em>at 269:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">\u201cWe held in <em>Nathanson v. United States . . . </em>that an affidavit does not establish probable cause which merely states the affiant\u2019s belief that there is cause to search, without stating facts upon which that belief is based. <em>A fortiori </em>this is true of an affidavit which states only the belief of one not the affiant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The parallel between the standards set out 1) for evaluating a primary source and his information and 2) for evaluating a secondary source and his information seems so logically compelling that the anguish felt in many quarters over <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>is difficult to fathom.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In measuring the affidavit in this case against these standards, we see that it turns upon the \u201ccredibility/reliability\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar. </em>In evaluating the application at the suppression hearing, Judge Childs discounted (properly, I think) all information received from the first informant and the third informant. Those incriminating allegations were defective, Judge Childs found, for failing to satisfy <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. Both were bald conclusions that the appellant was dealing in contraband drugs, with no underlying circumstances recited as to how the informants came upon such information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was not alleged that they had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>directly observed the appellant engaged in the suspect activities. There were no assurances that their conclusions were anything more substantial than \u201ca casual rumor circulating in the underworld\u201d, \u201can accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation\u201d or \u201can offhand remark heard at a neighborhood bar,\u201d condemned by <em>Spinelli, </em>at 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On the other hand, the information furnished from the second informant was concrete enough in detailing its pedigree to satisfy the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d aspect of <em>Aguilar. </em>The second informant significantly stated that he had heard incriminating information about the keeping of narcotics from the lips of the appellant himself. The appellant contends upon this appeal, however, that error was committed in considering this recitation from the second informant not because <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong had not been satisfied, but rather because the \u201ccredibility/reliability\u201d prong had not been satisfied. The sum total of information furnished to the magistrate bearing directly on the credibility of the second informant consisted of the single phrase, \u201cwhose reliability has been established in the past by the arrest of two persons for narcotics and one for burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Our problem is to assess the constitutional adequacy of this supporting data furnished to the magistrate to establish the veracity of the informant. From the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>complex emerge three methods of demonstrating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>such veracity, two of them intrinsic to the recitation about the informant and the third, extrinsic.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The focus of our inquiry is further narrowed, as we zero in on the veracity question, by the status of the secondary source here as an anonymous police informer. Although the difference is discussed expressly only in the dissenting opinion of Justice Harlan in <em>Harris, </em>at 29 L.Ed.2d 743, it is implicit in the Supreme Court\u2019s treating of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>problems that the rules set out for establishing an informant\u2019s credibility are aimed primarily at unnamed police \u201cinformers\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than at that broad class of secondary sources who are the victims of crime, the disinterested witnesses of crime, other disinterested civilian sources of information or other law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The members of this broad class are generally, but not universally,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> named. They are not from the criminal milieu.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">It was of this distinction that we spoke in <em>Dawson, </em>at 699:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201cThe practical distinction is that in dealing with a named source, the very naming of the source and the relationship of the source to the observed information may go a long way (or even be sufficient unto itself), under the facts of a particular case, to establish the credibility of that source or the reliability of his information. <em>Kapler v. State, </em>194 Md. 580; <em>Ward v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 583, 591-592; <em>Grimm, v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 321, 328. See also <em>Taylor v. State, </em>238 Md. 424; <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95; <em>Knight </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 282 (although these cases involve probable cause for warrantless arrests based upon hearsay information, the principle involved as to the trustworthiness of a witness-informant would also apply to cases involving applications for warrants).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">That a very different rationale exists for establishing the credibility of named citizen-informers than for establishing that of the more suspect and anonymous police-informer is widely acknowledged in recent case law. An excellent discussion of the different nature of the credibility problem is found in <em>People v. Glaubman, </em>485 P. 2d 711 (Colorado, 1971), wherein it was said, at 716-717:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cShe [a motel manager] was identified by name and is not on the same footing as the common informant who seeks to remain nameless and hidden and barters and sells information to the police. The nature of informants, which are a necessary part of police work, is such that the common informant is hidden behind a cloak of anonymity. . . . More often than not, the informant is paid or provides information in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his own misdeeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">Our view, which is supported by a number of decisions, is that the citizen-informer, adviser, or reporter who acts openly to see that our laws are enforced should be encouraged, and his information should not be subjected to the same tests as are applied to the information of an ordinary informer.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The intrinsic approach to veracity is an alternative one in that <em>Aguilar </em>commands that the magistrate \u201cbe informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant\u201d was \u201ccredible\u201d <em>OR </em>\u201chis information reliable.\u201d The Supreme Court, ironically, has never discussed the impact of the language, \u201cor his information reliable.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Arguably, supporting facts which show that an informant\u2019s information is \u201creliable\u201d thereby show also that the informant is, on that occasion at least, \u201ccredible.\u201d Unless the alternative phraseology is meaningless, the informant\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d would seem to involve his inherent and ongoing character as a person \u2014 his reputation and demonstrated history of honesty and integrity. Informational \u201creliability,\u201d as something separate from its source\u2019s credibility, would seem to involve some circumstances assuring trustworthiness on the particular occasion of its being furnished. Although hypothetical examples are difficult to conjure up in the context of police informers, it would certainly follow that any circumstance qualifying as a trustworthy exception to the hearsay rule in a trial setting would, <em>a </em>fortiori, qualify in a probable cause setting. Fortunately, it is not this aspect of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>veracity prong which is before us in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">With respect to the informant\u2019s \u201ccredibility,\u201d the recitation that his \u201creliability has been established in the past by the arrest of two persons for narcotics and one for burglary\u201d creates an extremely close question in terms of its self-sufficiency under <em>Aguilar. </em>It is my judgment, however, that, although close, it falls short as being too conclusory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The recurring theme that comes resounding down through all of the Supreme Court decisions is that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>every proposition, there must be an informed judgment made by the magistrate and not a mere conclusion offered by the policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">With respect to a somewhat lesser assertion, we said in <em>Iannone v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 81, at 85:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cWe think it clear that an undisclosed informant\u2019s reliability is not established by the affiant\u2019s mere unsupported and unparticularized conclusory assertion that he has \u2018furnished information which has proven to be reliable in the past\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">See also <em>Lashley v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 136, 139-140.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In asserting that the recitation here was too conclusory in nature, it is important to state what is not asserted. I do not suggest, by any means, that it fails simply because it recites that the information furnished in the past led to \u201carrests\u201d rather than to \u201carrests and convictions.\u201d In <em>Watkins v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 151, we held an assertion as to an informant\u2019s credibility to be sufficient under <em>Aguilar </em>where \u201carrests\u201d rather than \u201carrests and convictions\u201d were listed as the fruits of the confidential information. The significant difference is that in <em>Watkins, </em>the magistrate was furnished sufficient information to make a truly informed judgment. The information in that case was furnished in June, 1968. The affidavit recited that the informer was a narcotics user, long associated with narcotics peddlers and addicts in the Baltimore area. It recited that the informer had supplied reliable information to the police regularly since 1966. It recited that on two specific arrests made in March of 1968, three months prior, on the basis of information furnished by the informer, actual seizures were made of 77 capsules of heroin from the arrested individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Just as in <em>Watkins </em>we held that an assertion about information leading to prior arrests may, if sufficiently particularized, be adequate, we held conversely in <em>Moore v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 711, that an assertion that prior in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>formation led to \u201carrests and convictions\u201d may, if not sufficiently particularized, be inadequate. Judge Orth there held that the recitation that \u201creliable\u201d informants had furnished \u201cinformation in the past which resulted in arrests and convictions for violations of the narcotic laws\u201d was insufficient for lack of specificity. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201c \u2018Over the past\u2019 and \u2018in the past\u2019 could be the distant past or the immediate past or sometime in between. It does not follow that because an informant gave a tip years or even months ago which proved reliable, that he is forever after credible. Nor do we think it enough that this information given at some undetermined time resulted in arrests and convictions for violation of the narcotics laws. We do not say that such facts must be so detailed as would compromise the identity of the informant but we think more specificity than here presented is required, at the least as to about when past information was received and about how many arrests and how many convictions resulted therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The recitation as to the informant\u2019s past performance in the case at bar did not give the magistrate the data on which to base an informed judgment, notwithstanding the allegation as to \u201carrests.\u201d It did not tell the magistrate when that information had been furnished. It did not tell the magistrate whether, as a result of the arrests, evidence was turned up which the informant indicated would be turned up. It did not tell the magistrate whether the information from the informant was the exclusive predicate for the arrests, or whether it was but a minor contributing factor considered along with many other factors. It did not tell the magistrate whether those earlier arrests had ever been ruled upon, in terms of their legality and the adequacy of the probable cause upon which they were based. If the informant was, indeed, deemed reliable for purposes of those earlier arrests, what were the supporting facts which made him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>reliable then? That data would have been additionally significant for the magistrate here. The magistrate here was not even told whether the informant here had always furnished good information or not. In that last significant regard, <em>People v. Cruz, </em>53 Cal. Rptr. 354, provides a commendable benchmark. In that case, the affidavit recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cAffiant received information from a confidential reliable informant who has furnished information in the past that has resulted in the arrest of 7 persons, 6 for 11500 H&amp;S, and one for violation of parole. These cases are still waiting adjudication in Los Angeles courts. Informant has never given information which proved to be incorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">If the furnishing of good information in the past contributes to a belief in an informant\u2019s credibility, the furnishing of bad information in the past would certainly derogate therefrom. The policeman who works with an informant knows of his full batting average, not just of his successes. If a magistrate is furnished, selectively, with half-truths, he is intellectually crippled in terms of making the informed judgment contemplated by the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Police compliance need not be difficult, if the spirit of <em>Natkanson-Giordenello-Johnson-Aguilar-Spinelli </em>is once understood and appreciated. In permitting hearsay information from unnamed informants to serve as a significantly contributory, and even self-sufficient, basis for probable cause, the Constitution is realistically extending great latitude to law enforcement. When a magistrate is asked, therefore, to dispense with the oath, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>personal observation and even with the identity of the source of the ultimate information, upon which he must act, it is only a realistic substitute to require that the policeman make a bona fide effort to furnish in significant detail those reasons the policeman has for believing in his informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In this regard, the affidavit deemed sufficient by us in <em>Holland v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 635, is a model for the careful and meticulous detail which can go into demonstrating the credibility of an unnamed informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In his dissenting opinion in <em>Harris, </em>Justice Harlan discussed the types of information which enter into the judgments of the policeman, and should, therefore, be passed on to the magistrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cWithout violating the confidences of his source, the agent surely could describe for the magistrate such things as the informer\u2019s general background, employment, personal attributes that enable him to observe and relate accurately, position in the community, reputation with others, personal connection with the suspect, any circumstances which suggest the probable absence of any motivation to falsify, the apparent motivation for supplying the information, the presence or absence of a criminal record or association with known criminals, and the like.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>29 L.Ed.2d at 743.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The phrases \u201cinformation that has led to arrests\u201d or \u201cinformation that has led to arrests and convictions\u201d are not significantly less conclusory than such other phrases as \u201cproved to be reliable\u201d or \u201cfound by me to be credible.\u201d The hard lesson for police is that there are no magic words. There are no ritualistic incantations which, once discovered, will serve to satisfy reviewing courts. Rather on a case-by-case basis, the magistrate must be assisted to make an informed judgment as to why a particular informant is probably trustworthy. For such judgment, there is no mechanical formula. The factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>that lead one man to believe that another man is telling the truth are as varied as the experiences of Mankind itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Properly to inform the magistrate, a policeman should pass on all he knows about his informant, short of compromising the informant\u2019s identity, and that should include the informal data which is perhaps more significant than the formal data. It is not <em>reduetio ad absurdum </em>to suggest that if a policeman has habitually trusted his informant with his automobile, his wallet or his wife, let the magistrate be told; if the informant has powerful religious scruples against bearing false witness, let the magistrate be told; if the informant once confessed to chopping down his father\u2019s cherry tree, let the magistrate be told. This, and not the incantation of hopefully magic words, is the stuff of which informed judgments must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">My feeling that the recitation here, although close, fell just short of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>threshold, would not estop further inquiry into the informant\u2019s credibility. We would then have to explore the extrinsic route to the establishment of veracity. This is the alternative probable cause device, set out in <em>Spinelli, </em>whereby independent police or other credible observations may verify or corroborate so much of an informant\u2019s story as to lend credence to the rest of it and so raise it above <em>Aguilafs </em>threshold, even where the information initially furnished about the informant or the circumstances of his giving the information was intrinsically inadequate to pass muster. <em>Spinelli </em>described this buttressing technique, at 415-416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cIf the tip is found inadequate under <em>Aguilar, </em>the other allegations which corroborate the information contained in the hearsay report should then be considered. At this stage as well, however, the standards enunciated in <em>Aguilar </em>must inform the magistrate\u2019s decision. He must ask: Can it fairly be said that the tip, even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>certain parts of it have been corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">A magistrate cannot be said to have properly discharged his constitutional duty if he relies on an informer\u2019s tip which \u2014 even when partially corroborated \u2014 is not as reliable as one which passes <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>requirements when standing alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">See also <em>Dawson, supra, </em>at 703.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The informant had, <em>inter alia, </em>asserted that the appellant was \u201cdealing Dilaudid from his auto, a Black Ford approximately a 1963 model in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. in Baltimore City.\u201d The independent observations of the police-affiant established that \u201cthis Black 63 Ford [was seen] in the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. in Baltimore City on numerous occasions at approximately nine PM,\u201d and further that the appellant himself was seen in a 1960 Lincoln \u201cin the area of Ponca and Eastern Ave. on one occasion.\u201d Independent police investigation established that the black Ford automobile in question was registered to a \u201cNorma A. Dawson,\u201d who was listed as living at the same address as was the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">I feel that the assertions made here about the informant\u2019s credibility, buttressed by the corroboration of part of the informant\u2019s story by independent police observation, is as trustworthy as an assertion which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>test without independent corroboration. The verification here was slight, but only slight verification was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">This case contrasts significantly with <em>Spinelli, </em>wherein the independent police observations were far more extensive than were those here. The critical distinction is that here only a little by way of \u201cfurther support\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>was required, whereas in <em>Spinelli </em>the even more extensive independent observations were not enough to salvage an initial assertion as to the informant\u2019s credibility which was so inadequate under <em>Aguilar </em>as to be nugatory.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\">. By a 5-4 vote, the Court in <em>Harris </em>upheld the Government\u2019s appeal from an adverse decision in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and purported to distinguish <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>in so doing. Justices Douglas, Brennan and Marshall joined in the strong and well-reasoned dissent of Justice Harlan, who had authored the <em>Spinelli </em>opinion and who has never been overly latitudinarian with criminal defendants. It was Chief Justice Burger who spoke for the Court in <em>Harris. </em>Justices Black, White, Stewart and Blackmun joined him to tally five votes for the result, but did so for three expressed reasons or combinations of reasons distinct from the total rationale of the Chief Justice. The Burger opinion was in three' parts and gave three separate reasons for crediting the informant in the warrant application before the Court for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>view. (Two of the parts dealt with independent verification and only one with the internal sufficiency of the information furnished about the informant.) Justices Black and Blackmun joined the Chief Justice on all three points to represent the solid core of three votes for whatever <em>Harris </em>holds. The authoritative force of their voices in explication of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>doctrine is somewhat muted, however, by their avowed desire in two separate concurring opinions to go further and to reverse both <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli. </em>(Justice Black had been in dissent in both <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli; </em>Justice Blackmun had been a member of the 6-2 majority of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit whose decision was overturned by <em>Spinelli.) </em>Justice Stewart joined only in Part I of the Burger opinion. Justice White joined only in Part III of the Burger opinion. Neither joined in Part II. The three principles for which <em>Harris </em>might be cited, therefore, muster the maximum support of four votes, three votes and four votes, respectively. It is the third of these principles that is of greatest interest in perhaps adding a new consideration to our law on probable cause. It states that a declaration against penal interest by an informant, even be he a police informant, may serve to establish the credibility of that informant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\">. In his provocative analysis <em>Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation, </em>Professor Telford Taylor argues persuasively that, in terms of \u201cthe original understanding,\u201d the Supreme Court has \u201cstood the Fourth Amendment on its head.\u201d See <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>29 L.Ed.2d 564, 598 (concurring opinion by Harlan, J.). His thesis is that the Fourth Amendment and its progenitors in various state bills and declarations of rights were a direct reaction exclusively to the general warrant for seditious libel in England and to the writ of assistance for customs violations in the North American colonies, both universally detested and both representing at least partial catalysts for the American Revolution. Warrantless searches in traditionally criminal matters, and generally as an incident of arrest, were, on the other _ hand, of ancient usage and were tranquilly accepted on both sides of the Atlantic as posing no threat to the liberties of the people. The Fourth Amendment was drafted and enacted, so runs the thesis, not to exalt warrants over warrantless intru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sions but rather to place hedges about the warrants themselves, as instruments so vehemently feared and hated in so recent memory. See Lasson, <em>The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, </em>and Landynski, <em>Search and Seizure and Supreme Court, </em>for sound support for Taylor\u2019s thesis. Whatever the historical invalidity of the Supreme Court\u2019s position, however, the voice of that court in the Twentieth Century is nonetheless clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\">. <em>Giordenello </em>made clear that the standards for measuring probable cause are the same in the search and seizure situations and in the arrest situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">. It followed, of course, that if hearsay information could, under certain circumstances, be received at the trial on the merits itself, it should, <em>a fortiori, </em>he received in this <em>ex parte </em>proceeding before the magistrate where the burden of proof is a mere probability and where confrontation is not required. <em>Jones </em>went further and pointed out that since under <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, hearsay information could serve as the basis for an officer\u2019s belief that probable cause existed for a warrantless arrest, it would be incongruous and would, indeed, derogate from the preferred status of warrants to hold that more would be required for the issuance of a warrant than was required for a policeman to proceed without a warrant. <em>Jones </em>held, at 270-271:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">\u201cWhat we have ruled in the case of an officer who acts without a warrant governs our decision here. If an officer may act upon probable cause without a warrant when the only incriminating evidence in his possession is hearsay, it would be incongruous to hold that such evidence presented in an affidavit is insufficient basis for a warrant. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">We conclude therefore that hearsay may be the basis for a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">. As an apparent qualification on the requirement that the means by which the informant comes upon his information be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>explicitly set forth to meet <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test, Justice Harlan, speaking for four members of the Court in <em>Spinelli, </em>argued that if the information is furnished in sufficient detail, it may, under <em>Draper, </em>be \u201cself-verifying,\u201d on the theory that only a first-hand observer could ever possess such detail. The \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d theory rests on a shaky premise, however, for Justice White, concurring in <em>Spinelli </em>with the fifth and indispensable vote for the result, argued that <em>Aguilar </em>overruled <em>Draper </em>and cannot be reconciled with it. He refers to the \u201ctension between <em>Draper </em>and the <em>Nathanson-Aguilar </em>line of cases.\u201d See Note, \u201cThe Informer\u2019s Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest,\u201d 54 Cornell Law Review 958 (1969) for a thoughtful analysis of this doctrinal tension.
