The attempt is made whenever there is any action or conduct reasonably tending to create the apprehension<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in another, that the person engaged therein is about to apply such force to him. It is sufficient that there is an apparent intention to inflict a battery and an apparent ability to carry out such intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Battery is defined by Hochheimer in \u00a7 255:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cThe least actual force unlawfully applied to the person of another constitutes a battery. Force is applied, when there is any touching of the person or anything attached to the person by the aggressor or by any person or thing set in motion by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>(Seventh Edition) separately defines the two crimes, saying, in \u00a7 10.15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cA simple assault under common law is typified by an attempt or offer, with unlawful force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">and in \u00a7 10.19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">\u201cAny unlawful injury whatsoever, however slight, actually done to the person of another, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>directly or indirectly, in an angry, revengeful, rude, or insolent manner is a battery. Every battery includes an assault, so that on an indictment for assault and battery one may be convicted of an assault only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">To the same general effect are the definitions of the two crimes, given <em>separately </em>in each text, in 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Assault and Battery, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5, 6 C.J.S. Assault and Battery, \u00a7 57 a and b, <em>Perkins on Criminal Law </em>(Second Edition), pp. 107 and 114, and Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 329 and 337. In 6 C.J.S. Assault and Battery, \u00a7 57, it is said, \u201cThere is a clear and well defined legal distinction between an assault and an assault and battery. They are separate and distinct offenses under the law.\u201d We must take the term \u201cassault and battery\u201d as used here, as well as in many other texts, judicial decisions and statutes, as meaning, more precisely, \u201cbattery, with its included assdult\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The appellate courts of Maryland have had relatively little occasion to concern themselves with the definitions of assault and of battery, or with the close relation but clear distinction between the two crimes. In <em>Handy v. Johnson, </em>5 Md. 450 (1854) the Court of Appeals said at page 465:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cWhere an assault is charged the authorities show that the jury are to decide whether there was any intention to do any violence or injury; but the authorities also establish, that if in a threatening and rude or angry manner a man points a sword, or fork, at another, or shakes his fist in the face of the other, within striking distance, attended with a present ability to strike, although no stroke is given, such act is an assault, notwithstanding the failure to strike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In <em>Lamb v. State, </em>67 Md. 524,10 A. 208 (1887), the Court of Appeals said in an illustrative dictum, at page 534:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cA battery is defined to be the unlawful beating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>of another; and an assault is an attempt to beat another without touching him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Court of Appeals has more recently dealt with assault or battery or both in <em>Yantz v. Warden, </em>210 Md. 343, 123 A. 2d 601, in <em>Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80, 162 A. 2d 473, in an opinion by Chief Judge Brune, containing a review of text and case authorities on the subject, in <em>Hobbs v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 651, 163 A. 2d 331, and in <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, at pp. 176 and 177, 246 A. 2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">This Court has discussed or referred to the elements of one or both of the crimes in a number of cases, including <em>Weddle v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 85, 241 A. 2d 414; <em>Leatherberry v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 300, 242 A. 2d 599; <em>Williams v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 643, 244 A. 2d 619; <em>Price v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 127, 245 A. 2d 600; <em>Lyles v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 265, 269 A. 2d 178; and <em>Ott v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 259, 273 A. 2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We see no need to attempt to synthesize from these authorities any comprehensive definition of assault or of battery. The meaning of both is clear enough. Our purpose has been to show that assault is one crime and battery is another. There is no single crime properly called <em>assault and battery. </em>When the term is used, either it refers to two crimes, or it refers to the crime of battery, and when it does the word assault is superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In a number of cases we halve discussed the principles governing merger of, a lesser included, offense into a completed greater offense. With particular reference to merger of assault or battery into robbery, of which either or both are component elements, see the concurring opinion of Judge Orth in <em>Massey v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 615, 256 A. 2d 614, at pages 618 and 619, and the opinion written for this Court by Judge Orth in <em>Gray v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 478, 271 A. 2d 390, at pages 480-481. We have agreed with the statement in Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes, supra, </em>that on an indictment for assault and battery one may be convicted of an assault only.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Just as the assault or the battery which precede a larceny and combine with it to make the consummated crime a robbery, lose their identity as separate crimes when the greater crime of robbery is committed, so an assault which precedes a battery loses its identity as a separate crime when the greater crime of battery is committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Thus it is clear that battery stands in the law as a separate common law offense, made up of an attempt combined with the success of that attempt. One who unlawfully causes force to be applied, directly or indirectly, to the person of another, may be indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced for the crime of battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Henry Lee Woods, Jr. was convicted by a jury in Montgomery County of assault upon one individual, assault and battery of another, and of shoplifting. After sentences were imposed by Judge Irving A. Levine, he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In the early afternoon of January 9, 1971, Joseph Robert Gauthier was performing his duties as a major appliance salesman in the J. C. Penney Store in Silver Spring. He noticed appellant and a companion standing at a rack where stereo tapes were displayed. He observed what he felt were suspicious movements, and saw that the rack of cassettes was about half empty. He approached \u201cto see what actually was going on\u201d, and as he did so, appellant and his companion headed towards the front door. Mr. Gauthier called to Harold F. Evans, acting manager of the department, to head them off. Appellant\u2019s companion was carrying a shopping bag, which he dropped before the pair reached the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Mr. Evans attempted to block the exit of the two men, and appellant produced an object that resembled a fountain pen and squirted a fluid into the face of Mr. Evans, rendering him temporarily unable to see. An alarm was set up outside, and as the men fled, Officer Warren C. Crane, of the Montgomery County Police, took up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>chase. The men entered a car on a nearby parking lot, as Officer Crane approached the left front of the car. Appellant, driving, ignored the officer\u2019s command to stop, and started the car forward. Officer Crane jumped to his right. He testified, \u201cIf I had stayed in the position I would have been run over.\u201d He grabbed the door handle of the car and held on for a few feet, but could not maintain his hold. Appellant was caught by another police car after a chase into the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The shopping bag contained some clothing, and sixty-one stereo tape cassettes, identified by Mr. Gauthier as the property of the Penney store. He said their value was $5.99 each. The police took custody of the shopping bag and contents, inventoried and listed the cassettes and the price marked on each, photographed them, and later returned them to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">An indictment thereafter returned by the grand jury charged appellant in seven counts, entitled in the indictment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">First Count \u2014 Assault with Intent to Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Second Count \u2014 Assault and Battery</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Third Count \u2014 Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Fourth Count \u2014 Shoplifting of Goods Over the Value of One Hundred Dollars</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Fifth Count \u2014 Shoplifting of Goods' Under the Value of One Hundred Dollars</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Sixth Count \u2014 Assault and Battery</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">Seventh Count \u2014 Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">The first three counts involved offenses against Warren C. Crane, the police officer, and the last two charged offenses against Harold F. Evans, Penney\u2019s acting manager. The second count charged that the defendant, \u201cin and upon one Warren C. Crane, did then and there beat, contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State\u201d. The sixth count contained identical wording, except that the named victim was Harold F. Evans. Before any evidence was taken, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>State moved to amend the second and sixth counts by-inserting, before the words, \u201cdid then and there beat\u201d, the words, \u201cunlawfully did make an assault and\u201d. Over objection, leave to amend was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">At trial, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the second count, and denied the motion as to all other counts. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on the third, fourth and sixth counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Appellant makes several contentions here. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">1. The amendments to the second and sixth counts were of substance, not merely of form, and should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">2. Even if properly allowed, the amendments required that appellant be rearraigned on the two charges as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">3. It was error to admit in evidence the photographs of the stolen stereo tape cassettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">4. It was error to admit in evidence the tabulated list made by the police officer of the values of the cassettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">5. The evidence was insufficient to show that appellant committed an assault upon the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">6. The court\u2019s instructions regarding possible verdicts prohibited the jury from acquitting the appellant of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">7. The sentence of seven years for assault amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">1. and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">What we have said about the common law crime of battery shows that the sixth count of the indictment as originally drawn adequately charged that offense. Appellant\u2019s argument that there is no such crime in Maryland as battery alone is in error. Addition of the words, \u201cdid make an assault\u201d merely specified, separately, one of the ingredients of the crime of battery. Aside from being unnecessary, the addition involved form only, not substance. Maryland Rule 714 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">Absence of the technical word \u201cunlawfully\u201d from the original count was of no consequence, because the count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>charged facts which constitute a crime. Addition of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d by amendment was not a change of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">There was no error in allowing the amendment, and there was no requirement that appellant be rearraigned after the amendment was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Appellant seems to argue that the photographs of the tapes were improperly admitted because the tapes themselves were the best evidence. We held squarely in <em>Lamot v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 378, 234 A. 2d 615 and <em>Wells v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 510, 261 A. 2d 181, that the best evidence rule applied to writings or other documentary evidence, but has never been applied to chattels or material objects. Appellant also contends that the photographs did not fairly depict the individual tapes, and their individual identity could not be determined. The names of performers or musical selections printed on the labels were of no significance, and the photographs were merely cumulative evidence of the fact that a substantial number of stereo tape cassettes was involved in the crime. There was no error in their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The adding machine tape made by Officer Crane of the amounts shown on the price tags on the cassettes, along with his list of the titles on the cassettes, was received in evidence. We agree with Judge Levine that the records were admissible not only because Officer Crane made them in the ordinary course of his duties, but also because they merely recorded what he had personally observed. Appellant argues that the information as to prices was hearsay as it related to the value of the goods stolen. Both Mr. Gauthier and Mr. Evans testified to the number of tapes taken, and to their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The contention that the evidence was insufficient to show an assault upon Officer Crane is without merit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>officer testified to his attempt to stop the car, and that appellant drove toward him. He said that he jumped out of the way, and that if he had stayed in his position, he would have been run over. We have reviewed above the nature of the crime of assault. This evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt, <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450, 247 A. 2d 731, and the court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the third count was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We have examined the entire advisory instruction which Judge Levine gave to the jury. His summary of possible verdicts must be read in conjunction with his clear statement to the jury that the defendant could be found not guilty of each of the six counts submitted to it. No exception was taken to the instructions. Maryland Rule 756 f requires that such objection be made before the jury retires. There was no plain error, of which we may take cognizance and correct. Rule 756 g, <em>Brown v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 415, 287 A. 2d 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Appellant argues, somewhat abstractly, that the sentence of seven years imposed for his assault upon Officer Crane may be a cruel and unusual punishment. He suggests that since the Legislature has never seen fit to do so by statute, this Court should establish some kind of standard for sentences in assault cases. If we were so inclined, we lack the power to do so. In <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 111 A. 2d 597, Judge (now Chief Judge) Hammond, speaking for the Court of Appeals, discussed fully a contention that a sentence imposed after a plea of guilty to simple assault should be held to impose a cruel and unusual punishment and quoted from <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>82 Md. 527, 34 A. 246, where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cEven where the law confides to the Judge the imposition of the sentence without definite limit, it still may be possible to violate the Declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tion of Rights. If the punishment is grossly and inordinately disproportionate to the offence so that the sentence is evidently dictated not by a sense of public duty, but by passion, prejudice, ill-will or any other unworthy motive, the judgment ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded for a more just sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">See also <em>Weddle v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 85, 90, 241 A. 2d 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">There is nothing in this record to indicate that the sentence was dictated, not by a sense of public duty, but by passion, prejudice, ill-will or any other unworthy motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\">. Blackstone\u2019s <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England, </em>Volume III, dealing with private wrongs, at page 120. In Volume IV of the same work, discussing assaults, batteries and wounding as public wrongs, Blackstone says, at page 216: \u201c * * * I have nothing further to add to what has already been observed in the preceding book of these Commentaries; when we considered them as private wrongs, or civil injuries * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-13\">. In his work on <em>Criminal Law </em>(Second Edition) Professor Perkins points out that some misunderstanding has arisen from the use of the word \u201coffer\u201d by Blackstone and other writers. He says, at pages 117 and 118: \u201cThe word \u2018offer\u2019, it is said, signifies a threat that places the other in reasonable apprehension of receiving an immediate battery. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that the word carried any such significance when it first appeared in the definition of this offense. In one of its meanings, \u2018offer\u2019 is a synonym of \u2018attempt.\u2019 Duplicity of expression was no stranger in the early law, and when the phrase was first used in this definition, it was as if it had been worded \u2018an attempt or effort.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">The American Heritage Dictionary, among several definitions of the verb \u201coffer\u201d, includes: To exhibit an intention; attempt: To try to inflict upon. As a noun, \u201coffer\u201d is defined in part as: An attempt; a try: A show of intention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-12\">. Whether apprehension of impending harm on the part of the potential victim is a necessary ingredient of assault in tort law, we need not and do not decide. And while such apprehension may be present in most criminal assaults, it is not always present, and therefore it cannot be a required element. If a person be struck from behind, or by stealth or surprise, or while asleep, he is certainly the victim of a battery. But if we accept the oft-repeated statement that every battery includes or is preceded by an assault, and if there could be no assault without premonitory apprehension in the victim, then it could be argued that there was no battery. That is not the law. See 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Assault and Battery, \u00a7 4, <em>State v. Adamo, </em>9 N. J. Super. 7, 74 A. 2d 341, <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>17 Or. 300, 20 P. 625, <em>Nelson v. State, </em>(Fla. App.) 157 So. 2d 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
