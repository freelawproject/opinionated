J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABf\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Judge Samuel J. DeBlasis found Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Eugene Muskus in direct criminal contempt of court on two occasions in the course of a defective delinquency jury trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County; fines in the amount of $25.00 and $10.00 respectively were assessed against Muskus, a bench warrant was issued, and he was jailed pending payment of the fines. In an opinion filed in support of his orders, Judge DeBlasis stated, with reference to the first contempt citation, that Muskus \u201cfrequently debated the rulings of the court throughout the course of the proceedings even though he had been admonished not to do so.\u201d As to the second contempt citation, Judge DeBlasis stated that Muskus \u201crefused to return to counsel table after a bench conference although ordered to do so on several occasions.\u201d Judge DeBlasis concluded, presumably with reference to both contempt citations, that \u201cMuskus\u2019 conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>was arrogant and wilfully disobedient during the entire proceedings\u201d; he said \u201cmore particular reference is made to pages 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 41, 42, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, of the transcript for additional facts * * *.\u201d At a hearing held on Muskus\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the contempt citations, he told Judge DeBlasis that because he did not intend to be contemptuous, and did not believe that he had been, he could not apologize for his conduct since to do so would constitute a deception on his part solely to placate the court and would itself be a contemptuous act. Judge DeBlasis denied Muskus\u2019s motion; he stated that Muskus did not show that he was remorseful for his conduct. In the course of his remarks, Judge DeBlasis said Muskus\u2019s \u201cconduct at that time was somewhat less than antagonistic, perhaps in the heat of battle, but I think he was just frankly, completely and totally in disregard of the position of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On appeal Muskus contends that his conduct was not contemptuous, that he was not arrogant, disrespectful or wilfully disobedient. He claims that he was but advocating his case, zealously trying his best, though inexperienced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The pertinent background facts are these: At 1:50 p.m. on July 23, 1970, the case of <em>State v. Sorrell </em>was called for trial before Judge DeBlasis and a jury. Immediately after the jury was impaneled, Muskus requested a short continuance on behalf of the State; he explained to the court that its witness, Dr. Kelman, a staff psychiatrist at Patuxent Institution, was not then present in court but had been notified at 12:45 p.m. that trial was about to commence; that it would take thirty to forty-five minutes for the witness to arrive; that although the case had been set for trial at 10:00 a.m. that morning in another court room, it did not proceed as scheduled because of other pending matters in that court; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and that as a result, Dr. Kelman had been told that he would be contacted. Judge DeBlasis indicated his displeasure that the jury was required to wait on Dr. Kelman. He chastised Muskus for not having notified him in chambers that Dr. Kelman was not present in court. Muskus replied that he hadn\u2019t known previously to which court room the case would be assigned and therefore had not earlier notified the judge. The court asked Muskus if he had any other witnesses; he responded, saying \u201cThis is a defective delinquent * * at which time Judge DeBlasis interrupted him, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201cI know what it is. You don\u2019t have to tell me what it is. You are trying the Court\u2019s patience a little too much right this moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Muskus told Judge DeBlasis that Dr. Kelman was his only witness. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cWe will think about holding you in contempt. Do you have any other witnesses that you can present?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Muskus replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201cNo, Your Honor, just one witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Judge DeBlasis told both Muskus and the jury that unless Dr. Kelman was present in court in fifteen minutes, the court would consider granting a mistrial. Soon thereafter, Dr. Kelman arrived, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Muskus questioned Dr. Kelman at length. He asked him relevant questions pertaining to the only issue in the case, <em>viz., </em>whether Sorrell was a defective delinquent within the meaning of Maryland Code, Article 31B, Section 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Muskus developed in full and orderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fashion the witness\u2019s professional qualifications, the nature and purpose of Patuxent Institution, and the type of diagnostic tests used to evaluate whether a person is a defective delinquent. Muskus introduced Sorrell\u2019s Patuxent record into evidence. He asked Dr. Kelman a number of relevant questions concerning medical, psychiatric, and psychological tests conducted by the Institution on Sorrell and the results of those tests. He asked Dr. Kelman pertinent questions relating to the substance of staff reports concerning Sorrell. He sought to elicit relevant information concerning Sorrell\u2019s social background and criminal history, including both his and the State\u2019s version of the attempted rape offense for which Sorrell was referred to Patuxent for evaluation. Judge DeBlasis told Muskus that there was no reason to go into the offense, to which Muskus replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cYour Honor, this is to give a background of the defendant * * * in a proper prospective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Judge DeBlasis told Muskus to limit his inquiry to Sorrell\u2019s behavioral pattern. Muskus responded that he believed Sorrell\u2019s counsel would go into detail with respect to the attempted rape offense; the court said it was not going to permit Muskus to argue the case and directed him \u201cto get to the essence of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Muskus then asked Dr. Kelman about Sorrell\u2019s past offenses. Sorrell objected. The court said that it was proper to outline \u201cthe other crimes\u201d which Sorrell, had committed but told Muskus \u201cnot to get into the essence of the crime\u201d since it served no useful purpose. Thereafter, Dr. Kelman testified with respect to the attempted rape offense and stated it was the only crime committed by Sorrell as an adult. He related the details of the commission of the crime, after which Muskus questioned him further concerning Sorrell\u2019s family, school, and marital history, and the results of his physical, psychiatric, psychological examinations. Muskus then asked Dr. Kelman to summarize his testimony. Judge DeBlasis indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>that the summary was unnecessary. This colloquy then followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cMr. Muskus: Was there any objection by defense counsel ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">The Court: No, but there is objection by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">Mr. Muskus: Oh, excuse me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Dr. Kelman then testified that it was his opinion, and that of the Patuxent staff that Sorrell was a defective delinquent. Muskus then indicated to the court that he wanted to put Dr. Kelman\u2019s testimony \u201cin proper prospective\u201d for the jury. Sorrell objected and the court sustained the objection. Muskus undertook to ask another question. The court interrupted him, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t understand the ruling of the Court. We won\u2019t permit you to do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Muskus replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">\u201cPermit what, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">The Court: You are not to argue. The Court is not going to debate the issue here. We make the rulings and we ask that you be bound by it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Muskus next asked Dr. Kelman how Sorrell fit the elements of the defective delinquent definition. The court again interrupted him, stating that Dr. Kelman had already testified that Sorrell was a defective delinquent. Muskus replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-18\">\u201cYes, but I would like to have the jury clarify to them how this is applicable to Mr. Sorrell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-20\">The Court: He\u2019s already told you that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-21\">Mr. Muskus: Because we have it piecemeal and this is to put it in a proper perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The Court: The court is going to admonish you one more time and then hold you in contempt. We ask that you proceed on in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Muskus proceeded by asking Dr. Kelman whether he was familiar with the report of Dr. McCormack concerning Sorrell; Kelman replied that he was. The court solicited an objection to the question from Sorrell\u2019s counsel which it sustained. Muskus asked Dr. Kelman whether Dr. McCormack\u2019s report changed Kelman\u2019s impression of Sorrell. Again, the court solicited an objection from defense counsel which it sustained. At a bench conference requested by Muskus, he told the court that the defense had made no objection to his question. This colloquy then followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cThe Court: I am going to say to you for the last time. The next time we have to caution you about anything we will definitely hold you in contempt. We think you are trying the patience of this Court. If you don\u2019t know how</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cMr. State\u2019s Attorney, the Court is going to hold you in contempt and fine you $25. If you don\u2019t know how to proceed in this case we will give you time to recess in which to gather your faculties and proceed properly. We are holding you in contempt and we are charging you a fine of $25 in this instance. Your attitude is arrogant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">Mr. Muskus: A short recess, Your Honor? Just a short recess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The Court: We will ask you to proceed. We have already held you in contempt. And, Mr. Sheriff, he will be in your custody until he pays the fine of $25. We ask you now to proceed in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">After this exchange, Muskus asked no further questions on direct examination. Following a lengthy cross-examination of Dr. Kelman, Muskus asked him, on redirect examination, a long and somewhat confused question, to which Sorrell objected. The objection was sustained and Muskus undertook to rephrase the question. The court interjected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t hear me, Mr. State\u2019s Attorney. The objection is sustained. Do you understand the Court\u2019s ruling?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Muskus asked no further questions, and rested the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Sorrell called a psychiatrist, Dr. John McCormack, to testify on his behalf. Dr. McCormack testified at great length with respect to Sorrell\u2019s background and particularly as to the details of and reasons underlying the attempted rape conviction. He indicated that Sorrell had had an erection throughout the day on which the crime was committed, but had no thought of sex and was not seeking sexual gratification when he assaulted the victim. He said that Sorrell had been drinking during the day and as a result was impulsive; that the crime was not one of violence; that there was little force involved, and Sorrell had not hurt the girl. He testified that Sorrell was not a defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">On cross-examination, Muskus undertook to explore the basis for Dr. McCormack\u2019s conclusion that the attempted rape offense was not a crime of violence. The court inquired of Muskus as to his purpose in asking such questions; Muskus said that he wanted to show that Sorrell was a violent person. Judge DeBlasis then in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>quired what relevancy Sorrell\u2019s day-long erection had to the issue in the case. Muskus replied in effect that he was attempting to develop Sorrell\u2019s whole antisocial history. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cYou seem to the Court. want to continually argue with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKi\">Mr. Muskus: No, I don\u2019t intend to argue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIA\">The Court: I know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">Mr. Muskus: No, Your Honor, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aax\">The Court: \u2014I don\u2019t intent to permit you to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0F\">Mr. Muskus: I don\u2019t intend to argue with the Court, but I intend to at least present to the jury the particular circumstances here that we have; the type of person the defendant is; the doctor stating that maybe rape is not a violent crime, leaving the jury with the impression that what the defendant is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">The Court: That is not the issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6m0\">Mr. Muskus: Your Honor, I would feel that the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQM\">The Court: If you are asking questions that pertain to the issues in this case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acu0\">Mr. Muskus: I felt this is a pertinent fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\">The Court: Well, the Court has to admonish you once again, Mr. Muskus. If you can\u2019t draw anything from that, we might be a little more firmer in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUb\">Mr. Muskus: What does the Court intend, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8l\">The Court: You seem to want to question every time we do something. My rulings are not debatable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Mr. Muskus : I realize that, Your Honor. With all due respect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhC\">The Court: You may return to counsel table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3C\">Mr. Muskus : \u2014I\u2019d like to make the record clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARk\">The Court: You may return yourself to counsel table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUO3\">Mr. Muskus : Your Honor, if I may, please, for the record, I have no disregard\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\">(Court raps gavel.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">The Court: The Court is holding you in contempt again, and fine you another $10, and next time you will be incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APY_\">Mr. Muskus : Your Honor, would Your Honor state for the record the reasons why I am held in contempt for appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">The Court: Mr. Sheriff\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfR\">Mr. Muskus Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axz\">The Court: \u2014the attorney is in your custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ3\">Mr. Muskus : I move for a mistrial for information not relevant to the case and placing both the State and the defendant at a disadvantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFF\">The Court: Mr. Sheriff, the attorney is in your custody until he pays this fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC8\">Mr. Muskus : Your Honor, I would move for a mistrial first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Q\">The Court: You are going to get moved in jail if you continue in your conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Maryland Code, Article 26, Section 4, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he power of the several courts of the State to * * * inflict summary punishments for contempt of courts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201c(1) The misbehavior of any person or persons in the presence of the said courts, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">(2) the misbehavior of any officers of the said courts in their official transactions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">(3) the disobedience or resistance by any officer of the said courts, party, juror, witness or any other person or persons to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command of the said courts; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We noted in <em>Goldsborough v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 346, that while it was the legislative purpose in enacting Section 4 to restrain the courts from punishing as a contempt anything not falling within its terms, the judicial power to punish for contempt could not be so limited; that the right to punish for contempt by summary conviction is a power inherent in all courts of justice, and essential for their protection and existence. In <em>Ex Parte Sturm, </em>152 Md. 114, 120-121, the Court of Appeals said it was essential to the integrity and independence of judicial tribunals \u201cthat they should have the power to enforce their own judgment as to what conduct is incompatible with the proper and orderly course of their procedure.\u201d Expounding upon this generalization in <em>Ex Parte Bowles, </em>164 Md. 318, the court said at p. 330:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201cCriminal contempts of court embrace all acts committed against the majesty of the law or the dignity of the court, and the primary and controlling object sought to be obtained by punishment of such offenders is the vindication of public authority, of which the court is the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>bodiment, represented at any given time by the presiding judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Goldsborough v. State, supra, </em>we said that a contempt, viewed in a narrow sense, is a despising of the authority, justice, or dignity of the court; and that in a more general sense, a person whose conduct tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or disregard, interferes with or prejudices parties or their witnesses during litigation, or otherwise tends to impede, embarrass, or obstruct the court in the discharge of its duties, has committed a contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Nothing Muskus did or said at the Sorrell trial constituted, in our opinion, conduct properly punishable as a direct criminal contempt of court within the contemplation of these governing precepts of law. In so concluding, we fully realize the inadequacy of a cold record to depict such possible elements of misbehavior or otherwise contemptuous conduct as facial expressions, physical gestures, tone or inflections of voice, or manner of speaking. We recognize that even the most faithful transcript of record cannot capture a lawyer\u2019s attitude, his demeanor, the tone of his conduct at the trial. And we recognize that the nicest of words can on occasion take on a contemptuous flavor not revealed by the record. That a cold record is deficient in these important particulars does not mean that appellate courts must, in reviewing contempt citations, rely totally upon the fairness and objectivity of the presiding judge. Experience has shown that trial judges have on occasion abused their contempt powers, and we think such an abuse is readily evident in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Judge DeBlasis\u2019s first contempt citation was, as heretofore indicated, based on his finding that Muskus frequently debated the court\u2019s rulings, although warned not to do so. In <em>Fisher v. Pace, </em>336 U. S. 155, the Supreme Court held that it is the duty of counsel to abide by the court\u2019s rulings, even if erroneous, since any other procedure \u201cwould result in mockery of our trial courts and would destroy every concept of orderly process in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>administration of justice.\u201d At 162. But it later stated in <em>In Re McConnell, </em>370 U. S. 230, that while it is necessary that a judge have the power to protect himself from actual obstruction in the court room, \u201cit is also essential to a fair administration of justice that lawyers be able to make honest good-faith efforts to present their clients\u2019 cases.\u201d At 236. Further, in <em>McConnell, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cThe arguments of a lawyer in presenting his client\u2019s case strenuously and persistently cannot amount to a contempt of court so long as the lawyer does not in some way create an obstruction which blocks the judge in the performance of his judicial duty.\u201d (At 236)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Just where zealous trial advocacy shades into contempt of court has always been a troublesome question. Where a lawyer\u2019s persistence in debating a judge\u2019s ruling, even an erroneous one, becomes an actual disruption to the trial judge in the performance of his judicial duties, where he persists in defying the judge\u2019s order to desist, where the lawyer\u2019s persistence in debating the court\u2019s ruling becomes incompatible with the proper and orderly course of the trial proceeding, where it amounts to a despising of the court\u2019s authority and a real obstructive impediment to the court in its administration of justice, then such persistence may constitute a contempt. Compare <em>Gallagher v. Municipal Court, </em>192 P. 2d 905 (Cal.), where the court observed that intemperate behavior in the course of a trial lessens the mastery of the trial judge over the progress of the proceeding and thus tends to obstruct the course of the trial. That such a degree of persistent disagreement with the court\u2019s rulings as to amount to contemptuous conduct was not reached in this case is to us too plain to require extended discussion. At most, Muskus was mildly persistent. That he may have been tedious in the presentation of his case in the eyes of the court and tried the court\u2019s patience, as Judge De-Blasis stated, is hardly ground for finding him in direct criminal contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In his opinion Judge DeBlasis stated that Muskus was arrogant and wilfully disobedient through the entire trial, although on reconsideration he later stated that Muskus\u2019s conduct was \u201csomewhat less than antagonistic.\u201d To support his conclusion, Judge DeBlasis simply referred to a number of pages in the transcript without delineating or specifying the instances of arrogance or wilful disobedience to which he had reference. We see nothing on those pages making the alleged arrogance or wilful disobedience self-evident; indeed, nothing appears on any of these pages to suggest even a trace of arrogance, insolence or wilful disobedience on Muskus\u2019s part. Nor does anything appear on the face of the record which even remotely suggests that Muskus\u2019s conduct was in any sense boisterous, that he was hostile, defiant, or disrespectful, or that his words reflected on the integrity of the court. On the contrary, the record in its entirety portrays Muskus as a polite, respectful, well-prepared and resourceful lawyer. In such circumstances, we do not think that Judge DeBlasis\u2019s general and unparticularized statement that Muskus was arrogant and wilfully disobedient lends any support to his conclusion that Muskus\u2019s persistence in debating the court\u2019s rulings constituted contempt of court. See <em>Phelan v. People of Guam, </em>394 F. 2d 293 (9th Cir.) ; <em>In Re Hallinan, </em>459 P. 2d 255 (Cal.) <em>Raiden v. Super. Ct., </em>206 P. 2d 1081 (Cal.).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In light of the background against which the first contempt citation was cast, we don\u2019t think that Muskus\u2019s failure to promptly obey the court\u2019s order to return to the trial table constituted a contemptuous act. While undoubtedly Muskus should have sat down when Judge DeBlasis ordered him to do so, the circumstances were such, we think, as failed to present a legally sufficient basis upon which to find a contempt citation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We observe by way of conclusion that while trial judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>must be given wide latitude to punish contemptuous conduct, they must ever be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstructions to the administration of justice. See <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 U. S. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Order dated July 28, 1970 citing Eugene Muskus in contempt on two occasions vacated; costs to be paid by the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">.
