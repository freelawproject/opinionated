J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the passage of a public act effecting changes in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a impliedly repealed another public act passed earlier in the same legislative session and dealing with the same statute. The defendant, Garret D. Kozlowski, was arrested on October 3, 1985, and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claiming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the legislature had passed two public acts during the 1985 session, each of which authorized a different penalty for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a, the defendant moved for a declaratory judgment to determine which of the two penalty provisions would apply in the event of his conviction. The trial court, <em>Buzaid, J., </em>ruled that the later enacted act, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, had impliedly repealed the earlier enacted act, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, and therefore established the applicable penalties for a violation of the statute. The state has appealed from this decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The underlying facts are not in dispute. In May, 1985,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Connecticut legislature passed Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, entitled, \u201cAn Act Increasing the Imprisonment Penalties for Drunk Driving to Meet Federal Standards.\u201d Section one of this act changed subsection (h) of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a by repealing the penalties provided for first, second, and third offenders, and substituting more severe penalties in their place. The Governor signed this act on June 28, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Subsequent to the passage of this act but prior to its signing by the Governor, the legislature passed, in early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>June, 1985,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, entitled, \u201cAn Act Establishing a \u2018Per Se\u2019 Standard for Operating a Motor Vehicle While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor.\u201d This act changed subsection (a) of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a to provide that operating a motor vehicle \u201cwhile the ratio of alcohol in the blood . . . is ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight\u201d would in itself constitute the offense of driving under the influence of liquor in violation of the statute. The act also made changes in subsections (c), (d) and (h) of \u00a7 14-227a to conform with the new per se standard contained in subsection (a). To effect these changes, and in accordance with the format prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 2-18,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, recited \u00a7 14-227a in its entirety, capitaliz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ing new sections to be added and placing brackets around sections to be omitted. The act was prefaced by the phrase, \u201cSection 14-227a of the general statutes is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In ruling that this act impliedly repealed Public Act No. 85-387, the trial court found that, by republishing \u00a7 14-227a in its entirety without reference to the increased penalties contained in the recently-passed Public Act No. 85-387, the legislature had effectively reinstated the previous penalty provisions. Since these provisions differed from the penalties contained in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, the court held that \u201c[t]he acts [were] directly in conflict with each other on their face.\u201d Consequently, invoking the doctrine that, \u201cwhen two legislative enactments are in conflict and cannot reasonably be reconciled, the later one repeals the earlier one to the extent that they are in conflict,\u201d the court declared that \u201cPublic Act No. 85-387 was repealed by implication by the subsequent enactment of Public Act No. 85-596 and, therefore, would not be controlling over the defendant.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the trial court rejected the state\u2019s argument that a different result was mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 2-30b,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provides that concurrent effect should be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>to \u201ctwo or more acts passed at the same session of the general assembly [which] amend the same section of the general statutes . . . except in the case of irreconcilable conflict . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that \u00a7 2-30b was inapplicable to the present case because it applies, by its own terms, only to <em>amendatory </em>acts, whereas Public Acts 1985, Nos. 85-387 and 85-596, were legislatively characterized as <em>repealing </em>acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On appeal from the court\u2019s decision, the state claims that the trial court erred both in failing to apply General Statutes \u00a7 2-30b, and in finding an irreconcilable conflict between the two public acts. Our resolution of the state\u2019s claim, therefore, requires us to undertake a two-step analysis. We must decide first whether Public Acts 1985, Nos. 85-387 and 85-596, are amendatory acts within the meaning of \u00a7 2-30b, thereby triggering the application of that statute to the present controversy. Second, if we find that \u00a7 2-30b does in fact apply, we must determine whether it requires us to give concurrent effect to both public acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Our interpretation of the meaning and scope of \u00a7 2-30b takes place within well defined limits. The fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. In seeking to discern this intent, we look to the words of the statute itself; <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute; <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 522; to legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>lative practice and policy; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 187, 438 A.2d 859 (1981); and to judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The state\u2019s first claim of error concerns the scope of application of \u00a7 2-30b. The question therein raised is whether a statute which refers specifically to amendatory acts applies equally to acts which the legislature has denominated as repeals. The state concedes that both acts in question are characterized in their prefaces as repeals, and concedes further that other acts passed by the legislature are expressly characterized as amendments. It argues, however, that these labels are not determinative of \u00a7 2-30b\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">In construing the extent of \u00a7 2-30b\u2019s reach, we look first to its express language. If the words are clear and unambiguous, \u201cit is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature\u201d; <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981); and we need inquire no further. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 58; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 186. Although \u00a7 2-30b refers specifically to an \u201camendment,\u201d it does not define what is meant by that term, or indicate how broadly \u201camendment\u201d is to be read. In order to determine the statute\u2019s scope, therefore, we must look beyond the words to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dilieto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 433-34, 472 A.2d 768 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 522; see 2A Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 46.07, p. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">An examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 2-30b indicates that the legislature intended the statute to apply to all acts which make changes in existing legislation, regardless of whether those acts are denominated as amendments or as repeals. Section 2-30b was passed in response to our decision in <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 334 A.2d 452 (1973). See 17 H. R. Proc., Pt. 1, 1974 Sess., p. 430, remarks of Rep. James F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Bingham. In <em>Menzies </em>we held, on facts similar to the present ones, that a public act passed during the 1967 legislative session amending General Statutes \u00a7 31-298 was impliedly repealed by a public act passed later in the same session, which set forth \u00a7 31-298 in its entirety, and substituted new language for some of the old. Neither of the public acts at issue in <em>Menzies </em>was characterized in its preface as an amendment. Instead, both acts contained the identical \u201crepeal and substitute\u201d prefatory language that is found in Public Acts 1985, Nos. 85-387 and 85-596. Nevertheless, in enacting \u00a7 2-30b to clarify the status of such multiple acts, the legislature chose to use the word \u201camendment.\u201d This legislative history evidences an intent that \u00a7 2-30b encompass any and all acts which expressly change prior statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">A broad reading of \u00a7 2-30b is supported by an examination of the practice followed by the legislature in altering existing statutes. The legislature characteristically casts acts which alter language within existing statutory subsections in the form of repeal and substitution, reserving the label of amendment for acts which add entirely new subsections.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This format complies with the requirements of \u00a7 2-18 that an act altering a statutory subsection set out that subsection in its entirety, with changes clearly marked. Nevertheless, the legislature itself commonly refers to both types of acts as amendments, without regard to their prefatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>denominations. See Public Acts 1985, No. 85-613, \u00a7 134, which refers to Public Acts 1985, No. 85-254, as amendatory, even though that act contains a repeal and substitute preface; and Public Acts 1985, No. 85-613, \u00a7 142, referring to Public Acts 1985, No. 85-440. This practice suggests that the choice of prefatory language is prompted more by a desire to conform with the specifications of \u00a7 2-18 than by an intent to create a substantive distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Similarly, although we have not previously had occasion to construe \u00a7 2-30b, we have noted in another context that \u201c[wjhether a new provision is in the form of a new enactment repealing the old . . . or the form of an amendment of the old is immaterial and depends on the preference of the draftsman.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>149 Conn. 577, 581-82, 183 A.2d 256 (1962), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 375 U.S. 85, 84 S. Ct. 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1963). Accordingly, we too have consistently characterized as amendments acts which included the prefatory language of repeal and substitute. See <em>Connecticut Assn. of Boards of Education, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>197 Conn. 554, 556, 499 A.2d 797 (1985); <em>Federal Aviation Administration v. Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 548 n.1, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 539, 489 A.2d 363 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Consequently, in view of the legislative history of \u00a7 2-30b, legislative practice, and prior judicial interpretation, we conclude that the legislature intended the word \u201camendment\u201d as used in \u00a7 2-30b to apply to all acts which expressly change existing legislation, regardless of the specific prefatory language used. Accordingly, we hold that Public Acts 1985, Nos. 85-387 and 85-596, fall within the purview of \u00a7 2-30b, and that the trial court erred in not considering that statute in its evaluation of the effectiveness of the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Having decided the applicability of \u00a7 2-30b to the present case, we must next determine whether the statute mandates a finding that the two acts should both be given effect. Under the terms of \u00a7 2-30b, both public acts are effective, even though \u201creference to the earlier adopted act is not made in the act passed later,\u201d unless they are in irreconcilable conflict. If such conflict is found, the later act \u201cshall be deemed to have repealed the irreconcilable provision in the earlier act.\u201d The trial court found the acts to conflict with each other \u201con their face\u201d because the later enacted act, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, by restating the penalty provision of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (h) without reference to the increased penalties provided in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, effectively restored the original lesser penalties. Thus, the court reasoned, the two acts each provided a different punishment for the same violation, thereby causing an irreconcilable conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In urging us to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision, the defendant argues that we are bound to enforce the legislature\u2019s clear and unambiguous \u201clegal\u201d intent to reinstate the penalties contained in \u00a7 14-227a. According to the defendant, the legislature unequivocally manifested that intent by omitting the language of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, from Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, while reprinting \u00a7 14-227a (h) in its entirety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Although the legislature\u2019s restatement of \u00a7 14-227a has admittedly created a surface inconsistency, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>must begin our analysis by presuming that, in passing the later act, the legislature did so with an awareness of the earlier one and with an intent to create a consistent body of law. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 556 n.7, 457 A.2d 304 (1983); <em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>186 Conn. 300, 306, 441 A.2d 185 (1982); <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 123, 434 A.2d 949 (1980). \u201cThe point of the rules of interpretation is to give harmonious effect to all acts on a subject where reasonably possible.\u201d 1A Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 23.10, p. 346; <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, 494, 472 A.2d 775 (1984). Although penal statutes are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so as to disregard the context in which they exist or to frustrate the obvious intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In attempting to glean legislative intent, it is often useful to examine the title of a proposed bill; <em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>supra, 308; and the purpose the legislature intended to accomplish by its enactment. <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>supra, 214; <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 345, 441 A.2d 604 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 522. In the present case, it is significant to note that, although Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, is entitled \u201cAn Act Increasing the Imprisonment Penalties for Drunk Driving to Meet Federal Standards,\u201d Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, makes no reference to penalties in either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>its title or its statement of purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, whereas Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, focuses its proposed changes to \u00a7 14-227a solely on increasing the penalties, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, purports to make no changes whatsoever to the penalties imposed by the statute. Rather, its proposed alterations concern only the creation and application of a per se standard. This is evidence that, in passing these two acts separately, the legislature sought to make two separate and distinct changes in \u00a7 14-227a. Rather than intending to reinstate the previous penalties when it printed \u00a7 14-227a in its entirety, it is more likely that the legislature did so merely to comply with the format procedures specified in \u00a7 2-18.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Apex Motor Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>20 Ill. 2d 395, 399-400, 169 N.E.2d 769 (1960) (reprinting of entire statute in later act not indicative of legislative intent to repeal earlier act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>passed in same session, but merely to comply with state constitutional requirement that section to be amended be reprinted in its entirety).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">This conclusion is strengthened by an examination of the legislative history accompanying the passage of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596. During the course of the Senate debate, several references were made to the increased penalties contained in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, which had already been passed by the legislature, but which had not yet been signed into law by the governor. See 28 S. Proc., Pt. 16, 1985 Sess., pp. 5342-47. In explaining why Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, still contained the old penalty provisions of \u00a7 14-227a rather than the increased penalties found in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, Senator Richard B. Johnston stated: \u201c[TJhat is the present state of the law and that\u2019s a reciting of the present penalties. If the legislation that has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate is signed by the Governor, that will be changed.\u201d 28 S. Proc., Pt. 16,1985 Sess., p. 5344. This history strongly supports a finding that the legislature did not intend Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, to reinstate the prior penalties, but rather intended both acts to be given concurrent effect to the extent that they specifically <em>altered </em>\u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A further indication that the legislature did not intend Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, to repeal the penalty provisions of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, is the fact that the legislature has express procedures for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>changes in a prior act which has been passed earlier in the same legislative session. It can either recall the bill from the governor\u2019s desk as provided in Rule 23 of the joint rules of the senate and house of representatives (1984-85),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or it can pass a public act <em>specifically </em>repealing or amending the prior act. We find it significant that the legislature followed this latter route when it decided to delete a section from Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, after it had been passed. See Public Acts 1985, No. 85-613, \u00a7 137. It is therefore unlikely that, had the legislature intended to repeal the increased penalties provided in that same public act and reinstate the previous penalties, it would have done so in such an ambiguous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We thus conclude that the legislature did not intend the recitation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a in Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596, to reinstate the prior penalty provision, but rather intended to conform to the format specifications for amendments contained in General Statutes \u00a7 2-18. So construed, Public Acts 1985, Nos. 85-387 and 85-596, are not in conflict. Under \u00a7 2-30b, then, both acts are entitled to concurrent effect. The effective penalties for drunken driving in violation of \u00a7 14-227a are those enacted by Public Acts 1985, No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>85-387, which, in recognition of the seriousness of this crime, increases exposure to imprisonment for first, second, and third offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that his due process right to \u201cfair warning\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the penalties he faced for violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a would be violated by a finding that the increased penalty provisions of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, are effective. He argues that \u201c[a] citizen of this state should be able to look at the criminal statutes and ascertain the potential deprivation of liberty for a violation of that statute.\u201d While we do not disagree with this principle, we are persuaded that the defendant received constitutionally-adequate notice of the penalties he faced. Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, clearly spelled out those increased penalties, and \u00a7 2-30b provided notice that the penalties remained in effect even after the passage of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596. This combination is sufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> Prior to the changes made by the public acts at issue in this case, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provided in relevant part: \u201coperation while under THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR OR DRUG OR WHILE IMPAIRED BY LIQUOR, (a) OPERATION WHILE UNDER THE influence.

A review of public acts passed during the 1985 legislature reveals that the legislature consistently used the term \u201camend\u201d in three discrete circumstances: in altering special acts and bonding bills, neither of which are codified into statutes; and in adding full subsections to previous statutes, rather than changing words within existing subsections. We do not conclude from this practice, however, that the legislature intends to draw a substantive distinction which would affect our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"> The defendant also argues that our holding in <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 334 A.2d 452 (1973), requires a finding that Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, was repealed by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-596. <em>Menzies, </em>however, was decided prior to the enactment of \u00a7 2-30b.

Under this format, it was customary to preface the act with a statement that the relevant statute \u201cis amended to read . . . .\u201d Because this form made it difficult for both legislators and the public to recognize the extent of the proposed change without comparing the existing statute with the proposed bill, the legislature in 1945 passed Public Acts 1945, No. 3, which was the forerunner of the present General Statutes \u00a7 2-18. See 1 H. R. Proc., Pt. 1,1945 Sess., p. 39, remarks of Rep. Herbert B. Wanderer. This act provided for the first time that each public act amending an existing statute \u201cshall set forth in full the act, or the section or subsection thereof, to be amended. Matter to be omitted or repealed shall be surrounded by brackets and new matter shall be indicated by underscoring.\u201d In line with this new format, it became customary for amendatory acts to be prefaced by a statement that the relevant statute \u201cis repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof.\u201d With changes not relevant to this case, \u00a7 2-18 provides substantially the same provision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> This conclusion reflects a recognition of the realities of the legislative process. It is impossible for the legislature to know, at the time it votes on a particular bill, when or whether that bill will be signed by the Governor. It is entirely possible for a bill which has been passed early in the session to be signed after a bill which has been passed later in the session. It is also possible for a bill which has been passed by the legislature to be vetoed by the Governor. In the face of such inevitable uncertainty, it would thus be difficult for the legislature to make reference in one pending bill to provisions contained in another pending bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> Rule 23 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, Rules and Precedents of the General Assembly of Connecticut 1984-85, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u201c23.

Any bill transmitted to the governor or the legislative commissioners shall be returned first to that house in which the motion for its return originated, and the bill may then be altered or totally rejected by a concurrent vote of the two houses; but, if not altered or rejected by concurrent vote, it shall be again transmitted to the governor or the legislative commissioners, as the case may be, in the same form in which it was first presented to him or them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in part: \u201cSection 1.
