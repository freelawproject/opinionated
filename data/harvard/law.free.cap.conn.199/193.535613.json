Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeyz\">After a trial to the jury on a two count information, the defendant was found guilty of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, and guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in admitting certain hearsay statements under the constancy of accusation doctrine because the \u201ccurrent breadth\u201d of the hearsay exception which allows such testimony both as to the facts and contents of that accusation is no longer justified because of current developments in the law, and (2) in refusing to permit defense counsel to pursue, during cross-examination, a line of questioning involving the victim\u2019s \u201cprior sexual activity within the two or three day period prior\u201d to the alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The jury could reasonably have found, inter alia, the following facts. On February 2,1980, the victim C, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>eighteen years of age, met the defendant, an acquaintance, at a tavern in Bristol at about 6 or 6:30 p.m. She had had one drink of Seagram\u2019s and Seven at that tavern prior to his arrival there. He bought her another Seagram\u2019s and Seven as they talked. At about 8:30 p.m., C, the defendant, and a male friend left that tavern to go to another bar in an effort to meet C\u2019s sister there. C drove her own car while the defendant and his friend followed her in the defendant\u2019s Cadillac. C dropped her car off at her home and then got into the defendant\u2019s car. When the three arrived at the second bar, they did not find C\u2019s sister there. While there, the defendant bought C another Seagram\u2019s and Seven. All three left the bar together and the defendant dropped his male friend off at the latter\u2019s home. At about 9:30 p.m., the defendant and C drove to the house of one of the defendant\u2019s friends to buy some drugs. After going into his friend\u2019s house alone, the defendant returned with three quaalude tablets which he and C divided and consumed. C washed these drugs down with some beer that the defendant had with him. The two then went to a third bar where C began to feel the effects of the alcohol and the drugs. She felt dizzy, had trouble focusing and rested her head on the bar. Meanwhile, the defendant played pool and drank some alcoholic beverages. The defendant bought her yet another Seagram\u2019s and Seven. The bartender took note of her condition and, after speaking to the defendant about it, gave her some coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The defendant and C left this bar between 10 and 10:30 p.m., and he assisted her into the front seat of his car as she had difficulty walking and entering the car. C believed that the defendant was taking her home and she fell asleep. She awoke a short time later to find that the defendant had driven her to a secluded area in Southington and the next thing she knew he was pulling her pants off. Her pants tore as he pulled them off. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>She resisted, screaming and fighting, as he punched her and threatened to kill her. She tried to escape and while she was outside the car with her pants and panties off, the defendant dragged her on the ground back to the car. He held her and compelled her to engage in oral intercourse in the rear seat of the car. He attempted vaginal intercourse, but, according to the victim, he never ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The assault left her with ripped clothing, bruises and scratches on her buttocks, facial bruises and some marks on her neck. During the assault, she scratched the defendant on the face. Before the defendant left the scene, he searched the area for his wallet and a package of Marlboro cigarettes which he had lost. He then drove her to B\u2019s house and she told B what had happened. B, who was a friend of C\u2019s family, immediately telephoned C\u2019s sister about the assault. B drove her home where she told her sister and her parents about the assault. Thereafter, C, her sister, her parents and B went to the Southington police department after first having tried unsuccessfully to find the wallet and cigarettes the defendant had lost at the assault scene. After giving a statement to policewoman Elizabeth Keegan, C was examined by a physician at New Britain General Hospital. Thereafter, between 5 and 6 a.m., C and the police went to the scene of the attack where they found the defendant\u2019s wallet and his Marlboro cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">At the trial, B, Keegan, C\u2019s sister and Detective Stanley Porter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each testified, over defense objection of hearsay,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as to what C had told each of them about the assault, including the details related to them by her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>In each instance, the trial court admitted this evidence under the \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 92, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Essentially, the defendant argues that we should overrule our precedential case law and hold that the \u201ccurrent breadth\u201d of the constancy of accusation testimony exception to the hearsay rule is no longer justified because of contemporary developments in the law and in psychiatry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His fail-back position is that if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>do not repudiate that exception completely, we should at least hold that it does not permit such testimony to include the details of the crime involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The formulation of these positions, as now made on appeal, were not articulated in that manner in the trial court. Nevertheless, we do not dispose of this phase of his appeal by simply saying that we have been given no persuasive reason for overruling our oft-repeated precedents on this subject. The claims were functionally made and the record is adequate for our review. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>rejecting the defendant\u2019s claims, we have not forgotten that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[ejxperience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>192 Conn. 85, 95, 469 A.2d 1220 (1984) (A. <em>Healey, J., </em>dissenting), quoting <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>v. <em>Sharon Hospital, </em>188 Conn. 1, 17-18, 448 A.2d 190 (1982). The flexibility and capacity of the common law is its genius for growth and adaptation. \u201cWhen common-law principles are no longer supportable in reason they are no longer supportable in fact.\u201d <em>Pendexter </em>v. <em>Pendexter, </em>363 A.2d 743, 749 (Me. 1976) (Dufresne, C.J., concurring); see <em>Handeland </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>216 N.W.2d 574 (Iowa 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The target of the defendant\u2019s first claim of error is an evidentiary rule of long standing in this jurisdiction. \u201cIn sex-related crime cases, we have long recognized that a witness, to whom a victim has complained of the offense, could testify \u2018not only to the fact that a complaint was made but also to its details.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 549, 41 A.2d 101 (1945). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>161 Conn. 291, 294, 287 A.2d 386 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>160 Conn. 366, 367, 279 A.2d 552 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>157 Conn. 198, 207, 251 A.2d 178 (1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 928, 89 S. Ct. 1788, 23 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dziob, </em>133 Conn. 167, 169, 48 A.2d 377 (1946); <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 677, 163 A. 256 (1932); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>81 Conn. 1, 5, 69 A. 1054 (1908); <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>47 Conn. 465, 466 (1880); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 155-57 (1876); <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 99 (1830). \u2018Such testimony is admitted . . . when the complainant first has testified, in court, to the facts of the alleged occurrence, in order to corroborate her testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>supra, [677].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 453, 442 A.2d 906 (1982). Just recently we have reiterated that \u201c[t]here can be no serious question concerning the viability of the \u2018constancy of accusation\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>exception to the hearsay rule in sex-related cases . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In pressing his argument for repudiating or, in the alternative, greatly constricting the constancy of accusation exception, the defendant asserts that the latest legislative developments \u201creflect a far more progressive approach to the prosecution of sexual crimes.\u201d The defendant points to legislative action in 1974 that, in repealing General Statutes \u00a7 53a-68, eliminated the requirement of corroboration to sustain a conviction in particular sexual offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The legislative history of the repeal of \u00a7 53a-68 does not aid the defendant. 17 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1974 Sess., pp. 1306-10; 17 H. R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1974 Sess., pp. 2005-10. In viewing \u00a7 53a-68 as a \u201ccapricious law\u201d and as operating to cast complainants in such cases in an undignified, discriminating and demeaning manner, legislators urged that \u201cthe credibility of the plaintiff should be the sole requirement\u201d and indicated that the jury could properly decide where the truth was.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 17 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1974 Sess., pp. 1308,1309; 17 H. R. Proc., Pt. 4,1974 Sess., pp. 2005, 2006. There can be no question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>wisdom of the enlightened action of the legislature in repealing \u00a7 53a-68. In recognizing the legislative policy decision in repealing \u00a7 53a-68; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilletto, </em>98 Conn. 702, 714, 120 A. 567 (1923); we acknowledge that relevant established principles militate against the defendant\u2019s claim. When the legislature acts, it is presumed to know the state of the law. <em>Pomfret School </em>v. <em>Pomfret, </em>105 Conn. 456, 462, 136 A. 88 (1927); <em>Tolisano </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Conn. Sup. 266, 269, 111 A.2d 562 (1954) <em>(King, J.) </em>Thus, the legislature was presumed to have knowledge of the long-standing doctrine of constancy of accusation in such cases. \u201c[W]hen the Legislature acts in a particular area, it does so with knowledge of and regard to the prior state of the law, including relevant decisions [of the Appellate Court].\u201d <em>Scheve </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>44 Md. App. 398, 415, 408 A.2d 1071 (1979). It is presumed \u201cto know the existing state of the case law in those areas in which it is legislating\u201d; <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>95 Wash. 2d 257, 262, 623 P.2d 683 (1980); to be \u201ccognizant of judicial decisions relevant to the subject matter of a statute\u201d; <em>English </em>v. <em>Marin Municipal Water District, </em>66 Cal. App. 3d 725, 731, 136 Cal. Rptr. 224 (1977); and \u201cto know the state of existing relevant law when it enacts a statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>430 A.2d 749, 752 (R.I.1981). The knowledge of the constancy of accusation exception established decades prior to the repeal of \u00a7 53a-68 may thus fairly be imputed to the legislature\u2019s knowledge when \u00a7 53a-68 was repealed in 1974. Despite this, the legislature took no legislative action incident to the repeal of \u00a7 53a-68 to annul or restrict the constancy of accusation exception; this has significance because of that doctrine\u2019s incontestible relevance to the area of legislative concern at that time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See generally <em>Miller </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 594, 427 A.2d 425 (1980); <em>Sawyer Savings Bank </em>v. <em>American Trading Co., </em>176 Conn. 185, 189-90, 405 A.2d 635 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In any event, the legislature did not act to change the hearsay exception challenged here. The legislative deliberations referred to concerning the importance of credibility and reliance on the jury to sift out the truth in such cases constitute some telling measure of their thinking. Almost ten years after the repeal of \u00a7 53a-68 we explicitly noted the continued viability of this exception \u201calthough the statutory requirement of corroboration was repealed [in 1974].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 97 n.12. Under our constancy of accusation exception the complainant and those to whom she complained are permitted to testify to both the complaint and its details. Rather than disadvantaging a defendant, such a doctrine supplies a fertile field for cross-examination of a complainant with reference to ascertaining where the truth lies. In <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Copp, </em>96 Conn. 571, 575, 114 A. 682 (1921), Chief Justice Wheeler said: \u201cThe test of cross-examination is the highest and most indispensable test known to the law for the discovery of truth.\u201d Wigmore, speaking even more strongly, said that cross-examination \u201cis beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d 5 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev. 1974) \u00a7 1367, p. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Our present doctrine of constancy of accusation facilitates the prosecution of an outrage which is almost always \u201can inherently furtive act.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Linzy, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>N.Y.2d 99, 103, 286 N.E.2d 440, 335 N.Y.S.2d 45 (1972). We are aware that when a doctrine is of judicial origin, it may also be subject to judicial change. \u201c[T]he [doctrine] follows where its reason leads; where the reason stops, there stops the [doctrine].\u201d Karl Llewellyn, The Bramble Bush (I960) pp. 157-58; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schreiber, </em>599 F.2d 534, 537 (3d Cir. 1979). The reason for our doctrine of constancy of accusation persists vigorously. We reject the defendant\u2019s challenge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in excluding evidence concerning the victim\u2019s sexual activity within the two or three day period prior to the alleged assaults. We find no error on this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Certain evidence at the trial must be set out for a proper understanding of this claim. During cross-examination of the victim, she identified a pair of panties<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as those she was wearing on the night of the alleged assault. The state had no objection to their admission as the panties she wore that night. The jury was excused and the state objected that the admission should not encompass any stains on them or any laboratory reports concerning them. The court admitted them as a full exhibit without any limitation. During the voir dire examination, C admitted to defense counsel that she had had \u201csexual activity\u201d with her boyfriend within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>two or three days prior to the alleged assault. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection to the admission of such evidence. Later in the trial, the defendant introduced evidence through Dr. Abraham Stolman, the state toxicologist, that there was a seminal stain on the panties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The evidence adduced from C was equivocal on the matter of whether the defendant had ejaculated during the alleged assault.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The defendant argues that our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 400 A.2d 276 (1978), is dispositive. The state also relies <em>on Mastropetre </em>to sustain the challenged ruling. The defendant argues that <em>Mastropetre </em>clearly implies that, in the limited circumstances of this case, inquiry into C\u2019s prior sexual relations within the two or three day period preceding the assault, in order to impeach her credibility, is an exception to the general rule which excludes evidence of prior sexual relations. It appears that he intended, by such inquiry, to attack her credibility by showing that someone else was responsible for the semen on the panties.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was correct for any one of several reasons. The first is that, under <em>Mastropetre, </em>a condition precedent to the admission of prior sexual activity evidence is that the documentary evidence of the semen involved must be introduced <em>before </em>cross-examination concerning prior sexual activity of the victim is proper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 520. This is in accord with our statement in <em>Mastropetre </em>that a \u201c \u2018cross-examination as to the contents of a document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and questions at least relating to, if not actually involving, the contents of the document should not be permitted unless the writing is in evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 520. In this case, however, the laboratory report of Dr. Stolman identifying the stain on the panties as semen did not come into evidence until sometime <em>after </em>the defendant had introduced the panties and he had sought to cross-examine C on her prior sexual activity. The court\u2019s ruling finds support on this basis even though the court did not rely on this particular analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 93; <em>Witek </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>132 Conn. 104, 110, 42 A.2d 843 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is also flawed because he failed to lay a proper foundation to establish the relevancy of the excluded evidence in the first instance. In <em>Mastropetre, </em>quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>163 Conn. 241, 243, 304 A.2d 36 (1972), we said: \u201cOne fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 517. A proper foundation must be laid for the admission of evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Saia, </em>167 Conn. 286, 291, 355 A.2d 88 (1974). The defendant did not adduce any evidence that the stained panties that C was wearing at the time of the alleged assault were the same ones she had been wearing two or three days earlier at the time of her sexual activity with her boyfriend.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This defect itself justifies the ruling of the trial court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the evidentiary predicate for an attack on C\u2019s credibility was not at all established.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We agree with the state\u2019s argument on the context of relevancy that even had the semen on the panties been identified as having been that of C\u2019s boyfriend, that would not have rendered her prior sexual activity admissible because to do so would have to have been based on some evidence that semen had been deposited by the attacker who assaulted C. Because there was neither testimonial nor forensic evidence of that, no issue of relevancy really arose as to the origin of the seminal stain on the panties. McCormick observes: \u201cIn sum, relevant evidence is evidence that in some degree advances the inquiry. It is material and probative.\u201d McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 185, p. 544. The evidence excluded would not have advanced the determination of the inquiry in this case. Moreover, to have it admitted would have subjected C to embarrassment and humiliation which the law of evidence now wisely surrounds with structured safeguards. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 487 A.2d 545 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\"> The second count of the information had originally charged the defendant with kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 and he was found guilty of the lesser included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> Porter became involved in the investigation of the assault on the morning of February 3, 1980, at which time he interviewed the victim C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> C\u2019s sister was the third witness to testify under the constancy of accusation exception and the defendant objected to her testimony not only on the grounds of hearsay but also that it was repetitious and prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> The trial court carefully cautioned the jury, on each of those four occasions, as to the limited use of the admission of the constancy of accusation evidence. In addition, it also did so when it charged the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\"> The sole authority to which the defendant refers is a passage from 3A Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1970) \u00a7 924a from which he quotes selected portions of that passage. An examination of that passage is not helpful to the defendant. It notes that modern psychiatrists have \u201camply studied\u201d the \u201cpsychic complexes\u201d of the behavior of \u201cerrant young girls and women ... 3A Wigmore, supra. It opines that one form taken by such complexes is \u201cthat of contriving false charges of sexual offenses by men.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The passage makes the ultimate point that \u201c[n]o judge should ever let a sex offense charge go to the jury unless the female complainant\u2019s social history and mental makeup have been examined and testified to by a qualified physician.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">This passage is not persuasive. The view expressed therein that the complaining witness should <em>always </em>be subject to such an examination hardly enjoys widespread acceptance. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>325 N.W.2d 169, 171 (N.D. 1982), the North Dakota Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\u201cSome authorities have suggested that the complaining witness, in a case relating to a sex offense, should <em>always </em>be compelled to submit to a psychiatric examination. See, 3A, Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 924a (Chadbourn rev. 1970). However, later case law, in what seems to be a majority of states, does not follow this concept.

This statute, which eommendably serves to protect the victim\u2019s sexual privacy, allows her to testify in court under circumstances that guard against her undue embarrassment and is highly desirable legislation and is not at all inconsistent with the constancy of accusation exception.
