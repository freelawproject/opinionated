In his appeal, the defendant raises three issues: the propriety of the standard applied by the court in its rejection of the defense of self-defense; the sufficiency of the evidence to support rejection of the defense of self-defense; and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the rejection of the defense of defense-of-premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The trial court\u2019s judgment that the defendant was guilty of the crime with which he had been charged was supported by an oral memorandum of decision specifically addressing self-defense under \u00a7 53a-19 and a written memorandum of decision clarifying the court\u2019s conclusion with respect to \u00a7 53a-20. In these two memoranda the court found the following facts. On the evening of January 2, 1982, the defendant was visiting at his sister\u2019s apartment to watch her television. The decedent, Jeremiah Sharp, entered the apartment, obviously drunk, staggering and argumentative. The decedent and the defendant\u2019s sister had been living together for a number of years but had recently quarreled, and the decedent had come to remove his belongings from the apartment. The decedent and the defendant\u2019s sister engaged in a heated argument which the defendant endeavored to stop. There followed a confrontation between the defendant and the decedent about the decedent\u2019s continued presence on the premises. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>defendant observed the decedent reaching inside his jacket and noticed a pistol in the decedent\u2019s waistband. Although the defendant was smaller than the decedent, he was younger, alert and sober, and he succeeded in disarming the decedent as the latter was drawing the pistol from his belt. The decedent then armed himself with a steak knife and advanced toward the defendant with the knife raised. The defendant backed up, and fired a shot hitting the decedent in the left ankle. The defendant then fired a second shot causing the fatal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The trial court, in its oral memorandum of decision, concluded that this evidence sufficiently raised the defense of self-defense under \u00a7 53a-19 to impose upon the state the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense was unavailing. It specifically found that the decedent\u2019s effort to attack the defendant would cause a reasonable person to believe that the attacker was about to slash him, and that such a slashing could constitute great bodily harm. The court concluded nonetheless that the state had met its burden of proof because \u201cthe defendant, having had the ability to disarm [the decedent] of the revolver could easily have disarmed him, or could have retreated, and avoided him at the time when he was wielding the steak knife.\u201d The court made no subordinate findings of fact to substantiate this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Upon the motion of the defendant, the trial court filed a written memorandum of decision to clarify its conclusion with regard to self-defense under \u00a7 53a-20. Insofar as it is relevant to this case, \u00a7 53a-20 justifies the use of deadly physical force when a person privileged to be upon the premises, reasonably believing that force is necessary \u201cto prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass,\u201d uses deadly physical force \u201c(1) in defense of a person as prescribed in section 53a-19, or (2) when he reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>believes it is necessary to prevent an attempt by the trespasser to commit . . . any act of violence . . . Without determining whether the decedent\u2019s presence in the apartment of the defendant\u2019s sister constituted a criminal trespass, the court found that neither of the relevant subordinate conditions authorizing deadly physical force had been demonstrated. Consistently with the conclusion it had earlier reached in its oral memorandum, the court reiterated that the defendant\u2019s use of deadly physical force was not \u201cin defense of a person [as] described in Sec. 53a-19\u201d because \u201cit was established beyond a reasonable doubt that the decedent in his condition was not capable of using deadly force once he was disarmed.\u201d The court further concluded that there was no credible evidence that the defendant \u201creasonably believed [such force] necessary to prevent the decedent from committing a crime of violence.\u201d The court made no further findings of fact with reference to these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The parties are in substantial agreement that the statutes that codify the rights of self-defense and defense-of-premises focus on the perspective of the person claiming these defenses. The self-defense statute, in \u00a7 53a-19 (a), permits the use of deadly physical force only when \u201cthe actor reasonably believes that [his attacker] is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d As we have repeatedly noted, this language presents a question of fact about what the defendant himself reasonably believed about his exposure to jeopardy under the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). Similar language in \u00a7 53a-19 (b) requires recourse to retreat in lieu of the use of physical force only when the actor himself \u201cknows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The defense-of-premises statute, \u00a7 53a-20, since it refers to what \u201che reasonably believes,\u201d likewise refers to the perception of the person alleged to have been using deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The defendant claims, however, that the factual findings of the trial court do not justify its judgment because the court\u2019s findings do not address the evidence at trial from his perspective. The trial court rejected the defense of self-defense despite its finding that the decedent, armed with his steak knife, approached the defendant in a manner \u201cwhich would cause a reasonable person to believe that he was about to slash him.\u201d Although there was conflicting evidence at trial about such critical matters as the location of the combatants at the time of their confrontation, the defendant\u2019s own perception of his peril, and the defendant\u2019s efforts to avoid the use of deadly physical force, the court failed to make any factual findings to identify what led it to conclude that the defendant himself reasonably believed that he could safely disarm the decedent or retreat. The trial court concluded that the defense-of-premises defense had been refuted without finding whether the decedent was a criminal trespasser or whether the defendant was privileged to be on the premises. On this state of the record, we cannot determine whether the state has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime of manslaughter. For the proper disposition of this case, it is necessary for us to order a remand to the trial court for further articulation of the grounds on which it determined that the state had proved the inapplicability of the defenses of self-defense and defense-of-premises.

Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982). The trial court is directed to file a supplemental memorandum of decision answering the following questions and articulating the factual basis for its answers: (1) Was the defendant\u2019s use of force excessive because he reasonably believed that he could have disarmed the decedent? (2) Was the defendant\u2019s use of force excessive because he knew that he could retreat with complete safety? (3) Was the decedent on the premises as a criminal trespasser? (4) Was the defendant a person privileged to be in or upon the premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The case is remanded to the trial court with direction to file a memorandum of decision in accordance \u25a0with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-55. manslaughter in the first degree: class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-55a. manslaughter in the first degree WITH A FIREARM: CLASS B FELONY: ONE YEAR NOT SUSPENDABLE.
