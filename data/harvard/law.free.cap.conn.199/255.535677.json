Harrell, was convicted, after a jury trial, of burglary in the second degree with a firearm, in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-102a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and attempted robbery in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction on these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendant raises three issues on appeal. He claims that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion in limine to prevent impeachment by the use of evidence of prior convictions; (2) the ruling on the motion in limine effectively precluded the exercise of his state and federal constitutional right to testify; and (3) the trial court erred in its jury instructions on identification. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts relevant to this appeal: On March 20, 1981, at approximately 7 p.m., the Crawford family returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to their Guilford home from a restaurant and found an unfamiliar car parked in their circular driveway. John Crawford, the father, parked behind the vehicle and he and his wife Catherine exited their car and approached the other vehicle, a red and black Chevrolet. Their three children, ages 12,11, and 9, remained in the back seat of their car. No one was in the Chevrolet. The Craw-fords heard the sound of breaking glass and decided to leave the area. Before they could do so, the defendant approached them from the side of the house, ordered Catherine Crawford to \u201cget [her] hands up,\u201d and then ordered the family into their house. He held a flashlight in his left hand, but he kept his right hand in his pocket, telling them that he had a \u201cpistol.\u201d The Crawford family, however, never saw a weapon. John Crawford turned the lights on in the foyer of the house but the defendant ordered him to turn them off. The children remained in the kitchen of the home while the defendant questioned their parents in the foyer about valuables. The defendant did not take the stereo or television, the small amount of cash, or the credit cards that the Crawfords offered him. Throughout the five to ten minute confrontation, John Crawford was unable to make out the defendant\u2019s features because the defendant was shining a flashlight into his eyes. He was able, however, to determine that the intruder was a black male, approximately six feet tall. Several times the defendant gestured and said that \u201cCrazy Tommy\u201d was with him, that \u201cCrazy Tommy\u201d was uncontrollable and he ordered \u201cTommy\u201d to \u201ccome up.\u201d The defendant became nervous and concerned that someone had seen his license plate. Without taking any of the Crawfords\u2019 property, the defendant started to leave. As he approached his car, he turned to the left and called: \u201cCome up, Tommy. It is okay.\u201d No one ever saw a second individual. After the defendant was in his car, friends of the Crawfords drove into the circu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>lar driveway and blocked his exit. The defendant yelled to have that car moved out of his way and Catherine Crawford ran to the car, removed a girl from the car and told the girl\u2019s father to leave. Both drivers then drove out of the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Michael, the twelve year old son of Catherine and John Crawford, memorized the license plate number and color of the burglar\u2019s car (\u201cred [with] black roof\u201d) and, once in the kitchen, wrote this information on his hand with a pen. Catherine Crawford also memorized the license plate number. Michael and Catherine were able to give a description of the defendant to the police who arrived at their home immediately afterward. By using the license plate number memorized by Michael, the police were able to determine that the vehicle was registered to the defendant. At a photo array four days later, Michael and Catherine independently selected the defendant\u2019s photo as the man who had burglarized their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">At trial, after the state had rested, the defendant made a motion for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial court denied. The defendant then filed a written motion in limine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting that, if he should testify, the court prohibit the state from using for impeachment purposes the defendant\u2019s prior convictions in 1971 for two counts of robbery with violence and in 1976 for attempted burglary in the third degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ment on the motion, defense counsel orally amended his motion so that it included a total of four prior convictions, two counts of robbery with violence and one count each of forgery and attempted false pretenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The release date from incarceration for the two 1971 robbery convictions was June 29, 1973, which was \u201cnine years, three months, one day\u201d from the date the motion was argued in court. The trial court denied the motion. The defendant did not testify, and the jury returned guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendant could be impeached with his two prior convictions for robbery with violence was an abuse of discretion because of their prejudicial impact and remoteness in time to the present crimes. A criminal defendant who has previously been convicted of a crime carrying a term of imprisonment of more than one year may be impeached by the state if his credibility is in issue. General Statutes \u00a7 52-145 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>194 Conn. 297, 307, 481 A.2d 413 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1112, 105 S. Ct. 793, 83 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>513, 521, 447 A.2d 396 (1982); <em>Heating Acceptance Corporation </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>152 Conn. 467, 472, 208 A.2d 341 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>trial court\u2019s decision denying a motion to exclude a witness\u2019 prior record, offered to attack his credibility, will be upset only if the court abused its discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 623, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 10-11, 291 A.2d 240 (1971). This court has identified three factors that should be analyzed in order to determine whether a prior conviction is to be admitted: \u201c(1) the extent of the prejudice likely to arise; (2) the significance of the commission of the particular crime in indicating untruthfulness; and (3) its remoteness in time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We recognize that \u201c[wjhere the prior crime is quite similar to the offense being tried, a high degree of prejudice is created and a strong showing of probative value would be necessary to warrant admissibility.\u201d Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 642-43, 458 A.2d 379 (1983). \u201cThere is, of course, no per se rule prohibiting impeachment of a defendant by proof of a prior conviction of a crime similar to that for which he is being tried when that prior conviction is offered to attack his credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 622. The trial court specifically noted, after the state\u2019s case-in-chief and prior to argument on the motion in limine, that the case \u201cboil[ed] down at this point to a pure question of credibility. That being, was the defendant there that night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>or was he not.\u201d While there is some similarity between the defendant\u2019s two prior convictions for robbery with violence and burglary in the second degree and attempted robbery in the first degree, this similarity, standing alone, does not necessarily create prejudice which outweighs probative value. \u201cIn moving to bar introduction of prior convictions a defendant in a criminal case bears the burden of demonstrating the specific harm that will occur if the convictions are introduced.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>supra, 308. The trial court must undertake a balancing test to determine if the probative value of the prior convictions outweighs any prejudicial impact. \u201c \u2018This balancing of intangibles \u2014probative values against probative dangers\u2014is so much a matter where wise judges in particular situations may differ that a lee-way of discretion is generally recognized.\u2019 McCormick, Evidence, pp. 319-320.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>supra, 10; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 522, 528. As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>supra, \u201cthe record indicates that the defendant\u2019s argument in support of his motion amounted to little more than a perfunctory recitation of the prior conviction, a conclusory statement as to its prejudicial effect, and a request for a ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">While in this case the defendant also argued the third <em>Nardini </em>factor, the remoteness in time of the conviction, the trial court, well within its discretion and in considering all the factors, determined that \u201cremoteness is not really involved here.\u201d Acknowledging that the rule in Connecticut is moving closer to the federal ten year rule, the trial court deemed a nine year old release date to satisfy the remoteness in time factor. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 526. In addition, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe prejudice is [not] that great,\u201d specifically noting that \u201cthe larceny which is the underlying crime in any robbery does go directly to the credibility of the robber or larcener . . . .\u201d See, <em>e.g., State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 499, 481 A.2d 741 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 526. As we have noted, \u201ccrimes involving larcenous intent imply a general disposition toward dishonesty,\u201d and convictions for this type of crime \u201cobviously bear heavily on the credibility of one who has been convicted of them. The probative value of such convictions, therefore, may often outweigh any prejudice engendered by their admission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 12, 480 A.2d 489 (1984). Thus, robbery with violence is a crime which is relevant to the defendant\u2019s character for truthfulness and veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The trial court sufficiently reflected upon and weighed the three factors enunciated in <em>Nardini </em>and its ruling on the motion in limine cannot be said to have been an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion in limine effectively precluded him from exercising his constitutional right to testify as guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution and the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. We do not agree. We recognize that a defendant may be faced with the dilemma of either testifying and facing the possibility of impeachment by prior convictions or not taking the stand and thus not personally being able to present his version of the events to the jury. Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the constitutional right to testify does not carry with it a right to prohibit impeachment by prior convictions. See <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 215, 91 S. Ct. 1454, 28 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1971); <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 561, 87 S. Ct. 648, 17 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1967); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 155, 78 S. Ct. 622, 2 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1958); <em>People </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>197 Colo. 126, 589 P.2d 1368 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>413 A.2d 300, 303 (N.H. 1980). In <em>McGautha, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cIt is not thought overly harsh in such situations to require that the determination whether to waive the privilege take into account the matters which may be brought out on cross-examination. . . . Again, it is not thought inconsistent with the enlightened administration of criminal justice to require the defendant to weigh such pros and cons in deciding whether to testify.\u201d <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 215. \u201cA defendant may decide not to take the witness stand because of the risk of cross-examination. But this is a choice of litigation tactics.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 238, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The defendant claims that his decision not to testify at trial was directly related to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine. As a result of the ruling, the defendant argues, he was prevented from exercising his fundamental right to present a defense, specifically his alibi defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the defendant\u2019s motion in limine is not reviewable on appeal if the defendant does not testify at trial. The state argues that the ruling on a motion in limine is merely provisional, an \u201cadvisory, tentative indication of what the court is likely to do if faced with the same situation during trial . . . thereby allowing a defendant a more intelligent exercise of his fifth amendment rights\u201d and allowing him to \u201cavert the possibility of impeachment, if he so chooses.\u201d The state also claims that there is \u201cno indication whatsoever\u201d on the record that the defendant represented to the trial court that his decision on whether to testify hinged on the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>defendant, in his reply brief, claims that the statement in his written motion in limine that he was \u201cdesirous of testifying in his own defense\u201d is a sufficient indication that the defendant intended to testify.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">For the purposes of this appeal and because of our disposition of the first issue, we will follow the ruling of <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S. Ct. 460, 83 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1984), prospectively only. That ruling is not to be made applicable to our disposition of this case. In the case before us, the defendant was faced with possible impeachment by the introduction of evidence of his convictions of four prior felonies. On appeal, he alleges a constitutional error because the ruling, at least as to the two robbery convictions, caused him to forego testifying. While this court has previously reviewed on appeal trial courts\u2019 rulings on motions in limine on the admissibility of prior convictions; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 621; <em>State </em>v. <em>Iasevoli, </em>188 Conn. 325, 326-27, 449 A.2d 996 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 529; we have decided to follow the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <em>Luce </em>court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Burger, held that to \u201craise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>a defendant must testify.\u201d <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 43. The reasons for requiring the defendant to testify are several. If the defendant testifies at his trial and then challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of impeachment evidence, the reviewing court \u201cwould then have had a complete record detailing the nature of [the appellant\u2019s] testimony, the scope of the cross-examination, and the possible impact of the impeachment on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Id., 41. In addition, <em>Luce </em>acknowledged that a reviewing court is particularly \u201chandicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context. This is particularly true [where a court is called upon] to weigh the probative value of a prior conviction against the prejudicial effect to the defendant.\u201d Id. Therefore, to accomplish this balancing, \u201cthe court must know the precise nature of the defendant\u2019s testimony, which is unknowable when . . . the defendant does not testify.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Although we follow <em>Luce </em>prospectively, reference to the defendant\u2019s trial demonstrates why it is judicious to do so. The defendant did not testify at his trial because, as he now claims, he did not want to be impeached with evidence of his prior crimes. On appeal, he challenges the admissibility of only the two robbery convictions. A reviewing court is unable to determine accurately that the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify was solely the result of the ruling as to the robbery convictions and not because of the ruling as to his convictions for forgery and attempted false pretenses. There was scant evidence that the defendant would have offered any testimony had the motion been granted and no evidence at all that the trial court was unwilling to consider altering the ruling on the basis of the defendant\u2019s actual trial testimony. \u201cAny possible harm flowing from a [trial] court\u2019s in limine ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly specula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tive. The ruling is subject to change when the case unfolds, particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was contained in the defendant\u2019s proffer. Indeed even if nothing unexpected happens at trial, the [trial] judge is free, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, to alter a previous in limine ruling.\u201d Id., 41-42. \u201cBecause an accused\u2019s decision whether to testify \u2018seldom turns on the resolution of one factor\u2019 ... a reviewing court cannot assume that the adverse ruling motivated a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.\u201d Id., 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We follow <em>Luce </em>prospectively in order that those defendants who have relied on previous decisions of this court that did not require a defendant to testify will not be prejudiced by this rule. We look to the three factors outlined in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S. Ct. 349, 30 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971), to demonstrate that a retroactive application of the <em>Luce </em>holding would be substantially unjust. See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 639, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1965)(holding that the rule of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 [1961], does not apply retroactively to state court convictions which were already final before the decision was published). Our ruling today satisfies the first factor delineated in <em>Chevron </em>because it \u201cestablishes] a new principle of law . . . by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>supra, 106; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Conn. 515, 518A, 450 A.2d 361 (1982). The second factor is \u201c \u2018whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>supra, 106-107. The Ninth Circuit case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Givens, </em>767 F.2d 574, 578 (9th Cir. 1985), is instructive on this second factor. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>767 F.2d 72 (3d Cir. 1985) (appeals court applied holding of <em>Luce </em>retroactively for the defendant). The facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>of <em>Givens </em>are analogous to the facts of the case before us. In <em>Givens, </em>the defendant\u2019s trial preceded the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Luce. </em>At his trial, the defendant sought to preserve for appellate review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction and did so as required \u201cby the law of the [Ninth] Circuit\u201d at the time of his trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Givens, </em>supra, 577, 578. The defendant did not testify at trial. The Ninth Circuit stated that although \u201capplication of the <em>Luce </em>principle to the present case arguably would further the purpose of the rule by providing the trial court with concrete testimony on which to base its ruling . . . the first and third factors militate so strongly against retroactive application that they outweigh the second factor.\u201d Id., 578. The third <em>Chevron </em>factor is whether applying the new decision retroactively will produce substantial inequitable results. <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>supra, 107. As did the court in <em>Givens, </em>we refuse here to impose a \u201csubsequently-created [requirement] for preserving a claim on appeal on a defendant who did all that was necessary to comply with the law applicable at the time of his trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Givens, </em>supra, 579; see <em>Reed v. Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 596, 236 A.2d 909 (1967); <em>Chykirda </em>v. <em>Yanush, </em>131 Conn. 565, 569, 41 A.2d 449 (1945). To do otherwise would produce a substantially inequitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in failing to give the requested \u201cmodel\u201d <em>Telf aire </em>instruction on identification.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552 (D.C. Cir. 1972). The defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that the trial court granted his request to charge on this issue<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but failed to give the requested instruction. He claims that the failure to instruct on the <em>Telfaire </em>charge constituted reversible error because it violated his right to an \u201cadequately instructed jury.\u201d The defendant also argues that this failure to charge violated Practice Book \u00a7 852<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and constituted reversible error. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cWhen a proper request is filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852 or exception is taken pursuant to \u00a7 854 the test is whether the charge properly covered the substance of the written request or properly and adequately covered the specific subject matter of the exception.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 561, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). \u201cThe trial court is not under a duty in a criminal proceeding to charge in the identical language requested if its charge is accurate, adequate and, in substance, properly includes material portions of the defendant\u2019s request; its responsibility is performed when it gives instructions to the jury in a manner calculated to give them a clear understanding of the issues presented for their consideration, under the offenses charged and upon the evidence, and when its instructions are suited to their guidance in the determination of those issues.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 322-23, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978). The defendant concedes that <em>Telfaire </em>instructions \u201cneed not be given verbatim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>to ensure that the attention of the jury is properly guided.\u201d The instruction<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> given by the trial judge covered the substance of the written request. While the instruction did not delineate specific factors for the jury to consider in assessing identification testimony in such detail as in <em>Telfaire, </em>it did caution the jury to \u201cconsider carefully whether or not that witness is accurate in his belief and in his testimony.\u201d It told the jury that the \u201cvagaries\u201d of eyewitness identification were \u201cwell-known\u201d and that the jury should receive such testimony \u201cwith caution\u201d and consider it \u201ccarefully.\u201d In focusing the jury\u2019s attention to such testimony, the court also instructed it to \u201cscrutinize with care all such eyewitness identifications.\u201d The jury was also charged to \u201cconsider what opportunity each person had to make an observation, whether or not that person had seen the defendant before and all of the other circumstances surrounding such observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Further, we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that identification was the \u201csole material element of the crimes in substantial dispute.\u201d Two witnesses, Catherine Crawford and her son Michael, were independently able to select the defendant from a photographic array as well as to make an in-court identification at trial. The factual circumstances of this case indicate that this is not a case that exhibits \u201cthe special difficulties often presented by identification testimony that would require additional information be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>given to the jury in order ... to repose confidence in their ability to evaluate the reliability of the identification.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>supra, 556. The eyewitnesses were not \u201cuncertain, unclear or inconsistent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>supra, 322. The defendant\u2019s claim that the eyewitnesses\u2019 description of the defendant to the police as \u201ccleanshaven\u201d was inconsistent with subsequent photographic and courtroom identifications of the defendant who had facial hair does not, in and of itself, mandate more detailed instructions. There was extensive cross-examination of the eyewitnesses by defense counsel as to their ability to see and identify the individual who committed the robbery. We note that in <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 582, 469 A.2d 397 (1983), the defendant had also requested the \u201cmodel\u201d <em>Telfaire </em>instruction. In <em>McKnight, </em>the trial court did not adopt verbatim the <em>Telfaire </em>instruction but did give an instruction which \u201cadequately covered the dangers of misidentification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>supra, 583. As in <em>McKnight, </em>the charge as given here was adequate to address the \u201cdangers of misidentification\u201d under the facts of this case, especially when the main focus of the trial was a \u201cpure question of credibility.\u201d The specific instructions given to the jury were a correct statement of the law, and our review indicates that the charge as a whole fairly presented the case to the jury so \u201cthat injustice was not done under the law to the legal rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 586, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>supra, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In this opinion Dannehy, Santaniello and Callahan, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree with a firearm when he commits burglary in the second degree as provided in section 53a-102, and in the commission of such offense he uses or is armed with and threatens to use or displays or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm.

Under the balancing test we have approved; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 521, 447 A.2d 396 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>160 Conn. 47, 52, 273 A.2d 689 (1970); the prejudicial effect of these crimes was quite substantial in view of their similarity to the offenses charged in the present case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 642-44, 458 A.2d 379 (1983). \u201cWhere the prior crime is quite similar to the offense being tried, a high degree of prejudice is created and a strong showing of probative value would be necessary to warrant admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 522. The probative value of the robbery convictions, however, was slight, not only because their age barely falls within the ten year federal limitation we have referred to as a \u201crough bench mark\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 526; Fed. R. Evid., rule 609 (a); but also because of the minimal significance of these convictions as reflecting upon the credibility of the defendant in comparison to his convictions in 1976 for forgery and attempted larceny by false pretenses, which were also available for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The forgery and false pretense convictions clearly involved dishonesty and falsehood and, therefore, were highly significant upon the credibility of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 644. The slight additional significance on credibility the remote convictions for robbery may have had was clearly outweighed by the substantial prejudice their use entailed because of their similarity to the crimes on trial. Since the substantial prejudicial effect of the robbery convictions cannot be gainsaid and their probative value on the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility is only marginal at best, a proper application of the balancing test, with all due deference to trial court discretion, plainly required exclusion of those convictions from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Although I would find error in the refusal of the trial court to bar the use of the robbery convictions, I am persuaded that the error was harmless. The applicable standard for this nonconstitutional error is the probability of a different outcome. <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>190 Conn. 576, 588-89, 462 A.2d 1011 (1983). \u201cThe erroneous admission of the [conviction] was harmful only if the improper [evidence] was likely to have affected the jury's verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>187 Conn. 602, 611, 447 A.2d 734 (1982). The testimony that two witnesses, the mother and her son, had separately observed and memorized the license plate on the car found to have been registered in the name of the defendant, as well as their independent selection of him as the offender from photo arrays that are unchallenged, is overwhelming evidence of guilt that more than adequately satisfies this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
