Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUg\">The principal issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting the motion to quash the three respondents\u2019 subpoena that sought records from a sexual assault counselor who assisted the victim at a rape crisis center because of the statutory privilege accorded by General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k. The respondents Robert H. and Richard C. additionally raise the issue of whether there was sufficient evidence of intent to prove they had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-8. The respondent Blair P. also raises two issues: (1) whether he was adjudged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>delinquent without sufficient evidence and without required findings; and (2) whether the trial court made a disposition of him without the required findings under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">This case arises out of an adjudication of delinquency and a commitment of the respondents, Blair, Richard and Robert, to the custody of the department of children and youth services (DCYS) for a period not to exceed one year. The three juveniles, all fourteen or fifteen years old,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were adjudicated delinquent on the charge of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The three juveniles entered denials to the charges and a joint adjudication hearing was held before the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J. </em>The evidence adduced at the hearing included the following: The fourteen year old victim, T, and two friends, Mary Ann and Kristi, were at the apartment of Mary Ann\u2019s parents in the afternoon on January 15, 1984. While at the apartment, Mary Ann\u2019s brother, the respondent Richard, and the other two respondents, Blair and Robert, arrived as did two other girls, Kim and Brenda. The victim testified that they listened to records and danced in the living room. Mary Ann and Brenda testified that T was \u201cgrabbing\u201d the \u201cprivate parts\u201d and buttocks of Richard and Blair. Kim and Brenda left during the course of the afternoon. The victim testified that Blair and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>were in Mary Ann\u2019s bedroom and that \u201cBlair wanted to fool around and stuff like that and I wasn\u2019t willing.\u201d At this point, Richard and Robert entered the room and helped Blair remove T\u2019s pants and hide them. T said she was \u201ckicking and screaming for Mary Ann and Kristi\u201d but that they did not respond. Either Richard or Robert came into the room and helped Blair in his attempt to keep T\u2019s legs apart. Blair then inserted his finger into T\u2019s vagina. A detective, however, who was one of the officers assigned to investigate the incident, testified that a written statement taken from T on the night of the assault in the hospital stated: \u201c[Blair] kissed me, touched my breasts, and he put his fingers in my vagina.\u201d T, however, testified that this first incident of sexual activity occurred while she was \u201cresisting\u201d and \u201ckicking.\u201d Because she still refused Blair\u2019s advances, T testified, Blair called Robert and Richard into the room and Robert squirted baby oil on her. She put on a robe and started to go into another bedroom to clean herself in an adjoining bathroom. At this point, she was pulled down onto the bed. When the lights were turned on, she saw the three respondents standing there. The telephone rang and Blair left the room. T sat up and she yelled to Kristi that if it was her father on the phone to relay the message that she had already left \u201cbecause [she] figured that they\u2019d let [her] go because they might have thought [her] dad would come looking for [her].\u201d Blair walked into the room carrying a broom. Robert was holding the victim\u2019s feet and Richard was holding her arms. Blair then pushed the broom \u201cvery hard\u201d into her vagina. The juveniles then returned her pants. She dressed, left the apartment and walked home. She telephoned Mary Ann when she reached her home because she was in \u201ca lot of pain.\u201d She told her mother \u201cwhat happened\u201d and her parents took her to the hospital where she had to undergo an operation for an injury received during the second incident of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Three of the girls who were at the apartment testified that they did not hear T scream, yell, or call out, during the time that T was in the bedroom with Blair. Mary Ann and Kristi testified that they each saw Blair in the kitchen holding a broom. Mary Ann also testified that before \u201ceverybody had went into that room with [T]\u201d she saw Blair in the kitchen \u201cwiping [the broomstick] with a napkin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The trial court made several findings. The court determined that \u201cthe over-all attitude prevailing in the [apartment] the afternoon of January [15], 1984, was one of frivolity and sexual expressions, especially as it involved [T] and the three Respondents. . . . It is also clear that all three boys participated in the events that occurred in the bedroom of [Richard\u2019s mother]. The Court can also be reasonably satisfied that [T] continued to be a willing participant, continuing against feigned protestations. Granting all that counsel has said in defense as being true up to this point, granting that she was willing up to this point, the Court still feels that until [sic] the introduction of the broom into the scene that the complexion and atmosphere completely changed. . . . The Court does find that the testimony of [T] in this respect is credible and, as it relates to [Blair], is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he did penetrate the vagina of [T] with a broom without her consent and by use of force in the nature of assistance of [Robert] and [Richard] and their physically restraining her and holding her down while the act was consummated.\u201d The trial court specifically acknowledged that defense counsel \u201cthoroughly and exhaustively cross-examined [T] on claimed inaccuracies in the Court testimony as compared to written statements attributed to her and marked in Evidence.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201c[s]uffice to say that the Court has reflected on her in-Court testimony and found that it was consistent throughout. Further, close examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of the claimed inconsistencies between in-Court testimony and her written statements show that they are more in the nature of amplifications, qualifications or explanations of the written statements and not truly inconsistencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The respondents claim that it was because of \u201cyet other inconsistent statements made by\u201d T that they sought to introduce the records from the rape crisis center. The respondents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> issued a subpoena duces tecum to Debbie Kemlage of the Women\u2019s Center of Greater Danbury. An attorney for the center filed a motion to quash the subpoena because of the testimonial privilege created by Public Acts 1983, No. 83-429, now General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respondents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>offer of proof was that the evidence sought from the center\u2019s records would show that there were \u201csubstantial inconsistencies\u201d in T\u2019s testimony and that T was \u201ccoached in her testimony.\u201d In support of their subpoena, the respondents cited the state and federal constitutions, specifically the fifth and fourteenth amendment rights to due process and the sixth amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ment right to compulsory process to the federal constitution and the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution. The respondents stated that the privilege claimed by the counselor was only a legislative enactment and that it \u201cmust of necessity fall in lieu of the Federal and State constitutions.\u201d The respondents also requested proof that the center and the counselor had met the requirements of the statute before asserting the privilege. The attorney for the center informed the court that the supervisor of the rape crisis center, who would be able to testify and present the necessary documents to qualify the center under the statute, was unavailable. The court continued the hearing on the motion to quash until the next week and the center\u2019s attorney withdrew the motion to quash at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On March 20, 1984, the court resumed the hearing and the center\u2019s attorney again moved to quash the subpoena. The center called as its first witness Susan Jamison, the coordinator of the rape crisis center, and offered testimony for the purpose of qualifying the center and its counselors, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k, on such subjects as training, services and the purpose of the center. The defense sought to question Jamison as to whether she was the individual who counseled T. The attorney for the center objected, stating that the identity of the counselor could not be divulged under the statute. Defense counsel then argued that that portion of the statute that requires the privileged statements to have been given to a \u201cproperly qualified counselor\u201d could not be established. The trial court agreed, calling it a \u201cCatch 22\u201d situation, and \u201cthe type of Public Act that needs more work\u201d because \u201cjust to get to the point as to whether or not an exception exists, the very information that the statute indicates should not be divulged would almost seem to be absolutely necessary to know whether that exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>exists.\u201d Nevertheless, the court sustained the objection to the question as to the identity of the counselor. The trial court found that the records fell within the statutory privilege and that the blanket prohibition of the statute precluded the respondents\u2019 review of the records. The court found that the rape crisis center and its files qualified under the statute and that the defense did not make a showing that one of the exceptions in \u00a7 52-146k (e) applied and therefore granted the motion to quash. The respondents took exceptions to the trial court\u2019s ruling. On appeal, the respondents claim that the privilege was improperly invoked because none of the definitional elements could be established with respect to the counselor who received communications from T and because it violated their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We agree with the respondents that if the identity of the sexual assault counselor cannot be disclosed under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (b), then it would always be impossible to determine whether the statutory criteria set out in \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5) were satisfied with respect to that sexual assault counselor. The conflict arises between \u00a7 52-146k (b), which prohibits the disclosure of the identity of that counselor \u201cin any civil or criminal case,\u201d and \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5), which sets forth the criteria which must be satisfied by such a sexual assault counselor in order to qualify for the privilege under the statute, the existence of which is the dominant purpose of the statute. Whatever may be said to have been the legislative purpose for absolutely prohibiting the identity of a \u201cbattered women\u2019s counselor,\u201d the legislature did, in \u00a7 52-146k (b), extend that prohibition to sexual assault counselors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The legislature, as noted, set forth criteria that a sexual assault counselor must fulfill in order to qualify the communications from a \u201cvictim,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 52-146k (a), as confidential under the privilege the statute creates. Unfortunately, the legislature has created by the plain language of the statute a situation that imposes a condition precedent to the very invocation of the privilege which is impossible of fulfillment because of the identity proviso in \u00a7 52-146k (b). We do not believe that the legislature intended such a result given the dominant intent of \u00a7 52-146k to create a privilege. On the one hand, the language of \u00a7 52-146k (b) disables the successful invocation of the privilege because the statute prohibits the disclosure of the identity of the sexual assault counselor who counseled the victim to prove qualification under \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5). On the other hand, one in the position of the respondents would never be able to demonstrate that the privilege should not be permitted to be invoked because the identity bar of \u00a7 52-146k (b) would prevent them from determining whether that counselor had <em>not </em>satisfied the criteria set out in \u00a7 52-146 (a) (5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>We approach this issue keeping in mind that \u201c[i]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that a statute is not to be construed so as to thwart its purpose.\u201d <em>Narel </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>185 Conn. 562, 571, 441 A.2d 177 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928, 102 S. Ct. 1974, 72 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1982); see <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 31, 357 A.2d 498 (1975). The obvious intent and the dominant purpose of this statute is to grant a privilege to confidential communications between a sexual assault counselor or a battered women\u2019s counselor and a victim. 26 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1983 Sess., pp. 3783-84, and 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15,1983 Sess., pp. 5279-85. Incident to that purpose was, it was fair to say, an intention to protect or keep anonymous the identity of counselors who might be sought to testify \u201cin any civil or criminal proceeding.\u201d Although such protections are certainly commendable, it is apparent that the identity proviso in \u00a7 52-146k (b) would thwart the dominant purpose and obvious intent in creating a privilege in the first place. The rule now generally approved is that a proviso which is directly repugnant to the purview or body of the act is inoperative and void for repugnancy. See, e.g., <em>American Can Co. </em>v. <em>McCanless, </em>193 S.W.2d 86 (Tenn. 1946); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nielson, </em>19 Utah 2d 66-68, 426 P.2d 13 (1967); <em>Bence </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>84 Wis. 2d 224, 233, 267 N.W.2d 25 (1978); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 1-3, \u201c[i]f any provisions of any act passed by the general assembly or its application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of such act.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>171 Conn. 141, 145-46, 368 A.2d 136 (1976). \u201cTo hold that legislation is valid as to one part and invalid as to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>is not anomalous but consonant with principles long established.\u201d <em>Amsel v. Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 300, 106 A.2d 152, appeal dismissed, 348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 125, 99 L. Ed. 693 (1954). \u201cThe principle of separability is in aid of the intention of the lawgiver.\u201d <em>Angermeier </em>v. <em>Sea Girt, </em>27 N.J. 298, 311, 142 A.2d 624 (1958). We determine that that portion of \u00a7 52-146k (b) which prohibits the disclosure of the identity of a sexual assault counselor is separable and independent from the balance of the statute given its dominant purpose of creating the privilege and designed, as it is, to effectuate that privilege. See <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 353-54, 441 A.2d 604 (1982). We believe that the balance of the statute, apart from the offending portion, may be executed to discharge such legislative intent. In so doing, we continue to recognize, as we must, that \u201c \u2018statutes are to be construed to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body.\u2019 <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980); see <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>[188 Conn. 213, 220, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982)]; 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05.\u201d <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 65, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). The United States Supreme Court has said that even with the presumption of divisibility, \u201cwe cannot rewrite a statute and give it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole\u201d especially where offending portions \u201cso affect the dominant aim of the whole statute as to carry [the whole statute] down with them.\u201d <em>Railroad Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Alton Railroad Co., </em>295 U.S. 330, 362, 55 S. Ct. 758, 79 L. Ed. 1468 (1935). This, fortunately, is not the case in this highly appropriate statute which encompasses a socially desirable plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We remand this case to the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>for, inter alia, a determination of whether the sexual assault counselor who treated this victim has satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the criteria of \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5). The counselor\u2019s identity must now be disclosed to the respondents in order to allow them to cross-examine the counselor only as to her statutory qualifications under \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5), presumably demonstrated during her direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The respondents also claim that because the outcome of the case turned on the credibility of T, the records of the rape crisis center would have been relevant and material to the defense and to deny them access to the records is to deny them their right to confrontation, the right to due process, the right to compulsory process and the right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">A criminal defendant has the \u201cright to confront and to cross-examine one\u2019s accusers, guaranteed in a state trial through the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 534, 290 A.2d 332 (1971)....\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 267, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). The defendants\u2019 rights do not, however, encompass the right to present irrelevant, immaterial or prejudicial evidence. See <em>Haber </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>756 F.2d 1520, 1522-23 (11th Cir. 1985). Moreover, the defendants\u2019 right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses against them is not absolute, but must, on occasion, bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>supra, 268; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). The court advocate claims that the respondents\u2019 right to confrontation, particularly as to the rape crisis counselor, must bow to the legitimate interest established by General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k and in support cites subsection (f): \u201cThe failure of any party to testify as a witness pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>provisions of this section shall not result in an inference unfavorable to the state\u2019s cause or to the cause of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The legislature, by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k, provided a privilege to the confidential communications of a victim of sexual assault to a rape crisis counselor. The privilege may not be invoked by the counselor in three specific circumstances, including when there is an offer of proof that perjury may have been committed. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (e). The legislative history reveals that the privilege was intended to be akin to the psychiatrist-patient privilege. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d; see 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1983 Sess., pp. 5284-85. The purpose of both the victim-sexual assault counselor privilege and the psychiatrist-patient privilege is to enable a victim or patient to enter into a therapeutic, healing relationship with a trained counselor and to disclose highly personal confidences and information with the expectation that it will not be divulged except when waived under the statute. The victim-counselor relationship is one that society and the legislature has chosen to recognize as promoting a needed treatment process. The issue before us then becomes whether it is necessary to alter the claimed absolute statutory privilege of the victim in order to permit the respondents their constitutional right to confront the witness and cross-examine her about material in her records.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">It should be noted that each of the respondents\u2019 attorneys at the adjudication hearing extensively and effectively cross-examined the victim, T. The respondents, nevertheless, argue that although their cross-examination of the victim revealed some inconsistent statements, the additional inconsistent statements sought in the records would not be merely cumulative. The thrust of their argument is that the quashing of the subpoena was error because it denied them their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>right to cross-examination, their right to a fair hearing and the right to present witnesses in their favor. \u201cThe right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so it may decide where the truth lies. Just as an accused has the right to confront the prosecution\u2019s witnesses for the purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense. This right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The victim\u2019s testimony was crucial to the state\u2019s case. As in many sexual assault cases, the victim is the only witness to the crime. Her credibility was, therefore, important. The statements made to the sexual assault counselor, if introduced at the hearing, may or may not have impacted greatly, or at all, on her credibility. The respondents claim that because the court chose to disbelieve the victim\u2019s testimony as to her unwillingness to engage in the first instance of vaginal penetration and yet chose to believe her testimony as to the circumstances surrounding the second instance of vaginal penetration involving the broomstick, it demonstrates how \u201ccentral and crucial the credibility issue was to the adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">As in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974), the conflict between the respondent\u2019s right to cross-examine an important witness and a statutory privilege designed to protect that same witness must be resolved. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, a state statute prevented the defendant from revealing to the trier the witness\u2019 probationary status resulting from a juvenile delinquency adjudication. The United States Supreme Court held that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>had been denied his right of effective cross-examination because the witness\u2019 possible bias due to his probationary status was unable to be revealed to the jury. The court held that the state\u2019s policy interest in protecting juvenile offenders\u2019 confidentiality must yield to the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. Id., 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 497 A.2d 758 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), we considered the question of when a trial court or a criminal defendant should be permitted to examine psychiatric records of a state's witness to determine whether there was relevant impeaching evidence in light of the statutory psychiatric-patient privilege of General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e. In both cases the trial court refused to conduct an in camera inspection of the records because it determined that the statutory privilege protecting the confidentiality of the records precluded it from doing so. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, we enunciated a procedure, approved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>\u201cwhich would protect the witness\u2019 statutory right to confidentiality while simultaneously safeguarding the defendant\u2019s constitutional right effectively to cross-examine the witness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 329. That procedure is as follows: \u201cIf . . . the claimed impeaching information is privileged there must be a showing that there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation such that the witness\u2019 direct testimony should be stricken. Upon such a showing the court may then afford the state an opportunity to secure the consent of the witness for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the claimed information and, if necessary, to turn over to the defendant any relevant material for the purposes of cross-examination. If the defendant does make such showing and such consent is not forthcoming then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>court may be obliged to strike the testimony of the witness. If the consent is limited to an in camera inspection and such inspection, in the opinion of the trial judge, does not disclose relevant material then the resealed record is to be made available for inspection on appellate review. If the in camera inspection does reveal relevant material then the witness should be given an opportunity to decide whether to consent to release of such material to the defendant or to face having her testimony stricken in the event of refusal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We follow the <em>Esposito-Bruno </em>procedure in this case with the following modifications which are necessary to effectuate the sexual assault counselor privilege. The trial court\u2019s in camera review of a victim\u2019s records, if she consents, shall not be limited to merely \u201crelevant material.\u201d The trial court\u2019s in camera review of the sexual assault counselor\u2019s records should determine if there are any inconsistent and relevant statements of the victim in the records when compared to the victim\u2019s direct examination. Interpretations, recollections, and counseling notations of the counselor do not qualify as statements of the victim and cannot be disclosed to the respondent. See <em>Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, </em>494 Pa. 15, 28, 428 A.2d 126 (1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relevant, inconsistent statements of the victim are only those statements which are verbatim accounts by the victim given to the counselor and which are directly related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to an essential element of the crime for which the respondent is standing trial. Inconsistent, as it is used above, does not refer to a lack of <em>complete </em>uniformity-in details as compared to trial testimony. It is possible that the entire contents of the records of a victim may not be disclosable to defense counsel under our definition above, but any such decision awaits the scrupulous examination of a trial judge. Trial courts should be concerned with the intent of the legislature in enacting such a privilege, albeit now a limited one. A rape crisis counselor is specially trained to support and aid a victim of a sexual assault by encouraging her to \u201cexpress her whole range of feelings without fear of judgment, rejection, or recrimination.\u201d Women\u2019s Rights Law Reporter 185,195 (Summer 1985). All victims of sexual assaults are to some degree traumatized. The work of a trained rape crisis counselor can not only immediately but ultimately help the victim in her emotional and psychological recovery. Indiscriminate distribution or disclosure of a rape counselor\u2019s records by a trial court to defense counsel will surely destroy the effectiveness of a counselor-victim relationship if the need for confidentiality is not exacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">If the trial court denies or limits the disclosure of the contents of the records after following the above procedure, then the undisclosed material that is the subject of the respondents\u2019 request should be sealed for possible review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We must remand this case for further proceedings. We direct the trial court to follow the procedure outlined above. If the trial court determines that none of the material in the counselor\u2019s records should be disclosed, then none of the subpoenaed records are to be turned over to any of the respondents. If, on the other hand, the trial court determines that there are relevant, inconsistent statements of T in the subpoenaed records that should be disclosed to defense counsel and if, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the modified <em>Esposito-Bruno </em>procedure set out above, the victim then consents to the release of such material, then a new hearing is ordered and the defense counsel are allowed to use this material. If, however, the victim does not consent to the release of such material, then her testimony shall be stricken and the trial court is ordered to make a redetermination of the respondents\u2019 adjudications and dispositions based upon the remaining evidence at the original hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Although we remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion, our review of this case does not end here. Because the trial court may determine that the records may not be disclosed to defense counsel, we must address the respondents\u2019 other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The respondents, Robert and Richard, claim that the trial court erred in finding them guilty of sexual assault in the first degree without proof of all the necessary elements. The respondents allege that the court advocate failed to prove that they intended to help the principal, Blair, or that they possessed \u201cthe same intent as the principal [under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8],<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that is, the specific intent to commit the crime of sexual assault. These respondents claim, with respect to the element of intent to help the principal, that the only evidence offered on this element was the testimony of the victim which was \u201cnot at all clear on cross examination. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The trial court was required to find that Richard and Robert intended to aid Blair in the commission of the sexual assault by force or threat of force and that they intended to commit the sexual assault and that the sexual assault did occur. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>and 53a-8. The respondents do not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that a sexual assault occurred but instead \u201cpresume\u201d it for the purposes of their argument. Such an assault clearly took place, as the trial court found. The evidence as to the intent of the two boys to aid Blair is evident from the testimony of T. The trial court found that Blair assaulted T with \u201cthe assistance of Robert [H.] and Richard [C.] and their physically restraining her and holding her down while the act was consummated.\u201d The trial court also found that they \u201cconsciously and intentionally participated\u201d in the sexual assault and \u201cactively shared in its commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless they cannot be legally and logically supported. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). \u201cThe evidence must be given a construction most favorable to sustaining the [trial court\u2019s] verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>196 Conn. 36, 44, 490 A.2d 1000 (1985). \u201cIt is the trier of fact which determines the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony.\u201d Id., 45. The trial judge was able legally and logically to conclude, from the testimony of T, that the two boys restrained T on the bed in a position to aid Blair in the assault with the broomstick. The respondents rely on T\u2019s testimony that she did not know what Blair intended to do with the broomstick when he walked into the room until he actually assaulted her as an indication that they too did not know what Blair intended to do with the broomstick. T also testified, however, that when Blair left the room, the boys allowed her to sit up but that when Blair reentered the room with the broomstick, they again pulled her back down and restrained her on the bed, naked from the waist down, and held her legs and arms while Blair assaulted her with the broom. The respondents, nevertheless, claim that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>has \u201cfailed to recognize\u201d the third necessary element of the crime for which they were charged, the intent to commit sexual assault. The trial court found that not only did they aid Blair in the act but that they also \u201cconsciously and intentionally participated therein.\u201d The sequence of events, including their assistance to Blair in removing T\u2019s pants, and the manner in which T testified she was being held are clear evidence of Robert\u2019s and Richard\u2019s knowing and willing intent to aid Blair in sexually assaulting T and sufficient evidence of their intent to commit sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The two separate intents necessary to this charge, to aid and to commit the assault, were therefore found by the trial court based on the evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 207, 479 A.2d 237 (1984). There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt on the charge of sexual assault in the first degree against Robert and Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Blair also raises two issues that must be addressed. The adjudication stage is a two-step process which requires the court first to make a finding that a child is delinquent and then to make a disposition of the juvenile. The respondent, however, claims that although the court made a finding of delinquency in that it found Blair responsible for a delinquent act, the court did not make a finding that the child \u201cneeds the care, discipline or protection of the state\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140; before it adjudicated him a delinquent. Without this second finding, Blair claims that the court is without jurisdiction over him and erred in adjudicating him a delinquent. We do not read General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the same manner as the respondent does. We agree with the court advocate\u2019s claim that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> entitled \u201cDefinitions,\u201d defines the circumstances under which a child may be found to be delinquent. In the present case, the court found the respondent Blair responsible for the act of sexual assault, a violation of state law and one of the statutory circumstances for which a child may be found delinquent. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (c) (1). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140, entitled in part \u201cDisposition upon finding of delinquency,\u201d sets forth the various dispositions a court may order for a delinquent juvenile. The statute begins with a parallel construction: \u201c(a) The court, if it finds that the child is delinquent and needs the care, discipline or protection of the state, may adjudge him delinquent and place him in the care of any institution . . . . \u201d We agree with the court advocate that the parallel construction used \u201cpairs [the] finding of delinquency with adjudication of delinquency and need for care with provisions for care.\u201d The court thus made the necessary finding of delinquency when it determined that the respondent had violated a state law and formalized this finding by adjudicating him a delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The court set the matter down for a predispositional hearing to determine Blair\u2019s need for the care, discipline and protection of the state and on April 30, 1984, the court made its disposition of the matter, committing Blair to the custody of DCYS for a period of time not to exceed one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The respondent, Blair, also claims that the court\u2019s disposition, a commitment to DCYS, was made without the findings required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> specifically that a finding was not made that probation and other available services were inadequate. The respondent claims that the court should have chosen the least restrictive alternative for his disposition and that DCYS is a \u201clast resort.\u201d The court advocate states that a review of the transcript of the dispositional stage shows that \u201cthe judge found a need in the Respondent which could not be met by Probation services or other services of the Court . . . ,\u201dWe have thoroughly reviewed the transcript of the April 30, 1984 dispositional stage. The court, in addition to a predispositional study of Blair by a probation officer, heard the testimony of several defense witnesses including a clinical psychologist who interviewed and tested Blair one time for approximately one and one-half to two hours and a child adolescent psychiatrist who had met with Blair three or four times. The court considered the other alternative dispositions suggested by the expert witnesses, such as family therapy. The court, however, determined that only institutionalization, in the nature of commitment to the DCYS and its facility known as Long Lane, would provide the punishment commensurate with the seriousness of the offense. The court stated that the punishment would be \u201ca start in the respondent\u2019s road to rehabilitation, because punishment for the sake of punishment, while it is not therapeutic, it does serve as a lesson and a deterrent. A lesson that antisocial activities are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>acceptable and can be the first step towards making the therapy programs that are coincided with institutionalization and those that follow. You can make those programs more meaningful.\u201d The court thus did make a reasoned determination that \u201cits probation services or other services\u201d were not adequate for the particular psychological and disciplinary needs of Blair.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In addition, the court\u2019s disposition of this matter encompassed \u201cthe least restrictive alternative\u201d commensurate with Blair\u2019s needs indicated by this \u201cserious juvenile offense\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120, contrary to this respondent\u2019s claim. The court, as the respondent suggests should be the procedure, did make a \u201cstatement of the facts relied on in support [of its disposition] and the reasons for selecting the disposition and rejecting the less restrictive alternatives.\u201d The court could have committed the respondent to the custody of DCYS for a period of up to four years; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (a); and the court specifically noted that Blair was not to be kept in \u201cthe secure unit\u201d at Long Lane although his offense was a \u201cserious juvenile offense.\u201d The court also stated as part of its disposition that Blair should be kept out of the confines of his community for a period of six months because it was a serious juvenile offense. The court\u2019s disposition was well within its statutory authority and indicates that it was well thought out and reasoned and based on all of the evidence and comprehensive reports before it. There was no error in the court\u2019s adjudication or disposition of Blair.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The case is remanded to the court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>for proceedings not inconsisent with this

Although I agree with the remainder of the majority opinion, I disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>portion holding that \u201cif the identity of the sexual assault counselor cannot be disclosed under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (b), then it would always be impossible to determine whether the statutory criteria set out in General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (a) (5) were satisfied with respect to that sexual assault counselor.\u201d The criteria in subdivision (5) for determining whether a person qualifies as a \u201csexual assault counselor\u201d require proof that such person (1) has received at least twenty hours of appropriate training, (2) is certified as a counselor by the sexual assault center which provided such training, (3) is under the control of a \u201cdirect services supervisor of a rape crisis center,\u201d and (4) is employed for the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of advising and assisting rape victims. It would not \u201calways be impossible\u201d to prove these facts without the testimony of the particular counselor who has conferred with the victim, as the opinion assumes. Other witnesses, such as the supervisor of the rape crisis center, could ordinarily be called to testify in proof of these requirements. The identity of the counselor would not necessarily have to be disclosed while her qualifications were being proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The majority opinion has effectively emasculated the statutory privilege for protection of the identity of the rape crisis counselor in declaring that disclosure of her identity is essential in order to determine whether she qualifies for the privilege under the criteria set forth in subdivision (5) of \u00a7 52-146k (b). The opinion does not respond to the paradox that, where a witness must testify in proof of her statutory right to protection of her identity, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation entitles him to revelation of the very information the privilege was designed to protect. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 88 S. Ct. 748, 19 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1968). The intention of the legislature to protect against disclosure of the identity of the sexual assault counselor for fear of harrassment or reprisal is no less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>clear or less worthy of implementation than its purpose to prevent disclosure of the confidential communications of the victim without her consent. Even if the latter objective could be effectuated only at the expense of the former, as the majority opinion quite unnecessarily assumes, I fail to comprehend the basis upon which one of the two statutory privileges has been made subservient to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Only in the event that the sexual assault counselor who assisted the victim in this case should take the stand to testify against the defendant would his right of confrontation require the disclosure on cross-examination of her identity. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra. At the point where the counselor involved is called as a witness, she should be given the opportunity to invoke her privilege under \u00a7 52-146k (b) not to disclose her identity by refusing to testify unless her statutory privilege is observed. Her right to exercise the privilege, which hinges upon proof of her status as a sexual assault counselor, could ordinarily be determined through the testimony of other witnesses concerning her qualifications prior to her appearance as a witness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
