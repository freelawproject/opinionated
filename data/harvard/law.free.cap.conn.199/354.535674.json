On December 17,1983, two Hartford police officers received information from an unidentified informer that a Hispanic male dressed in a tan jacket, jeans and a cap was selling cocaine in foil packets at the corner of Nelson and Main Streets. Observing the scene from an abandoned building, the officers saw a man, later identified as the defendant, who fit the description. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>officers watched the defendant engage in two separate transactions in which he transferred a foil packet in exchange for money to another person. As the officers approached the defendant, they saw him remove four tinfoil packets and drop them on the ground. One of the officers arrested and immediately searched the defendant and found two squares of tinfoil and $173.00 upon his person. Subsequent laboratory tests disclosed that the tinfoil packets contained cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error alleges that he was entitled to a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct. At trial, defense counsel sought to impress on the jury that the amount of cocaine allegedly contained in the tinfoil packets was too small an amount to warrant prosecution for sale of narcotics. In his cross-examination of the state\u2019s toxicologist, defense counsel succeeded in having that witness characterize four hundred milligrams, the amount of cocaine involved in this prosecution, as \u201cessentially a garbage case.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the state rested its case and the defendant, outside the presence of the jury, moved for a directed verdict, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s a garbage case as the expert indicated.\u201d Counsel for the state replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s a garbage case, Mr. Friedland can give his own children some cocaine. I will ask that the Motion be denied.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. After the jury had been brought back, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on \u201c[the prosecutor\u2019s] comments [to] which I take offense, about those comments of my children using cocaine.\u201d The court instructed the jury to disregard these remarks of defense counsel and advised the defense to proceed with its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It is fanciful to argue that these events entitled the defendant to a mistrial. Although the remark of the assistant state\u2019s attorney was unprofessional and offensive, his conduct while the jury was absent could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>had no impact whatsoever on the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial. But for the repetition of the prosecutor\u2019s remark by defense counsel after the jury had returned, the jury would never have learned what had transpired. The defendant cannot claim a mistrial because of an error induced by his own counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 47, 454 A.2d 266 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 424, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973). The trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for mistrial in these circumstances did not constitute an abuse of its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>198 Conn. 490, 495-97, 503 A.2d 1157 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 264-68, 502 A.2d 886 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 452-53, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985); <em>State </em>v. Vass, 191 Conn. 604, 613, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowakowski, </em>188 Conn. 620, 624, 452 A.2d 938 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The defendant contends, in his second claim of error, that the trial court insufficiently replied to an interrogatory from the jury during its deliberations. The jury sent a note to the court asking: \u201cWe would like an indication whether the quantity has any bearing on intent to sell according to the law.\u201d The court replied by reading to the jury the relevant part of the governing statute, \u00a7 21a-277 (a). Defense counsel excepted, urging the court to instruct the jurors that the answer to their question was in the affirmative. In evaluating the adequacy of a supplemental instruction, we consider the main and the supplemental instructions as a whole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Topciu, </em>183 Conn. 1, 6, 438 A.2d 803 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 308, 386 A.2d 243 (1978). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Viewing the instruction from this perspective, we conclude that the defendant has not met his burden of showing that it was reasonably probable that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 422, 356 A.2d 147 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant also asserts, in his final claim of error, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney was not permitted adequate time to prepare for trial. On the very day that the defendant\u2019s case was scheduled for jury selection, the defendant discharged his prior counsel and retained his present counsel. The jury was selected on that day, a Friday, and the case proceeded to trial the following Tuesday. The defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s refusal of his request for a continuance. The defendant has not pressed, on appeal, a claim that the denial of his request for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion by the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 47-52, 501 A.2d 752 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 437-38, 489 A.2d 350 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 463-64, 479 A.2d 199 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chairamonte, </em>189 Conn. 61, 65-66, 454 A.2d 272 (1983). Furthermore, defense counsel has pointed to no specific occurrence at the trial that furnishes evidence of the inadequacy of his representation of the defendant. As we have recently held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541-42, 504 A.2d 480 (1986), this kind of claim must be litigated, on a proper factual record, in a proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201c(Formerly Sec. 19-48).

To draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>such an inference and intention to sell is not only the privilege of the jury but also the duty of the jury provided, of course, the inference drawn is a reasonable and logical one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
