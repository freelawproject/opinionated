We granted certification to review the judgment of the Appellate Court setting aside the judgment of the Superior Court, which had reduced the town\u2019s assessment of the district\u2019s property situated within the town from $8,922,660 to $8,351,280 for each list. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The decision of the Appellate Court fully describes the underlying facts, which are not in dispute. <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>3 Conn. App. 53, 485 A.2d 1311 (1984). In 1979, the town assessed 6628 acres of water supply land owned by the district, a specially chartered municipal corporation, at $1900 per acre. The district appealed to the town\u2019s board of tax review. The board refused to modify the assessment and the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-119. The appeal was heard by a state trial referee, exercising the powers of the Superior Court, who concluded that the value of the property was $1800 per acre. The town consented to the reduction of its $1900 per acre figure to the court\u2019s valuation. The district appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming error in the referee\u2019s application of the property tax assessment provision contained in its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The district was created in 1929 by a special act of the General Assembly. 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511. The act, as amended, is commonly referred to as the Charter of the Metropolitan District (hereinafter the charter). The charter provides that water supply land situated in nonuser towns be \u201cassessed for taxation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in such town.\u201d See part I of this opinion, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Appellate Court enunciated a definition of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the charter and concluded that the Superior Court\u2019s failure to define that term invalidated its valuation because it had no proper standard by which to weigh the evidence of value presented at trial. The Appellate Court defined \u201cimproved farmland\u201d as land that \u201chas been altered, changed or developed from its natural state, in a not inconsequential manner, in order to enhance or promote its use as farmland.\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 73. The court set aside the judgment of the Superior Court and ordered a new trial to determine the value of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d in the town in accordance with this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We granted certification to review the judgment of the Appellate Court in respect to two issues: \u201c(1) the definition of \u2018improved farmland\u2019 under [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-76 and [the] related charter provision of the Metropolitan District, and (2) the claimed implied repeal of the charter provision by [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-76. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In our review of these certified issues we focus on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment of the Appellate Court, not of the Superior Court. The only questions we need consider are those raised by the petition for certification, and we will ordinarily consider these issues in the manner in which they have been framed in the Appellate Court. See Practice Book \u00a7 3154; <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 234, 506 A.2d 139 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A brief statutory history of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 and the district\u2019s charter is essential to our review of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. In <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Water Commissioners, </em>44 Conn. 360 (1877), we held that a reservoir owned by a municipal corporation in another town was <em>not </em>subject to taxation in the town where the reservoir is situated. The General Assembly\u2019s dissatisfaction with the result of this case prompted adoption of the original version of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, which provided: \u201cLand owned or taken by any municipal corporation, for the purpose of creating or furnishing a supply of water for its use or benefit, shall be liable to taxation, and shall be set in the list in the town where such land is situated, to the corporation owning or controlling such water supply, <em>at a valuation which would be fair for said land if used for agricultural purposes: </em>provided, however, that no such land shall be liable to taxation, or set in any list as aforesaid, wherever the inhabitants of the town in which the said land is situated have the right to the use of such water supply upon the same terms and conditions as the inhabitants of such municipal corporation, and when such town actually uses the same.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1879, c. 79. Subsequently, in 1913, the legislature deleted the language \u201cat a valuation which would be fair for said land if used for agricultural purposes\u201d and substituted <em>\u201cat the average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in said town. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1913, c. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In 1929, the Metropolitan District was created by a special act of the General Assembly. 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511. Initially, the act contained no provision establishing a tax valuation standard for its water supply property. The act was, however, subsequently amended by borrowing language virtually identical to the 1913 amendment to \u00a7 12-76, that \u201call land taken for any of said purposes shall be set in the list for taxation in the town in which said land is situated, to The Metropolitan District, and assessed for taxation <em>at the average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in such town.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 21 Spec. Acts 655, No. 505, \u00a7 14; 25 Spec. Acts 1162, No. 444, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In 1963, the pertinent portion of the present General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 was amended to provide: \u201c[S]uch land shall be liable to taxation and shall be assessed in the town in which such land is situated to the corporation owning or controlling such water supply <em>at what would be its fair market value were it improved farm land.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1963, No. 490, S 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court did not define the phrase \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d This omission, as the Appellate Court concluded, rendered its determination of the value of the district\u2019s property invalid because the court did not utilize a proper standard in evaluating the evidence of value presented at trial. \u201c[T]he fundamental issue in the case was never considered.\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Each witness at trial employed a different definition of \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d The town assessor, Mary Ringuette, defined it as land \u201cable to have a tractor go through and plant crops.\u201d The town\u2019s expert appraiser, James C. Oles, defined \u201cimproved farmland\u201d as \u201cprime crop land cleared, the absolute best farmland there is.\u201d The district\u2019s project manager, Leon C. Kirk, did not explicitly define the term but did opine that any available <em>farmland </em>in the town would fall within the purview of \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d It is apparent that the trial court simply adopted the testimony of Oles, which was based upon sales of improved farmland, \u201cthe absolute best farmland there is\u201d under his definition, in other towns in Litchfield county.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In order to fulfill the statutory mandate of assessing the district\u2019s property at the average assessed valuation of the improved farmland in the town, it is essential, as the Appellate Court concluded, to define the term \u201cimproved farmland\u201d so that whatever land in the town satisfies that definition can be identified and its \u201caverage assessed valuation\u201d ascertained. The Appellate Court found that none of the valuation standards used at the trial complied with the charter criterion for assessing the district\u2019s land. The pertinent provision of the charter provides that the district\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>property shall be assessed \u201cat the average assessed valuation ... of the improved farming land in such town.\u201d \u201c \u2018[T]he word \u201cshall\u201d must be assumed to have been used with full awareness of its ordinary meaning.\u2019 <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>181 Conn. 367, 371, 435 A.2d 996 (1980). \u2018Shall\u2019 is a word ordinarily creating a mandatory duty. <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 (1967).\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 69-70. The Appellate Court noted that the charter is devoid of any specific definition of \u201cimproved farmland,\u201d \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cfarmland.\u201d Id., 71. \u201c \u2018Where a statute or regulation does not define a term, it is appropriate to focus upon its common understanding as expressed in the law and upon its dictionary meaning. <em>The Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>State Department of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>269 Md. 625, 308 A.2d 679 (1973).\u2019 <em>Ziperstein </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 493, 500, 423 A.2d 129 (1979).\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 72; see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186-87, 438 A.2d 859 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Appellate Court looked to General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q) for the definition of the term \u201cfarming.\u201d Activities included within this statutory definition of farming are cultivation of the soil, dairying, forestry and raising any agricultural or horticultural commodity. Evidently, \u201c \u2018farmland\u2019 includes land used for a broad range of purposes . . . .\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 71 n.10. The Appellate Court aptly reasoned that land used to conduct any of these \u201cfarming\u201d activities delineated in \u00a7 1-1 (q) is \u201cfarmland.\u201d See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>160 Conn. 71, 273 A.2d 706 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Appellate Court then considered dictionary definitions and common usage in order to define the word \u201cimprove\u201d: \u201c \u2018[T]o increase the value of (land or property) by bringing under cultivation, reclaiming for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>agriculture or stock raising, erecting buildings or other structures, laying out streets, or installing utilities as sewers <em>(improved </em>farmland).\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) The same dictionary defines \u2018reclaim\u2019 in part as follows: \u2018[T]o rescue from a wild or uncultivated state: make fit for cultivation or use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 72, quoting Webster, Third New International Dictionary; see <em>Builders Land Co. </em>v. <em>Martens, </em>255 Iowa 231, 233-34, 122 N.W.2d 189 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>186 Minn. 132, 135, 242 N.W. 474 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Because the charter uses a technical term, \u201cimproved farmland,\u201d clearly associated with the farm industry, that term \u201cshould be accorded the meaning which [it] would convey to an informed person in the . . . trade or business.\u201d <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 475, 217 A.2d 698 (1966); <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Manchester Police Union, </em>3 Conn App. 1, 9, 484 A.2d 455 (1984). Therefore, in an effort to define the word \u201cimproved\u201d the Appellate Court also relied on an assessor\u2019s reference manual definition of \u201cimprovement\u201d: \u201c \u2018[a]nything done to raw land with the intention of increasing its value. Thus, a structure erected on the property constitutes one very common type of improvement, although other actions, such as those taken to improve drainage, are also improvements. . . .\u2019International Association of Assessing Officers, Improving Real Property Assessment, A Reference Manual, p. 425.\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Applying the dictionary definitions and common parlance of \u201cimprove\u201d to the definition of \u201cfarming\u201d as contained in General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q), we agree with the Appellate Court that the term \u201cimproved farmland\u201d in the district\u2019s charter refers to land that has been altered or developed from its natural state in order to enhance or promote its use for farming. See <em>Lentz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>v. <em>Dostal, </em>212 Wis. 81, 85, 249 N.W. 174 (1933) (parcel of land was \u201cimproved farm property\u201d within statute where pasture was under plow, and remaining woodland cleared of brush). While this definition is clearly a matter of law, the application of this standard to a particular parcel of land is a question of fact for the trial court. The trial court must consider, by reference to the definition enunciated by the Appellate Court, whether sufficient improvements have been made to particular land to justify its classification as \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The town argues that its appraiser\u2019s standard of \u201cprime crop land cleared\u201d is the most appropriate definition because that will result in tax revenue at a rate commensurate with the highest quality farmland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We recognize that the purpose of the taxing provisions of the charter is to ensure that towns not sharing in the use of water supply property do not lose the tax revenue from the land taken for the reservoirs. See <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 403, 288 A.2d 435 (1971); <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>New Canaan, </em>85 Conn. 119, 81 A. 1027 (1911). We point out that the Appellate Court\u2019s definition would encompass \u201cprime crop land <em>cleared,\u201d </em>as such land is certainly improved by virtue of being cleared, but is not restricted to such land. In view of the broader definition of \u201cfarming\u201d in \u00a7 1-1 (q), we do not believe that the legislature intended to limit the definition of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d solely to land specially suited to cultivation. The objective of preserv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ing the tax base of a town when its land is taken for the purpose of supplying water to other municipalities does not require that the town be compensated far in excess of the lost revenue by valuing each acre of the water supply property, regardless of its potential as quality farmland, at a figure applicable only to the most desirable parcels of farmland in the town. The charter provision refers to the \u201caverage assessed valuation . . . of the improved farming land,\u201d indicating a realization on the part of the legislature that \u201cimproved farming land\u201d in the town would not be of uniform value for farming. The implicit assumption in this formula was that each acre of water supply land had a potential for improvement as farmland that would never be achieved because the land had been taken for the purpose of a water supply, thus depriving the town of tax revenue it would ordinarily have realized. This assumption would have been wholly unrealistic if it were based on the notion that each acre of water supply land had a potential for improvement as \u201cprime crop land cleared, the best farmland there is.\u201d A tax formula so wholly divorced from reality would have imposed an unfair tax burden on the customer towns served by the district, going far beyond the legitimate purpose of compensating the town for revenue it would normally have received. The Appellate Court\u2019s definition of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d is consistent with the legislative policy of fair compensation to nonuser municipalities and effectively balances the competing interests of the taxing town and the district\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The town also claims that the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, rather than those of the charter, apply to the district\u2019s water supply property. The essential difference in the two provisions is that the charter specifically requires that water supply land be valued in comparison to that of other improved farmland located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in the same town, while the valuation procedure under the terms of \u00a7 12-76 is not so limited. The relevant charter provision provides that water supply land shall be assessed \u201cat the average assessed valuation ... of the improved farming land <em>in such town.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In 1963, the relevant portion of \u00a7 12-76 was changed to provide that water supply property of a municipal corporation located in another municipality whose inhabitants do not have the right to use the water, is \u201cassessed . . . at what would be its fair market value were it improved farm land.\u201d Public Acts 1963, No. 490, \u00a7 10. The town claims that this amendment repealed the tax assessment provision of the district\u2019s charter by implication. As did the Appellate Court, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We have consistently expressed our disfavor of repeals by implication. <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>191 Conn. 514, 521, 468 A.2d 574 (1983); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ulichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 153, 440 A.2d 885 (1981); <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn 603, 606, 376 A.2d 71 (1977); <em>Knights of Columbus Council </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>154 Conn. 583, 591, 227 A.2d 413 (1967). Nevertheless, it is a well established principle of statutory construction that subsequent enactments of the legislature are presumed to repeal earlier inconsistent ones to the extent that they are in conflict. <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra; <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbary, </em>185 Conn. 445, 458, 441 A.2d 131 (1981); <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 123, 434 A.2d 949 (1980). \u201cA special and local statute, providing for a particular case or class of cases, is not affected by a statute general in its terms, broad enough to include cases embraced in the special law, unless the intent to repeal or alter is manifest.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wallen </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>82 Conn. 122, 124, 72 A. 575 (1909); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 593, 427 A.2d 425 (1980); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Rocky Hill Convalescent Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District, </em>160 Conn. 446, 454-55, 280 A.2d 344 (1971). \u201c \u2018There is no rule which prohibits the repeal by implication of a special or specific act by a general or broad one. The question is always one of legislative intention, and the special or specific act must yield to the later general or broad act, where there is a manifest legislative intent that the general act shall be of universal application notwithstanding the prior special or specific act.\u2019 50 Am. Jur. 565, Statutes, \u00a7 544.\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>159 Conn. 453, 468, 271 A.2d 110 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The town argues that unless the charter is construed to permit the assessor to consider the value of property in other towns, the charter and \u00a7 12-76 are incompatible because the charter does not provide for the case in which there is no \u201cimproved farmland\u201d in a town in which property of the district is situated. Therefore, the gravamen of the town\u2019s claim of repeal by implication is the assertion that \u00a7 12-76 provides for a situation not contemplated by the charter. We refuse to equate this potential, unprovided-for situation with a \u201cmanifest intent to repeal or alter\u201d the charter on the part of the legislature in enacting the 1963 amendment to \u00a7 12-76. In all instances except where no qualifying farmland exists within a town, the charter can operate in an arena independent from \u00a7 12-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u201c \u2018If courts can by any fair interpretation find a reasonable field of operation for both statutes without destroying or perverting their evident meaning and intent, it is the duty of the courts to do so, thus reconciling them and according to them concurrent effect. [Citations omitted.]\u2019 <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>144 Conn. 694, 702, 137 A.2d 536 (1957).\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 63-64. The Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[r]ather than an essential repugnancy, the two methods of assessment can live together com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>patibly as two different but related methods of achieving the same objective.\u201d Id., 64. The charter has independent application with respect to the water supply land of the district, while General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 is applicable to any other municipal water company or municipality owning water supply land. Id., 64; see <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baningoso, </em>134 Conn. 382, 385, 58 A.2d 5 (1948); <em>Lamberti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>131 Conn. 396, 401, 40 A.2d 190 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that there is \u201cnothing in the legislative history of the charter and General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 to display a manifest intent that the charter provision is repealed by the later general statute.\u201d <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 64. Because the charter and General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 can logically be given concurrent application, the charter provision was not repealed by implication in the adoption of the 1963 amendment to General Statutes \u00a7 12-76. Under the charter, the assessment standard is not the fair market value of the district\u2019s land as \u201cimproved farmland\u201d based upon the value of land outside Barkhamsted but the actual average assessment used for improved farmland in the town. In light of our conclusions, we agree with the Appellate Court that this case must be remanded for a determination of the average assessed valuation of the \u201cimproved farmland\u201d located within the town of Barkhamsted in order to compute properly the district\u2019s tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> While the charter used the term \u201cfarming land,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 uses the term \u201cfarm land.\u201d We agree with the Appellate Court that these two terms are synonymous. <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, 3 </em>Conn.

Essentially, these statutes enable owners of \u201cfarm land\u201d to be free from the pressure to sell their property caused by high tax rates based on increasing market value created by the advent of residential and commercial development. Id. Under this scheme, qualifying \u201cfarm land\u201d is valued based on its current use, without regard to any potential use of the property. <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Conn. 396, 403, 288 A.2d 435 (1971). This issue is not before us because the district did not file with this court a cross petition for certification under Practice Book \u00a7 3141. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 434 n.6,493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> In 1982, the General Assembly extended the language of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 to include land owned by municipal water districts created by special act. Public Acts 1982, No. 82-452, \u00a7 1. General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 now provides in relevant part: \u201cLand owned or taken by any municipal corporation, including any metropolitan district established under provisions of the general statutes or any special act . . . shall be assessed . . . at what would be its fair market value were it improved farm land, notwithstanding the provisions of . . . any special act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> The town also claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s definition of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d is contrary to our decision in <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>New Canaan, </em>85 Conn. 119, 125-27, 81 A. 1027 (1911). In <em>Norwalk, </em>this court concluded that certain items comprising components of a municipal water supply corporation (i.e., dam, underground pipes, etc.) were not taxable under General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 because they did not constitute \u201c[l]and owned or taken ... for the purpose of creating or furnishing a supply of water.\u201d <em>Nor-walk, </em>however, is inapplicable to the present case because it involves the definition of \u201cwater supply land\u201d under \u00a7 12-76 and not that of \u201cimproved farmland\u201d under the district\u2019s charter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
