He asserts that the bankruptcy court erred by not revoking the Debtor\u2019s discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(d)(1) and/or 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">\u2018We apply the same standard of review as did the district court: the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; its legal conclusions and mixed questions of fact and law, <em>de novo.\u201d AT &amp; T Universal Card Servs. v. Mercer (In re Mercer), </em>246 F.3d 391, 402 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc). The bankruptcy court\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to deference, and its factual findings may be set aside only if, after considering the entire evidence, the reviewing court is left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Dennis (In re Dennis), </em>330 F.3d 696, 701 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">In an adversary proceeding, the plaintiff has the burden of proving sufficient facts to sustain his claims by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Beauboeuf v. Beaubouef (In re Beaubouef), </em>966 F.2d 174 (5th Cir. 1992). After review of the record and the briefs of the parties, we find that the bankruptcy court did not err, clearly or otherwise, in concluding that the Appellant failed in his burden of proof required for discharge revocation. We find no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions that the Appellant did not show that the Debtor\u2019s actions and mistakes were knowingly and fraudulently made, that the Appellant did not show that the Debtor\u2019s mistakes were material, and that the Appellant did not show that he was unaware of the facts at issue when the Debtor sought discharge. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1035-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
