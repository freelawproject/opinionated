We transferred the appeal from the Appellate Court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The trial court found the following facts, which are undisputed. The taxpayer is a public utility company that generates electricity for distribution to consumers in south central Connecticut. The taxpayer has three plants in Bridgeport and New Haven, each of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>consists of an integrated system of water pipes, steam ducts, boilers, pumps, heaters, baffles, condensers, turbines, generators, transformers, smokestacks and assorted parts and connections. This integrated system heats water to steam and brings the steam to super high temperatures. The resulting heat energy turns the turbines, which use mechanical energy to turn the generators, which generate electricity. The transformers change the electricity from high current to high voltage, which is then fed by transmission lines to consumers. The component parts of the system require periodic maintenance, which is performed by third party contractors. The commissioner assessed a sales tax upon the cost of these services pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In reviewing a decision of the trial court sustaining a taxpayer\u2019s appeal from a deficiency assessment, this court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous, or whether the decision is otherwise legally erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988). When a party has challenged the legal conclusions of the trial court, as the commissioner has here, we must determine whether these conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra; see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We note at the outset the principles of statutory construction that govern the applicability of a tax exemption. \u201cFirst, statutes that provide exemptions from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against the taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>an adverse assessment concerning an exemption.\u201d <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990). Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly held that the taxpayer had sustained its burden of proving eligibility for the exemption from \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) for services to \u201cmachinery and production equipment\u201d at an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The purchase by a taxpayer of services for the maintenance of industrial, commercial or income-producing real property is subject to the sales tax under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) unless the transaction qualifies for an exemption pursuant to another section of the Sales and Use Tax Act or regulations promulgated thereunder. The commissioner contends that the various components of the taxpayer\u2019s electric generating plants that are the subject of this appeal are commercial real property and are thus subject to the tax. The taxpayer argues first that these components are personal property, but that, even if they are deemed to be fixtures, the services rendered to them qualify for an exemption under \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the regulations, as services to \u201cmachinery and production equipment\u201d at an \u201cindustrial plant.\u201d We agree with the commissioner that the taxpayer does not qualify for the exemption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The taxpayer claims an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the regulations, which provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Industrial property\u2019 shall mean and include an \u2018industrial plant\u2019 as defined in Section 12-426-llb of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and all real estate with structures thereon, if any, used in support of the industrial plant. . . . <em>Services rendered to machinery and production equipment are not taxable even though such machinery or equipment is considered to be a fixture under Connecticut real property law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 12-426-llb (7) of the regulations defines an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d as a \u201cmanufacturing facility at which a manufacturing production process is occurring.\u201d The regulations define both \u201cmanufacturing\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cmanufacturing production process\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as activities that \u201cshall occur solely at an industrial plant.\u201d The taxpayer contends that services rendered to the components of its elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tricity generating facilities are exempt from the sales tax because the generation of electricity is \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Whether the generation of electricity constitutes manufacturing for the purposes of a sales tax exemption is a question of first impression in this state. In determining this question, we need not undertake a scientific discussion of the nature of electricity or its generation by mechanical means. See, e.g., <em>Frederick Electric Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>84 Md. 599, 600-602, 36 A. 362 (1897). Rather, we rely on the legislative history and construction of the Sales and Use Tax Act as a whole for our conclusion that electricity generation is not manufacturing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the generation of electricity may in some sense be a \u201cmanufacturing\u201d process, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to exempt businesses engaged in the generation of electricity for public consumption from the tax on services rendered to machinery and production equipment under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Tex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>aco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987), \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Starting with the language of the statute itself, as we must; see, e.g., <em>Lundy Electronics &amp; Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>189 Conn. 690, 695, 458 A.2d 387 (1983); we note that \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) refers to \u201ccommercial, industrial and income-producing real property.\u201d The legislative history of No. 75-213 of the 1975 Public Acts, which enacted the provision, does not clarify the meaning of the term \u201cindustrial real property.\u201d The regulations define \u201cindustrial real property\u201d as an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-26 (d); which is in turn defined as a \u201cmanufacturing facility at which a manufacturing production process is occurring.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-1lb (7). The regulatory definition of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d is ambiguous as to whether the generation of electricity is included. See footnote 5, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Where particular words or sections of a statute, considered separately, are imprecise, we may look to the expressed intent of the statute as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>189 Conn. 321, 326, 455 A.2d 1335 (1983); see also <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 25, 566 A.2d 658 (1989). Thus, in construing the terms \u201cindustrial real property,\u201d as used in \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), and \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d as referred to in the regulations promulgated thereunder, we consider other sections of the Sales and Use Tax Act which contain similar language.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The Sales and Use Tax Act was enacted in 1947 and 1948.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The act singled out the furnishing of electricity for special treatment in several places. First, the act exempted from taxation the sales, furnishing or service of electricity, and gas, water, telephone and telegraph, \u201cwhen delivered to consumers through mains, lines or pipes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> General Statutes (1947 Rev.) \u00a7 334i (c). In addition, the act separately exempted materials, tools and fuel used in the generation of gas, water, steam or electricity for distribution to consumers, and materials, tools and fuel used in \u201can industrial plant in the process of the manufacture of tangible personal property.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 2096 (r). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The special treatment of electric companies and other public utilities suggests that the act\u2019s drafters considered such industries to be distinct from manufacturing concerns. In addition, such separate treatment implies a legislative intent not to exempt public utilities from other sections of the act unless expressly exempted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the separation of the \u201cfurnishing of electricity\u201d from the \u201cmanufacture of tangible personal property\u201d in the second provision supports an inference that the term, \u201cindustrial plant,\u201d excludes facilities devoted to the generation of electricity for public consumption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Machinery was expressly excluded from the original exemption for materials, tools and fuel. See footnote 10, supra. In 1978, the legislature deleted the language excluding machinery and added a new subsection, now codified as \u00a7 12-412 (34), which exempted \u201cmachinery . . . used directly in a manufacturing production process.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[A] legislative act must be read as a whole and construed to give effect and to harmonize all of its parts . . . .\u201d <em>Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>176 Conn. 43, 50, 404 A.2d 898 (1978). The legislative history of \u00a7 12-412 (34) therefore guides us in determining what constitutes \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for the purposes of the exemption from \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) claimed by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Senator Audrey P. Beck, the sponsor of the bill to eliminate the sales tax on machinery and equipment, gave the following two reasons in support of the legislation: \u201cThe first is that in the judgment of the Committee, <em>the sector of the business community having the greatest difficulties is the manufacturing sector and, therefore, by eliminating the sales tax on machinery and equipment, we feel that we will be stimulating the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>manufacturing sector to modernize, to improve, to remain efficient and competitive </em>and, secondly, in terms of the sales by those companies, which are selling such equipment, we feel that by completely eliminating this tax, we will also stimulate their own sales of that equipment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) During House debate on the bill, the House Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Representative Gardner E. Wright, Jr., referred to the elimination of the tax as \u201can encouragement and an inducement for manufacturers in the state of Connecticut,\u201d citing United Technologies as the largest manufacturer in the state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The legislative intent is further illuminated by comments made by Representative Wright at public hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Finance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In response to a question about the meaning of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d under the act,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Representative Wright stated: \u201cLet me try to explain a little bit of the rationale about what we did. We had limited number of dollars to work with and we felt that it was our purpose and our intention to put those tax incentives where we thought they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>would do the most good in the expansion of jobs in the state of Connecticut, and <em>we felt the manufacturing industry where we produced goods for sale </em>outside of the state of Connecticut or even to other manufacturing industries or concerns within the state, it <em>would provide us with the greatest return, and that if we were to encourage expansion and development in the true manufacturing industries, we would encourage expansion of jobs in Connecticut, </em>and that\u2019s why.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Pt. 2, 1978 Sess., p. 549. He suggested that proposed new plants for J.C. Penney and Union Carbide would provide \u201ctrue manufacturing jobs.\u201d Id., p. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 12-412 (34) demonstrates that the elimination of the sales tax on machinery and equipment was intended to encourage the growth and development of \u201ctrue\u201d manufacturing industries in Connecticut. See <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 135, 527 A.2d 672 (1987). We conclude that the exemption claimed by the taxpayer pursuant to \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, for services rendered to machinery and equipment at an industrial plant, was motivated by the same concerns.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c[Wjould the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>\u2018manufacturing industries\u2019 strike the mind of the average man, when used in the above connection as including an electric light plant?\u201d <em>Frederick Electric Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>84 Md. 599, 601, 36 A. 362 (1897). \u201cIn the ordinary popular meaning of the word, a corporation which operates gas or electric works is not a \u2018manufacturer,\u2019 and is not so styled, though, scientifically speaking, gas or electricity may be a product of manufacture.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>New Orleans Ry. &amp; Light Co., </em>116 La. 144, 149, 40 So. 597 (1906). The history of \u00a7 12-412 (34) makes clear that the \u201cmanufacturing industries\u201d exempted from taxes on the purchase of machinery and equipment and services rendered thereto were \u201cintended to be such as might go elsewhere\u201d; <em>Frederick Electric Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>supra, 602; not those, like a public power utility, that would ordinarily be expected to remain in this state. The inducements provided by the exemptions in \u00a7 12-412 (34) and \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the regulations therefore do not apply to businesses engaged in the generation of electricity. See id., 602-603. We conclude that the legislative purpose is not served by exempting such businesses from the tax on services rendered to machinery and production equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The case law in other jurisdictions supports our conclusion that machinery and equipment used for the generation of electricity is not \u201cmachinery and production equipment\u201d at an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies because the generation of electricity is not \u201cmanufacturing\u201d within the meaning of the Sales and Use Tax Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The commissioner properly calls our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>attention to a decision of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court; <em>Potomac Edison Co. </em>v. Commonwealth, 50 Pa. Commw. 1, 411 A.2d 1287, aff'd, 491 Pa. 432, 421 A.2d 214 (1980), appeal dismissed, 451 U.S. 901, 101 S. Ct. 1965, 68 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1981); for the proposition that the generation of electricity is not manufacturing. In <em>Potomac Edison </em>Co., the court reviewed the taxpayer\u2019s appeal from an adverse administrative decision. In the absence of a statutory definition, the court defined \u201cmanufacturing\u201d as \u201cthe application of labor or skill to material whereby the original article is changed into a new, different and useful article. . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Potomac Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra, 411 A.2d 1290. The court stated that the legal concept of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d requires both a \u201csubstantial\u201d change and the continued existence of the original, tangible material in the finished product. Id. Relying on this definition, the court concluded that the process of electricity generation was not manufacturing because \u201cno molecules of the original raw material survive in the final product.\u201d Id., 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The taxpayer refers us, however, to a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota which held that electricity is a \u201cmanufactured, marketable product\u201d for the purposes of a property tax exemption. <em>In re Answer of Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co., </em>289 Minn. 64, 75, 182 N.W.2d 685 (1970). The Minnesota law at issue exempted \u201c[tjools and machinery which by law is considered as personal property used or useable in . . . the manufacture, processing, production, sale or distribution of marketable products . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 67. In dicta, the court reviewed with approval earlier Minnesota decisions and decisions from other jurisdictions which held that electricity generation is manufacturing. Id., 72-73. The holding in <em>In re Answer of Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co., </em>however, turned on the question of whether electricity is a \u201cmarketable product\u201d within the meaning of the statutory exemption. Id., 73-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The definition of manufacturing in <em>Potomac Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra, is substantially similar to the definition set forth in \u00a7 12-426-llb (10) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. See footnote 5, supra. Nevertheless, we reject as unnecessarily technical the reasoning of the Pennsylvania court in that case. The holding of <em>In re Answer of Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co., </em>supra, is inapplicable because it did not depend, as does the exemption claimed by the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>payer in the present case, upon a determination of whether electricity generation constitutes manufacturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The taxpayer bears the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption. <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 369. Where there is any ambiguity in the applicability of an exemption, we must uphold the assessment of the commissioner. Id. The taxpayer in the present appeal has not sustained its burden. We therefore reverse the decision of the trial court in favor of the taxpayer. We agree with the taxpayer, however, that a remand to the trial court is necessary for a factual determination of the nature of the subject property. See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions.

The taxpayer has not appealed that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\"> Because the trial court found that the subject property qualified as machinery and production equipment at an industrial plant, the court did not determine whether it was real or personal property.

However, \u00a7 12-426-26 (d) of Conn.

It does not, however, exempt such companies generally from that tax but only as regards service delivered to customers \u2018through mains, lines or pipes.\u2019 <em>The careful delineation of the bounds of this exemption gives unusual force to the principle that the express mention in a statute of one exemption precludes reading others into it. . . . </em>The provision unmistakably shows a legislative intent that, as to sales other than those specified, public utility companies should be subject to the sales tax, and shows that there was no intent to exempt them generally from that tax.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> The minimal legislative history available on the exemption for materials, tools and fuel supports such an interpretation. At a hearing on the sales tax bill, state tax commissioner Walter W. Walsh explained the exemption for materials, tools and fuel as follows: \u201cIf the article purchased is for <em>tangible property </em>to be produced for sale, assembling or processing or whatever is consumed in such cases and no tax should be on the material. A purchase of oil which is going into a machine making up <em>things </em>is not taxed. Parts making up <em>things </em>eventually used for resale, no tax. Many parts incorporated into the same for parts to be sold, no tax.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Nevertheless, the commissioner\u2019s references to the production of \u201ctangible property\u201d and \u201cthings\u201d as manufacturing suggests that the drafters did not intend the generation of electricity, which was separately exempted, to constitute manufacturing at an industrial plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> No. 78-71, \u00a7 4, of the 1978 Public Acts added the following subsection to the Sales and Use Tax Act: \u201c(gg) Sales of and the storage, use or other consumption of machinery used directly in a manufacturing or agricultural production process.

Moreover, the definitions set forth in \u00a7 12-426-llb of the regulations, including the definition of \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d apply to both \u00a7\u00a7 12-412 (34) and 12-407 (2) (i) (I). We also find support in the administrative interpretation of \u00a7 12-412 (34) by the commissioner. \u201cThis court pays considerable deference to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of tax statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 24, 566 A.2d 658 (1989). In particular, the \u201ctime-tested\u201d administrative interpretation of a statute is entitled to great weight when it is both reasonable and consistent with the overall statutory scheme. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). We accord significant weight, therefore, to the fact that, since as early as January 1, 1982, the commissioner has treated all <em>purchases </em>of machinery by utility companies, including electric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>ity generation machinery, as taxable, and thus non-exempt pursuant to \u00a7 12-412 (34). See Connecticut Sales and Use Tax Manual \u00a7 20.18.13.
