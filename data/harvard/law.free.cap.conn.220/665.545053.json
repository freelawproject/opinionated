During those years, UTC did business in Connecticut and, consequently, was subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax embodied in chapter 208 of the General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended (corporation business tax).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>defendant was the commissioner of the department of revenue services for the state of Connecticut (commissioner) at the time of the institution of this action and the action was brought against him in his official capacity. For the income years 1976 through and including 1982, UTC was a corporation taxable both within and without Connecticut and therefore subject to the apportionment provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-218.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">For the years 1976 through 1982, UTC timely filed its Connecticut corporation business tax returns and timely paid in full all taxes and charges that its calculations indicated were due. Thereafter, the commissioner conducted an audit of UTC\u2019s corporation business tax returns for the years 1976 through 1982. As a result, on August 2,1986, the commissioner notified UTC that he had assessed additional corporation business taxes and interest. The disputed portion of the commissioner\u2019s increased assessment was based on his determination that UTC was not allowed to utilize, and should not have utilized operating loss carryovers from 1979 and 1980 in computing its net income for the year 1981. The additional assessment attributable to the commissioner\u2019s disallowance of UTC\u2019s use of its operating loss carryovers in computing its 1981 corporation business tax increased UTC\u2019s corporation business tax liability for that year from $231,316, which UTC had previously acknowledged and paid, to $4,254,897 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Subsequently, UTC paid to the commissioner the amount shown as the total due on the commissioner's notice of additional assessment dated August 2,1986. At the same time, UTC filed a request pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-236<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a hearing and a correction of the amount of the additional taxes and interest assessed by the commissioner. The commissioner denied UTC\u2019s request for a hearing. Thereafter, UTC filed this appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-237.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>At the request of the parties, the single issue of law in controversy between them was later reserved by the trial court for the advice of the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The single issue reserved for the advice of the court is: \u201cFor the purposes of the Connecticut corporate business tax, is a taxpayer entitled to utilize its operating loss carryovers from 1979 and 1980 in computing its net income or loss under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i) for 1981 and 1982?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No evidence was taken in the trial court and the parties have filed a stipulation containing the facts necessary for a resolution of the reserved question.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In order to answer the reserved question it is necessary to review briefly the relevant history of the corporation business tax. The parties stipulated that prior to the income year 1981, taxpayers subject to the corporation business tax were required to compute their business tax liability using whichever of three methods yielded the highest tax: (a) the \u201cregular tax\u201d imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 12-214,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which was generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>equal to 10 percent of the net income of the taxpayer; (b) the \u201calternative tax\u201d imposed by General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u00a7 12-219 (1) (A),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which was generally equal to 3/10 mills per dollar of average net book value <em>of the </em>taxpayer, up to a maximum tax of $100,000, plus under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u00a7 12-219 (1) (A) and General Statutes \u00a7 12-223c, the sum of $250 for each company, other than the taxpayer, included in the taxpayer\u2019s combined return; or (c) the \u201cminimum tax\u201d of $250 per corporation included in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>combined return pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-219 (1) (A)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 12-223c.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In January, 1981, however, the legislature amended \u00a7 12-219 to provide that in addition to the three bases of computation noted above, corporations would also be required to compute their corporation business tax liability under a fourth measure of the tax popularly known as the \u201cfourth base.\u201d Under the \u201cfourth base,\u201d corporations were required to pay a tax at a rate of 5 percent measured by 50 percent of the net income or loss of the corporation received from business transacted within Connecticut, plus 50 percent of the salaries and other compensation, apportioned to Connecticut, paid to officers of the corporation and certain shareholders. General Statutes \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201cThe new additional tax base embodied in \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) was enacted as a parallel provision to the Unincorporated Business Tax, General Statutes \u00a7 12-610 et seq. See 24 S. Proc., Pt. 10,1981 Sess., p. 3308; 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1981 Sess., p. 5077. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>unincorporated business tax, which has since been repealed; see Public Acts, Spec. Sess., November, 1981, No. 81-4, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 32 (7); imposed a 5 percent tax on the taxable net income of unincorporated Connecticut businesses whose gross income exceeded $50,000. General Statutes \u00a7 12-611. While certain deductions from gross income were allowed in computing taxable net income; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-612,12-615; a business could <em>not </em>deduct amounts paid to a proprietor or partner for services rendered. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-612 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cAVhile the legislature was considering passage of the unincorporated business tax, one of its main concerns was whether unincorporated businesses would incorporate in order to avoid the new tax. See 24 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1981 Sess., p. 2118. In other words, an unincorporated business, faced with the prospect of paying the new tax, might well decide to incorporate and then to \u2018drain away\u2019 its taxable income by paying it to officers and shareholders in the form of salaries, bonuses and other benefits, those amounts being deductible in computing the net income of a <em>corporation. </em>See General Statutes \u00a7 12-217. The new additional tax base of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) was added to the corporate tax structure to prevent this method of circumventing the unincorporated business tax. 24 S. Proc., Pt. 10,1981 Sess., p. 3308. Under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (ii), \u2018salaries and other compensation\u2019 paid to officers and 1 percent shareholders, which were deducted in computing the net income of a corporation, were to be added back to net income in calculating the corporation\u2019s tax base.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>George P. Gustin Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>203 Conn. 198, 205-206, 524 A.2d 603 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">For the income years 1979 and 1980, UTC had operating losses apportioned to Connecticut in the amounts of $102,414,410 and $76,596,988, respectively. In computing its tax liability for the year 1981, UTC carried over those operating losses so as to reduce its net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>income to zero for use in computing the amount of corporation business tax that it owed for 1981 for purposes of both the \u201cregular tax\u201d imposed by \u00a7 12-214 and the \u201cfourth base\u201d tax imposed by \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the \u201cregular tax\u201d was determined simply by multiplying net income by 10 percent under that method of calculation, UTC owed no business tax for 1981. Under the \u201cfourth base\u201d tax of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B), however, although its operating loss carryovers reduced UTC\u2019s net income to zero, it was required to add back salaries and other compensation paid to officers in the amount of $8,532,635. Fifty percent of that amount at a tax rate of 5 percent yielded a tax of $213,316. That being the highest tax payable under the four bases for determining liability, UTC paid that amount of corporation business taxes for the year 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The commissioner, however, contends that while UTC correctly deducted its operating loss carryovers in calculating net income and its consequent corporation business tax liability for 1981 under the \u201cregular tax\u201d of \u00a7 12-214, it was not allowed to use, and incorrectly used, its operating loss carryovers in determining its net income and consequent corporation business tax liability under the \u201cfourth base\u201d of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cNet income\u201d under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i) was stated to be: \u201cnet income as defined in this chapter.\u201d The sole definition of \u201cnet income\u201d in chapter 208, concerning the imposition and payment of the corporation business tax, was contained in \u00a7 12-213,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which defined \u201cnet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>income,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cnet earnings received during the income year . . . computed by subtracting from gross income the deductions allowed by the terms of section 12-217 . . . .\u201d In turn, \u00a7 12-217 provided in relevant part that \u201c[notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, (1) any excess of the deductions provided in this section for any income year commencing on or after January 1,1973, over the gross income for such year or the amount of such excess apportioned to this state under the provisions of section 12-218, shall be an operating loss of such income year and <em>shall be deductible as an operating loss carryover in each of the five income years following such loss year, </em>provided the portion of such operating loss which may be deducted as an operating loss carryover in any income year following such loss year shall be limited to . . . (i) any net income greater than zero of such income year following such loss year, or in the case of a company entitled to apportion its net income under the provisions of section 12-218, the amount of such net income which is apportioned to this state thereto . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As previously noted, the commissioner has stipulated that UTC sustained the operating losses, apportionable to Connecticut, previously indicated for the years 1979 and 1980. It would appear then, that under a plain reading of the pertinent statutes, UTC was entitled to carry over those operating losses to reduce its net income to a number not less than zero, for purposes of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i), until the carryovers were exhausted, for each of the five income years following the loss years. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>218 Conn. 729, 735, 590 A.2d 974 (1991). The commissioner has failed to provide us with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>a compelling reason why that is not so or why the meaning conveyed by the plain reading of the statutes is not the proper one. See <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Trustees of California State University &amp; Colleges, </em>33 Cal. 3d 211, 218-19, 655 P.2d 317, 188 Cal. Rptr. 115 (1982); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 46.01, p. 74.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The commissioner, moreover, has conceded that UTC properly used its operating loss carryovers to reduce its net income to zero in 1981, under the \u201cregular tax\u201d of \u00a7 12-214, with the result that there was no corporation business tax due the commissioner from UTC under that section. He insists, however, that the same operating loss carryovers could not and should not have been used by UTC to reduce its net income under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i). The commissioner\u2019s positions are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Both \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-219 (1) (B) (i) provide that \u201cnet income\u201d is the \u201centire net income [as defined in chapter 208] received by such corporation or association from business transacted within the state during the income year . ...\u201d As previously indicated, \u201cnet income\u201d is defined in \u00a7 12-213 as \u201cnet earnings received during the income year . . . computed by subtracting from gross income the deductions allowed by the terms of section 12-217,\u201d and \u00a7 12-217 allows the deduction of operating loss carryovers. If we were to conclude that corporate taxpayers were allowed to use operating loss carryovers to arrive at \u201cnet income\u201d under \u00a7 12-214 but not allowed to use operating loss carryovers to determine \u201cnet income\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i), we would be attributing two different meanings to the same term, \u201cnet income,\u201d in the same statutory scheme. Such a result is contrary to both common sense and the rules of statutory construction. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 116, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991); <em>Plasticrete Block &amp; Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>216 Conn. 17, 27, 579 A.2d 20 (1990); <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 432, 572 A.2d 951 (1990); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 232. Furthermore, we have found nothing in our search of the legislative history of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B), nor has the commissioner called our attention to anything in that history, that would lead us to believe that the legislature intended that operating loss carryovers, while deductible to arrive at net income under \u00a7 12-214, were not deductible for that purpose under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i). In summary, there is no indication from any persuasive source that would induce us to conclude that the meanings or interpretations of the term \u201cnet income\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-219 (1) (B) (i) were to be dissimilar or that \u201cnet income\u201d consisted of different components depending on which of the two statutes was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">An interpretation of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i) that allowed for the use of operating loss carryovers in arriving at net income would also be compatible with the genesis of that section. As we stated in <em>George P. Gustin Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Duhno, </em>supra, 205-206, \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) was passed in 1981 in order to foreclose attempts by unincorporated businesses to circumvent the newly enacted unincorporated business tax by incorporating and paying out all their earnings to principals in salaries and other compensation and thus avoiding payment of business taxes altogether.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Obviously, the elimination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>operating loss carryovers was not necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the statute was enacted. Taxing the salaries and other compensation paid corporate officers would have achieved the intended purpose. See <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn 529, 536, 494 A.2d 555 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Also if the legislature had intended such a radical departure from the established method of calculating net income, a method that the commissioner concedes is allowed under \u00a7 12-214, a statute enacted many years prior to \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B), it surely would have manifested clearly its intention to do so. \u201cIn the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u201d <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954); <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 66, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); <em>Nor\u2019easier Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 481, 542 A.2d 692 (1988); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 527, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979). The commissioner would have us conclude, however, that it was the legislative intent, in order to enforce the new unincorporated business tax, to enact a tax statute that had the potential to raise a taxpayer\u2019s corporation business tax liability astronomically, in this instance from zero under \u00a7 12-214 and a maximum of $100,000 under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (A), to well over $4,000,000 under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B), without any indication in the newly enacted legislation that it was doing so. The commissioner would have us determine, moreover, that this was done without any discussion or mention of that potential tax increase in either house of the legislature during the debate on the bill embodying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Furthermore, as UTC points out in its brief, the purpose of allowing operating loss carryovers is to mitigate the rigidity of the annual accounting period; J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (1987) \u00a7 29.01, p. 3; and \u201cenable a taxpayer to average income and losses over a period of years to reduce the disparity between the taxation of businesses that have stable income and businesses that experience fluctuations in income.\u201d Williamson, 9-4th T.M., Net Operating Losses\u2014Concepts and Computations, A-l (1988). \u201cAn inequitable tax burden would result if companies were taxed during profitable periods without receiving any relief during periods of net operating losses.\u201d D. Kieso &amp; J. Weygandt, Intermediate Accounting (6th Ed. 1989) p. 939. We fail to understand why, if viable under the \u201cregular tax\u201d of \u00a7 12-214, the policy of averaging out income and losses is inapplicable to the \u201cfourth base\u201d tax of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i). The policy supporting the use of operating loss carryovers to reduce income is no less compelling under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) (i) than it is under \u00a7 12-214 and we see no justification for disparity in their treatment under the two statutes. We continue to believe, as we stated in <em>George P. Gustin Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 200, that the first step in ascertaining the corporation business tax under \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) was \u201cto compute the Connecticut net income <em>in the same manner </em>as under the net income base of \u00a7 12-214.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>We conclude that by the enactment of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) the legislature did not intend to prohibit the use of operating loss carryovers to compute net income and consequent corporation business tax liability under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The answer to the reserved question is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">No costs shall be taxed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\"> \u201cThe Connecticut corporation business tax; General Statutes \u00a7 12-213 et seq.; is a tax upon the franchise of corporations, whether they be domestic or foreign, \u2018for the privilege of carrying on or doing business, owning or leasing property within the state in a corporate capacity . . . .\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 12-214; <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 243, 247, 423 A.2d 883 (1979); <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>135 Conn. 37, 56, 61 A.2d 89 (1948); <em>Stanley Works </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>122 Conn. 547, 551, 190 A. 743 (1937); <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>94 Conn. 47, 55, 108 A. 154 (1919), aff\u2019d, 254 U.S. 113, 41 S.

In the case of a company other than a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust, the tax calculated under this section shall be: (A) A tax of thirty-one one hundredths of a mill per dollar for each income year of the amount derived (a) by adding (i) the average value of the issued and outstanding capital stock, including treasury stock at par or face value, fractional shares, script certificates convertible into shares of stock and amounts received on subscriptions to capital stock, computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, the average value of surplus and undivided profit computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, and (ii) the average value of all surplus reserves computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, (b) by subtracting from the sum so calculated (i) the average value of any deficit carried on the balance sheet computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, and (ii) the average value of any holdings of stock of private corporations including treasury stock shown on the balance sheet computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, and (c) by apportioning the remainder so derived between this and other states under the provisions of section 12-219a, provided in no event shall the tax so calculated exceed one hundred thousand dollars or be less than fifty dollars. For each income year beginning on or after January 1, 1972, in the case of any regulated investment company or real estate investment trust, which, in arriving at net income as defined in section 12-213, is entitled to a deduction under section 12-217 for dividends paid as defined in the federal corporation income tax law, the tax calculated under this subdivision shall not exceed ten thousand dollars and shall be calculated at the rate of five-tenths of one mill per dollar of the amount derived by adding the average value of the issued and outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>capital stock including treasury stock at par or face value, fractional shares, script certificates convertible into shares of stock and amounts received on subscriptions to capital stock, computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, and the average value of surplus and undivided profits computed on the balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period, provided, where the remainder so derived as aforesaid is apportioned between this state and other states under the provisions of section 12-219a, the tax calculated under this subdivision for any such company shall not exceed the lesser of ten thousand dollars and the tax calculated under this sentence, multiplied, in either case, by a fraction the numerator of which is the additional tax base apportioned to this state under section 12-219a and the denominator of which is the entire additional tax base. The tax shall, in no case, be less than fifty dollars for any income year. For purposes of this subdivision, in the case of a new domestic company, the balances at the beginning of its first fiscal year or period shall be the balances immediately after its organization or immediately after it commences business operations, whichever is earlier; and in the case of a foreign company, the balances at the beginning of its first fiscal year or period in which it becomes liable for the filing of a return in this state shall be the balances as established at the beginning of the fiscal year or period for tax purposes. In the case of a domestic company dissolving or limiting its existence, the balances at the end of the fiscal year or period shall be the balances immediately prior to the final distribution of all its assets; and in the case of a foreign company filing a certificate of withdrawal, the balances at the end of the fiscal year or period shall be the balances immediately prior to the withdrawal of all of its assets. When a taxpayer has carried on or had the right to carry on business within the state for eleven months or less of the income year, the tax calculated under subdivision (A) of this section shall be reduced in proportion to the fractional part of the year during which business was carried on by such taxpayer.

He argues that theoretically a loss could lower the salary component of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) in the loss year and also be carried over as an operating loss in ensuing years. While that may have been possible, a similar result was also theoretically possible under the unincorporated business tax. Because \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) and the unincorporated business tax were intended to be \u201cparallel taxes,\u201d that argument of the commissioner is unavailing. See <em>George P. Gustin Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>203 Conn. 198, 206, 524 A.2d 603 (1987). Moreover, in this instance, such a double deduction did not occur and could not have occurred because the operating losses carried over by UTC were incurred in years prior to the effective date of \u00a7 12-219 (1) (B) and the utilization of the salary component.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
