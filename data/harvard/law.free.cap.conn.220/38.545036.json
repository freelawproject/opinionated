O\u2019Connell, J., </em>found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a term of three years and nine months. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the evidence was the fruit of an unlawful seizure by the police, and that the trial court, therefore, should have granted his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that would justify the stop and therefore reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>22 Conn. App. 10, 576 A.2d 156 (1990). Upon the granting of certification on three issues,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the state appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The state claims that the Appellate Court should have concluded that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The state urges us to follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1547, 113 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1991), and conclude that at the time the pertinent evidence was obtained, the defendant had not been seized and that, therefore, the evidence was not the fruit of an unlawful seizure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the alternative, the state asserts that, even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>defendant had been seized, the seizure was justified by the investigating police officer\u2019s reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant had engaged in criminal activity. We conclude that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified a brief detention of the defendant, and that, therefore, the evidence seized was the product of a lawful seizure. Accordingly, without addressing the issue of whether there was a seizure, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of November 21, 1987, the defendant drove a friend to the Maplewood Terrace housing project in Middletown. The defendant parked his car, a 1988 white Pontiac LeMans, in the rear of a partially lit and nearly full parking lot designated as parking lot number three. The defendant\u2019s car was facing the road. After his friend left the car, the defendant met two other males with whom he was acquainted and they entered his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">On the same evening, Sergeant Frank Violissi, a seventeen year veteran of the Middletown police department and the police officer in charge of the department\u2019s street crime unit, received a telephone call from a confidential informant who had provided him with useful information in the past that had led to narcotics arrests. The informant told Violissi that a black male was selling drugs at Maplewood Terrace. Violissi and two members of the street crime unit drove in an unmarked car and met with the informant a short distance from Maplewood Terrace. Violissi arranged for the informant to make a controlled buy of narcotics from the alleged seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">About fifteen minutes later, the informant returned with what appeared to Violissi to be cocaine. The infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>mant told the officers that he had purchased the drugs from a black male named Sonny who was wearing a red hat and was seated in the driver\u2019s seat of a 1987 blue Chevrolet Beretta with two other male passengers. The informant did not indicate the car\u2019s shade of blue. The informant told Violissi that the car was parked in the rear of parking lot number three and was facing the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Violissi and the other officers drove to parking lot number three. The officers watched the defendant\u2019s car for about thirty seconds from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet and saw no suspicious activity. Violissi did not notice any blue cars or other occupied cars in the parking lot. He believed the defendant\u2019s car was the car described to him by the informant. The officers then backed up their car and parked about thirty-five feet behind the defendant\u2019s car. Violissi and one of the officers, both dressed in plain clothes with badges on chains around their necks, decided to approach the defendant\u2019s car to corroborate further the information supplied by the informant. On the basis of his experience in the Maplewood Terrace area, Violissi believed himself to be entering a life threatening situation. He therefore drew his gun and carried it by his side as he approached the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">When Violissi reached the rear of the car on the driver\u2019s side, the defendant looked into his outside rearview mirror and saw a man with a gun rapidly approaching his door. He turned around and looked at Violissi through the car window. The defendant then exited his car, pushed Violissi, and began throwing things from his clothing. Violissi testified that he recognized the items as money and contraband. He identified himself as a police officer and grabbed the defendant with his left hand. A struggle ensued. Additional police officers arrived to assist Violissi and the defendant was arrested along with the other occupants of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>In reviewing the Appellate Court\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s finding that a brief detention of the defendant was justified by the police officer\u2019s reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, we undertake a two-part analysis. First, we ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings were clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>197 Conn. 620, 625, 500 A.2d 1299 (1985); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see Practice Book \u00a7 4061. Second, in light of the facts found by the trial court, we determine whether the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the police officer lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on which to base his initial investigative approach to the defendant\u2019s car. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s conclusions must stand unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 267, 460 A.2d 970 (1983). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that Violissi had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was the person described by the informant is supported by the facts found by the court from the evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It is well established that the fourth amendment to the United States constitution allows a police officer to detain an individual briefly for investigative purposes if the officer has a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d that the individual is engaged in criminal activity. <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 110 S. Ct. 2412,110 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1990); <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The police officer\u2019s decision to do so must be based on more than hunch or speculation. \u201cIn justifying the particular intrusion 'the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u2019 <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 21.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 148-49, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). A recognized function of a constitutionally permissible <em>Terry </em>stop is to maintain the status quo for a brief period of time to enable the police to investigate a suspected crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 689, 495 A.2d 273 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In evaluating the validity of such a stop, courts consider whether, in light of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture,\u201d the police officer had \u201ca particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S. Ct. 690, 66 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 195. When, as in this case, an officer\u2019s decision to detain a suspect briefly is based on information received from an informant, the task of the reviewing court is akin to a probable cause determination. In the probable cause context, we have recently departed from the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969), in favor of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach of <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). Just as we made clear in <em>Barton </em>that the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity,\u201d \u201creliability,\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d remain \u201chighly relevant\u201d; id., 539-40; \u201c[t]hese factors are also relevant in the reasonable suspicion context, although allowance must be made in applying them for the lesser showing required to meet that standard.\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As a threshold matter, we assume that the defendant was seized for the purpose of an investigative detention at some point before he discarded the contraband, and that his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were therefore implicated. The remaining question is whether the police officer had sufficient justification to warrant the detention of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">At the suppression hearing, the trial court found that the informant was credible and reliable, that Violissi had been able to corroborate the information he had received, and therefore, that he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity that justified detaining the defendant for further investigation. Consequently, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized. On appeal, a divided panel of the Appellate Court reversed, finding \u201cthat the obvious discrepancies between the informant\u2019s description and the situation found by the police rendered the officer\u2019s suspicion speculative and unreasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 20. The majority concluded that the police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that would justify the stop. Id., 20-21. Viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the informant had supplied Violissi with information that had sufficient indicia of reliability and corresponded adequately to his observations in the parking lot to provide him with reasonable and articulable suspicion sufficient to justify approaching the defendant\u2019s car for further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The trial court found that the informant had been known to Violissi for about eight months, and had recently provided information regarding narcotics activities that had led to narcotics arrests and seizures. The trial court also found that Violissi had corroborated the information given by the informant to some extent. As anticipated, Violissi found the car in the third of four parking lots of Maplewood Terrace, in the rear of that lot, facing the street. Moreover, the car was new, its driver was a black male and two other male occupants were present, as the informant had stated. Although \u201c[a]ny one of these factors is not by itself proof of illegal conduct,\u201d taken together \u201cthey amount to reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 9, 109 S. Ct. 1581, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1989). Therefore, the trial court was justified in concluding that the informant was credible and the information he gave Violissi was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Although acknowledging that the informant had previously supplied reliable information, the majority of the Appellate Court found it \u201cimprobable that, having given such a detailed description [of the car], the informant would have been mistaken as to every detail\u201d of the car\u2019s \u201ccolor, make, model and year.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 20. The issue, however, is not whether the informant was correct. The issue is whether Violissi\u2019s suspicions should have been dispelled by the discrepancies between the car the informant described and the defendant\u2019s car. \u201cReasonable suspicion is a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">At the hearing, Violissi testified that he believed the defendant\u2019s car was in fact the car the informant described. He admitted that he did not know the difference between different car makes and models. The only discrepancy from the information given by the defendant that he noted was in the color of the car. Violissi attributed this discrepancy to the effect of the lighting conditions, which might have caused the informant to misperceive the color white as light blue. The presence of discrepancies in an informant\u2019s account does not necessarily undermine the reasonable suspicion of the police. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1972), the United States Supreme Court found that an <em>unverified </em>tip from a known informant was sufficiently reliable to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. On the basis of the information that Violissi was able to corroborate, he made the decision to investigate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The trial court credited Violissi\u2019s version of the events leading up to the defendant\u2019s arrest. The court made an express finding that Violissi lacked knowledge \u201cof what different automobiles are.\u201d The Appellate Court majority indicated its disbelief of Violissi\u2019s testimony by suggesting that a reasonable police officer with seventeen years on the police force would have been familiar with different car makes and models and would not have confused a new Chevrolet Beretta with a new Pontiac LeMans. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 18. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>majority, however, has misconstrued its function as a reviewing court. The determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is the special function of the trial court. \u201cThis court cannot sift and weigh evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 26 <em>(E. O\u2019Connell, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Robert S. Weiss &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>196 Conn. 614, 621, 495 A.2d 1006 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>175 Conn. 398, 407, 399 A.2d 1269 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In this close case the trial court might well have determined the facts differently and thus concluded that Violissi lacked the reasonable and articulable suspicion necessary to justify the detention of the defendant. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he factfinding function is vested in the trial court with its unique opportunity to view the evidence presented in a totality of the circumstances, i.e., including its observations of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses and parties, which is not fully reflected in the cold, printed record which is available to us.\u201d <em>Lupien </em>v. <em>Lupien, </em>192 Conn. 443, 445, 472 A.2d 18 (1984). Our review of the record shows that in light of the facts found by the trial court, Violissi was not acting on a whim or speculation, but upon his reasonable suspicion, sufficiently articulated in his testimony, that the defendant\u2019s car was the car described by the informant. Thus, we hold that the trial court properly concluded that the information provided by the informant, as corroborated by Violissi\u2019s observations, was sufficient to raise such a suspicion and to justify an investigative detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Our conclusion that the Appellate Court incorrectly reversed the trial court\u2019s determination that a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity existed makes it inappropriate for us to consider the federal and state constitutional issues raised by <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra. \u201c \u2018Constitutional issues are not considered unless absolutely necessary to the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>sion of a case.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 560-61, 353 A.2d 750 [1974]; 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law, \u00a7\u00a7 111, 113; see <em>Pi </em>v. <em>Delta, </em>175 Conn. 527, 534, 400 A.2d 709 [1978]; <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-47, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 [1936] (Brandeis, J., concurring).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 37-38, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). Therefore, we decline to address these constitutional issues. <em>See Alexander v. Robinson, </em>185 Conn. 540, 548, 441 A.2d 166 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Because the \u201c \u2018high crime area\u2019 factor is not an \u2018activity\u2019 of an individual\u201d; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bower, </em>24 Cal. 3d 638, 645, 597 P.2d 115, 156 Cal. Rptr. 856 (1979); the crime rate of a particular area cannot transform \u201cotherwise innocent-appearing circumstances into circumstances justifying the seizure of an individual.\u201d Id. A history of past criminal activity in a locality \u201cdoes not justify suspension of the constitutional rights of everyone, or anyone, who may subsequently be in that locality.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>35 Cal. 3d 473, 479, 674 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>240, 198 Cal. Rptr. 538 (1984); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Torres-Urena, </em>513 F.2d 540, 542-43 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As the majority acknowledges, Sergeant Frank Yiolissi detected \u201cno suspicious activity\u201d while he watched the defendant in the well lighted parking lot number three of Maplewood Terrace. Violissi also <em>did not see </em>a red hat on the defendant\u2019s head, reportedly there some fifteen minutes earlier, nor did Violissi see the defendant in the driver\u2019s seat of a 1987 blue Chevrolet Beretta, although he testified that he had \u201c[j]ust looked in the parking lot\u201d for a car of that year, color, make and model. What Violissi did see after a thirty second observation from ten to fifteen feet was the hat-less black defendant in a 1988 white car, clearly and visibly marked with the make and model \u201cPontiac LeMans,\u201d in the \u201cgeneral area\u201d wherein the informant had recounted that a black man had been selling \u201clarge amounts of cocaine.\u201d Given the fact that black and Hispanic persons predominantly inhabit Maplewood Terrace, it was not, as Violissi agreed in court, \u201can unusual event to find a car with black people sitting in it in a parking lot at Maplewood Terrace.\u201d Neither, presumably, was it unique to behold a new car in one of nearly fifteen spaces aligning the road in lot number three of Maplewood Terrace, which Violissi testified had been \u201cfull of cars.\u201d Notwithstanding the unremarkable and unsuspicious scene that Violissi encountered there, and despite the conspicuous absence of the only significant descriptive details that would have set the drug dealer that he sought apart from inculpable individuals in the vicinity, Violissi, indulging the \u201cgut feeling\u201d admittedly engendered by his experiences in and the reputation of Maplewood Terrace, impulsively drew his gun and seized the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In the name of deference to the trial court\u2019s demeanor determinations, the majority exonerates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Violissi for his failure to comprehend the vital omissions in that scene on the grounds that he truthfully-testified that the \u201conly discrepancy he noted\u201d between what he had seen in parking lot number three and what he had been informed that he would see \u201cwas in the color of the car,\u201d which he credibly claimed that he had attributed \u201cto the effect of the lighting conditions which might have caused the informant [possibly to] misperceive the color white as light blue,\u201d and further, that he sincerely stated that he \u201cdid not know the difference between different car makes and models\u201d and \u201cbelieved the defendant\u2019s car was in fact the car the informant described.\u201d The issue in the present case is not, however, whether Violissi subjectively suspected the defendant of wrongdoing or honestly believed that the car he had observed was that of the drug dealer described by the informant. Even assuming that the trial court properly found Violissi\u2019s suspicions to have been truly harbored, the question of law before this court is whether <em>\u201cthe facts available to [Violissi] at the moment of the seizure </em>. . . <em>[would] \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriated\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). If \u201csubjective good faith\u201d on the part of a detaining officer \u201calone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \u2018secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects,\u2019 only in the discretion of the police.\u201d Id., 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The dictates of the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution constrained Violissi to make a reasoned, \u201ccommon sense\u201d assessment of \u201call of the circumstances\u201d available to him; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S. Ct. 690, 66 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1981); and proscribed his seizure of any person at Maplewood Terrace unless that assessment of the \u201cwhole picture\u201d yielded \u201ca particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d Id. Having previously urged the informant \u201cto go in and get as much details as possible and to come back and supply us with that information,\u201d and, having obtained precisely what he had requested, Violissi entered the designated parking area of Maplewood Terrace in possession of particularized and objective facts that afforded him a reasonable basis for suspecting that a black man wearing a red hat and sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a 1987 blue Chevrolet Beretta was engaged in the criminal activity of selling cocaine. Yet, after \u201cget[ting] in real close\u201d to the defendant\u2019s car purportedly \u201cto corroborate what the confidential informant told us,\u201d Violissi heedlessly overlooked the conspicuous absence of the most particularized and distinctive facts of the lot. He irrationalized away the sole discrepancy that he noted, moreover, on the ground that the informant, whom he had known to have been close enough to the suspected vehicle to purchase drugs from its driver, and, in addition, to report back that \u201c[i]t had blue interior,\u201d may have mistaken the color of the car in the well lighted parking area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The facts available to Violissi at the moment he seized the defendant, in my view, hardly would have warranted a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra. If the United States constitution condones such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>seizures of Connecticut citizens, founded upon hunch and in credibly imprudent indifference to particularized information readily at hand, the \u201c \u2018demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated [that] is the central teaching of . . .
