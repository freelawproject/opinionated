The issue presented is whether the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty complied with the rules of practice and with state and federal constitutional standards concerning guilty pleas, so as to render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>remand unnecessary. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment sentencing the defendant to a term of fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The Bridgeport police arrested the defendant for the unlawful sale of narcotics on June 2, 1989. At his arraignment before the trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>on July 18, 1989, the state charged him with the illegal sale of narcotics under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After waiving the reading of the information, the defendant pleaded not guilty. On October 23,1989, the defendant appeared before the court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>and changed his plea to guilty under the doctrine enunciated in <em>North </em>Carolina v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>At the plea hearing, before any canvass of the charge had occurred, the trial court told the defendant that he would receive a fifteen year sentence. During the trial court\u2019s subsequent canvass of the guilty plea, the defendant acknowledged that he understood the <em>Alford </em>doctrine and that he entered his plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, with an understanding of the charge and its possible penalties, and after consultation with his attorney who had explained the charges to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">On November 13, 1989, the trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>accepted the defendant\u2019s plea and rendered judgment sentencing him to fifteen years imprisonment. During the sentencing proceeding, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Does your client wish to say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201cMr. McIntosh [Assistant Public Defender, Defense Counsel]: If I may simply have a moment to inquire\u2014 Mr. Badgett does request to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201cThe Court: What would you like to say Mr. Badgett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">\u201cMr. Badgett: I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not drug-dependent when I am. I have sniffed a lot of cocaine in the last few years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">\u201cThe Court: You have already entered your plea. Your plea has been canvassed, Mr. Badgett. The time for that issue has passed. Your record speaks for itself. You haven\u2019t learned your lesson. You have been arrested and convicted of the same type of activity. If this sentence doesn\u2019t teach you a lesson and you come back in, this fifteen years is going to seem like a weekend. If you want to stay in that business, there\u2019s a risk. If you get caught, there\u2019s a price to be paid and that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the price you\u2019re going to pay. It is the sentence of the Court that you be committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for fifteen years to serve.\u201d At no time did the defendant move to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Following sentencing, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that the plea canvass did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7 711, and that the post-plea sentencing proceeding did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7 720. Specifically, the defendant argued that his statement to the court regarding his drug dependency was a timely request to reconsider whether his plea was knowing or voluntary under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 720 and 721, and whether the original plea canvass complied with Practice Book \u00a7 711. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant and remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty. After the remand order, the state requested and we granted certification to appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4126 et seq. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction that it reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The defendant argues here, as he did before the Appellate Court, that the plea canvass did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>asserts that the trial court failed to ensure that the defendant fully understood \u201c[t]he nature of the charge to which the plea is offered.\u201d The defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain that General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) exempts drug-dependent persons is a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 711 (1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 711 \u201cwas promulgated to ensure that such guilty pleas are made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the waiver of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>194 Conn. 223, 226, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984); <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 373-74, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977). We have held that \u201c[a] defendant can voluntarily and understanding^ waive these rights without literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 and 712.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Examination of the record discloses that the trial court canvassed the defendant concerning the voluntary and knowing nature of his plea pursuant to both Practice Book \u00a7 711 and the mandate of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243 n.5, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUnder <em>Boykin, </em>in order for a plea to be knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made, a trial court is required to advise a defendant that his plea operates as a waiver of three fundamental constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>rights\u2014jury trial, confrontation and self-incrimination. \u2019 \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra. An examination of the relevant portions of the plea canvass<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reveals the following: The defendant specifically stated that he understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ramifications of his <em>Alford </em>plea, that he understood the nature of the crime after discussing it with his attorney, that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice, that he understood he was waiving certain constitutional rights, that his plea was voluntary and that he did not have any further questions about the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Despite the defendant\u2019s assertions that he understood the charge, he claims that the \u201coff-the-record\u201d explanations given by his attorney did not provide adequate notice of the nature of the crime. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The record discloses that the defendant chose to waive the reading of the information at his arraignment on July 18,1989. Further, we have never required that the trial court read the statute to the defendant in order for the canvass to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 711 if there are other reasons to believe that the defendant understands the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 44, 470 A.2d 688 (1984). In this case, the defendant himself admitted that counsel had, in fact, explained the statute to him. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976) (guilty plea involuntary when neither counsel nor the court informed defendant about essential element), is misplaced. This is not a case like <em>Henderson </em>in which neither defense counsel nor the trial court had explained the nature of the charge to the accused. See <em>Oppel </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>200 Conn. 553, 557, 512 A.2d 888 (1986). Here, the defendant stated that he understood the charge and that his trial counsel had explained it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We have previously held that \u00a7 21a-278 (b) places no burden on the state to prove that the defendant is not a drug-dependent person and that nondependency is not an element of the crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 165-67, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). We have concluded that the state may initially rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>a presumption of nondependency. Id. Even if the trial court did not rely upon the defendant\u2019s representation that he understood the crime with which he was charged, it did not have a duty to canvass the nature of the charge with respect to drug dependency at the plea hearing because it is not an element of the crime. \u201cWhether the existence of some fact is an essential element of a crime depends upon whether the existence of that fact forms a part of the conduct prohibited by the statute; that is, whether the fact in question is part of the corpus delecti. ... We conclude that the defendant\u2019s status as a person who is not drug-dependent is not an essential element of the offense charged. It is not a part of the prohibited conduct, i.e., the possession of a certain quantity of narcotic substance with intent to sell.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 165-66. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court complied with Practice Book \u00a7 711 at the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The defendant next argues that the postplea sentencing proceeding did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 720<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 721 (1) and (2)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because his plea was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge and as such was involuntary. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Once a guilty plea has been accepted it cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 720; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>207 Conn. 590, 597, 542 A.2d 1131 (1988). The proper procedure for challenging the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea is by a motion to withdraw the plea before the conclusion of the proceeding at which sentence is imposed. Practice Book \u00a7 720. Ordinarily, the failure to file such a motion will preclude review of alleged infirmities in the acceptance of the plea. While we have recognized exceptions to the general rule; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 115, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983); the present case does not fall within any such exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The defendant, who was at all times represented by counsel, had ample opportunity to move to withdraw his plea but failed to do so. Even if we did conclude that the defendant\u2019s statement was the equivalent of a motion to withdraw his plea, we have earlier concluded that the trial court complied with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 711 and that the defendant entered his plea voluntarily with knowledge of the nature of the charge. Therefore, the grounds for a plea withdrawal, relied upon by the defendant as set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1) and (2), are without merit. See footnote 8, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that his guilty plea was invalid because he did not have a sufficient understanding of the offense and the law in relation to the facts as constitutionally required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 121. It is appropriate, in assessing such a claim, for the trial court to presume that counsel adequately explained the charge to the defendant, given that there is some indication on the record that an explanation occurred. <em>Oppel </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 556-59; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 123-24. Since we have already concluded under the more stringent Practice Book standards that the defendant understood the nature of the charge to which the plea was offered, we need not repeat that discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less ten years nor more than twenty-five years.

The state initially charged the defendant not only with violating General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), but also as a subsequent narcotics offender under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277. As part of his plea bargain, the state nolled this subsequent narcotics offender charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b34-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 711 provides: \u201cThe judicial authority shall not accept the plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that he fully understands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">\u201c(1) The nature of the charge to which the plea is offered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">\u201c(2) The mandatory minimum sentence, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">\u201c(3) The fact that the statute for the particular offense does not permit the sentence to be suspended;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">\u201c(4) The maximum possible sentence on the charge, including, if there are several charges, the maximum sentence possible from consecutive sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>fences and including, when applicable, the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">\u2018 \u2018(5) The fact that he has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and the fact that he has the right to be tried by a jury or a judge and that at that trial he has the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> We note that \u201cthe Practice Book provisions were designed to reflect the principles embodied in <em>Boykin </em>[v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.

App. 378, 536 A.2d 605 (1988), for the proposition that no motion to withdraw should be required in this case, is unavailing. At the sentencing hearing in <em>Morant, </em>the defendant stated: \u201cI had not pleaded guilty to this court on my own recognition. I was on a pressure force to plead guilty. It was the way to withdraw\u2014\u201d Id., 382. Subsequently, the court interrupted the defendant numerous times but he did manage to assert that he wanted to appeal. Id. Morant never filed a motion or stated orally that he wanted to withdraw his_plea but the Appellate Court concluded that his statements were clear evidence that his plea had not been entered voluntarily and ordered a remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty. Id. The facts in this case are distinguishable. The defendant never asserted to the trial court that his plea was involuntary; in fact, he never mentioned his plea. His assertions that he was drug-dependent were more akin to claims of innocence to the crime of narcotics sales by a person who is not drug-dependent under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) than to any misunderstanding of the nature of the charge. It is instructive to note that he maintained that he understood the charge at the plea canvass and that the defendant himself raised the issue of drug dependency at the sentencing hearing, thereby indicating that he knew the nature of the charge. Furthermore, since the defendant pleaded guilty under the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), he may maintain his innocence while simultaneously entering a guilty plea. The court is under no obligation to review his <em>Alford </em>plea merely because the defendant contends that he is innocent. Also, contrary to <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, there is no evidence that the sentencing judge foreclosed the defendant\u2019s opportunity to move to withdraw his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
