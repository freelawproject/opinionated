The disciplinary proceeding arose out of a complaint filed by the named defendant, the department of health services (department). As a result of that proceeding, the plaintiffs chiropractic license was suspended for one year, he was ordered to pay fines totalling $5000 and he was placed on probationary status for a period of three years. The plaintiff, a chiropractor licensed by the state of Connecticut, filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court. The trial court sustained the appeal as to certain of the counts filed against the plaintiff and dismissed the appeal as to the other counts. After the plaintiff filed an appeal and the defendants filed a cross appeal in the Appellate Court, we transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We now affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. After complaints concerning the plaintiff had been made to the department, it brought a disciplinary action in twenty-four counts. The department alleged that, in the course of providing chiropractic services, the plaintiff had engaged in illegal and incompetent conduct and material deception in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conduct at issue involved the treatment of three patients during 1982 and 1983. The board charged that the plaintiff had engaged in incompetent practice in diagnosing Mark Spivey and in advising him that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>scoliosis was caused by emotional or psychological factors. The board also claimed that the plaintiff had engaged in illegal and incompetent conduct and material deception in the treatment of Cheryl Benham and her husband, Richard Benham. Those allegations arose out of certain representations made by the plaintiff and out of his use of x-rays. The charges also concerned the plaintiffs use of a procedure known as the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation, which involves a manual intra-rectal examination and manipulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff performed this procedure on Cheryl Ben-ham on several occasions and advised her that proper chiropractic adjustment required this procedure. In addition, after learning that Cheryl Benham would be taking a trip by plane, the plaintiff instructed her to perform this procedure on herself during the flight. The plaintiff also advised Richard Benham of the necessity of this procedure, but he did not agree to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">When the hearings on this matter were held by the board in 1985 and 1986, General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 20-25<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> required that the board consist of two chiro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>praetors and one public member. One of the chiropractic members, Lewis Labbadia, recused himself from this matter because he had filed a complaint with the department about the plaintiff\u2019s conduct. Because there was no public member of the board at the time of the hearings, the hearings were conducted solely by Marino Passero, the other chiropractor on the board at that time. After the hearings, Mary Coman was appointed as the public member of the board. She read the record of the hearings and discussed the matter with Passero, and the board subsequently issued its decision, which was signed by Passero and Coman.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">During the hearings, the department withdrew three of the counts. The board dismissed or transferred to another state agency eight of the remaining counts, while it found in the department\u2019s favor on the other thirteen counts. The plaintiff then appealed that decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. After granting the plaintiff\u2019s motions to present evidence outside the record and to add to the record, the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal as to seven of the counts and dismissed the appeal as to the five other counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of those five counts concerns either the plaintiff\u2019s use of the coccygealmeningeal manipulation or statements that he made regarding that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that: (1) count twenty of the department\u2019s complaint adequately informed the plaintiff of the nature of the charge in that count; (2) the plaintiff waived the right to claim that the board\u2019s decision was not rendered on a timely basis because he did not avail himself of the remedy available under General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-180 (a) and (b); (3) the plaintiff received a fair hearing and was not denied his right to due process of law; (4) Passero\u2019s membership on the board was proper despite the fact that at the time of the hearings he was an officer of the Council of Chiropractic Education; (5) the board properly interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 20-28 (b) as defining limitations on chiropractic practice; (6) the board properly admitted into evidence an exhibit concerning schools and colleges of chiropractic approved by the board; and (7) the plaintiff had abandoned one of his claims by failing to brief that issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In their cross appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that expert testimony was required to support some of the counts; and (2) allowed the plaintiff to conduct discovery after the hearing before the board and supplement the record of those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The plaintiff claims that the twentieth count did not adequately inform him of the nature of the charge against him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the plaintiff filed a written request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that the department state the basis for its claim that the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation was improperly prescribed and not clinically indicated, the department denied this request on the ground that there is no provision for discovery under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the plaintiffs contention that his rights under the federal due process clause and under the UAPA were denied because of the alleged deficiency in the notice. The trial court also rejected the plaintiffs claim that the department\u2019s refusal to respond to his request for clarification violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-177 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the charge was adequately stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c) provides that \u201c[n]o revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action . . . In <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 534, 560 A.2d 403 (1989), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>we noted that the notice requirements in \u00a7 4-182 (c) are stricter than those in \u00a7 4-177 (b) because the former proceeding involves a \u201c \u2018more compelling private interest.\u2019 \u201d When the potential result of an agency proceeding is the suspension of a license upon which a person depends in earning his or her living, \u201c \u2018due process requires that the notice given must advise the party of the facts or conduct alleged to be in violation of the law and must fairly indicate the legal theory under which such facts are claimed to constitute a violation of the law.\u2019 \u201d Id., 535, quoting Hart <em>Twin Volvo Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 42, 47, 327 A.2d 588 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The language in the twentieth count informed the plaintiff that this charge arose from his prescribing the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation for Richard Ben-ham. He was therefore fairly apprised of the facts or conduct that served as the basis for the department\u2019s charge. In addition, the count informed him that his conduct was alleged to be in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-29. His claim, in essence, is that he was never given notice of the legal theory under which those facts gave rise to the statutory violation. In its ruling on the twentieth count, the board indicated that the basis for its conclusion that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 20-29 by prescribing the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation for Richard Benham was its conclusion that the use of this technique constituted incompetent practice. Although we note that the legal basis for the allegation in the twentieth count could have been expressed in clearer terms, we conclude that the notice provided was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Even if we were to conclude that the twentieth count failed to provide adequate notice to the plaintiff, our disposition of this issue would be the same because the plaintiff did not suffer material prejudice as a result of this alleged procedural deficiency. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-183 (g); <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 196 Conn. 192, 205, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985). The plaintiff introduced evidence to attempt to show that the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation was taught at a chiropractic college and that the use or prescription of this procedure would not constitute incompetent practice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff, therefore, cannot now complain that his defense was prejudiced by any alleged deficiency in notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The plaintiff next argues that the board\u2019s decision was void because it was not rendered within ninety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>days, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-180 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendants concede that the board did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 4-180 (a), but assert that the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff had waived his right to challenge the timeliness of the board\u2019s ruling by not applying to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-180 (b) for an order requiring the board to issue its decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Section 4-180 (b) provides in part that \u201c[i]f an agency fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section in any contested case, any party thereto or any interested person may apply to the superior court ... for an order requiring the agency to render a decision forthwith, after hearing.\u201d We have held that the failure to raise a procedural claim or the failure to utilize a remedy available to cure a procedural defect can constitute a waiver of the right to object to the alleged defect. See <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 536 (plaintiff did not file an application for a more definite and detailed statement of the charges pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 [b] [4]); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 461-63, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987) (failure to raise claim that adjudicator should be disqualified within reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>able time of learning of basis for disqualification); <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 208, 213-14, 257 A.2d 795 (1969) (failure to object at zoning hearing to reading into the record a letter in opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 application for approval); see also <em>Cantor </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>12 Conn. App. 435, 436-37 n.2, 531 A.2d 606 (1987); <em>Curry </em>v. <em>St. Louis County, </em>773 S.W.2d 499, 502 (Mo. App. 1989) (no due process violation despite delay in issuance of administrative decision where appellant did not utilize statutory remedy to prevent unreasonable delay). We conclude that the plaintiff waived his right to object to the board\u2019s noncompliance with \u00a7 4-180 (a) by not invoking the remedy provided in \u00a7 4-180 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiff further asserts that his rights to due process and a fair hearing were violated because: (1) coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sel for the department referred to unsuccessful settlement negotiations; (2) the legal advisor for the board allegedly assumed the role of an advocate at one point during the hearings; and (3) Passero, the board member who presided at the hearings, should have recused himself on the basis of his professional relationship with a chiropractor who had treated one of the patients involved in this case. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We have stated that \u201c \u2018not all procedural irregularities require a reviewing court to set aside an administrative decision; material prejudice to the complaining party must be shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 205; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-183 (g). The trial court concluded that counsel for the department should not have referred to settlement negotiations during the final hearing, but that those remarks had not materially prejudiced the plaintiff. We agree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The general rule that evidence of settlement negotiations is not admissible at trial is based upon the public policy of promoting the settlement of disputes. <em>Simone Corporation </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>187 Conn. 487, 490, 446 A.2d 1071 (1982); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.5.4 (b). Although hearings before administrative agencies are not governed by the strict rules of evidence, they \u201c \u2018must be conducted so as not to violate the fundamental rules of natural justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 536, 525 A.2d 940 (1987), quoting <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 249, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984). Allowing evidence of settlement negotiations to be admitted at administrative hearings is inconsistent with both fundamental principles of justice and with the public policy of encouraging settlements. We conclude, therefore, that evidence of attempts at settlement is generally not admissible at adjudicative hearings by agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In this case, however, counsel for the department referred only to the fact that the department had made a settlement \u201coffer.\u201d The terms of the offer were not disclosed. There was no suggestion that the plaintiff responded to the offer, or even participated in settlement negotiations. On the basis of this record, therefore, we conclude that the plaintiff was not prejudiced by this procedural irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The plaintiff next claims that his rights to due process and a fair hearing were violated and that his right to present a defense was hindered by the adversarial role allegedly assumed by the counsel for the board during the final hearing. The trial court dismissed this claim, concluding that the plaintiff had not suffered any material prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">During each of the three hearings, an attorney from the attorney general\u2019s office was present to advise the board on any legal rulings it was required to make and to assist the board in the fact gathering process. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>attorney stated that his role was not that of an advocate, but that he would ask questions of the witnesses concerning the matters before the board, particularly matters not directly related to the merits of the case. During the third hearing, the board\u2019s attorney asked a series of questions of Nicholas Wisniewski, a chiropractor who testified for the plaintiff. These questions were directed to testimony by Wisniewski about a Colorado case in which he had testified regarding the propriety of a chiropractor\u2019s diagnosis and treatment of spinal problems. Although Passero overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the questioning of Wisniewski by the board\u2019s attorney, shortly thereafter he sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objection to further questioning concerning the Colorado case on the ground that it was \u201ctoo far afield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We need not address whether counsel for the board did, in fact, improperly assume the role of an advocate at the hearing because we conclude that the plaintiff did not suffer material prejudice from the line of questioning at issue here. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-183 (g); <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. These questions were directed at such a tangential issue that Passero subsequently discontinued the entire line of inquiry. In light of the fact that the questioning by the counsel for the board was of little import, the plaintiff cannot rely on it to establish his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The plaintiff contends that Passero should have recused himself from this case. The basis for his claim is the fact that Mark Spivey, one of the plaintiff\u2019s patients whose treatment gave rise to the disciplinary action, consulted a chiropractor, Donald J. Lawlor, who was a member of the same \u201cchiropractic group\u201d as Passero. Lawlor was instrumental in the filing of the counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>against the plaintiff related to Spivey\u2019s treatment. The trial court concluded that the \u201ctenuous relationship\u201d between Passero and Lawlor did not require that Passero recuse himself. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is presumed that members of administrative boards acting in an adjudicative capacity are unbiased. <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 236, 506 A.2d 139, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 S. Ct. 42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986); see <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975). The party who contends that an adjudicator is biased bears the burden of proving the disqualifying interest. <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 196, 102 S. Ct. 1665, 72 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982); <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe applicable due process standards for disqualification of administrative adjudicators do not rise to the height of those prescribed for judicial disqualification. <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>supra. The canons of judicial ethics go far toward cloistering those who become judges, the ultimate arbiters of constitutional and statutory rights, from all extraneous influences that could even remotely be deemed to affect their decisions. Such a ratified atmosphere of impartiality cannot practically be achieved where the persons acting as administrative adjudicators, whose decisions are normally subject to judicial review, often have other employment or associations in the community they serve. It would be difficult to find competent people willing to serve, commonly without recompense, upon the numerous boards and commissions in this state if any connection with such agencies, however remotely related to the matters they are called upon to decide, were deemed to disqualify them. Neither the federal courts nor this court require a standard so difficult to implement as a prerequisite of due process of law for administrative adjudication.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s rights to a fair trial and due process were not violated by Passero\u2019s refusal to recuse himself. Passero and Lawlor were both members of the Norwalk Chiropractic Group, Inc. That group was a service corporation that paid the expenses of operating the building where its five chiropractor members worked. The building was owned by Passero and another member of the group. Each of these chiropractors acted as independent subcontractors and paid rent to the corporation to cover the cost of maintaining the facility. Each had separate practices and collected their own fees. The group was not a professional corporation, and there was no sharing of income or funds between the members. Passero never discussed this case with Lawlor and he first learned of Lawlor\u2019s involvement in this matter at the initial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The plaintiff has failed to prove that Passero \u201chad a disqualifying interest sufficient to overcome the \u2018presumption of honesty and integrity\u2019 .... <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>supra, 47.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 238. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence clearly supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the relationship between Lawlor and Passero did not require that the latter recuse himself from this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 20-25 provides in part that \u201c[n]o professional member [of the board of chiropractic examiners] shall be an elected or appointed officer of a <em>professional society of chiropractors </em>or have been such an officer during the year immediately preceding his appointment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s hearings before the board, Marino Passero, the only professional member of the board who participated in the board\u2019s decision to discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the plaintiff, was president of the Council of Chiropractic Education. The plaintiff renews on appeal his claim that the Council of Chiropractic Education is a \u201cprofessional society of chiropractors\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-25 and, therefore, that the board was not properly constituted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The only evidence in the record concerning the Council of Chiropractic Education came from a statement made by Passero. He indicated that the members of this council are educational institutions and a commission on accreditation. He also stated that membership is \u201cnot open to the field.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The language of \u00a7 20-25 is ambiguous as to whether this provision applies to the Council of Chiropractic Education. \u201c \u2018Where the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court . . . <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). Under our rules of statutory construction, this court is to be guided by the language, purpose and legislative history of the statute in question.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 405, 528 A.2d 805 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We conclude that the legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 20-25, did not intend to include within the meaning of the term \u201cprofessional society of chiropractors\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>organization whose membership is not generally open to members of the profession and whose principal function is to accredit educational institutions in that field. The legislative history on this issue, albeit limited, supports this conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant has suggested no viable reason, and we can conceive of none, why the legislature would wish to exclude from the board a professional who was an officer of an organization of the nature of the Council of Chiropractic Education.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Our conclusion is also supported by the principle that \u201c \u2018[n]o word in a statute should be treated as superfluous, void or insignificant unless there are impelling reasons . . . why this principle cannot be followed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 506, 522 A.2d 264 (1987). Section 20-25 refers to a \u201cprofessional society <em>of chiropractors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Passero indicated that the members of the Council on Chiropractic Education are educational institutions and the individuals who make up the accreditation commission. Although it is not clear from the record whether individuals are appointed to represent member institutions, or whether such individuals include both chiropractors and nonchiropractors, this limited evidence of the membership structure of the Council of Chiropractic Education does not support the plaintiff\u2019s contention that this organization is a \u201cprofessional society of chiropractors\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The plaintiff argues that the board and the trial court improperly interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>which provides that \u201c[a]ny chiropractor who has complied with the provisions of this chapter may . . . [e]xamine, analyze and diagnose the human living body and its diseases, and use for diagnostic purposes the x-ray or any other general method of examination for diagnosis and analysis taught in any school or college of chiropractic which has been recognized and approved by the state board of chiropractic examiners.\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the board stated that the plaintiffs use of the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation on Cheryl Benham for diagnostic purposes constituted illegal conduct in violation of \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) because that procedure \u201cwas not part of the core curriculum of any school or college of chiropractic approved by the Board at any relevant time in this case.\u201d The trial court agreed with that interpretation of \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2). The plaintiff now contends that \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) merely establishes the scope of diagnostic techniques that are presumptively valid, and that this section does not limit chiropractors to the use of diagnostic techniques that are taught at a school or college of chiropractic approved by the board. We disagree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cOrdinarily, the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts where the administrative decision is not entitled to special deference, particularly where, as here, the statute has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny or time-tested agency interpretations.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773-74, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). Although we need not defer to the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2), we conclude that the board properly construed this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We reject the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) is unambiguous and that its plain language, namely, the use of the term \u201cmay,\u201d mandates that this provision be construed as merely establishing that the use of certain diagnostic procedures by chiropractors is presumptively valid. \u201c \u2018It is an elementary rule of construction that statutes should be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling their separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation . . . .\u2019 <em>La Providenza </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 23, 29, 420 A.2d 905 (1979).\u201d <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984). When \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) is read in conjunction with the other subdivisions of \u00a7 20-28 (b), it is evident that in each of these provisions the legislature was attempting to establish limits on the practice of chiropractic.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Construing \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) as limiting chiropractors to the use of diagnostic procedures taught in schools recognized and approved by the board is also consistent with the licensing provisions applicable to chiropractors. One of the conditions for obtaining a chiropractic license is graduation from an accredited school approved by the board, the same bench mark used in \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2). See General Statutes \u00a7 20-27. Moreover, our conclusion that \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) sets limits on what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>diagnostic techniques a chiropractor is allowed to use is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 20-28 (b).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The plaintiff argues that the effect of the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) is to restrict the use of new diagnostic techniques that are not yet taught in approved colleges of chiropractic and thereby limit advancement in chiropractic care. While the plaintiff may indeed be correct in this assertion, we have concluded that the legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2), intended to set limits on the diagnostic techniques that chiropractors can employ. The policy issue raised by the plaintiff, therefore, should be addressed to the legislature rather than this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">As his final claim, the plaintiff argues that the board improperly admitted into evidence exhibit N and that he suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the admission of this exhibit. Exhibit N included a list of accredited schools and colleges of chiropractic approved by the board as of February, 1983, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on the admission of this list.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>was relevant to the determination of whether the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation was taught at any chiropractic schools approved by the board. The plaintiff contends that this list should not have been admitted by the board because it was hearsay and because a proper foundation was not laid.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cWe note first that administrative tribunals are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence and that they may consider evidence which would normally be incompetent in a judicial proceeding, as long as the evidence is reliable and probative. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 710, 372 A.2d 110, cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977); <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 559, 570, 345 A.2d 520 (1973). There is moreover no specific prohibition against hearsay evidence in the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which provides that \u2018[a]ny oral or documentary evidence may be received, but [that] the agency shall, as a matter of policy, provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (1).\u201d <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>177 Conn. 344, 348, 416 A.2d 1205 (1979). \u201c[W]hen a hearing will be expedited and the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be received in written form.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-178 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">We conclude that the list of accredited and approved schools was both reliable and probative. The list was obtained from the licensing division of the department of health services. Referring to this list, Passero, the board member who presided at the plaintiffs hearings, stated that each year the board sends to the licensing division its updated list of the approved schools and colleges of chiropractic after obtaining from the Council of Chiropractic Education the names of accredited schools. General Statutes \u00a7 20-27 (d) requires that the board prepare this list annually. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff cannot seriously contend that there was an insufficient foundation for the admission of this list or that the list was not probative or sufficiently trustworthy. We conclude, therefore, that the list of chiropractic schools approved by the board was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In the cross appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the department was required to present expert testimony to support seven of the counts against the plaintiff. The board members who decided the plaintiffs case were Passero, a licensed chiropractor, and Mary Coman, the public member of the board who possessed no expertise in chiropractic.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In reaching its conclusion that expert testimony was required for seven of the counts, the trial court relied on our decision in <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 525, 560 A.2d 403 (1989), in which we stated that an administrative board hearing and deciding a licensing case must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sist of a majority of experts in order to obviate the need for expert testimony on issues whose determination requires knowledge of standards of professional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In this case, because the board that decided the matter did not consist of a majority of expert members, the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal as to the seven counts that required the presentation of expert evidence. The defendants contend that the \u201cmajority of experts\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Levinson </em>applies only to the statutory composition of the board, not to the membership of the panel that actually hears and decides a case. Alternatively, the defendants argue that the presence of a single expert on the panel that hears and decides a case is sufficient. We disagree with both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendants\u2019 first argument is without merit. In <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 348-50, 64 A.2d 330 (1949), we stated that because the medical examining board at that time was composed exclusively of medical professionals, the board was competent to determine whether the conduct of a physician was in accordance with the standards of the profession without hearing expert evidence. Accord <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 89, 411 A.2d 42 (1979). In <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, we considered whether our decision in <em>Jaffe </em>was undercut by the passage of Public Acts 1977, No. 77-614, \u00a7 362, which changed the composition of the chiropractic examining board from three chiropractors to two chiropractors and one public member.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We concluded that \u201cthe rationale of <em>Jaffe </em>survives the addition of a public member to the board. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>long as <em>the board hearing and deciding a licensing matter </em>is composed of at least a majority of experts in the field involved in the case, the board may rely on its own expertise in evaluating charges against persons licensed by the board and the requisite standard of care by which to judge such cases.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 tortured interpretation of <em>Levinson. </em>In <em>Levinson, </em>the board that heard and decided the case consisted solely of chiropractors, and therefore the narrow issue was whether our holding in <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>supra, was eviscerated by the mere existence of public members on the statutory board. <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra. Both the rationale of our decision in that case and the dictates of common sense, however, make it clear that the relevant bench mark in determining whether expert testimony is necessary is the composition of the board that actually hears and decides the case, not the statutory composition of the board. Id., 524-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We also reject the defendants\u2019 assertion that, in the absence of expert testimony, the presence of a single expert on the board that hears and decides a case is adequate, as opposed to the rule adopted in <em>Levinson </em>requiring at least a majority of experts. Our decision in that case implicitly recognized the risk that, when considering matters that require knowledge of the standards of a profession, the public members of the board will simply defer to the expert members in the absence of expert testimony. This risk is clear in the context of the present case, where the board was composed of only one chiropractor and one public member. In order to ensure against this risk, we held in <em>Levinson, </em>and we reaffirm today, that expert testimony is necessary in a licensing matter unless the board that hears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and decides a case is composed of at least a majority of experts in the field.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-29 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe board of chiropractic examiners may take any of the actions set forth in section 19a-17 for any of the following reasons . . . violation of any provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted hereunder, engaging in fraud or material deception in the course of professional services or activities ... or illegal, incompetent or negligent conduct in the practice of chiropractic.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> The board concluded that the manipulation was used \u201cat least in part for diagnostic purposes.\u201d The use of this procedure as a diagnostic technique is also referred to as \u201cstressology.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1985)] \u00a7 20-25. examining board.

That count informed the plaintiff that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the board regarded the use of the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation as a per se violation of \u00a7 20-29.</p>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">We also reject the plaintiffs contention that the department was required to respond to his request for articulation of the twentieth count under the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-177 (b).

Those provisions require an agency, upon application, to furnish a more definite and detailed statement of the matters asserted if the initial notice includes only a statement of the issues involved. In this case, however, the notice provided to the plaintiff informed him not only of the issues involved, but also of the facts and conduct that served as the basis for the charge.

He also testified that he did not know of any schools at which the course was being taught at the time of the hearing and that he did not know if the course had been offered at any time after 1977.

In <em>Bogaert </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 536-38, we held that the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 51-29 (amended and recodified as General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b), which set forth the time limits for the rendering of judgments in civil actions, are mandatory, but that those limits can be waived. We noted that in certain circumstances a party\u2019s failure to object to the timeliness of a decision until after judgment is rendered can constitute a waiver of that defect if there is \u201csome duty or occasion to speak or act.\u201d Id., 538. Here, the existence of the statutory remedy in General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-180 (b) provided an occasion and a duty to raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>supra, 240-46, we concluded that the time limitations in General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (c) are mandatory but that the existence of a violation of those provisions did not mandate that a complaint necessarily be dismissed.

Similarly, the existence of the remedy provided in \u00a7 4-180 (b) supports the proposition that a violation of the timeliness provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (a) does not invalidate a decision of the board, and that the failure to employ this remedy constitutes a waiver of the violation.

Representative John Morrison stated that \u201cthis bill simply updates the definition of the practice of chiropractic [in General Statutes \u00a7 20-24], <em>It specifies in greater detail what a chiropractor may or may not do. </em>The bill describes in detail the various methods a chiropractor may use to diagnose and to apply proper treatment for his patients.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4,1976 Sess., p. 1336.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\"> The first page of exhibit N is a list of chiropractic schools approved by the board. The succeeding pages of the exhibit are copies of letters sent to Lewis Labbadia, D.C., a member of the board, from schools appearing on that list in response to a letter sent by Labbadia inquiring whether stressology was being taught at those schools or whether it was the subject of research. \u201cStressology\u201d is a procedure involving manipulation of the coccyx to determine meningeal tension. Each of the schools on the list answered \u201cno\u201d to both of these questions. Although at the hearing the plaintiff objected to the admission of these letters as well as to the list of the schools, in his brief the plaintiff refers only to the list of schools. We conclude, therefore, that he has abandoned his claim of inadmissibility with respect to the letters. See <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 356 n.4, 559 A.2d 206 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> The plaintiff also contends that the list was improperly admitted because it was dated February, 1983, and the hearings were held in 1985 and 1986. The plaintiff\u2019s argument assumes that the relevant issue was whether the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation was taught at any chiropractic school approved by the board at the time of the hearings. The department asserts, however, that the date that the procedure was used is the relevant date for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff violated General Statutes \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) by using a diagnostic procedure not taught at any approved school. We agree with the department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 20-28 (b) (2) because it would be patently unfair to judge the lawfulness of the use of a particular chiropractic technique by whether that technique is taught at an approved school at some time in the future. The plaintiff performed and prescribed the use of the coccygeal-meningeal manipulation for the Benhams in 1982, and the plaintiff has made no showing that the list of schools recognized by the board in 1983 varied from the 1982 list. We therefore reject this claim of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> Although Coman did not attend the hearing, she read the record of the hearing and discussed the case with Passero.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> Public Acts 1988, No. 88-248, \u00a7 6, increased the total number of members on the board from three to seven. Of this number, four members must be practicing chiropractors and the other three positions on the board are for public members. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\"> The defendants also raise in their cross appeal the issue whether the trial court properly allowed the plaintiff to present evidence to the trial court outside the agency record and to conduct discovery in furtherance of that purpose. Pursuant to these rulings, the trial court allowed the plaintiff to depose the board members who decided this matter. We decline to address this issue, however, because it has no bearing on the appeal in light of our disposition of the first issue raised by the defendants in their cross appeal. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal only as to those counts that it concluded required the presentation of expert testimony, and we have rejected the defendants\u2019 cross appeal on that issue. Therefore, even if we were to conclude that the trial court should not have allowed the plaintiff to conduct discovery and present additional evidence, we would still affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss those counts for which expert testimony was required. We therefore do not address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
