J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4c\">In this criminal appeal, the principal issue is whether the defendant, James C. Tillman, has adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the process of selecting his jury array was managed in an unconstitutionally discriminatory manner. The state charged the defendant with kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B), sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a), robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136 (a), assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1), and larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a jury trial finding the defendant guilty as charged, the trial court rendered a judgment sentencing him to a total effective term of forty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>we transferred his appeal here in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of January 21,1988, at about 11 p.m., the victim finished her work at an insurance company in Hartford and moved her car from her company\u2019s garage to an outside parking lot on Columbus Boulevard so that it would be easier to retrieve later. After having gone to a bar with her supervisor and coworkers, she returned to the car with her supervisor at about 12:45 a.m. Her supervisor left after observing her start her car and put her car lights on.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In the process of backing the car up, the victim noticed that she did not have her seat belt on and that the driver\u2019s side door was not locked. As she stopped to remedy this situation, the defendant opened the driver\u2019s side door and attempted to enter her car. When she asked what he was doing, the defendant punched her in the face, then reached in and turned off the ignition. He then hit her again and pushed her over to the passenger side of the car. When she screamed and tried to get out through the passenger door, he reached over, locked the door and hit her several more times.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The defendant, thereafter, started the car, but could not keep it from stalling because he was unfamiliar with a standard transmission. Finally, after fifteen to twenty minutes, he drove out of the parking lot and, a few minutes later, parked in another small outside lot. He took the victim\u2019s purse and jewelry, and then sexually assaulted her. After rifling through her briefcase, he drove the car out of the lot. He then stopped the car and ran off with her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of this evidence, if believed by the jury, to sustain his convictions. He maintains, however, that he is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>a new trial for three reasons: (1) the selection of jury panels was unconstitutionally discriminatory; (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on identification, consciousness of guilt, and the use of prior inconsistent statements; and (3) the trial court improperly ruled that the field notes of a police social worker were inadmissible as hearsay. To the extent that these claims are entitled to a plenary review, we conclude that they do not establish the defendant\u2019s right to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of the jury array arose in the following factual context. During voir dire, after six jurors had been selected, a supplemental panel was called for the selection of two alternates. The defendant, a black male, complained that the composition of the panels was discriminatory because they contained no black males and only one resident of Hartford. He requested that the clerk send in a new panel that would be more representative of the defendant\u2019s race and residence. The trial court ruled that the motion was untimely unless counsel could present evidence that the clerk was choosing people improperly. Defense counsel replied that he had no such evidence, but would speak with the jury clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Several days later, defense counsel advised the trial court that he had been told by the clerk that jurors were being routinely dismissed for economic hardship if they could provide documentation that their employers would not pay the difference between their daily jury pay of $10 and their normal wages. The clerk\u2019s reasons for doing this, according to counsel, were that forcing such individuals to serve on a jury would cause them economic disadvantage, and that the clerk felt that such economically disadvantaged persons would not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>good jurors. The clerk reportedly acknowledged that a disproportionate number of minorities would be excused on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the makeup of the panels. After trial, in a motion for a new trial, the defendant reiterated his claim that the absence of black male jurors and of more than one Hartford resident on either panel violated his constitutional rights. The court denied the motion, noting that the six jurors who decided the case had been chosen before the issue was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">One basis for a constitutional challenge to the composition of a jury array is the standard set forth in <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979). \u201cIn order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u201d Once the defendant has established this prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the state to prove that the selection system resulting in a nonrepresentative array furthers a significant state interest. Id., 367-68; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 250, 496 A.2d 513 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 421-22, 481 A.2d 56 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The defendant maintains that the <em>Duren </em>standard has been violated in his case because the jury selection process tended to exclude or underrepresent a discernible class of persons, namely, people who are not compensated by their employers during jury duty, and because these persons were systematically excluded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the jury selection process. He also alleges that this discrimination produced an underrepresentation of blacks and Hartford residents from his panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">A jury array that does not violate <em>Duren </em>by under-representing any distinctive group may nonetheless be challenged if unconstitutional criteria were used in selecting its members. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>180 Conn. 589, 430 A.2d 1306 (1980), we ordered a new trial when the jury clerk had been shown to have divided the array cards from which the jury panels were to be chosen into separate piles for men and women. While this procedure did not result in the underrepresentation of either sex, we held that it did discriminate on the basis of sex. \u201c[A]ny attempt to stack a jury panel by intentionally including or excluding any members of a discernable class runs afoul of both due process and the right to a jury trial.\u201d Id., 595-96. \u201cThe end result ... is irrelevant. It is the <em>method </em>of selection which offends the constitution.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 597. The defendant argues that, as in <em>Nims, </em>his jury was selected according to unconstitutional criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Before considering the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims under <em>Duren </em>and <em>Nims, </em>we must address the state\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s objection to the jury selection process was not timely raised. The state relies principally upon Practice Book \u00a7 842, which provides: \u201cAny party may challenge an array on the ground that there has been a material departure from the requirements of law governing the selection and summoning of an array. Such challenge shall be made within five days after notification of the hearing or trial date, unless the defect claimed has arisen subsequent to the time required to make such motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The state\u2019s reliance on Practice Book \u00a7 842 is not persuasive. Concededly the defendant did not question the composition of the jury venire until six jurors had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>selected, but it was only the composition of the second panel of jurors that aroused his suspicion that there was a possibility that black males or Hartford residents were being systematically excluded. Although <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>146 Conn. 59, 63, 147 A.2d 478 (1958), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 880, 82 S. Ct. 1155, 8 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1962), holds that \u201ca challenge to the array comes too late if it is made after the verdict, even though the irregularity may not previously have been known,\u201d the defendant in this case called the irregularity to the attention of the court long before the jury was called upon to reach its verdict. Moreover, the irregularity in <em>Ferraro </em>was merely the failure to follow the procedural requirements of a statute: the names of the veniremen had been drawn by a deputy sheriff instead of a clerk. In this case, by contrast, the defendant has mounted a constitutional challenge to the validity of the jury selection process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>supra, 593-97 (ordering a new trial when an unconstitutional method of jury selection is discovered after trial). Where a constitutional flaw is discovered and brought to the court\u2019s attention before jury selection is complete, and good cause can be shown for the defendant\u2019s failure to mount an earlier challenge, the Practice Book is not a procedural roadblock.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We therefore shall consider in turn the defendant\u2019s claims under <em>Duren </em>and <em>Nims. </em>The defendant makes two claims under <em>Duren: </em>first, that his right to a representative array was violated because some persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>were excluded on the basis of the arrangement by which their employers compensated them; second, that because of this exclusion, blacks and Hartford residents were underrepresented on his panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendant\u2019s first <em>Duren </em>claim relies principally on <em>Thiel </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>328 U.S. 217, 66 S. Ct. 984, 90 L. Ed. 1181 (1946), which held that a federal jury panel was unlawfully constituted when a clerk and a jury commissioner intentionally and systematically excluded persons who worked for a daily wage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The clerk\u2019s stated reason for the exclusion was similar to that alleged here: \u201c \u2018The minute that a juror is called into court on a venire and says he is working for $10 a day and cannot afford to work for four, the Judge has never made one of those men serve, and so in order to avoid putting names of people in who I know won\u2019t become jurors in the court, won\u2019t qualify as jurors in this court, I do leave them out. . . . Where I thought the designation indicated that they were day laborers, I mean they were people who were compensated solely when they were working by the day, I leave them out.\u2019 \u201d Id., 222. The result of this procedure was that \u201cbusiness men and their wives constituted at least 50% of the jury lists.\u201d Id. The court held impermissible this \u201cwholesale exclusion of a large class of wage earners,\u201d and declared that \u201c[j]ury competence is not limited to those who earn their livelihood on other than a daily basis,\u201d and that \u201cthe pay period of a particular individual is completely irrelevant to his eligibility and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>capacity to serve as a juror.\u201d Id., 223, 225. \u201cThe American tradition of trial by jury,\u201d the court stated, \u201cnecessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.\u201d Id., 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In this case, however, the defendant has not made out a prima facie case of unconstitutional jury selection because he has not offered sufficient evidence to satisfy the <em>Duren </em>test. The defendant bears the burden of making an adequate record to support a challenge to a jury array. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 635 n.6, 500 A.2d 1303 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 218, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982). All that this defendant ever offered to the court in support of his request for a new supplemental panel was his counsel\u2019s hearsay representations of a conversation he had had with the clerk. The defendant did not offer the clerk\u2019s own testimony or any other testimony. He did not request an evidentiary hearing to support his claims, or a continuance in order to gather probative evidence. A challenge to a jury array will fail if the defendant presents no evidence to the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>187 Conn. 647, 681, 448 A.2d 163 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983). A representation by counsel does not meet this evidentiary requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 391, 521 A.2d 555 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">To satisfy his evidentiary burden under the first part of <em>Duren\u2019s </em>three part test, the defendant would have had to establish the discriminatory exclusion of a \u201cdistinctive group.\u201d While there is no precise definition of the term \u201cdistinctive group\u201d; <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 174, 106 S. Ct. 1758, 90 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1986); such a group must have, first, \u201c \u2018some factor which defines and limits the group\u2019 \u201d; second, \u201c \u2018a basic similarity in attitudes or ideas or experience which is present in members of the group and which cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>adequately represented if the group is excluded from the jury selection process\u2019 and third, \u201c \u2018there must be a possibility that exclusion of the group will result in partiality or bias on the part of juries hearing cases in which group members are involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 438, 450 A.2d 828 (1982), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guzman, </em>337 F. Sup. 140, 143-44 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). <em>Thiel </em>established that the requirement of distinctness can be satisfied by a group that has been excluded on the basis of the arrangements by which its members are paid by their employers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so holding, however, the United States Supreme Court appears to have taken judicial notice that those who are paid by the day tend to be \u201cpersons of low economic and social status.\u201d <em>Thiel </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>supra, 223-24. There is no such clear implication of economic and social status for those whose employers will not pay them the difference between their jury salaries and their regular income. The group is broad enough to include both the day laborers considered in <em>Thiel </em>and highly paid professionals, and this court could do no <em>more </em>than guess at the proportions of each. This we decline to do. In order to satisfy the first prong of <em>Duren, </em>then, the defendant had to offer some further evidence that the persons excluded were a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group. For example, evidence that the group included disproportionate numbers of city dwellers or black males, as the defendant suggested, might have been helpful in building his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The defendant has similarly failed to meet the second or third requirements of the <em>Duren </em>test. He did not even allege the proportion of jurors who were actually excused for economic hardship. While the procedure that counsel described to the court did involve a systematic exclusion and might well have exceeded the clerk\u2019s statutory authority,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> no proof was offered that that procedure was in fact followed. The defendant\u2019s second <em>Duren </em>claim, which alleges racial and geographical discrimination, fails for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s alternate claim under <em>Nims. </em>The defendant correctly observes that <em>Duren </em>is not the only standard for determining the validity of a jury selection process. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>supra, in which we followed the three-part Duren test,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we did not overrule or modify our analysis in <em>Nims. </em>See also <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 250, 254, 496 A.2d 513 (1985), citing both <em>Castonguay </em>and <em>Nims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Under Aims, even if there is no underrepresentation of any group, it is possible for the jury to be selected according to unconstitutional criteria. The sex-based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>classification in question in <em>Nims </em>had, however, been previously held by the United States Supreme Court to constitute a distinctive group both in the specific context of jury selection; <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>329 U.S. 187, 193-94, 67 S. Ct. 261, 91 L. Ed. 181 (1946); and as a suspect classification that must be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1976); <em>Frontiero </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 682, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973) (plurality opinion). <em>Nims </em>relied on the latter series of cases to invalidate the challenged procedure because it could not be shown to \u201c \u2018serve important governmental objectives and ... be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>supra, 596, quoting <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>supra, 197. Far from relaxing the first requirement of <em>Duren, </em>our decision in <em>Nims </em>relied on a finding that a suspect classification had been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">As an evidentiary matter, it is more difficult to establish that a classification is suspect than it is to show that a group is \u201cdistinctive\u201d under <em>Duren. </em>See <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 445-46, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). As we have already noted, the defendant in this case offered no supporting evidence of any kind to establish his claim of unconstitutional discrimination. The trial court therefore did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court, in its instructions to the jury: (1) improperly failed to give his requested charge on the effect of physical impairment on the credibility of eyewitness testimony; (2) gave an improper charge on consciousness of guilt; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(3) improperly failed to limit the jury\u2019s use of a prior inconsistent statement. We are not persuaded that any of these claims requires us to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant submitted a request to charge that, in assessing the credibility of eyewitness testimony, the jury \u201cmay consider . . . whether the witness was physically impaired or under stress when observing the perpetrator.\u201d This charge was directed at the credibility of the victim, whose capacity for accurate observation the jury might reasonably have found to have been somewhat impaired at the time of the incident. There was evidence at trial that, before the attack, the victim had been drinking. As a result of the attack, she received a cut on her left eyebrow that bled and later required seven stitches. Her left eye began to swell during the attack, and later closed completely. The entire left side of her face was swollen after the attack. Her right eye eventually became black and blue. Because she was hit in the nose, she suffered a nosebleed. Despite this evidentiary foundation for the request to charge, the court did not comply literally with the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The trial court might appropriately have given the requested instruction. The court was not, however, required to charge the jury in the exact language of the request to charge, as long as the instructions given to the jury provided proper guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 658, 522 A.2d 795 (1987). Although the court did not use the phrase \u201cphysically impaired,\u201d it informed the jury that, in determining whether to credit a witness\u2019 testimony, it must assess the witness\u2019 \u201cability to observe facts correctly.\u201d The court further said that among the factors the jury was to consider was the witness\u2019 \u201cdegree of stress\u201d and \u201cher opportunity to observe the person.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>These instructions adequately alerted the jury to the factors that it had to assess in determining the reliability of the victim\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Even if the court\u2019s instructions were less informative on the risks of misidentification than they might have been, the issue is at most one of instructional error rather than of constitutional error. A new trial would only be warranted, therefore, if the defendant could establish that it was reasonably probable that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 754, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). The record does not sustain such an assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The evidence supporting an inference of visual impairment was far from overwhelming. The victim testified that she could see out of both eyes, and she never said that she had any difficulty viewing her attacker. During much of the fifty minutes that she was with him, they were in well-lighted areas. There were street lights on Columbus Boulevard, where the car was parked when the attacker entered it, and there were floodlights on an adjacent building. When the attacker forced the victim back into her car, his face was directly in front of hers and she was able to get a good look at his face. During the entire fifteen to twenty minutes that the attacker was having difficulty starting the car, the victim observed the right side of his face. She tried to look at him as much as possible as the car passed under the street lights of Columbus Boulevard. Because her left eye had been hurt, she held her right arm against her right eye to protect it. Because the area where the car stopped was well lit, the victim was able to view her attacker. She testified that she \u201cwas trying to focus on his eyes, nose, the shape of his face, things that I could remember, things that I would be able to use to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>identify him by.\u201d His nose was particularly distinctive, \u201c[kjind of like a hook nose.\u201d The street he drove the car onto after the sexual assault was also well lit. After the attacker fled, the victim could not see very well out of her left eye, but her right eye was unaffected. When the police arrived she told them that she was certain she could identify her attacker, and she readily picked the defendant\u2019s photograph from a properly assembled array. When she was shown the first mug shot of the defendant, she correctly noted that he seemed younger in the photograph. She testified that there was no doubt in her mind that the defendant was the man who had attacked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Given this positive identification testimony, and the instruction that was given, we conclude that it is not reasonably probable that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s refusal to charge in the specific language that the defendant had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The defendant\u2019s second challenge to the jury instruction focuses on the court\u2019s statement that: \u201cThere is a legal principle of law known as consciousness of guilt, and it applies when a defendant says or does an act which one can infer that he had attempted to avoid detection or to avoid facts which would lead to his conviction. Here again, <em>this principle would apply </em>to the defendant\u2019s statements to Detective Kumnick when questioned how he got the lacerations which were healing on the major knuckles of his hand.\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the testimony of Detective Stephen Kumnick of the Hartford police department, when the defendant was arrested and charged with assault and sexual assault, he had visible bruises and lacerations on his hands. When asked how he had gotten these cuts, he first responded that he was not sure, and then said that he had gotten them while working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>at a car wash. Further inquiry from Kumnick led the defendant to remark, \u201cI didn\u2019t get those from punching no girl.\u201d At this time, no one had told the defendant that the victim had been beaten by fists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant denied having made the statement, and also testified that at the police station he was shown a picture of the victim\u2019s battered face.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury was instructed that it first had to determine that the statement was actually made. If it was made, the jury could draw \u201creasonable inferences\u201d from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The defendant contends that the emphasized portion of this instruction removed from the jury\u2019s consideration the possibility that his statement was made on the basis of innocent beliefs or motives. Since his motivation in making the statement was properly a question for the jury to consider, he argues, the instruction impaired his constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A jury charge in which the court removes from the jury\u2019s consideration an issue that is one of the essential elements of the crime, and thereby relieves the state of the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, would violate the holding of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979). Although the defendant never filed a request to charge or objected to the charge that was given, he now maintains that his complaint is of constitutional magnitude and therefore reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We disagree. An instruction about consciousness of guilt is not so directly related to an essential element of the crime as to warrant plenary discussion of whether \u201cthe claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging a violation of a fundamental right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>219 Conn. 160, 166, 592 A.2d 382 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In his third challenge to the validity of the jury charge, the defendant maintains that the trial court improperly instructed the jury about a prior inconsistent statement allegedly made by Gwendolyn Wilson, an alibi witness for the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court informed the jury that, if it found that Wilson had said something contradictory to her trial testimony in an earlier conversation with Detective Kumnick, and the prior statement was \u201cnot in writing or recorded on tape, it may only be used to test the witness\u2019s credit and may not be substituted for her testimony.\u201d The defendant now claims that, because Wilson\u2019s recollection at trial was refreshed by reading statements attributed to her in Kumnick\u2019s written report, the jury might have been misled into giving substantive weight to her earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We need not decide this question because the defendant did not raise this claim below. See Practice Book \u00a7 852. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that this instruction unconstitutionally deprived him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of a fair trial. \u201cPatently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label. . . . For example, once identified, unpreserved evidentiary claims masquerading as constitutional claims will be summarily dismissed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant finally claims that because these instructions concerned the essential element of identity and were related to the portions of testimony that were most damaging to him, taken together they deprived him of a fair trial. We are unpersuaded. We are aware of no case, and the defendant has cited none, that holds that a group of instructional claims of error, each of which has individually been found not to constitute reversible error; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 230-33, 438 A.2d 38 (1980); should be aggregated to form a separate basis for a claim of a constitutional violation of a right to a fair trial. We decline to create a new constitutional claim in which the totality of alleged constitutional error is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The defendant\u2019s last contention is that the trial court improperly excluded from evidence the field notes of Janette Getz, a police department social worker, in which she had recorded a pretrial conversation with Kumnick to the effect that fingerprints had been found on the driver\u2019s side of the victim\u2019s car, but that they did not belong to the defendant. At the trial, Kumnick testified that the fingerprints found on the car did not belong to the defendant. He identified the location of the fingerprints, however, as being in the area of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>passenger door. The victim testified that her attacker had entered and exited the car from the driver\u2019s side. The defendant offered the field notes as a business record, in an attempt to persuade the jury either that the unknown prints were actually on the driver\u2019s door or that the police investigation was faulty. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection, and the defendant duly excepted. On appeal, the defendant urges, alternatively, that the notes were also admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of Kumnick that might have been used to attack his credibility in various other critical parts of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding the field notes \u201cis limited to the specific legal ground raised in the objection.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 579, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4185, 288. The statement in the notes that is attributed to Kumnick would have been inadmissible as hearsay, because it was \u201c[a]n out-of-court statement . . . offered to establish the truth of the matters contained therein\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 661, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); unless it came within the exception for business records. \u201cTo gain admission of a document under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, the proponent must show that (1) the document was made in the regular course of business, (2) it was the regular course of business to make such a record, and (3) the record was made when the act, transaction or event occurred, or shortly thereafter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 156-57, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1069, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990). To qualify a record as a business entry, the party offering the evidence must present a witness who testifies that the three requirements have been met. Id. The defendant made no attempt to lay a proper foundation for the admission of the notes, even after the trial court pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>out this requirement. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly excluded the field notes from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In this opinion Callahan, Covello and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when ...

See <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 537, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979). The state argues that <em>Duren, </em>which invalidated an exemption that was presumed if females did not respond to the summons, is distinguishable because in the procedure alleged by the defendant, each juror had to act voluntarily and provide proof of his or her claim. A blanket exemption for women would not, however, become permissible if each woman were required to apply for the exemption and provide proof of her sex.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> There is no merit to the state\u2019s claim that the practice complained of was authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 51-217 (c) (2).

I disagree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to present evidence in support of a challenge to his jury array. I would find, on the basis of the offer of proof made by the defendant, that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to attempt to make a prima facie showing that the jury array was derived in an unconstitutional manner through the adoption of a practice that resulted in the exclusion of minorities, including black persons. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment in this case and remand the same for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In this criminal prosecution, the state charged the defendant, James C. Tillman, a black man, with the crimes of sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery, larceny and assault of the victim, a white female. Jury selection began on September 5, 1989, and the first panel was drawn from an array consisting of fifteen persons, all of whom were white except for two black females who were bank employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">After the first panel was exhausted at the end of the day on Thursday, September 7, 1989, a second panel of ten persons was drawn, all of whom were white. After one person on the second panel was questioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the defendant objected to its composition because neither of the two panels, both of which contained twenty-five persons, included any black males and because only one person was from Hartford. The defendant requested that the second panel be dismissed and that a new panel be drawn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the request and implicitly invited counsel to ascertain if there was \u201cevidence that the jury clerk is calling in people improperly or excusing them improperly or sending them down other than randomly.\u201d Jury selection continued for part of the day on Friday, September 8, and a total of six white jurors were selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On Monday, September 11, prior to the selection of the alternates, the defendant renewed his objection to the composition of the jury panel. Counsel read a prepared statement from the defendant objecting that the -composition of the panels failed to include black males and Hartford residents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After reading the statement of the defendant, counsel furnished the court with an offer of proof that included the following: \u201cAs the court knows, the jurors are selected from a combination of motor vehicle records and voting lists. Also, a factor that is used by the jury clerks in this judicial district, in deciding whether or not to exclude a person from jury duty . . . [is] an economic factor. If the jury clerk for this district, Your Honor, for this building, has documentation that a person called for jury duty who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>employed somewhere will not be given the balance of his or her pay by his or her employer, and therefore would only be receiving the ten dollars a day that the state provides the jurors, then the jury clerk will excuse that person for an economic hardship. This is a decision that is made by the jury clerk and there are two reasons that the jury clerk gave me for this: One is that it\u2019s economically disadvantageous to that potential juror to have to spend four weeks here making ten dollars a day when he or she\u2014and therefore forfeiting a lot more that they would be paid on their job, if they happen to come from an employer who does not make up the difference. The other reason, Your Honor, is that the clerks feel that a person who is, in effect, forced to sit on jury duty for four weeks for ten dollars a day will not make a good juror. Now, I would submit that . . . this is not to be construed ... as racial discrimination as such, but the fact is, according to the jury clerk here, that very often members of minorities are employed by employers who do not make up the difference in the ten dollar a day\u2014the difference from the ten dollar a day that the state pays the jurors. <em>Therefore, the clerk agreed that there are a disproportionate number of minorities who would be excluded solely by the jury clerk for this economic hardship. </em>She told me, in fact, that on this particular panel, the array that is available upstairs, that in fact there are not many black jurors available.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court again rejected the claim of the defendant giving as his reason \u201cthat six jurors were selected prior to the challenge having been made.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, two white alternates were selected. The defendant was tried and convicted as charged by his all white jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The issues raised by the defendant, which allege the exclusion of persons from jury service on the basis of race, go to the very heart of our system of criminal justice\u2014the impartial jury. \u201cThe purpose of a jury is to guard against the exercise of arbitrary power\u2014to make available the commonsense judgment of the community as a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor and in preference to the professional or perhaps overconditioned or biased response of a judge.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 530, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The selection of a petit jury from a representative cross-section of the community is an essential element of the right. Id. There is, however, no constitutional right that the petit jury result in any particular composition. <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>750 F.2d 1113, 1128 (2d Cir. 1984), reh. denied, 756 F.2d 277 (2d Cir. 1985) (en banc). Not \u201cevery jury must contain representatives of all the economic, social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community . . . .\u201d <em>Thiel </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>328 U.S. 217, 220, 66 S. Ct. 984, 90 L. Ed. 1181 (1946). \u201cIndeed the impracticability of attempting to achieve a petit jury composed of a cross section is obvious.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 48, 56, 549 A.2d 1092 (1986). Its composition, from the array to the jury panel, then becomes a question of the luck of the draw. The array, however, from which these panels are drawn must be composed of a representative cross-section of the community in order to allow the defendant a chance to achieve this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The thrust of the majority opinion denying the defendant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of the jury array is that \u201c[a]ll that this defendant ever offered to the court in support of his request for a new supplemental panel was his counsel\u2019s hearsay representations of a conversation he had had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>with the clerk.\u201d The majority fails to acknowledge the basic trial procedure of an \u201coffer of proof\u201d as utilized by the defendant. Offers of proof are allegations by the attorney in which he represents to the court that he could prove them if granted an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 267, 413 A.2d 854 (1979). \u201c \u2018An offer of proof, properly presented, serves three purposes. First, it should inform the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible. Second, it should inform the trial judge of the specific nature of the offered evidence so the court can judge its admissibility. Third, it thereby creates a record adequate for appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Conrod, </em>198 Conn. 592, 597, 504 A.2d 494 (1986), quoting <em>Mad River Orchard, Inc. </em>v. <em>Krack Corporation, </em>89 Wash. 2d 535, 537, 573 P.2d 796 (1978). Although counsel for the defendant did not articulate that he was presenting an \u201coffer of proof,\u201d it is apparent from the record that the trial court understood it to be such an offer when it rejected the challenge to the jury array on the ground that six jurors have already been selected\u2014in other words\u2014it was too late to make the claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the array must be reviewed as if these allegations of the defendant could had been proven at an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendant made five basic allegations in his offer of proof and statement to the court. First, the jury clerk, in deciding whether she will excuse a person from jury duty, considers an economic hardship\u2014that is, if the person\u2019s employer would not make up the difference between his or her regular wage and the $10 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>diem jury fee paid by the state, that person would be excused; second, very often the excuse of persons on this economic criterion results in the exclusion of members of minorities including blacks because they are likely to be employed by those who do not make up the difference; third, this practice results in the exclusion of a disproportionate number of minorities including blacks; fourth, the array from which panels were selected in this case did not include many blacks; and fifth, the defendant claimed that the array from which the defendant\u2019s jury was selected was unconstitutionally constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We have long held that \u201c[impartiality as a core requirement of the right to trial by jury is served not only by the sixth amendment, which applies to the states as well as to the federal government . . . but also by the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 542, 442 A.2d 927 (1982).

This would then have shifted the burden to the state to prove that the selection system furthered significant state interests. <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra, 367-68. The defendant would have satisfied the \u201cdistinctive group\u201d requirement by the proof that potential jurors were excluded for the economic reasons, which resulted in the exclusion of minorities including blacks;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Thiel </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>supra, 222 (intentionally eliminated all those who worked for a daily wage);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he would have satisfied the \u201crepresentation of this group ... is not fair and reasonable\u201d requirement by proof that the practice resulted in a disproportionate number of blacks being excluded compared to their number in the community; and the \u201cunder-representation is due to systematic exclusion\u201d requirement would have been satisfied by proof that this exclusion was the practice of the clerk in the judicial district of Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Likewise, proof of the defendant\u2019s offer would have established a violation of due process under <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Nims, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The due process clause does not itself guarantee a defendant a randomly selected jury, but simply a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. A claim of denial of this due process right requires a showing that the jury selection process tended to exclude or underrepresent some discernable class of persons and consequently to defeat a fair possibility for obtaining a truly representative cross section.\u2019 \u201d Id., 595, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>548 F.2d 608, 614 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Nims, </em>however, makes clear that the practice does not necessarily have to exclude all those in the discernible class; \u201cit is equally offensive to the constitution to limit proportionally the number of an identified group that will serve on a jury array or panel. <em>Cassell </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>[339 U.S. 282, 286-87, 70 S. Ct. 629, 94 L. Ed. 839 (1950)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>supra, 597. Surely, the imposition of the economic criterion in this case of excusing potential jurors, which results in the exclusion of members of minorities including blacks, satisfies <em>Nims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Underscoring both the <em>Duren </em>and the <em>Nims </em>claims made in this case is the composition of the community. According to the 1990 national census, Hartford, the largest city included in the judicial district, has a total population of 139,739, which includes a black population of 39 percent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Considering these statistics makes it even more likely that the practice of the jury clerk had an impact on the underrepresentation of blacks on the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In our system of justice, not only must the accused be afforded a fair trial, but equally important there must be a perception of fairness by the community and the accused. Anything less not only undermines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>credibility of this branch of government but also threatens the very fabric of our democracy. And, of course, the perception that the person is being tried before a fair jury drawn from a cross-section of the community is high on the agenda in achieving that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">When a black man, as in the present case, is accused of serious crimes such as the sexual assault of a white victim, that black defendant\u2014and, indeed, the black community\u2014cannot perceive that he has received a fair trial from a jury that is entirely composed of white persons, drawn from an array made up of very few blacks because of deliberate practices that resulted in their elimination. The defendant in this case forcefully expressed that concern when his attorney read to the court during jury selection the following statement he had prepared. \u201cYour Honor, I object to the jury array. I do not feel that this is a jury of my own peer[s] and therefore it will be impossible for me to have a fair trial. Especially considering the facts of the Danny Webb case which has been in all the news and newspapers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the fact that his case alleges that he [attacked] a middle class white woman from one of the suburban towns, which in fact is what my jury panel was made of. There were only two blacks from the entire panels in which I had to choose from. I\u2019m sure that this [doesn\u2019t] comply with the statistical percentage of blacks for this geographical area. Therefore, this cannot be a jury of my peer[s] and [it] will be impossible for me to have a fair trial. I therefore state for the record at this time, I would like to challenge the jury array and ask the court to order whatever [is] necessary for me to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>There is a need to preserve public confidence in the fairness of a jury but that perception dissipates when the court, through its clerk, employs selection practices for the array that undermines the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to select a jury from a fair cross-section of the community. \u201cSelection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\u201d <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 87, 106 S.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s representative of the entire jury pool here but I don\u2019t think it comports with Mr. Tillman\u2019s right to a trial by a jury of his peers and in addition, your Honor, there has been only one Hartford resident from my count on this sheet here and that happened to be a black woman who was excused by the state. I just would request the court to ask the jury clerk to send a new panel down here that might be more representative of Mr. Tillman\u2019s race and place of residence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> See infra, 515.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\"> The defendant, after the verdict, renewed his objection to the arrays in a motion for a new trial, which was denied.
