We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. During the early morning hours of November 29, 1985, the defendant and two companions, Ralph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cRicky\u201d Birch and Tina Yablonski, stole a 1973 brown Buick Regal from an automobile repair shop in Brook-field. That evening, they drove the Buick to New Hampshire. The Buick was damaged and its muffler was lost in New Hampshire. Due to the loss of the muffler, the car\u2019s engine was very loud.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On Sunday, December 1,1985, the defendant, Birch and Yablonski drove the Buick from New Hampshire to Danbury. They arrived in Danbury in the early evening and went to the residence of a friend, Douglas Stanley. While at Stanley\u2019s residence, the defendant and Yablonski \u201cfreebased\u201d cocaine. The defendant, Birch and Yablonski left Stanley\u2019s apartment between 11:10 and 11:20 p.m. and drove to New Milford in the Buick. The defendant and Birch dropped off Yablonski at her home on Aspetuck Road at approximately 11:55 p.m. The defendant and Birch drove to a residential area approximately two miles away, driving north on Aspetuck Avenue to its intersection with Marwick Manor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They turned into Marwick Manor and parked the car between 12:10 and 12:30 a.m. on December 2. The defendant and Birch then walked a short distance to the house at 74 Aspetuck Avenue, on the corner of Aspetuck Avenue and Marwick Manor. They entered the house through the back door, which was unlocked. Everett Carr, a sixty-five year old man who lived with his wife and daughter, was alone in the house. Carr\u2019s wife was out of town and his daughter had gone out for the evening at approximately 9:30 p.m. Carr encountered the defendant and Birch in the hallway adjacent to the kitchen on the first floor. A struggle ensued, and either the defendant or Birch went to the kitchen and obtained a carving knife. During the continued struggle, Carr was stabbed repeatedly, which resulted in his death. The defendant and Birch then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>searched the house for valuables, taking some jewelry, a videocassette recorder and several other small items. They left the house and drove away in the Buick between 12:30 and 1 a.m. The defendant and Birch returned to the defendant\u2019s home in New Milford between 2 and 4:20 a.m. Carr\u2019s daughter discovered her father\u2019s body when she returned home between 4 and 4:30 a.m. on December 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. This court has consistently employed a two-part analysis in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609-10, 595 A.2d 306 (1991). We first review the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the guilty verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 500, 594 A.2d 906 (1991). We then determine, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, whether any rational trier of fact could have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. \u201cWe do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In undertaking the foregoing analysis, the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 600, 594 A.2d 459 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>supra. \u201cIt is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>183 Conn. 225, 227, 439 A.2d 305 (1981). After a review of the record, we conclude that the jury could reasonably have determined that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The defendant specifically claims that: (1) the lack of scientific or forensic evidence prevented the state from meeting its burden of proof; (2) his actions in the days following the crime were more consistent with innocence than with guilt; and (3) statements he made to his grandmother and a friend in the months after the crime were consistent with his innocence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the verdict, as we must, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The defendant first focuses on the lack of forensic or scientific evidence in the state\u2019s case. Since direct and circumstantial evidence have equal probative value, however, the absence of forensic or scientific evidence does not make the evidence insufficient per se. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 600. A review of the record reveals the following evidence: First, two distinct sets of footwear imprints in the blood of the victim were found at the scene of the stabbing. There was uncontroverted expert testimony from Henry C. Lee, M.D., director of the state forensic laboratory, that the imprints were made during a struggle before the victim collapsed to the floor. The same two imprints were tracked in the victim\u2019s blood into areas of the house where items of personal property were missing. In addition, the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend, Tina Yablonski, testified that the defendant and Birch drove in the direction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the victim\u2019s house shortly before a very loud car was heard pulling into Marwick Manor, a few hundred feet from the victim\u2019s house. The testimony of two Marwick Manor residents supported Yablonski\u2019s testimony regarding the direction from which the car arrived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The two residents heard the car park on Marwick Manor, and then heard it start up again approximately one half hour later. One witness testified that he heard the car \u201cspeed\u201d up the hill when it drove away and that it was out of sight within the one minute it took him to get to the window. When viewed in conjunction with the other evidence presented, the foregoing evidence, while largely circumstantial, was ample to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The defendant next contends that his actions in the days immediately following the crime are more consistent with innocence than with guilt. \u201c \u2018[I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 598, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foord, </em>[142 Conn. 285, 294, 113 A.2d 591 (1955)].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 616-17, 491 A.2d 404 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 604. The jury may draw such inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence as it deems to be reasonable and logical. Id. The jury reasonably and logically could have inferred the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt from his actions and statements to police after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Tina Yablonski testified that she, the defendant and Birch had two discussions about the murder during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>which the defendant expressed concern about being a suspect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant agreed to go along with a fabricated story regarding the group\u2019s movements during the late evening hours of December 1 and the early morning hours of December 2,1985.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During these discussions, the defendant told Birch and Yablonski that they all had to \u201cget [their] stories straight.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant told the story agreed upon to state police detective Patrick McCafferty on December 4, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On December 5, 1985, the defendant hid the Buick in heavy underbrush near the reservoir in New Milford. After the police, with Birch in the car, encountered the defendant walking on a nearby road, he led them to where the car was hidden. Later that day, the defendant spoke with state police detective Scott O\u2019Mara, and claimed that he had not told McCafferty about the car on December 4, because the car was stolen. The defendant told O\u2019Mara that he, Birch and Yablonski had left Stanley\u2019s apartment in Danbury on the morning of December 2, 1985, between 12:30 and 2:30 and had driven to Yablonski\u2019s house. He said that he and Birch had then gone to either his father\u2019s house or the reservoir.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> O\u2019Mara testified that, when he showed the defendant a picture of the victim, the defendant indicated that he recognized the victim because of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tattoos, even though no tattoos were visible in the photograph. The defendant said he might have passed the victim on the street. When asked to theorize about what had happened, the defendant referred to the manner of the victim\u2019s death, despite not having been informed of it by O\u2019Mara.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On December 9, 1985, the defendant again spoke with McCafferty. McCafferty confronted the defendant with the conflict between his account of when he, Birch and Yablonski had left the Stanley residence and the account of Effie Coates, the woman who lived with Douglas Stanley. According to McCafferty, the defendant then said: \u201cI have to remember where I was. I know I was with Ricky and Tina.\u201d McCafferty also testified that the defendant\u2019s leg began to shake violently when McCafferty told him that residents at Marwick Manor had heard the Buick on the night of the murder and that the police knew where he had parked and turned around. According to McCafferty, the defendant then stated that he, Birch and Yablonski may have turned around in the victim\u2019s driveway. When McCafferty inquired how the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s house, the defendant responded: \u201cTina and I did not go into the house.\u201d McCafferty then asked the defendant whether he was saying that Birch had entered the house, to which the defendant responded that McCafferty would have to ask Birch. Finally, the defendant twice denied having killed anyone. From the evidence of the defendant\u2019s actions and statements to police after the crime, including the defendant\u2019s own testimony, the jury was entitled to infer consciousness of guilt and firsthand knowledge of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Finally, the defendant asserts that statements he made regarding the crime to his grandmother and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>friend do not support his conviction. The jury heard testimony from the defendant\u2019s grandmother, Mildred Henning, and a friend, Timothy Saadloff, regarding statements the defendant made to them after the crime. Mildred Henning testified that she had received a telephone call from the defendant in early 1986 during which he told her that he was in trouble, that there had been a burglary and an \u201cold man\u201d had been killed. The defendant told her that he was at the scene of the crime but that he did not kill the victim and that someone else had participated in the burglary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She said that the defendant had sounded upset and that they both had cried. Mildred Henning also testified regarding a subsequent conversation she had with the defendant in August, 1987. She testified that, during that conversation, the defendant had rescinded what he had told her previously, saying that he had never told her about the crime. He said that what he had told her earlier was only what the police had alleged against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Timothy Saadloff, who described himself as the defendant\u2019s best friend, testified that he had received a telephone call from the defendant sometime in 1986. The defendant said that he was in a \u201clittle bit of trouble.\u201d He told Saadloff that he and a friend had broken into a house, and had surprised the man who lived there, who they thought was not at home. The defendant told Saadloff that the man had been murdered, but that he did not do it and that his friend had done it. Saadloff recalled that the defendant had used the word \u201cstabbing\u201d when referring to how the man had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The testimony of Mildred Henning and Timothy Saadloff was an integral part of the state\u2019s case. While both witnesses testified that the defendant had denied committing the actual killing, the jury could reasonably have inferred from his statements to these witnesses that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime and participated in the burglary. This evidence, when viewed together with all of the evidence presented against the defendant, is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict finding the defendant guilty of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly failed to charge the jury on burglary in the third degree as a lesser offense included in the charge of felony murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The information filed by the state charged the defendant with two separate crimes: felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the close of the evidence, the defendant filed a written request to charge with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>trial court, requesting that the court instruct the jury-on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of burglary in the second degree.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court found that the state had failed to present sufficient evidence that the entering or remaining unlawfully in a dwelling occurred at night, and, therefore, did not submit to the jury the second count of the information charging the defendant with burglary in the second degree. The court instructed the jury only as to the felony murder count of the information, instructing on burglary in the third degree as the underlying felony. The defendant did not request a charge on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder, and took no exception to the charge as given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Since the defendant neither requested an instruction on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder nor took an exception to the trial court\u2019s charge, this court is not bound to review the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For the purposes of this appeal, however, we will treat the issue as properly raised below. We conclude that the requested instruction does not survive the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201c \u2018When we are reviewing a trial court\u2019s failure to charge as requested, \u201cwe must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support.\u201d . . . \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 275, 506 A.2d 556 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 595, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990). Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 588, a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense only if four conditions are met: \u201c(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d A review of the record reveals that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder because the fourth condition of <em>Whistnant </em>was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We need spend little time on the first three conditions of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. We will assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that the first condition has been satisfied. It is clear from the information<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the defendant could not have committed felony murder without having committed burglary, and, thus, the second condition is also satisfied. Finally, a review of the record reveals some evidence that would justify conviction of the lesser offense, and, therefore, the third condition has been met.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The fourth condition is the critical factor in the present case. We must first differentiate the elements of burglary in the third degree from those of felony murder, and then determine if these elements were sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of felony murder but guilty of burglary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 588. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, which defines felony murder, provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits . . . burglary . . . and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime ... he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d Burglary in the third degree is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 as \u201centering] or remaining] unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d Since felony murder, as defined in \u00a7 53a-54c, includes the crime of burglary, the only elements that differentiate burglary from felony murder are indicated by the language, \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of such crime . . . he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The state presented uncontroverted evidence that the death of Everett Carr was caused during the course of and in furtherance of a burglary by one or more of the participants in the burglary. There was evidence of two distinct sets of footwear imprints in the blood of the victim made during a struggle before the victim collapsed. The injuries sustained by the victim indicated a struggle with one or more assailants. Both footwear imprints were tracked in the victim\u2019s blood into rooms where items of personal property were missing, and blood was found on articles of clothing and a dresser drawer. In addition, the defendant\u2019s grandmother testified that the defendant had admitted to her in early 1986 that he had been present at a burglary in which an \u201cold man\u201d had been killed. Finally, Timothy Saadloff testified that the defendant had told him in 1986 that he had participated in a burglary, in which a man was stabbed to death by the defendant\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 602, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980), the defendant was charged with felony murder, and he requested a lesser included offense instruction on burglary or robbery in the first degree. The only issue that was arguably in dispute was the cause of death of the eighty year old victim, who died more than four months after the defendant had severely beaten him while robbing him in his home. Id., 605. This court found that, despite the time lapse between the injuries inflicted by the defendant and the victim\u2019s death, the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that the victim\u2019s death was caused by the defendant in the course of a burglary or robbery. Id., 609. Thus, the jury could not consistently have found the defendant guilty of the lesser crimes of robbery or burglary and not guilty of felony murder. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In the present case, the causal link between the burglary and the victim\u2019s death was more direct than it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was in <em>Morin </em>and is undisputed by the defendant. The evidence presented by the state was controverted only by the defendant\u2019s trial testimony that he did not participate in either the burglary or the murder. The jury thus had before it evidence that indisputably showed a killing committed in the course of a burglary and sufficient evidence implicating the defendant in the burglary, on the one hand, and the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was not present, on the other. The jury was entitled to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Participation in the underlying felony is sufficient to sustain a conviction of felony murder.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, there was simply no evidence to allow the jury <em>consistently </em>to find that the defendant had participated in the burglary but was innocent of the felony murder charge. Since the elements that differentiate burglary from felony murder were thus not sufficiently in dispute, the defendant has failed to satisfy the fourth condition of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. We therefore conclude that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In this opinion Shea, Callahan and Covello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c. felony murder.

What if they suspect us?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> The defendant, Birch and Yablonski agreed to tell the police that they had left Douglas Stanley\u2019s apartment in Danbury between 12:30 and 1 a.m. on December 2, 1985, and had hitchhiked from there to New Milford. In his trial testimony, the defendant admitted that he had agreed to tell a false story to the police, and that he had in fact done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> The defendant admitted having said words to this effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> The defendant told a different story at trial. He testified that, after leaving the Stanley residence in Danbury at approximately 11:30 p.m., he, Birch and Yablonski stopped for approximately forty-five minutes to smoke cocaine. After the defendant and Birch drove Yablonski to her house, they drove to two different locations in New Milford to siphon gas. They then returned to the defendant\u2019s father\u2019s house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> The defendant told O\u2019Mara that he thought someone had interrupted a burglary and that it would have been sufficient to knock out the victim rather than \u201cslice\u201d him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\"> The defendant\u2019s grandmother testified that the defendant had told her that there was a dog in the area where the man was killed. She recalled the defendant saying during the early 1986 conversation that the dog had been killed. A dachshund, belonging to the victim\u2019s daughter, was in the house on the night of the crime but was apparently unharmed. In light of the substantial other evidence against the defendant, this inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s statement and the facts does not affect the overall sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> The defendant raises two additional claims, both of which relate to the claim for a lesser included offense charge. First, the defendant claims that alibi should be treated as a defense, and that there was sufficient evidence of alibi presented to require a jury charge regarding lesser included offenses to felony murder. Second, the defendant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to remedy its error during the defendant\u2019s postverdict motion for acquittal. The defendant claims that the trial court should have remedied its error by acquitting him of the felony murder charge and finding him guilty of burglary in the third degree. The defendant abandoned the foregoing claims at oral argument. Moreover, since we find that the trial court properly omitted the lesser included offense instruction, these claims must necessarily fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-102. burglary in the second degree: class c felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling at night with intent to commit a crime therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u201c(b) Burglary in the second degree is a class C felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> The relevant portion of the defendant\u2019s request to charge read as follows: \u201c3.

I agree with the majority that the judgment of felony murder should be affirmed. I, however, disagree with the majority\u2019s consideration of whether there was sufficient evidence to instruct the jury on the lesser included crime of burglary in the third degree. <em>Whistnant </em>makes clear that to be entitled to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense, the party seeking the charge (either the state or the defendant) must request such an instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). In this case the majority correctly points out the \u201cdefendant neither requested an instruction on burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder nor took an exception to the trial court\u2019s charge. . . .\u201d Preclusion of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, if that be the purpose of the majority in reviewing the merits of the claim, should be left to another day in another forum. Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
