Because we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist as to the intended meaning of a disputed provision of the will of the testatrix, Virginia R. Ward, and as to whether the defendant had committed waste actionable by the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 52-563<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and subject to immediate relief in damages, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The plaintiff was the wife and is the sole devisee of the testatrix\u2019 now deceased only son, John S. Barnett. The defendant was the wife of the testatrix\u2019 physician and friend, Eddie Brewer. The focus of the present dispute is a will executed by the testatrix in July, 1967, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>which provided in article three for the disposition of a thirty-three acre parcel of property known as \u201cBeaver Dam\u201d (property). The property at that time consisted of a newly constructed house and recently landscaped grounds, as well as a clear and swimmable man-made pond complete with a boat house and dock for recreational purposes. Article three provided: \u201cI devise to my friend, Leonie Sullivan Walker [Brewer], for and during the term of her natural life my residence real estate [the property] in the town of Salisbury, and, at her death, or if she surrenders the premises prior thereto, the remainder interest therein to my son, JOHN S. BARNETT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Upon the testatrix\u2019 death in October, 1967, the defendant, in accordance with article three of the testatrix\u2019 will, entered into possession of the property and made her home there. The defendant resided on the property until September, 1988, when she purchased and began to occupy a home elsewhere and leased the property to a third party. To date, a third party remains in possession of the property pursuant to a lease executed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">After learning of the defendant\u2019s leasing of the property, the plaintiff commenced this action in the Superior Court alleging that, under article three of the testatrix\u2019 will, such leasing constituted a \u201csurrender\u201d of \u201cthe premises\u201d that entitled the plaintiff to immediate possession of and title to the property in fee simple. The plaintiff further alleged that by permitting the buildings and grounds of the property to become out of repair, the defendant had committed \u201cwaste\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-563 that had greatly diminished the value of the property. In addition to possession and title, the plaintiff sought relief in the form of money damages and \u201csuch other and appropriate equitable relief as the court may deem appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Upon completion of discovery, the defendant moved for summary judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 384 on the grounds that: (1) because the phrase \u201csurrenders the premises\u201d in the testatrix\u2019 will unambiguously meant the \u201cyielding up of an estate for life or years to him who has an immediate estate in reversion or remainder\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); she had not, as a matter of law, effected a \u201csurrender\u201d of \u201cthe premises\u201d by leasing the property to a third party; and (2) the plaintiff could not maintain a claim of waste under \u00a7 52-563 because she had failed to allege that the defendant\u2019s waste had substantially and permanently damaged the property, and, alternatively, \u00a7 52-563 did not authorize relief in the form of damages for waste before the termination of the defendant\u2019s tenancy. After hearing the parties and considering the evidence proffered in support of their respective claims, the court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether: (1) the defendant\u2019s leasing of the property constituted a \u201csurrender\u201d of \u201cthe premises\u201d within the intended meaning of that phrase in the testatrix\u2019 will; and (2) the defendant committed waste actionable by the plaintiff and subject to immediate relief in damages under \u00a7 52-563. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the defendant\u2019s leasing of the property constituted a \u201csurrender\u201d of \u201cthe premises\u201d within the intended meaning of article three of the testatrix\u2019 will. According to the plaintiff, the phrase \u201csurrenders the premises\u201d was an ambiguous expression of testamentary intent that required the trial court to consider extrinsic evidence in order to determine whether the testatrix intended that a leasing of the property constitute a surrender of the premises. The defendant counters that the testatrix\u2019 use of the word \u201csurrender\u201d in the will unambiguously evinced her intent that a surrender of the premises mean a \u201csurrender\u201d as defined in the law of estates: \u201cA yielding up of an estate for life or years to him who has an immediate estate in reversion or remainder . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). Consequently, the defendant maintains that, as a matter of law, she did not surrender the premises when she leased the property to a third party. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201c \u2018Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 561-62, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). The issue, therefore, is whether the trial court properly determined that the testatrix\u2019 will so unambiguously expressed her intent that the phrase \u201csurrenders the premises\u201d carry the technical meaning accorded the term \u201csurrender\u201d in the law of estates that, as a matter of law, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ant\u2019s leasing of the property to a third party did not constitute a surrender of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In construing a will, the \u201cmeaning of language used cannot be determined by an arbitrary rule of legal definition, but depends in each case on the peculiar provisions and character of the special will in question, which must to a large extent be its own interpreter.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 185, 70 A. 645 (1908). The proper contextual examination of a word carrying a technical legal meaning, for example, may indicate that the testatrix used the word in a nontechnical or otherwise more restricted sense. Id.; see <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>140 Conn. 504, 515, 101 A.2d 789 (1953); see also <em>Canaan National Bank </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>217 Conn. 330, 336, 586 A.2d 562 (1991). In such instances, the expressed intent of the testatrix must be effectuated by construing the particular word accordingly. <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>supra. Moreover, testamentary language \u201csusceptible of different meanings is to be given that meaning which will most nearly effectuate the [testatrix\u2019] intention.\u201d <em>Middletown Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>96 Conn. 61, 67, 112 A. 689 (1921). \u201cThis requires the court, at times, to resort to extrinsic facts as an aid in explaining any language whose meaning the [testatrix] has left uncertain.\u201d <em>Ministers Benefit Board </em>v. <em>Meriden Trust Co., </em>139 Conn. 435, 444, 94 A.2d 917 (1953); see <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>165 Conn. 376, 382, 334 A.2d 888 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">An examination of the word \u201csurrender\u201d in its context in article three of the testatrix\u2019 will discloses that she employed the word as a transitive verb, followed by the object \u201cthe premises.\u201d Although the \u201cusual and appropriate meaning\u201d of the word premises in the law of estates denotes an interest or estate, the word \u201cis used in common parlance to signify land, with its appurtenances\u201d and the \u201cbuildings thereon.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); see Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. The susceptibility of the word prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ises to \u201ca duplicity of meaning\u201d; <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>supra, 382; creates an ambiguity as to the precise act that the testatrix intended to amount to a surrender of the premises when she used those words in her will. This ambiguity is further compounded by the susceptibility of the word surrender to a similar duplicity of meaning. Specifically, the technical meaning of the word surrender in the law of estates, \u201cas referring to the transfer of an estate, has been somewhat obscured by its frequent use in an untechnical sense, as referring to the relinquishment or yielding up, not of an estate, but of the physical possession of the premises . . . .\u201d 4 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In view of these ambiguities, we conclude that the intended meaning of the entire phrase \u201csurrenders the premises\u201d in article three of the testatrix\u2019 will is not discernible from the language of the will alone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue of the legal effect of the defendant\u2019s act of leasing the property, therefore, cannot be resolved without resort to \u201cextrinsic evidence as an aid in removing the doubt and in finding the [testatrix\u2019] true intention from the language through which [she] expressed [herself].\u201d Hoe<em>nig </em>v. <em>Lubetkin, </em>137 Conn. 516, 519, 79 A.2d 278 (1951).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court should not have summarily adjudicated that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the trial court improperly determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the defendant committed waste actionable by the plaintiff and subject to immediate relief in damages under \u00a7 52-563.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant responds with two alternative contentions. First, she contends that the plaintiffs claim of waste was not actionable under \u00a7 52-563 because the plaintiff failed to allege or produce evidence demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s waste had caused \u201cpermanent and substantial\u201d injury to the property. Second, the defendant contends that \u00a7 52-563 authorizes only equitable relief, and not relief in damages, before the termination of her life tenancy. We consider the defendant\u2019s alternative contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Section 52-563 provides: \u201cAny person who, having no greater interest in real property than an estate for years, or for life, created by the act of the parties and not by the act of the law, commits waste upon the premises, beyond what tenants for years or life created by operation of law may do, shall be liable to the party injured in an action on this section, unless he was expressly authorized, by the contract under which the interest is created, to do the acts complained of.\u201d With respect to the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of waste was not actionable under \u00a7 52-563 in the absence of substantial or permanent injury to the property, the plaintiff directs our attention to the following evidence that she submitted in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment: building inspector William Conrad\u2019s affidavit asserting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the defendant had neglected to make a number of \u201cordinary repairs\u201d necessary \u201cto preserve the property\u201d; the defendant\u2019s deposition testimony acknowledging her failure to maintain particular areas of the property and certain of the structures thereon and photographs depicting the property in its original condition in approximately 1969 and its comparatively deteriorated condition in approximately 1989. The plaintiff asserts that this evidence raised a genuine and material factual issue as to whether the defendant committed waste by failing to make ordinary repairs to the property, thus entitling her to bring an action against the defendant under \u00a7 52-563.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant concedes that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence disclosed that \u201csome ordinary repairs were needed to preserve the property and keep it in a reasonable state of repair.\u201d In addition, the defendant acknowledges that she was \u201cresponsible\u201d for making such repairs. <em>See Hooker v. Goodwin, </em>91 Conn. 463, 471, 99 A. 1059 (1917). The defendant nonetheless contends that the evidence was insufficient to preclude summary judgment because it did not show that her failure to make ordinary repairs had resulted in permanent and substantial injury to the property. Although the defendant does not attempt to ground this contention upon the language of \u00a7 52-563, an endorsement of her position would require that we construe the word injured in the statute to require permanent and substantial injury, in the absence of which, as the defendant asserts, a claim of waste does not \u201crise to the level of an actionable claim\u201d under the statute. Because such a construction of \u00a7 52-563 to a large extent would absolve the defendant of her acknowledged duty to make ordinary repairs, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">A life tenant is bound to keep the land and the structures comprising the estate \u201c \u2018in as good repair as they were when he took them, not excepting ordinary or nat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ural wear and tear . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>84 Conn. 202, 205, 79 A. 177 (1911); see 4A G. Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 1900, p. 30; 5 R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 640[3], p. 56-23. The obligation to make ordinary repairs is twofold. The tenant not only has the duty to make the ordinary repairs required to remedy a presently existing condition of substantial disrepair that may have injured the property substantially or permanently, but also has the duty to make any ordinary repairs necessary to prevent the property from progressively declining to the point where its deterioration, and the resultant injury to the inheritance, is substantial or permanent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See 1 Restatement, Property \u00a7 139, comment (c); 5 R. Powell, supra, p. 56-22 (\u201cduty to keep the premises in repair to prevent serious injury to the property\u201d). In discharging the latter duty to make preventive ordinary repairs, for example, \u201c \u2018if a new roof is needed, [the tenant] is bound to put it on; if paint wears off, he is bound to repaint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Rochford, </em>supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Like a tenant who fails to repair a presently existing condition of substantial disrepair, a tenant who fails to make preventive ordinary repairs \u201ccommits waste\u201d of the permissive variety within the meaning of \u00a7 52-563. Id., 204-205; see 4 G. Thompson, supra, \u00a7 1853, p. 400 (\u201c[p]ermissive waste, as the name implies, consists in the mere neglect or omission to do what will prevent injury\u201d). If, as the defendant urges, a claim of waste were not actionable under the statute until permissive waste produced substantial and permanent injury to the property, a tenant effectively would be relieved of the preventive aspect of the duty to make ordinary repairs because no right of action would exist to enforce that duty. Because it would have been irrational for the legislature to mismatch the scope of a life tenant\u2019s duty to make ordinary repairs and the scope of the right to enforce that duty, thereby rendering the tenant less than fully accountable for inaction that unquestionably constitutes \u201cwaste\u201d under \u00a7 52-563, we conclude that the legislature intended that such duty and such right be correlative in scope. The party to whom the life tenant owes the duty to make ordinary repairs is therefore actionably \u201cinjured\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>within the meaning of \u00a7 52-563 if the tenant \u201ccommits waste\u201d by failing fully to discharge either aspect of that duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The relief furnished to redress permissive waste proved to have been committed necessarily will reflect the degree of injury to the property occasioned by such waste. See generally <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Willametz, </em>9 Conn. App. 565, 580-87, 520 A.2d 621 (1987); D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a75.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Construing the plaintiffs evidence in the light most favorable to her; <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 247, 571 A.2d 116 (1990); we conclude that the plaintiff established a sufficient factual predicate from which it could be determined, as a matter of law, that a genuine and material factual dispute existed as to whether the defendant had committed permissive waste by neglecting to perform preservative acts comprehended within both aspects of her duty to make ordinary repairs. See id., 251. The declarations in the affidavit by Conrad indicated that the defendant had not made preventive ordinary repairs in that the front posts supporting the boat dock were \u201csplitting and must be replaced,\u201d the mortar on a retaining wall had \u201ccracked\u201d and the wall had \u201cmoved,\u201d and \u201cthe wall coverings throughout the house [had] begun to come off the walls.\u201d With respect to the defendant\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to remedy presently existing conditions of substantial disrepair, Conrad asserted that \u201cthe support for the boat house [had] been seriously damaged and it appeared to be sinking at one corner,\u201d and further, \u201cthe pond . . . [had] grown in on all sides and is essentially unusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The defendant similarly acknowledged in her deposition testimony that she had ceased efforts to control the vegetation that had begun growing in the swimming area when it \u201cgot the better of [her],\u201d and that while the island in the center of the pond had experienced \u201ctremendous growth\u201d during her tenancy, she had taken no action to control that growth since 1983. Notwithstanding the affidavit submitted by the defendant wherein real estate broker and appraiser Robinson Leach, Jr., contrarily alleged that his inspection of the property revealed \u201cnothing other than \u2018normal wear and tear/ \u201d this evidence can hardly be characterized as excluding \u201cany real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact\u201d concerning the defendant\u2019s commission of permissive waste. <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 637, 443 A.2d 471 (1982). The court, therefore, should not have rendered summary judgment for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant had committed permissive waste under \u00a7 52-563.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s alternative contention that \u00a7 52-563 authorizes only equitable relief and not relief in money damages for waste before the termination of her life tenancy, we initially note that even if we were to agree with her, we nevertheless would conclude that summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of waste was improper. The plaintiff\u2019s prayer for relief not only included a request for money damages, but also a request for \u201csuch other and appropriate equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>table relief as the court may deem appropriate.\u201d Because \u00a7 52-563, as the defendant concedes, clearly authorizes immediate equitable relief for the commission of permissive waste; see <em>Brainerd </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>27 Conn. 617, 625-26 (1858); summary judgment should not have been rendered on the ground that no relief presently was available to the plaintiff even if she were to have proved her claim of waste. We nonetheless address the issue of whether \u00a7 52-563 authorizes relief in the form of damages before the termination of a life tenancy because it is likely to arise on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In support of her claim that a life tenant is not \u201cliable\u201d under \u00a7 52-563 to pay damages for waste before the termination of the tenancy, the defendant principally relies upon an American Law Reports annotation reporting a number of cases from other jurisdictions so limiting a contingent remainderman\u2019s right to collect damages for waste. See annot., 56 A.L.R.3d 677, 681. The jurisdictions noted in the annotation relieve a life tenant from legal liability to a contingent remainderman on various grounds, each tied to the uncertainty that the future interest ever will become possessory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to prevent a contingent remainderman\u2019s collection of damages \u201c \u2018for that which may not be his\u2019 \u201d; <em>Sermon </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>640 S.W.2d 486, 487 (Mo. App. 1982); such jurisdictions limit contingent remaindermen to equitable remedies \u201c \u2018to prevent the destruction of that which may become his.\u2019 \u201d Id., 487-88; <em>see Strickland v. Jackson, </em>261 N.C. 360, 361, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>134 S.E.2d 661 (1964); see also 2 Restatement, Property \u00a7 188, comment (a); but see L. Simes &amp; A. Smith, Law of Future Interests \u00a7 1652.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The comparative certainty of possession attendant to ownership of an indefeasibly vested future interest in fee simple absolute, the type of interest owned by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> entitles the owner thereof to the maximum protection available both in equity and at law. See 2 Restatement, Property \u00a7 187, comment (a); see also 5 R. Powell, supra, \u00a7 642[1], p. 56-31. It has been said that such an owner \u201cmay secure compensatory damages for injuries sustained. ... He may enjoin threatened acts of waste, or secure a mandatory injunction to compel the performance of a duty by the life tenant with respect to the care of the premises.\u201d L. Simes &amp; A. Smith, supra, \u00a7 1654 (c); see C. Smith &amp; R. Boyer, Survey of Property c. XIII, p. 238. Accordingly, in <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>24 Conn. 350, 357 (1856), this court held that, under General Statutes (1854 Rev.) \u00a7 284, the first statute authorizing the action now provided for under \u00a7 52-563, a life tenant was liable in damages to an indefeasibly vested reversioner <em>before </em>the termination of the tenancy \u201cto the extent of the injury\u201d to the inheritance occasioned by an act of <em>voluntary </em>waste. Cf. <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Willametz, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">While we have not previously considered whether a life tenant likewise is \u201cliable\u201d under \u00a7 52-563 to pay damages for any injury to the inheritance caused by <em>permissive </em>waste, we see no principled reason why the immediacy of an indefeasibly vested future interest owner\u2019s remedy in damages should turn upon the variety of waste committed by the tenant. The variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>waste committed does not diminish the certainty of such an owner\u2019s future possession of the wasted property, nor does the inaction that constitutes permissive waste necessarily produce less damage to the inheritance than an act of voluntary waste, which, under <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>supra, gives rise to an immediate right of action for damages under \u00a7 52-563 irrespective of whether the life tenant remains in possession. Furthermore, the possibility that the tenant may choose to repair the damage caused by permissive waste before the termination of the tenancy does not, as the defendant claims, justify the suspension of such an owner\u2019s ability to obtain relief in damages under \u00a7 52-563 until such termination. Voluntary waste does not consist solely of acts irrevocably destructive, but includes acts subject to reparation at the tenant\u2019s election such as the unjustified removal of \u201canything which has been fixed, or in any manner fastened, to the house,\u201d such as \u201cdoors, floors, or wainscot.\u201d 2 Z.

Because the prospect of possible restoration does not prevent an indefeasibly vested future interest owner from obtaining immediate relief in damages \u201cto the extent of the injury\u201d to the inheritance caused by an act of voluntary waste; <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>supra; that prospect should not bar the owner from obtaining similarly immediate relief for any injury caused by the inaction of permissive waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Having discerned no sound basis for distinguishing between the remedies immediately available to the owner of an indefeasibly vested future interest in fee simple abolute insofar as voluntary and permissive waste are concerned, we conclude that the available remedies should be coextensive. A life tenant, therefore, may be \u201cliable\u201d under \u00a7 52-563 to pay damages to such an owner for either voluntary or permissive waste before the termination of the tenancy. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>2 Restatement, Property \u00a7 187, comment (b) (\u201c[w]hen the right of the owner of the [indefeasibly vested] future interest is that the owner of the estate for life shall . . . make repairs . . . this right is made effective through compelling by judicial action the specific doing of the act in question, or through giving to the owner of the future interest a judgment for the damages caused to him by the omission to act\u201d). Consequently, the trial court should not have rendered summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor on the ground that \u00a7 52-563 does not authorize immediate relief in damages even if the plaintiff were to have proved that the defendant had committed permissive waste. Both equitable and legal relief, in the court\u2019s discretion, presently are available to the plaintiff under \u00a7 52-563. See generally D.
