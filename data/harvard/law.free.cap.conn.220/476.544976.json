Michael and Dennis N. Michael. The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from that action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> naming as defendants the conservation commission, the Michaels, and Luciano and Debra Angeloni,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who are owners of a portion of the property covered by the license at issue. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal, claiming that the plaintiff was neither statutorily nor classically aggrieved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court granted the defendants\u2019 motions and rendered judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly dismissed her appeal because she established: (1) statutory aggrievement pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) statutory standing to raise environmental issues pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) classical aggrievement under \u00a7 22a-43 (a) as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>action. See footnote 4, supra. Because we conclude that the plaintiff established classical aggrievement, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and find it unnecessary to consider her claims of statutory aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conservation commission is the municipal inland wetlands and watercourses agency for the town of Redding. In 1987, the Michaels received subdivision approval from the Red-ding planning commission for an eleven lot subdivision known as \u201cHuntington Estates.\u201d In conjunction with their application for subdivision approval, the Michaels also applied to the conservation commission for a license to conduct certain regulated activities on the subdivision, which contains wetlands and a stream. The Michaels represented to the conservation commission that all of the proposed subdivision lots, including lot 5, would be put to residential use. At the time, lot 5 was already devoted to residential use. In response to a letter from a body of technical advisers to the town regarding future development of lot 5, Gary R. Michael informed the planning commission on September 28, 1987, of the \u201cexisting and planned uses\u201d of lot 5,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that he and Dennis N. Michael \u201chave no intention of extending the existing uses for the property.\u201d In their application to the conservation commission, the Michaels proposed no change in the use of lot 5 and no regulated activities thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>On October 30, 1987, the conservation commission issued a license to the Michaels to conduct certain regulated activities on the subdivision. The license permitted, at specific locations on the subdivision map, a number of activities such as discharge of storm water runoff, development of drainage systems and storm water detention facilities, installation of wells and septic systems, and construction of a residence and driveway. The license did not specify any regulated activities to be permitted on lot 5. The only specific reference in the license to lot 5 was the special condition that a certain declaration of restrictive covenants prohibiting the lot\u2019s subdivision or resubdivision be made part of the license. One of the general conditions of the license was that \u201c[t]he Commission is to be notified in writing of any changes in the permitted activity as soon as such changes are anticipated. The applicant is advised that significant change requires Commission approval.\u201d Another of the general conditions was that the license \u201cshall expire one year from the date of issuance, except on such terms as it may be renewed by the Commission on written application to it prior to expiration.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Nine days after the issuance of the license, on November 9,1987, the Michaels entered into a contract to sell lot 5 to Luciano Angeloni, pursuant to which the Michaels agreed to cooperate with Angeloni\u2019s effort to obtain a special permit to use lot 5 as a horse riding academy. The Michaels did not inform the conservation commission of this contract. After subdivision approval by the planning commission and the issuance of the wetlands license by the conservation commission, the Michaels conveyed lot 5 to the Angelonis, who thereafter secured from the Redding zoning commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sion a special permit to operate a horse riding academy on lot 5. That permit contemplated fifty horses on the site.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On or about October 30,1988, the Michaels\u2019 license was renewed by the conservation commission. On November 22, 1989, the conservation commission received a letter from Gary R. Michael, dated November 15,1989, requesting further renewal of the license. On November 21, 1989, the conservation commission renewed the license, and published notice of that action on November 30,1989. In response, on December 11, 1989, the plaintiff requested the conservation commission to revoke the license. The conservation commission considered the plaintiff\u2019s request at its meeting on December 12, 1989. The plaintiff attended that meeting and filed with the conservation commission a verified notice of intervention pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a); see footnote 5, supra; claiming environmental harm resulting from the horse riding academy on lot 5. The conservation commission did not revoke the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of aggrievement. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In her appeal to the trial court, the plaintiff alleged that the development of the horse riding academy involves regulated activities, including construction of storm water runoff and drainage facilities, roof drains and other water diversions, and alterations of drainage patterns, that require licensing by the conservation commission. She also alleged that the riding academy will have an impact on the wetlands, watercourses and groundwater resources of the other lots in the subdivision and of property outside the subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>sion. The plaintiff alleged that the commission acted illegally by, inter alia, renewing an expired license, failing to review whether the conditions of the license had been complied with prior to its renewal, failing to require notification by the Michaels of a substantial change pertaining to lot 5, and failing to regulate activities of the riding academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s specific factual allegations of aggrievement, which, as noted above, the defendants conceded for purposes of the motions to dismiss; see footnote 6, supra; are as follows. The plaintiff and her husband own and reside with their family on land located in the vicinity of the Michaels\u2019 subdivision. Their land is traversed by a stream and wetland system that flows through and issues from the subdivision. The stream and wetland system are likely to capture polluted and contaminated water issuing from the horse riding academy, and the operation of the horse riding academy could adversely affect the well on the plaintiff\u2019s property that serves the plaintiff\u2019s home. The plaintiff is interested in the maintenance of the purity and cleanliness of the stream and wetland system that flow across her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The plaintiff claims that these allegations, taken as true for the purposes of the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, establish her classical aggrievement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45 constitute the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (the act). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-37. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a), \u201cany person aggrieved by any . . . order, decision or action made pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, by . . . [a] municipality\u201d may appeal to the court. See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u201cThe fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. . . . <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953). <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 442, 445, 435 A.2d 975 (1980). <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 299-300, 524 A.2d 636 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 530, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The parties\u2019 stipulation established a possibility that the stream and wetland system flowing from the subdivision through the plaintiff\u2019s land will be polluted by the horse riding academy. The parties also stipulated that this pollution could adversely affect her well. These facts are sufficient to establish at least a possibility that the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the purity of her well will be adversely affected by the horse riding academy. That adverse effect constitutes \u201ca specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the [conservation commission\u2019s] decision\u201d that was \u201cspecially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendants argue that the plaintiff was not aggrieved because (1) pollution of the stream is a matter of general interest, rather than of personal interest to her, and (2) the source of the pollution of which the plaintiff complains is the riding academy on lot 5, \u201cnot any activity which the Michaels\u2019 license permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>them to conduct on lots 1-4 and 6-11 of the subdivision.\u201d Thus, the defendants argue, since the riding academy was not the subject of the license renewal, the decision of the conservation commission, as opposed to the action of the zoning commission in permitting the riding academy, did not adversely affect the plaintiffs interests. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 first argument, we need not decide whether every downstream riparian owner is classically aggrieved by pollution of an upstream watercourse. It is sufficient here that the parties agreed that pollution could adversely affect the plaintiff\u2019s well.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The defendants\u2019 second argument rests on an unduly cramped notion of the subject matter of the decision of the conservation commission. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c) provides in pertinent part that \u201cno regulated activity shall be conducted upon any inland wetland and watercourse without a permit.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>22a-42a (d) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he agency may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds . . . that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work as set forth in the application.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The decision of the conservation commission not to revoke the license was a \u201cdecision or action made pursuant to\u201d the act. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a). The plaintiff\u2019s claims of illegal conduct by the conservation commission\u2014namely, renewing an expired license, failing prior to renewal to determine compliance with its conditions regarding lot 5, failing to require notice of a substantial change in conditions existing on lot 5, and failing to regulate activities on lot 5\u2014at least on their face, fall within the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 22a-42a (c) and (d), and within the municipal regulation cited by the plaintiff. See footnote 8, supra. The plaintiff\u2019s factual claims regarding the wetlands impact of the riding academy\u2014namely, construction of storm water runoff and drainage facilities, alterations of drainage patterns, and impacts on the wetlands and groundwater resources of sites on and off the subdivision\u2014are sufficient to constitute a claim of unlicensed regulated activity pursuant to \u00a7 22a-42a (c). Similarly, the allegations regarding the intervention of the horse riding academy and its claimed consequences are sufficient to constitute a claim of a significant change in the activities on the subdivision that required notification to and approval by the conservation commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The fact that the license was originally silent with respect to lot 5, save for the prohibition against further subdivision, does not mean, as the defendants suggest, that subsequent activity on the lot was ipso facto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>outside the subject matter of the conservation commission\u2019s decision not to revoke the license. Among the plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations that were stipulated as true for purposes of aggrievement was the allegation that the riding academy would impact on the wetlands and groundwater resources of the remaining ten lots of the subdivision, which were plainly within the Michaels\u2019 license. Thus, as the plaintiff argues, when her factual allegations were brought to the attention of the conservation commission upon the request for revocation of the license, the conservation commission could have required the Michaels to adopt additional pollution control measures on those lots for the purpose of safeguarding the stream and wetland system thereon, and could have thereby reduced the likelihood of the enhanced pollution that the plaintiff claimed to be a result of the activities on lot 5. We conclude, therefore, contrary to the defendants\u2019 position, that the activities on lot 5 were within the subject matter of the decision of the conservation commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> In a second count of her complaint, the plaintiff also requested declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed that count for: (1) failure to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) failure to give proper notice to interested parties; and (3) improper joinder. The plaintiff has not challenged that action of the trial court in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> The commissioner of the department of environmental protection became a party to the trial court proceedings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43, but has not participated in this appeal. We refer herein to the conservation commission, the Michaels and the Angelonis as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> The Angelonis also claimed that the appeal should be dismissed as to them for defective process. The trial court found it unnecessary to reach that issue. Since the Angelonis have failed to brief that issue as an alternative ground to support the decision of the trial court; see Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u00a7 4065; we consider it abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 423 n.2, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); <em>Czarnecki </em>v. <em>Plastics Liquidating Co., </em>179 Conn. 261, 262 n.1, 425 A.2d 1289 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a) provides: \u201cThe commissioner or any person aggrieved by any regulation, order, decision or action made pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, by the commissioner, district or municipality or any person owning or occupying land which abuts any portion of land or is within a radius of ninety feet of the wetland or watercourse involved in any regulation, order, decision or action made pursuant to said sections may appeal to the superior court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183, except venue shall be in the judicial district where the land affected is located, and if located in more than one judicial district to the court in any such judicial district. Such appeal shall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as that prescribed for civil actions brought to said court. Notice of such appeal shall be served upon the inland wetlands agency and the commissioner. The commissioner may appear as a party to any action brought by any other person within thirty days from the date such appeal is returned to the court.
