We conclude that the statute does not permit such approval without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>consent of all parties to the appeal and accordingly reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiff, Ralto Developers, Inc. (Ralto), owned a tract of land in Danbury. Ralto filed an application with the named defendant, the environmental impact commission of the city of Danbury (commission), acting as the inland wetlands agency of the city, for permission to conduct a regulated activity on its land,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> related to the construction of a subdivision of fifty-one dwellings. After holding a series of public hearings, the commission denied the application on July 12, 1989. Ralto appealed to the Superior Court contesting the denial of its application. The defendant, Tarrywile Neighbors for Sensible Development Association (association), made a motion to intervene and become a party to this appeal, which the court, <em>West, J., </em>granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">While that administrative appeal was pending, Ralto filed a second application with the commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The association filed a notice of intervention in the application proceedings, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-20 of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-14 through 22a-20. After another round of hearings, the commission denied the second application on December 18, 1989. Ralto filed a second administrative appeal to the Superior Court, contesting the denial of its second application.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Meanwhile, in September, 1989, Ralto had brought an action against the individual members of the commission pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 claiming damages for an unconstitutional taking of its property resulting from the denial of the first applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tion. While this action and the administrative appeals were pending, the commission held four executive sessions commencing in February, 1990, to consider the possibility of settling all this litigation. A proposed stipulation for judgment was eventually drafted and circulated to all parties. A public hearing was held to solicit comments on the proposed stipulation. The stipulation, as ultimately revised, provided for granting a wetlands permit to Ralto to construct a road affording access to its property but imposed numerous conditions as a prerequisite. On June 26, 1990, a motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation was filed in Danbury Superior Court, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-43 (c). The court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>declined to grant the motion because the association was not then a party to the second administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Later, the court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>granted a motion filed by the association to intervene and become a party to the second administrative appeal and the court, <em>West, J., </em>granted its motion to consolidate the two appeals. Thereafter, Ralto filed a motion to reargue its motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation and submitted a modified proposed stipulation. After two days of hearings, at which the association objected continually to the terms of the proposed stipulation, the court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>rendered judgment in accordance with the stipulation on August 3, 1990. The effect of the judgment was to withdraw Ralto\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action and its first administrative appeal, and to settle the second appeal as provided in the stipulation. The association has appealed from the judgment, raising three issues: (1) whether a trial court may approve the withdrawal and settlement of an appeal from a decision of an inland wetlands agency pursuant to \u00a7 22a-43 (c) when an intervening party refuses to consent to the agreement reached between the agency and the applicant devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>oper; (2) whether the court used proper criteria as a standard of review and correctly allocated the burden of proof in conducting the proceeding required for approval of the settlement of such an appeal; and (3) whether the court\u2019s approval of the settlement is adequately supported by the record of the proceeding. We address only the first issue and conclude that \u00a7 22a-43 (c) requires the consent of all parties to an appeal before the court may approve a settlement withdrawing an appeal from a decision of an inland wetlands agency when the settlement agreement modifies the decision of that agency. This determination makes it unnecessary to consider the other issues, nor would a discussion of them be likely to serve any useful purpose related to further trial court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The association concedes that it did not raise the claim that \u00a7 22a-43 (c) does not authorize the stipulated judgment rendered by the court without its consent to the settlement until September 27,1990, when it filed a motion for articulation in the course of appealing from the judgment. The issue was not raised in its memorandum opposing Ralto\u2019s motion for a stipulated judgment that was presented to the court after the hearing that preceded the rendition of judgment on August 3, 1990. The motion for articulation contained one paragraph requesting clarification of \u201chow the [cjourt could have approved the settlement of one administrative appeal and withdrawal of a second administrative appeal, when one of the parties to both administrative appeals did not agree to said settlement and withdrawal.\u201d The court denied that paragraph of the motion explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u201cThe supreme court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4185. The association\u2019s motion for articulation, pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the absence of its consent, having been filed long after judgment, cannot be deemed to have satisfied the requirement of this rule that claims be \u201cdistinctly raised at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The rule provides further, however, that \u201c[t]he supreme court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4185. It is only in rare cases that this exception to the requirement for seasonable assertion of claims in the trial court may be invoked. \u201cSuch review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). \u201cWe have noticed plain error in the failure of a trial court to apply a clearly relevant statute to the case before it.\u201d Id., 88; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331-32, 438 A.2d 93 (1980); <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 607, 609, 436 A.2d 1259, reh. denied, 449 U.S. 956, 101 S. Ct. 363, 66 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In the present case the court did not entirely overlook \u00a7 22a-43 (c), because, in rendering its decision from the bench, it specifically referred to the hearing requirement of the statute. The court thoroughly reviewed the stipulation on its merits and approved it as \u201cfair and equitable to the applicant and the public interest.\u201d The association had contested the motion for a stipulated judgment and had presented the testimony of abutting owners opposing Ralto\u2019s proposed development at the hearing on the motion. The court must have been aware of the absence of the association\u2019s consent, but must have overlooked the provision of the statute that refers to a \u201csettlement [agreement] between the parties to any such appeal\u201d as a prerequisite to approval of a settlement involving the withdrawal of such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>We conclude that the circumstances of this case are appropriate for plain error review. The failure of the court to recognize that \u00a7 22a-43 (c) requires the approval of all the parties to an appeal, before a settlement agreement modifying the agency decision that is the subject of the appeal may be approved, qualifies as an \u201cobvious\u201d error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra. Particularly in a case such as this, involving the public interest in land use and environmental concerns, our failure to rectify such an evident oversight may undermine \u201cpublic confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d Id., 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Relying on the failure of the association to raise the issue at trial, Ralto has not argued the merits of the claim that \u00a7 22a-43 (c) did not authorize approval of the settlement agreement between Ralto and the commission without the association\u2019s consent thereto. We must, nevertheless, apply standard principles in construing the statute. \u201cTo determine the collectively expressed legislative intent, we look first to the language of the statute itself. If that language is plain and unambiguous, we go no further.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991); <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 322, 328, 585 A.2d 690 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Section 22a-43 (c) provides that \u201c[n]o appeal [from an inland wetlands agency decision] shall be withdrawn and <em>no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective\u201d </em>without court approval of \u201csuch proposed withdrawal or settlement\u201d after a hearing. (Emphasis added.) The legislative intent is clear that a settlement agreement \u201cbetween the parties\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>appeal is a condition precedent for approval of any settlement involving withdrawal of the appeal. The association had intervened in both pending appeals and, therefore, was a party. It follows that no \u201csettlement between the parties\u201d could be reached without the association\u2019s consent. Accordingly, \u00a7 22a-43 (c) did not empower the court to approve the settlement and to render judgment pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (c) provides as follows: \u201cNo appeal taken under subsection (a) of this section shall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the superior court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\"> This regulated activity consisted of a proposal to construct a road across certain wetland areas and drain water into Tarrywile Lake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\"> The second application was virtually the same as the first except for changes haade to the proposed configuration of the road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> It is possible to argue that the use of \u201cbetween\u201d rather than \u201camong\u201d indicates that the legislature intended that the agreement of only two parties, the aggrieved appellant and the agency, would be necessary for a set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tlement pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (c). This inference is refuted by contemporary lexicographers. \u201cThe OED [Oxford English Dictionary] gives a warning against the superstition that [between] can be used only of the relationship between two things, and that if there are more <em>among </em>is the right preposition. \u2018In all senses <em>between </em>has been, from its earliest appearance, extended to more than two. . . . It is still the only word available to express the relation of a thing to many surrounding things severally and individually; <em>among </em>expresses a relation to them collectively and vaguely: we should not say <em>the space lying among the three points </em>or <em>a treaty among three Powers.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.) H. Fowler, Modem English Usage (2d Ed.) p. 57. The following examples of approved usage of \u201cbetween\u201d are cited by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary: \u201cthe fortune was divided [between] the four grandchildren\u201d; \u201cthe food was shared [between] three families.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
