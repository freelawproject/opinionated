Phillips, was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because an actual conflict of interest adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. In 1983, the petitioner was convicted, after a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95, and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101. Prior to and throughout the petitioner\u2019s trial for these offenses, his attorney was Bernard L. Avcollie, a convicted murderer who had been allowed to continue legal practice until he had completed the process of appealing his conviction. We conclude that, under the particular facts of this case, the petitioner was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel, and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The petitioner appeals from the judgment of the habeas court, <em>Axelrod, J., </em>denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In the habeas court he claimed that: (1) he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at his criminal trial because Avcollie was burdened by an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected Avcollie\u2019s performance on his behalf; and (2) the trial court at his criminal trial, <em>Henebry, J., </em>denied him his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel by failing to inquire about a possible conflict of interest that the court knew or should have known existed. With respect to the first claim, the habeas court concluded that no conflict of interest existed and that, even if there had been such a conflict, it did not affect Avcollie\u2019s performance as his lawyer. With respect to the second claim, the habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>court concluded that, although there was a potential conflict of interest about which the trial court should have initiated an inquiry, the petitioner was not entitled to a new trial because of an absence of an actual conflict of interest. The habeas court, accordingly, rendered judgment denying the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court agreed with the habeas court that there had been no conflict of interest, and that it was, therefore, unnecessary to determine whether any such conflict adversely affected Avcollie\u2019s performance at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>23 Conn. App. 63, 69 n.3, 579 A.2d 1092 (1990). The Appellate Court also concluded that, even if the original trial court should have known of a potential conflict of interest, its failure to inquire was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the absence of an actual conflict of interest. Id., 74-75. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court. Id., 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We granted certification to appeal limited to two issues: (1) whether the petitioner was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel pursuant to the sixth amendment to the United States constitution because of an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance; and (2) whether the absence of an inquiry by the trial court about a conflict of interest denied the petitioner his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 822, 581 A.2d 1056 (1990). We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the petitioner must prevail on the first issue because (1) Avcollie violated his duty of undivided loyalty to the petitioner by continuing to represent the petitioner at his trial, and (2) as a direct result thereof, Avcollie placed himself in the untenable position of choosing to forgo individual voir dire regarding his own murder conviction. We, therefore, need not reach the second issue. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The pertinent facts found by the habeas court or appearing of record are undisputed. On April 8,1983, at the judicial district of Waterbury, the petitioner was convicted, after a jury trial, of breaking into the Naugatuck apartment of the victim, an eighty-one year old woman, at approximately 12:30 a.m. on September 2, 1982,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and restraining and sexually assaulting her. <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>17 Conn. App. 391, 392, 552 A.2d 837 (1989). The trial court sentenced the petitioner to an effective sentence of thirty years. The Appellate Court affirmed that conviction on direct appeal. Id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>conviction the petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus which was denied by the habeas court. The Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the habeas court; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 63; and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The petitioner\u2019s claim of a conflict of interest stems from the extensively publicized murder conviction with which his lawyer was burdened at the time of his original trial, and the claimed repercussions that the burden had on the petitioner\u2019s case. The petitioner\u2019s attorney, Avcollie, had been a prominent figure in the Waterbury area for many years prior to the events in question. He had been involved in politics in his hometown of Naugatuck since 1954, and was a state representative from 1967 through 1974, when he was defeated in a primary in which his morality became a public issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In October, 1975, the body of Avcollie\u2019s wife was found floating in the swimming pool of their home in Naugatuck. Twenty-three days later, Avcollie was indicted for his wife\u2019s murder, and in 1977 a jury composed of citizens from towns in the Waterbury judicial district convicted him of murdering her by strangling her to death. After the trial court set aside the conviction for insufficiency of evidence, the state appealed and this court reinstated the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015,100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980). Upon denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, Avcollie was sentenced in the Waterbury Superior Court on March 14,1980, to an indefinite term of eighteen years to life imprisonment. Avcollie appealed, and on December 14,1982, this court affirmed his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>viction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 453 A.2d 418 (1982). On May 16, 1983, the United States Supreme Court denied Avcollie\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>Avcollie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The criminal proceedings against Avcollie between November 21,1975, when he was indicted, and May 16, 1983, when his petition for certiorari was denied, were the source of numerous headlines in the Waterbury and Naugatuck newspapers. Those newspapers have wide circulation in the Waterbury judicial district from which the jurors for the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial were chosen. This publicity had prompted Avcollie and his attorneys at his criminal trial to move twice for a change of venue because they were concerned about the negative impression that potential jurors may have gained from the publicity about the case. The state was also concerned and successfully moved in the Waterbury Superior Court for a protective order, entered on November 26,1975, to protect Avcollie\u2019s right to a fair trial by a fair and impartial jury from being impaired by prejudicial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Avcollie continued to practice law, both before and after his conviction was reinstated and after he was sentenced, and while his appeal from his conviction was pending. In fact, there was discussion among the judges of the Superior Court about the propriety of his continuing to practice law. After his sentence was imposed, Avcollie reached an agreement with the grievance committee for the judicial district of Waterbury to permit him to practice law until all direct appeals of his murder conviction, including a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, were exhausted. The committee believed that it was powerless to take any action against Avcollie because it read the Practice Book to preclude a temporary suspension, even after conviction and pending an appeal, and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office would not release evidence to the committee while the appeal was pending.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Nonetheless, the committee, concerned that members of the public would retain Avcollie ignorant of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that he had been convicted of murder, took the unusual step of moving in the Superior Court pursuant to then Practice Book \u00a7 32,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to have its report released to the public. This was, in the committee\u2019s view, the \u201cleast wrong thing to do in the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The order of the Superior Court authorizing the public release of the committee\u2019s report was signed by Judge Henebry, who would later preside at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">As a result of the notoriety concerning his prosecution for murdering his wife, Avcollie\u2019s previously flourishing legal practice suffered severely. He ordered his young associate, Michael McVerry, to leave the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in order for McVerry to continue to make a living. After his conviction was reinstated, Avcollie took cases that he would have refused previously, including a sexual misconduct case. When he was successful in obtaining a disposition of accelerated rehabilitation for that client, he received many requests to take other cases involving sex crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Avcollie tried one of those cases to a jury in September and October, 1982. The charges against Avcollie\u2019s client were sexual assault, incest and risk of injury to a child. During the jury selection, at the general introduction to the venirepersons, one of the venirepersons excused herself because she lived in Naugatuck and knew about Avcollie\u2019s conviction. Avcollie did not mention his conviction for murder to the venirepersons, either during the general introductions or individual voir dire, because his appeal to this court had not yet been decided. That case resulted in a mistrial, and Avcollie did not represent the defendant on the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On September 11,1982, the petitioner was arrested on the charges that form the basis of this habeas corpus action. He was incarcerated in default of bond. His girlfriend hired McVerry, Avcollie\u2019s former associate, to represent him at arraignment. At the courthouse on the day of the arraignment, McVerry introduced the petitioner to Avcollie and suggested that he retain Avcollie to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The petitioner was a native of Illinois, had moved to Connecticut in 1978, and was unaware that Avcollie had been convicted of murdering his wife and that Avcollie was appealing the conviction. At their first meeting, Avcollie did not inform the petitioner of these facts. Avcollie asked the petitioner about his case and quoted a retainer fee of $2000. The petitioner told Avcollie that he was innocent of the charges against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>him, that he had been working in Port Chester, New York, when the crimes were committed, and that two coworkers would support that alibi.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Avcollie undertook to represent the petitioner because he needed the $2000 and because he believed that the case would not go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The petitioner first learned of Avcollie\u2019s murder conviction three days later, when he was released on bail. His girlfriend told him that Avcollie had been convicted of murdering his wife, but that the conviction had been overturned by the trial judge and that the state was appealing from that action. This information was inaccurate, because by then Avcollie\u2019s conviction had been reinstated by this court, he had been sentenced, and he was appealing from the conviction to this court. Nonetheless, the petitioner decided to retain Avcollie on the recommendation of friends and relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Approximately two weeks after his arraignment, the petitioner met Avcollie for a second time. This meeting took place at Avcollie\u2019s office. The petitioner hired Avcollie as his lawyer and paid him the $2000 retainer. Avcollie disclosed nothing to the petitioner about his murder conviction or appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Approximately one month later, near the end of October, 1982, the petitioner and Avcollie met for a third time, at Avcollie\u2019s office. Avcollie told the petitioner that it was likely that the case would go to trial, necessitating additional fees beyond the retainer. Avcollie did not mention his murder conviction or appeal to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>At a date sometime after January 20,1983, the petitioner and Avcollie met again at Avcollie\u2019s office. By then this court, on December 14, 1982, had affirmed Avcollie\u2019s conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 626. Avcollie told the petitioner that when the case went to trial the petitioner would have to pay him for his time in court. For the first time, Avcollie mentioned his own legal situation, telling the petitioner that this court had affirmed his conviction. Avcollie told the petitioner that he was concerned that his own problems could affect the jury\u2019s attitude toward the petitioner, but he did not go into any detail about this. He assured the petitioner that he could do a credible job of representing him despite those problems. Upon this assurance, the petitioner told Avcollie that he wanted him to continue as his attorney. Avcollie did not secure any written waiver from the petitioner consenting to his continued representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">At this meeting, Avcollie had two goals: (1) to determine that the petitioner was \u201cacquainted with [Avcollie\u2019s] bad fortunes at that time\u201d; and (2) to assure himself that his continued representation would be on a \u201ccash and carry basis.\u201d Avcollie was considering three options: (1) withdrawing from the case altogether; (2) informing the entire jury panel of his conviction during the general introduction phase of voir dire; and (3) questioning each juror, during the individual voir dire phase, about the juror\u2019s knowledge of Avcollie\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Avcollie rejected the option of withdrawal because he had already invested a significant amount of time in the case, because he could not afford to return the retainer to the petitioner, and because he wanted the additional fees that he would earn at the trial. The petitioner\u2019s case came to trial in the Waterbury Superior Court on March 15, 1983, when jury selection began. Avcollie had elected the second option, namely, to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the issue of his murder conviction during the general introductory phase of the voir dire. He had intended to highlight in his introductory comments to the panel of venirepersons the fact that he had been a defendant himself, that he had recently had his case decided against him, and that he did not want the jurors to hold those facts against the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Avcollie, however, did not highlight any such facts. In his general introductory remarks to the panel of venirepersons, he stated only as follows: \u201cIf you know anything about any of the people that I have mentioned that work in my office or particularly about me, if there is anything that you know or feel about me that will inhibit your ability to judge this man fairly, then you should so indicate. You are not of course sitting in judgment of his attorney nor of his office staff any more than you are sitting in judgment of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, you\u2019re sitting in judgment of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Although Avcollie believed that most of the venirepersons knew of his murder conviction, he asked no questions during the individual voir dire concerning that knowledge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He challenged no jurors for cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>during the individual voir dire. It is undisputed that the jurors who sat on the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial lived in the Waterbury area during the period from 1975 through 1983. It is also undisputed that Avcollie\u2019s murder of his wife was the subject of extensive press coverage from November 21, 1975, when Avcollie was indicted, through April 8,1983, when the petitioner\u2019s jury returned its verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The Appellate Court defined the relevant conflict of interest as follows: \u201cA conflict of interest has been determined to be present where one party in interest stands to gain significantly by adducing evidence, advancing arguments or engaging in conduct that is detrimental to the interests of another party.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 69. This definition was drawn from two decisions of this court that involved representation of multiple criminal codefendants by the same lawyer. See <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>191 Conn. 622, 631, 469 A.2d 1181 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>175 Conn. 211, 219, 397 A.2d 533 (1978). The Appellate Court agreed with the habeas court that \u201cthere was no conflict of interest between the petitioner and Avcollie. To the contrary, their interests converged at all times to achieve the ultimate goal of acquittal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>have not been shown to have diverged at any point.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 70-71.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The Appellate Court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that it was a violation of Avcollie\u2019s duty of loy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>alty, and thus a conflict of interest, to represent the petitioner in the Waterbury judicial district because of the risk that the potential jurors would know of Avcollie\u2019s murder conviction and hold it against the petitioner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u201c[t]he petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>bald assertions as to the situs of the trial do not substantiate his claim of conflict of interest. Avcollie was in an adversarial relation with the Waterbury prosecutor\u2019s office in both cases. The petitioner makes no claim that Avcollie compromised the petitioner\u2019s defense either to advance Avcollie\u2019s own defense, or in an attempt to gain, in any other way, at the petitioner\u2019s expense.\u201d Id., 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Appellate Court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that Avcollie was required to conduct an individual voir dire to discover the extent of the jurors\u2019 knowledge of his conviction. The court reasoned that this was a reasonable strategic choice \u201cto protect the interests of the petitioner by not planting the seeds of prejudice where none existed.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the petitioner\u2019s principal claim on this appeal, namely, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Avcollie violated the petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> right to the undivided loyalty of his attorney by representing the petitioner at his trial because Avcollie\u2019s well publicized murder conviction jeopardized the petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We first consider our scope of review. Although the underlying historical facts found by the habeas court may not be disturbed unless they were clearly erroneous, whether those facts constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s rights under the sixth amendment \u201cis a mixed determination of law and fact that requires the application of legal principles to the historical facts of this case.\u201d <em>Cuyler </em>v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 342, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980). As such, that question requires plenary review by this court unfettered by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Id.; see also <em>Mannhalt </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>847 F.2d 576, 579 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 908, 109 S. Ct. 260, 102 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1988); <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Zepp, </em>748 F.2d 125, 134 (3d Cir. 1984). Indeed, we have applied that scope of review, without specifically articulating it, to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 423-29, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991); <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Conn. 547, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). In accordance with this scope of review, we next consider the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201c \u2018the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984), quoting <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970). \u201cAs an adjunct to this right, a criminal defendant is entitled to be represented by an attorney free from conflicts of interest. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>450 U.S. 261, 271, 101 S. Ct. 1097, 67 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1981); <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 70, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1942); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 78, 513 A.2d 116 (1986); <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>[supra, 626-27].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>203 Conn. 159, 166-67, 523 A.2d 1284 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Different standards apply to different types of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Where the criminal defendant presents a claim of \u201c \u2018actual ineffectiveness\u2019 \u201d; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 686; that is, when he challenges his lawyer\u2019s performance in the trial court, he must show that: (1) his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d in the sense that the counsel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment\u201d; and (2) the \u201cdeficient performance prejudiced the defense\u201d; id., 687; in the sense \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., 694. In such a case, therefore, the defendant must establish (1) deficient performance, and (2) actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Where, however, the defendant claims that his counsel was \u201cburdened by an actual conflict of interest\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>id., 692; the defendant need not establish actual prejudice. Id. Where there is an actual conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed because \u201ccounsel [has] breach[ed] the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests.\u201d Id. In a case of a claimed conflict of interest, therefore, in order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment the defendant has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) \u201cthat counsel \u2018actively represented conflicting interests\u2019 \u201d and (2) that \u201c \u2018an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 350; see also <em>Burger </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>483 U.S. 776, 783, 107 S.

The \u201cultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.\u201d Id., 696.

Thus, whether counsel\u2019s conduct violated the sixth amendment is a peculiarly fact-bound inquiry. See id., 690; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 267; <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>supra, 555. For purposes of that inquiry, moreover, \u201c[prevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-1.1 to 4-8.6 (2d ed. 1980) (\u2018The Defense Function\u2019), are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides.

See <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>191 Conn. 622, 631, 469 A.2d 1181 (1983). Although that definition does not directly address a case such as this case, where there are no differing interests of codefendants, the fundamental principle underlying the right to conflict-free representation is directly applicable to this case. That fundamental principle is that an attorney owes an overarching duty of undivided loyalty to his client.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the core of the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel is loyalty, \u201cperhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 692; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>also <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 356 (Marshall, J., dissenting). \u201cLoyalty of a lawyer to his client\u2019s cause is the <em>sine qua non </em>of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that an accused is entitled to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aiello, </em>814 F.2d 109 (2d Cir. 1987).

Ed. 2d 817 (1972) (client entitled to \u201cundivided loyalty of the one upon whom he looks as his advocate and his champion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This requirement of loyalty carries with it the correlative duty of exercising independent professional judgment on the client\u2019s behalf, and both those duties are also reflected in the relevant disciplinary guidelines. \u201cExcept with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of his professional judgment on behalf of his client will be or reasonably may be affected by his own financial, business, property, or personal interests.\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-101 (A). Similarly, DR 5-105 (A) of the Code of Professional Responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ity provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] lawyer shall decline proffered employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by the acceptance of the proffered employment . . . .\u201d \u201cA lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited . . . by the lawyer\u2019s own interests . . . .\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7 (b). The comments to Rule 1.7 reinforce these ethical precepts. They state, in relevant part: that \u201cRoyalty is an essential element in the lawyer\u2019s relationship to a client\u201d; that such loyalty is \u201cimpaired when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the lawyer\u2019s other responsibilities or interests\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he lawyer\u2019s own interests should not be permitted to have adverse effect on representation of a client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">These references to a lawyer\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d are not confined, however, to those financial or personal interests that are extrinsic to the case at hand. They may, under appropriate circumstances, include situations where the intrinsic situation of the lawyer, when viewed in the context of his client\u2019s cause, requires that he withdraw from representing the client because of the impermissible risk that the jury will identify his conduct with that of his client. Thus, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Iorizzo, </em>786 F.2d 52 (2d Cir. 1986), the court identified a conflict of interest in the likelihood of the jury\u2019s identification of the defendant\u2019s lawyer with the government\u2019s witness whom the lawyer had represented at prior, related administrative proceedings. \u201cBecause [the witness\u2019] prior statements had been made at a time when defense counsel was representing him, the prior testimony could not be used to attack [the witness\u2019] credibility without putting defense counsel\u2019s role before the State Tax Commission in issue.\u201d Id., 57. Similarly, in <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, the court found a conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of interest where the defendant\u2019s lawyer sought to impeach the credibility of a state\u2019s witness by use of a statement that he had typed without the witness\u2019 knowledge, and where the lawyer then called another witness to bolster his own credibility. The court reasoned: \u201cThe only issue which should have been before the jury was [the] defendant\u2019s conduct, not that of his attorney. . . . Counsel\u2019s prior conduct was completely irrelevant to [the defendant\u2019s] case and could only detract from his defense. That the jury unintentionally imputed the alleged improprieties of defense counsel to his client is a very real possibility.\u201d Id., 711. Thus, an attorney may be considered to be laboring under an impaired duty of loyalty, and thereby be subject to conflicting interests, because of interests or factors personal to him that are \u201cinconsistent, diverse or otherwise discordant with [the interests] of his client . . . .\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Zepp, </em>748 F.2d 125, 135 (3d Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Application of these principles to the unique facts of this case requires us to conclude that the petitioner was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel. Although Avcollie may not have had a conflict of interest in the classic sense of separate clashing interests, there was a conflict of interest in the constitutional sense because of his violation of the fundamental principles underlying the notion of a conflict of interest and the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. Avcollie\u2019s representation of the petitioner was fatally flawed by an inherent conflict of interest because Avcollie\u2019s duties of undivided loyalty and independent exercise of professional judgment demanded that he withdraw from representing the petitioner on the serious charges that the petitioner faced in that place and at that time. Moreover, that conflict of interest adversely affected Avcollie\u2019s performance as the petitioner\u2019s lawyer because, as a direct result of his vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>lation of those duties, Avcollie was required to make the tactical choice of choosing between two options\u2014 inquiring of the venirepersons during individual voir dire whether they knew about his murder conviction, or forgoing such inquiry\u2014either of which was fraught with peril for the petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial before an impartial jury, and because the course he chose of forgoing the inquiry created a significant risk of a jury biased against his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Certain facts bear repeating. Avcollie had been a prominent figure in the Waterbury area for many years. His indictment, trial and conviction, and the ensuing appeals by the state and by him, had been the subject of widespread publicity in that area from November, 1975, when Avcollie was convicted, through April, 1983, when the petitioner was found guilty by a jury that had been exposed to that very same publicity. Indeed, both Avcollie and his attorneys, as well as the state\u2019s attorney, had deemed special measures to be necessary in order to protect Avcollie\u2019s right to a fair trial from being impaired by that prejudicial publicity. Moreover, Avcollie had been convicted of murdering his wife by strangling her to death, a crime of violence of the first order of seriousness, and the petitioner was charged with the crimes of sexual assault, unlawful restraint and burglary, arising out of a factual scenario of terrible violence against an elderly woman. Furthermore, Avcollie believed that most of the venirepersons knew of his murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Surely no other criminal defendant in the history of Connecticut jurisprudence\u2014indeed, in the history of American jurisprudence\u2014has ever had to face a jury in a trial for serious and violent criminal offenses, while represented by a convicted murderer, whose conviction was likely to have been known by the jurors, in the judicial district where both the murder and conviction took place, where both the murder and its ensu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ing legal aftermath had been widely reported in the press, and when the murderer was literally on his own way to prison.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Surely, no other attorney in the history of Connecticut or American jurisprudence has ever brought with him to the criminal jury courtroom the potential for prejudice to his client that Avcollie brought to the Waterbury courtroom in April, 1983. Under these unique factual circumstances, we are constrained to conclude that there was a constitutionally impermissible risk that the petitioner\u2019s jurors would identify Avcollie\u2019s status as a convicted murderer with his client\u2019s status as an accused rapist, kidnapper and burglar, and that they would transfer to the petitioner the distaste or revulsion that they may have felt for his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We cannot blind ourselves to the real and substantial risk that one or more of the petitioner\u2019s jurors may well have known of Avcollie\u2019s murder conviction and viewed the petitioner\u2019s defense through a lens corrupted by that knowledge. Avcollie believed that risk to be a reality. That risk, which was all too apparent to Avcollie from the very beginning and which persisted throughout the proceedings, demanded no less than that Avcollie, burdened as he was by his own well publicized murder conviction, simply refrain from representing the petitioner before a Waterbury jury in April, 1983. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Iorizzo, </em>supra. \u201cThe only issue which should have been before the jury was [the petitioner\u2019s] conduct, not that of his attorney.\u201d <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>State, </em>778 W.2d 707, 711 (Mo. App. 1989). There was an impermissible risk that the jurors would \u201cuninten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tionally [impute] the . . . improprieties of defense counsel to his client . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Furthermore, an independent attorney, exercising his reasonable professional judgment, would have counseled the petitioner strongly against permitting Avcollie to represent him on such serious criminal charges at that place and time. The petitioner was entitled to no less from Avcollie.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Thus, Avcollie\u2019s fiduciary duties to give undivided loyalty to the petitioner and to exercise independent professional judgment on the petitioner\u2019s behalf required that he withdraw from representing the petitioner on those charges. His failure to do so was \u201cinconsistent, diverse or otherwise discordant with [the interests] of his client.\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Zepp, </em>supra, 135. Under these circumstances, therefore, the \u201cfundamental fairness of the proceeding\u201d was impaired by Avcollie\u2019s representation of the petitioner. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The respondent argues that there was no conflict of interest because the petitioner\u2019s claim is \u201cin actuality, simply a claim that Avcollie could not effectively represent him because of Avcollie\u2019s status as a convicted felon.\u201d Thus, the respondent asserts, \u201ca jury\u2019s knowledge of defense counsel\u2019s criminal conviction no more implicates conflict of interest concerns than would a jury\u2019s belief that defense counsel is not doing a very good job.\u201d We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">First, it is premised on an unduly cramped notion of when a criminal attorney is laboring under a conflict of interest because it ignores the principle that conflict of interest rules are designed to implement and protect the client\u2019s constitutional entitlement to his lawyer\u2019s undivided loyalty and independent professional judgment. Second, it trivializes the enormity of the facts of this case. We do not hold that whenever a law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>yer who has been convicted of a felony represents a criminal defendant there is a conflict of interest in the constitutional sense. We can hardly equate, however, Avcollie\u2019s murder conviction in that judicial district with any other criminal conviction, nor can we equate the likelihood of the petitioner\u2019s jury\u2019s knowledge of that conviction with some other jury\u2019s belief that defense counsel is not doing a very good job.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The respondent also argues that, even if the issue is properly analyzed in conflict of interest terms, there was no such conflict because there was no proof that Avcollie had anything to gain by following a course of conduct detrimental to the petitioner\u2019s interest, because their respective interests merged since they both desired an acquittal, because there was no overwhelming danger that Avcollie\u2019s stigma as a convicted murderer weakened his ability to represent the petitioner, and because we should not presume that the petitioner\u2019s jurors were aware of Avcollie\u2019s conviction or, if they were, that they could not remain unbiased nonetheless. Therefore, the respondent argues, the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that there was no conflict of interest because there was no proof that Avcollie stood \u201cto gain significantly by adducing evidence, advancing arguments or engaging in conduct that [was] detrimental to the interests of\u201d the petitioner. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 69. These arguments are equally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Although the petitioner did not establish a conflict of interest within the Appellate Court\u2019s definition of that term, that definition was drawn from cases involving representation of multiple criminal defendants, and does not address the underlying violation of the duties of loyalty and exercise of independent professional judgment present in this case. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order for there to be a conflict of interest, the habeas corpus petitioner show that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>lawyer desired his conviction. As the petitioner aptly points out, it is not necessary to prove that Avcollie was a quisling<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in order to establish a conflict of interest under the sixth amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, we need not, and do not, presume that any one of the petitioner\u2019s jurors was actually biased against him because of Avcollie\u2019s murder conviction. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980), does not mandate such an impossible showing. We hold only that the risk of such bias was so significant that Avcollie\u2019s duties to the petitioner mandated that he withdraw in order to avoid that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">This violation of Avcollie\u2019s duty of loyalty to the petitioner adversely affected Avcollie\u2019s performance as the petitioner\u2019s lawyer. Having opted to remain as the petitioner\u2019s lawyer in violation of his duty to withdraw, Avcollie was faced with the insoluble dilemma of whether to raise the fact of his own notorious conviction during the individual voir dire, in order to ferret out those venirepersons who harbored hostility toward him and who would transfer that hostility to his client. This was, from the petitioner\u2019s viewpoint, a classic \u201cno win\u201d situation. If Avcollie did not raise the issue, he exposed his client to the risk that such biased venirepersons would find their way on to the jury. If he did raise the issue, he created the risk that he would inform\u2014 or remind\u2014otherwise ignorant or forgetful venirepersons that they were to hear a case in which a convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>murderer would be representing an accused rapist. Either choice was harmful to the petitioner\u2019s interest, because either course of conduct created the impermissible risk that the jurors who were to judge the petitioner would do so infected by their view of Avcollie.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">No other lawyer would have imposed that unique danger on his client solely by his presence at his client\u2019s side. This dilemma was inherent in Avcollie\u2019s personal situation, and was the inevitable result of the violation of his duty of loyalty to the petitioner. Thus, we can only conclude that, by his forgoing individual voir dire on this issue, Avcollie\u2019s performance was adversely affected by his conflict of interest. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">This conclusion is reinforced by reference to the unique role that individual voir dire plays in Connecticut. Article first, \u00a7 19, of our constitution, as amended by article IV of the amendments thereto, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he right to question each juror individually by counsel shall be inviolate.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That constitutional right is implemented further in criminal cases by General Statutes \u00a7 54-82f,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201ceither party . . . the right to examine, personally or by his counsel, each juror outside the presence of other prospective jurors as to his qualifications to sit as a juror in the action, or as to his interest, if any, in the subject matter of the action, or as to his relations with the parties thereto.\u201d One of the principal purposes of individual voir dire is the discovery of factors \u201cthat may predispose a prospective juror to decide a case on legally irrelevant grounds\u201d; <em>Rozbicki </em>v. <em>Huybrechts, </em>218 Conn. 386, 391, 589 A.2d 363 (1991); and thus provide a basis for a challenge for cause or for a peremptory challenge. Other cases reinforce the particular importance that our law places on the individual voir dire. Id., 390; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 161, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 511, 525 A.2d 509 (1987); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>202 Conn. 158, 162, 520 A.2d 190 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Conn. 667, 671-72, 495 A.2d 699 (1985). Avcollie, at the petitioner\u2019s expense, dispensed with this unique and valuable right. That course of inaction by Avcollie constituted an adverse effect on his performance that was the direct result of his conflict of interest. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The respondent argues that there was no adverse effect on Avcollie\u2019s performance because \u201cAvcollie reasonably concluded that the potential harm to the petitioner in informing previously unaware jurors of Avcollie\u2019s situation outweighed the potential benefit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>detecting jurors who were already aware of his situation and could not remain unbiased.\u201d Thus, the respondent contends, Avcollie made a reasonable \u201cstrategic choice . . . to protect the petitioner\u2019s interests in not \u2018planting the seeds of prejudice\u2019 where none may [have existed].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">It is not clear from this record, and the habeas court did not find, that strategic considerations rather than personal reluctance dictated Avcollie\u2019s decision to forgo individual voir dire about his own murder conviction. See footnote 10, supra. Assuming, however, that strategy was the predominating motive, we nonetheless reject the respondent\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It was only because of Avcollie\u2019s antecedent violation of his constitutional and ethical duties to the petitioner that he was confronted with a strategic choice that carried with it only adverse consequences for his client. That strategic dilemma was dictated solely by Avcollie\u2019s own personal situation. No other lawyer would have been required to sacrifice his client\u2019s interests by making a strategic decision that threatened to harm those interests no matter which fork in the road he took. Under these circumstances, the petitioner cannot be charged with the consequences of a strategy that was born, not of his misconduct, but of the misconduct of his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the matter to the Superior Court with direction to render judgment granting the writ of habeas corpus and ordering a new trial for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In this opinion Shea and Glass, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-12\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cFurther provisions respecting criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">The sixth amendment is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment. <em>Pointer v.

Avcollie, still practicing law after his own conviction in a highly publicized case in the same courthouse, was unable to pursue certain courses of action, such as probing individual voir dire to protect his client against juror bias, because Avcollie put his own interest in staying on the case ahead of his professional judgment that most members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the jury panel knew of his conviction and his \u2018nagging feeling that [his] reputation was going to hurt this man [the petitioner]\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"AhC\">\u201c2.

Upon the filing of such complaint a rule to show cause shall issue to the defendant, who may make any proper answer within twenty days from the return of the rule, and shall have the right to be heard in his own defense and by witnesses and counsel. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, such complaints shall be prosecuted by local bar counsel and heard as soon as practicable, and upon such hearing the court shall make such lawful order as may to it seem just. Such complaints shall be proceeded with as civil actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">William St. John, Jr., who had been the counsel to the grievance committee, testified that after Avcollie had been arrested but before his trial the committee took no action because he had not been convicted and because \u201cthere was at the time no mechanism in the Practice Book for a temporary-type suspension. Our choice was to go for a full reprimand, or a full disciplinary action, or nothing. And we determined that from doing research that we would have to prove the underlying conduct of an accusation in order to establish grounds for some type of discipline. That was, the bottom line was we would have to prove that he murdered his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u201cWe spoke with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and determined from them that they felt it was inappropriate for them to give us their files since it was a pending criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u201cTaking all of those things into consideration, the Committee determined there really wasn\u2019t anything they should do, or could do at that time and did not do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">St. John also testified that, after the jury returned its guilty verdict, the committee took no action because the trial court had set the verdict aside and acquitted Avcollie. He testified further that, after the conviction was reinstated by this court, the committee accepted statements by Avcollie and his attorney that if his appeals, including a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, were unsuccessful he would voluntarily surrender his license to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The committee\u2019s impotence in the face of Avcollie\u2019s conviction for murder, after that conviction had been reinstated and after sentence had been imposed, is probably attributable to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 292-94, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978). In that decision, we held that \u00a7 20 of the 1963 Practice Book, which provided for summary discipline of an attorney, without a complaint or hearing, for misconduct occurring in the presence of the court, did not apply to \u201ca conviction evidencing mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>conduct elsewhere.\u201d Id., 294. Thus, the committee believed that, despite Avcollie\u2019s conviction, it would have been required independently to prove, in the disciplinary proceedings, that Avcollie murdered his wife, at least until his appeals were exhausted. <em>Tedesco </em>did not necessarily hold, however, that \u00a7 21, which later became \u00a7 31, did not provide a basis for disciplinary action, including suspension or disbarment, upon conviction of a major felony, as long as the procedures provided by \u00a7 31 were followed. Indeed, the committee\u2019s reading of \u00a7 31 would have required it to prove that Avcollie murdered his wife, even after his conviction had been affirmed by this court and certiorari denied by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">In any event, the committee\u2019s perceived dilemma has been resolved by Practice Book \u00a7 28B, which provides: \u201c[suspension, disbarment and UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW]\u2014DISCIPLINE OF ATTORNEYS CONVICTED OF A FELONY</p>\n<p id=\"AdO\">\u201c(a) The clerk of the superior court location in this state in which a lawyer is convicted of a felony shall transmit, immediately upon the imposition of sentence, a certificate of the conviction to the statewide bar counsel and to the statewide grievance committee.

Such hearing shall be prosecuted by the statewide bar counsel, an assistant bar counsel or an attorney designated pursuant to Sec. 31A. At such hearing the attorney shall have the right to counsel, to be heard in his own defense and to present evidence and witnesses in his behalf.

It stated, in part, that \u201c[t]he Committee has determined that it is not consistent with due process of law or fundamental fairness to take any action pursuant to Rule 31 while direct appeals are pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">\u201cThis decision may not be applauded in all circles, but it is not the Committee\u2019s function to satisfy or please any group large or small. Every citizen in the country is entitled to due process of law and lawyers are no exception.\u201d After noting that the committee would take further action if Avcollie\u2019s direct appeals were unsuccessful, the report stated that \u201c[t]his entire matter has received widespread coverage in the media and it appears to the Committee that legal services consumers have sufficient facts in their possession to determine whether or not they wish to engage Attorney Avcollie\u2019s services.\u201d The report concluded: \u201cIn order to avoid confusion on the part of the public and the organized bar, it is important that this report be made public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\"> The Appellate Court record of the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal indicates that the petitioner testified in his own defense at his criminal trial, denying that he had been in the victim\u2019s apartment at the time of the crimes, and claiming that he was at work in Port Chester, New York, at that time. Two of the petitioner\u2019s coworkers corroborated his testimony. The state impeached the coworkers\u2019 testimony, and presented testimony of the victim, her son-in-law and a neighbor identifying the petitioner as the masked perpetrator of the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\"> The habeas court specifically noted Avcollie\u2019s testimony that he thought that his remarks had been more specific than these, and that in Avcollie\u2019s view these remarks did not \u201cgo much further than an instruction I might have made had I not had a personal problem.\u201d The court also specifically noted that the respondent\u2019s expert witness, attorney Louis S. Avitabile, characterized these remarks as the \u201cstandard introduction of a defense attorney to a jury panel.\u201d The court also noted that the petitioner\u2019s expert witness, attorney Richard R. Brown, opined that these remarks provided an insufficient basis for a defense attorney competently to judge the fairness of a potential juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> The habeas court made no specific findings regarding the reasons for Avcollie\u2019s failure, during the individual voir dire, to pursue the question of whether any of the venirepersons knew of his murder conviction and would hold that fact against the petitioner. Avcollie\u2019s testimony suggests either or both of two motives: (1) personal reluctance; and (2) strategy. Avcollie testified on direct examination that \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I didn\u2019t do more than [his general introductory remarks], other than I felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that that was enough. And I still wasn\u2019t in the habit of talking a lot about [his murder conviction] and, frankly, I was probably a little squeamish about mentioning it over and over and over again . . . .\u201d He also testified that \u201cin the back of my mind I constantly had the nagging feeling that my reputation was going to hurt this man, and I had to continue to talk myself out of it.\u201d He testified on cross-examination, however, that \u201cif I covered it in more in depth in the individual voir dire, I may be doing more harm than good for [the petitioner], . . . And if they didn\u2019t know, before I questioned them, that I was in trouble, they\u2019d sure know after I questioned them. So, I elected to pass on that at that time . . . rather than go into it in detail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> In addition to copies of the press clippings, the evidence in the habeas court included the testimony of St. John, Avitabile, Avcollie and Judge Henebry that the press coverage was very extensive, and the report of the grievance committee that Avcollie\u2019s conviction had received widespread press coverage. See footnote 7, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b151-5\"> The Appellate Court also concluded that \u201cAvcollie apprised the petitioner of the inherent risks of Ms representation as required under the Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 5-105 (C), and the petitioner chose, nevertheless, to continue their attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, 23 </em>Conn. App. 63, 71, 579 A.2d 1092 (1990). The petitioner challenges this conclusion, and the respondent claims that it is supported by the record. The respondent does not claim, however, and specifically disclaimed in the habeas court, that the petitioner waived any conflict of interest that Avcollie may have had. In any event, we agree with the petitioner that this conclusion of the Appellate Court is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Disciplinary Rule 5-105 (C) of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides as follows: \u201cIn the situations covered by DR 5-105 (A) and (B), a lawyer may represent multiple clients if it is obvious that he can adequately represent the interest of each and if each consents to the representation after full disclosure of the possible effect of such representation on the exercise of his independent professional judgment on behalf of each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Disciplinary Rule 5-105 (A) and (B) provide as follows: \u201c(A) A lawyer shall decline proffered employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by the acceptance of the proffered employment, or if it would be likely to involve him in representing differing interests, except to the extent permitted under DR 5-105 (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201c(B) A lawyer shall not continue multiple employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by his representation of another client, or if it would be likely to involve him in representing differing interests, except to the extent permitted under DR 5-105 (C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">First, the habeas court made no findings that would support a conclusion that Avcollie made \u201cfull disclosure of the possible effect of [his] representation on the exercise of his independent professional judgment on behalf of\u201d the petitioner. Indeed, the court\u2019s finding of the lack of detail supplied by Avcollie to the petitioner is, if anything, to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Second, the portions of the record relied on by the respondent to support the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion do not do so. The respondent points to certain testimony of Avcollie regarding his discussions with the petitioner. Avcollie testified that at the post-January 20, 1983 meeting at Avcollie\u2019s office, Avcollie \u201ctold [the petitioner] of . . . what had, by that time, grown to be a major concern of mine . . . that my reputation and my problems might rub off on [him]. And I told him that I was concerned about that, <em>but that I felt I could, correct that by comments to the jurors in a timely fashion, and hopefully if we had honest jurors, they would judge John on John, not on Bemie. \u2019 \u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Avcollie also testified that at that meeting he told the petitioner that they would have the opportunity to question each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>potential juror individually, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t give him my solution to my problem. <em>I didn\u2019t go into that with him because at the time, frankly, I didn\u2019t have a solution to the problem. I was still carrying it around in my mind and on my conscience with it. . . . </em>My problem was that I was concerned that the jurors may be prejudiced against John because of my notoriety and my conviction. ... I told him what my situation was . . . <em>and I told him that I felt I could represent him and do a good job, </em>but that if he felt squeamish about it, that he should . . . elect to get other counsel. He felt that, as I recall, that he would stick with me.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Based on this record, we cannot conclude that there was the kind of full disclosure of the inherent risks of Avcollie\u2019s continued representation that DR 5-105 (C) contemplates. There was no disclosure, for example, of Avcollie\u2019 s own notoriety in the community, of the degree of notoriety of his murder trial and conviction, of the fact that he and his attorneys had felt it necessary to move for a change of venue in his own case, nor of the protective order obtained by the state because of that press coverage. Nor was there any disclosure of the fact that, contrary to the petitioner\u2019s inaccurate understanding, Avcollie\u2019s own appeal of his conviction\u2014as opposed to the state\u2019s earlier appeal of the trial judge\u2019s action in setting the verdict aside\u2014had recently been rejected by this court, and that, absent the unlikely grant of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, Avcollie himself was literally on his way to prison, or that those facts had themselves been the subject of extensive press coverage in the Waterbury area. Furthermore, Avcollie undercut what meager disclosure there was by accompanying it with his assurance that he could \u201ccorrect\u201d the problem \u201cby comments to the jurors in a timely fashion\u201d\u2014an assurance that he failed to fulfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Given this record, the dissent\u2019s reliance on a purported waiver by the petitioner is wholly misplaced. Indeed, as noted above, the respondent specifically disclaimed any such reliance in the habeas court. When asked by the court whether \u201cthe Respondent claim[s] that the Petitioner waived his right to conflict-free representation,\u201d the respondent answered: \u201cNot in the technical sense. No, Your Honor, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any basis for making that claim in this representation. It would be the Respondent\u2019s position that a waiver in the technical sense, or in the word-of-the-art, involves a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of a known right which is something that takes place somewhere on the record, in some form. And there has been no claim that anyone ever conducted such an inquiry or a canvass of this . . . petitioner] in this regard. So, obviously, no. I just don\u2019t think we can make that kind of a claim.\u201d As a result, the habeas court was not called upon to address the factual issue of waiver, on which the respondent bore the burden of proof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 267, 533 A.2d 545 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Of course, even where a trial court <em>finds </em>a waiver of a constitutional right, that finding is subject to \u201ca scrupulous examination\u201d by us in order to determine that it is supported by substantial evidence. Id., 268. The dissent, nonetheless, would disregard the respondent\u2019s disclaimer and the necessity for such special scrutiny and would find waiver as a matter of law in a record where the issue was never presented, litigated or argued by the parties and where, therefore, no such finding was ever made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> In the habeas court, the petitioner had presented the expert testimony of attorney Richard R. Brown, of Hartford, a former assistant attorney general, former assistant state\u2019s attorney, former chair of the criminal justice section of the Connecticut Bar Association, and currently a criminal defense attorney in private practice. The habeas court recognized Brown as an expert witness on matters of conflicts in interest in criminal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Brown testified, inter alia, that it was a breach of Avcollie\u2019s duty of undivided loyalty to the petitioner to represent him at his trial because there was a conflict of interest inherent in the situation. Asked to explain his opinion by putting himself hypothetically in Avcollie\u2019s position, he testified as follows: \u201c I . . . [have] been convicted, myself, of a violent crime, to wit, murder. I\u2019m representing someone who is charged with a heinous violent crime, to wit, rape. That jury has to rely upon my integrity. I\u2019m now a convicted felon. It is my opinion, based upon my years of experience, there is without question a spill-over effect\u2014that is, for better or for worse as defense lawyers [we] are sometimes associated with the defendant in terms of what they think of the lawyer\u2014it spills over onto the defendant. . . . If I have the stigma of being a convicted murderer, I have to believe in my experience, that that would have a substantial effect [on the jury]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">He also testified that in this situation it was incumbent on Avcollie, having nonetheless continued to represent the petitioner despite the violation of his duty to withdraw, to request the trial court for an expanded individual voir dire in order \u201cto insure that all prospective jurors could honestly separate [his] problems and [his] history from those of [his] client and would not transfer any feelings they may have [had] about [him], nor let any felony convictions they may have [had] about [him], spill over to those . . . feelings that they might have . . . [regarding] the evidence against [his] client.\u201d He testified further that Avcollie\u2019s general introductory remarks to the jury panel were inadequate to bring to the surface those potential jurors \u201cwho may not even be aware of their prejudice until it\u2019s brought to their attention by way of various indepth questioning,\u201d and that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>remarks were not an adequate substitute for an individual voir dire that was required under the circumstance of the case to guard against the risks he had outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"Aym\">The respondent presented the expert testimony of attorney Louis S. Avitabile, an experienced criminal defense lawyer from Waterbury, who since 1971 had been under contract with the public defender\u2019s office for cases in which it is necessary to decide whether an attorney other than a public defender is needed and who has testified as an expert regarding the issue of effective assistance of counsel. Avitabile testified that Avcollie\u2019s personal situation did not constitute a conflict of interest, and that as long as Avcollie explained that situation to the petitioner, \u201cif his client wants to hire him then that\u2019s between him and his client at that point.\u201d He also testified that the decision whether to discuss Avcollie\u2019s status as a convicted murderer with the potential jurors in individual voir dire, or to confine the issue to general remarks addressed to the entire venire, was a strategic choice that had \u201cpros and cons in both situations.\u201d He agreed that questioning jurors individually on the subject could have \u201cplant[ed] seeds of prejudice where they may or may not exist in a juror\u2019s mind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> The Appellate Court did agree with the petitioner, however, that the habeas court had applied an improper standard in requiring the petitioner to show actual bias on the part of petitioner\u2019s jurors. \u201cWe agree that here, without having conducted a line of questioning during individual voir dire to ferret out potential bias, it is impossible now to prove actual bias.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>23 Conn. App. 63, 71 n.5, 579 A.2d 1092 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> The petitioner couches his claim entirely in sixth amendment terms and makes no separate claim under the Connecticut constitution. Although we have, in the context of the right to the effective assistance of counsel, stated that \u201cthe state and federal constitutional standards for review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims are identical\u201d; <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 355-56 n.3, 559 A.2d 206 (1989); we have more often and recently insisted on a separate and independent analysis of our state criminal constitutional provisions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 358 n.9, 590 A.2d 408 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 89, 588 A.2d 145 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 67 n.9, 544 A.2d 611 (1988). Therefore, in the absence of any such analysis by the petitioner in this case, we confine our discussion to his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Thus, the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner did not establish actual prejudice, because he did not prove actual bias on the part of any of his jurors, is simply beside the point. In a conflict of interest case, prejudice is presumed precisely because it is impossible \u201cto measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Equally unpersuasive is the dissent\u2019s complaint that we are engaging in prohibited \u201cappellate second-guessing.\u201d The admonitions that the dissent quotes from <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 690-91, were issued in the context of a case involving a claim of an attorney\u2019s actual ineffectiveness in the performance of a trial, not a case involving a claimed conflict of interest, and were premised largely on considerations involving the necessity to make reasonable strategic choices that are inapplicable to Avcollie\u2019s choice in this case to continue his representation of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In this case, moreover, even if we were to afford Avcollie an initial \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d; id., 689; that presumption would quickly disappear in the glare of the facts disclosed by this record. We do not second-guess, nor is our view distorted by hindsight. Bather, we reach a set of conclusions that are compelled by the undisputed facts of this ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\"> Indeed, we have held that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be confined to habeas corpus proceedings, where an adequate record may be made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b160-5\"> The dissent argues that because \u201ca divergence of competing motives is the heart or essence of a conflict of interest claim,\u201d there was no constitutional conflict of interest in this case. We disagree for two related reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">First, that position is derived from the dissent\u2019s adoption of a definition of a conflict of interest as existing \u201c \u2018when, in behalf of one client, it is [a lawyer\u2019s] duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.\u2019 [ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 6].\u201d <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 356 n.3, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980). That definition was formulated by Justice Marshall dissenting in <em>Cuyler, </em>and was not adopted by the majority. It was specifically tailored, moreover, to the facts of <em>Cuyler, </em>which was a case of representation of multiple codefendants. Furthermore, Justice Marshall prefaced his adoption of the definition by stating: \u201c \u2018Conflict of interests\u2019 is a term that is often used and seldom defined. The American Bar Association\u2019s usage . . . is a fair statement of what is <em>ordinarily </em>meant by the term, and it is that meaning that I adopt <em>here.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. After noting its applicability to a case of multiple representation, he acknowledged that \u201c[t]he ABA materials do not, of course, define the constitutional standard.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Second, the dissent\u2019s limited perception of when a conflict of interest may occur ignores the basic principle of loyalty to client that undergirds the sixth amendment prohibition against actual conflicts of interest. The dissent does not take issue, however, with our analysis, or with the case law on which it is based, that underlying the rules against conflicts of interest is the duty of loyalty. Thus, even though an attorney may have violated that constitutional duty of loyalty, the dissent would condone it unless the violation was committed in the service of some competing motive of the attorney. We do not believe that the notion of a conflict of interest in the constitutional sense should be divorced from the fundamental principle underlying the sixth amendment guarantee that conflict of interest rules are designed to implement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> Like the habeas court and the parties to this appeal, we have found no other case where a convicted murderer was permitted to practice law by representing a client accused of serious criminal offenses.

The majority concludes that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>has been denied the effective assistance of counsel. I disagree. \u201cA convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal . . . has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. . . . Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that [counsel\u2019s assistance has been ineffective].\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.

ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule 5-105 (A)-(B) (1976). . . . \u2018[A] lawyer represents conflicting interests when, in behalf of one client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.\u2019 [ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 6].\u201d <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 356 n.3. Thus, a divergence of competing motives is the heart or essence of a conflict of interest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">An <em>actual </em>conflict of interest occurs upon proof, as opposed to hypothesis, that counsel\u2019s behavior is motivated out of a \u201cdesire to diminish the jury\u2019s perception of a codefendant\u2019s guilt . . . [so that] . . . counsel\u2019s \u2018struggle to serve two masters [could not] seriously be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>doubted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 75, 62 S.

Ed. 2d 333 (1980). \u201c[U]ntil a defendant shows that his counsel <em>actively represented conflicting interests, </em>he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance. . . . [T]he <em>possibility of conflict </em>is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In the present case, \u201cthere was no conflict of interest between the petitioner and Avcollie. To the contrary, their interests converged at all times [in seeking] the ultimate goal of acquittal . . . .\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>23 Conn. App. 63, 70, 579 A.2d 1092 (1990). As the habeas court correctly observed, \u201cthe interest of Avcollie and that of the petitioner [neither conflicted nor diverged] but rather they converged in that each wanted to obtain a not guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Further, \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment. . . . [Prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an <em>actual </em>conflict of interest. . . . Prejudice is presumed only if the defendant <em>demonstrates </em>that counsel \u2018actively represented conflicting interests\u2019 and that \u2018an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>[446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691-92, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984). Since, as the majority concedes, the petitioner\u2019s attorney did \u201cnot have . . . a conflict of interest in the classic sense of separate clashing interests . . .\u201d there is no presumption of prejudice that would satisfy the second require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ment of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Having failed to demonstrate an <em>actual </em>conflict of interest and thus being unable to rely on the presumption of prejudice, the majority seeks to craft an entirely new definition of actual conflict of interest based upon an assumption of divided loyalty based in turn upon the possibility of jury prejudice. Intriguing as this definition is, no court has ever adopted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Although the majority would not require that actual bias be present, only a significant risk of bias on the part of jurors, the habeas court found that \u201c[i]n this case there was no evidence presented that any of the jurors sitting on the petitioner\u2019s case harbored any hostility toward Attorney Avcollie that would prevent such juror from judging the case fairly and impartially.\u201d Without having questioned the jurors during individual voir dire, or as an incident to the habeas hearing, it is impossible now to prove actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Further, the majority overlooks completely the significance of the petitioner\u2019s waiver of counsel\u2019s disability. <em>\u201cA </em>valid waiver is defined ... as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>In re Manuel R., </em>207 Conn. 725, 736, 543 A.2d 719 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 532, 480 A.2d 435 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Examination of the record reveals that sometime shortly after September 11,1982, the petitioner learned that Avcollie had been convicted of murder. Despite this, he elected to proceed with Avcollie as counsel. On January 20,1983, some four months later, Avcollie himself explained his conviction to the petitioner <em>and discussed with him his concerns that his own problems could affect the jury\u2019s attitude toward the petitioner.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Despite these clear admonitions, the petitioner again elected to continue with Avcollie\u2019s representation at trial, a trial that began some two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It is important to note that a tension exists between the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and the limited right to counsel of one\u2019s choice. This tension is resolved, in part, through the law of waiver. Our rules of practice, for example, allow an accused to refuse the assistance of counsel entirely and represent himself providing the trial court finds an effective waiver of the right to counsel. See Practice Book \u00a7 961. Further, the Code of Professional Responsibility, in force at the time of this trial, permitted counsel with an actual conflict of interest, to continue to represent a client provided there was full disclosure of the conflict and a knowing waiver by the client.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction . . . and it is all too easy for a court ... to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct. . . . [A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . .\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Despite its clear admonition to the contrary, the majority has done exactly what the <em>Strickland </em>court tells us not to do. In a classic case of appellate second guessing, having made no \u201ceffort ... to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,\u201d and having cast aside the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct . . . [was effective]\u201d; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra; the majority has redetermined the facts and rendered a judgment that is without legal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Since there has been: (1) no demonstration of an actual conflict of interest; and (2) no evidence of prejudice caused by the presumed conflict of interest, I conclude that the petitioner has not met his burden of establishing a violation of the sixth amendment under the <em>Strickland </em>test. Further, even were there a conflict of interest, the record clearly demonstrates a voluntary and knowing waiver of its ramifications by the petitioner. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> The petitioner has never claimed that he did not understand that Avcollie\u2019s representation might adversely affect the jury\u2019s perception of him (the petitioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> Disciplinary Rule 5-101 (A) of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility in effect at the time of the petitioner\u2019s trial, provided: \u201cExcept with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of his professional judgment on behalf of his client will be or reasonably may be affected by his own financial, business, property or personal interests.\u201d See also Rules of Professional Conduct \u00a7 1.7 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
