CONCLUSION...620\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (\"SEPTA\") has been operating the mass transit system in Philadelphia since 1964. It operates bus, subway, commuter rail, light rail, and trolley service to Philadelphia and Delaware, Montgomery, Bucks and Chester counties, with some train service to Wilmington, Delaware and Trenton, New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This case concerns the advertising space on the inside of SEPTA buses. SEPTA's bus network serves the many neighborhoods of Philadelphia and suburbs. Many residents of Philadelphia, particularly those for whom private vehicles, taxis or other forms of transportation are inaccessible or too expensive, rely on SEPTA buses, trolleys, and subways for daily transportation. The viability of this public transit system is thus of critical importance in a city of over 1.5 million, where more than 25% of residents live below the poverty rate.\n   <em>\n    QuickFacts: Philadelphia City, Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , U.S. CENSUS BUREAU https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/philadelphiacitypennsylvania (July 1, 2017)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Initial Proposed CIR Advertisement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff, The Center for Investigative Reporting (\"CIR\") is a nonprofit investigative journalism organization based in Emeryville, California. (10/01/18 Trial Ex. 11.) Its mission notes that \"Advances in social justice, solutions to pressing problems, and greater accountability in both the public and private sectors all rely on the availability of credible information. Verifiable, nonpartisan facts empower the public to effect positive change, advancing improved outcomes for a broad range of critical issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CIR's reporting is published on its news website Reveal (www.revealnews.org), as well as on its national radio show, podcast, video, and live events. (ECF l, \"Compl.\" \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On February 15, 2018, CIR published the results of a year-long investigation into disparate lending trends throughout the country. (Trial Ex. 4.) The results of this investigation showed that in 61 metropolitan areas, applicants of color were more likely to be denied conventional home purchase mortgages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CIR used the information from this investigation to create a 10-panel comic strip entitled \"A Stacked Deck.\" (Trial Ex. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In January 2018, a designer from CIR emailed Jon Roche, Vice President at Intersection, the company that manages advertising space for SEPTA, seeking to display the comic on the interior of SEPTA buses. (Trial Ex. 10, Jan. 17, 2018 Email from G. Hongsdusit to J. Roche.) The comic was derived from the following advertisement from Reveal's website:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SEPTA's Rejection of the Proposed Ad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   SEPTA rejected CIR's proposed advertisement, noting that \"[t]he proposed ad is an issue ad and cannot be accepted. Disparate lending is a matter of public debate and litigation.\" Ex. 10, Feb. 22, 2018 Email from J. Roche to H. Young.) Included in the email exchange with CIR was a copy of the SEPTA's 2015 Advertising Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Following SEPTA's rejection of the ad, Victoria Baranetsky, Esq., General Counsel for CIR, exchanged letters with SEPTA's General Counsel, Gino Benedetti Esq., regarding the stated reason for the rejection. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 16-19.) Benedetti explained that SEPTA adopted the 2015 Advertising Standards after previous litigation involving SEPTA's advertising policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Freedom Defense Initiative v. SEPTA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331948\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/314/\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 2015) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   \") (Goldberg, J.). Benedetti stated that SEPTA rejected CIR's proposed advertisement \"under Standards 9(b)(iv)(a) and (b)\" of the 2015 Advertising Standards. (Trial Ex. 17.) These standards read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Prohibited Advertising Content.\n   </em>\n   Advertising is prohibited on transit facilities, products and vehicles if it or its content falls into one or more of the following categories-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (a) Advertisements promoting or opposing a political party, or promoting or opposing the election of any candidate or group of candidates for federal, state, judicial or local government offices are prohibited. In addition, advertisements that are political in nature or contain political messages, including advertisements involving political or judicial figures and/or advertisements involving an issue that is political in nature in that it directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (b) Advertisements expressing or advocating an opinion, position or viewpoint on matters of public debate about economic, political, religious, historical or social issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Trial Ex. 22, at \u00b6\u00b6 II(A)(9)(b)(i)-(ii).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The second sentence of subparagraph (a) and subparagraph (b) are collectively referred to as the \"Challenged Provisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2015 Advertising Standards also include language stating that SEPTA has the \"express intention ... that property\n   allocated for advertising be a non-public forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II(A)(9)(b)(ii).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Revised Advertisement and Second Rejection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Benedetti presented testimony as to his objection to two panels which he stated were of \"particular concern,\"-one showing \"a white hand handing keys and stick of dynamite to a black hand,\" and one that displayed \"African-Americans holding signs protesting ... and a white guy not part of the protest.\" (Trial Ex. 111, Benedetti Dep. at 156:9-158:3.) CIR proposed a revised advertisement which removed these panels, but SEPTA again rejected that advertisement as being \"barred by the same advertising standards as the first.\" (ECF 32, SEPTA Opp'n to CIR Mot. for Inj. Ex. A, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   CIR's May 1, 2018 complaint asserts a single cause of action for a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. (Compl. at 12.) The Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys' fees, and any other relief that the Court deems proper. SEPTA answered the Complaint on June 5, 2018. (ECF 10, Answer.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On August 17, 2018, CIR moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin SEPTA from administering its 2015 Advertising Standards. (ECF 20, \"Mot. for Prelim. Inj.\") SEPTA opposed that motion on August 31, 2018 (ECF 21, SEPTA Opp'n; ECF 23, \"SEPTA Am. Opp'n\"), and CIR replied in support on September 10, 2018 (ECF 24, \"SEPTA Rep.\"). This Court held a hearing on the motion on September 14, 2018, and ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing, with which they complied on September 21, 2018. (ECF 26, 27, 31, 32.) Also on September 14, 2018, while continuing to take the motion for preliminary injunction under advisement, the Court scheduled a final hearing/trial on the merits of CIR's case for October 1, 2018. (ECF 26.) Then, on September 25, 2018, upon consideration of the hearing transcript and all briefing, this Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction without prejudice. (ECF 33, \"Sept. 25, 2018 Prelim. Inj. Op.\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 34, \"Sept. 25, 2018 Prelim. Inj. Order.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   A bench trial took place as scheduled on October 1, 2018 (ECF 39). The trial involved the testimony of just one witness-Mr. Gino Benedetti, General Counsel for SEPTA. By stipulation, SEPTA first questioned Benedetti on direct, followed by cross-examination from counsel for CIR. The parties also submitted stipulations regarding evidence and certain factual matters. (ECF 37). The Court then called for post-trial briefing and sent a letter to all counsel on October 3, 2018, with specific questions for the parties to address. CIR's brief, which included proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and answers to the Court's specific questions, was submitted on October 8, 2018. (ECF 44, \"CIR Post-Trial Br.\") SEPTA responded in opposition with its own proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as its own responses to the Court's specific questions on October 15, 2018. (ECF 47, \"SEPTA Post-Trial Br.\"; ECF 48, Notice of Errata.) CIR replied on October 22, 2018 (ECF 49), and SEPTA filed a Sur-Reply on October 29, 2018 (ECF 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court held post-trial oral argument on November 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preliminary Injunction Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   CIR presented evidence in support of its motion for preliminary injunction, including deposition testimony from Benedetti and Baranetsky. These transcripts were summarized in this Court's September 25, 2018 Memorandum Opinion denying that motion, which we incorporate by reference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 25, 2018 Prelim. Inj. Op.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Benedetti's Trial Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Benedetti testified that he has responsibilities including \"working with counsel and my client in adopting the amendment to the standards\" and \"making the final decision about whether or not a proposed ad satisfies our standards.\" (10/01/18 Trial Tr., at 42:2; 43:4-9) (hereinafter \"Trial Tr.\") Benedetti testified that his job responsibilities are not \"related to revenue maximization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Benedetti testified that SEPTA has contracted with Intersection (formerly Titan) to solicit advertising for SEPTA vehicles both through the SEPTA website and the work of local and national salespeople. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:6-16.) Benedetti stated that Intersection sells advertisements for all of SEPTA rails, buses, and trolleys, and that the same advertising standards apply to advertising space on each vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:16-51:20; 65:19-67:6.) Benedetti confirmed that in total, SEPTA advertises on the interior and exterior of over 2,500 vehicles and 200-plus stations and facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:7-9.) SEPTA has a $1.2 billion operating budget, and advertising revenue is \"a very small piece of our revenue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   52:2-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Benedetti testified about what he thought was the purpose of the advertising space. When asked about the advertisement revenue, Benedetti testified that \"we certainly consider this to be a source of revenue, not at the expense of happy customers and safe customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:6-8.) According to Benedetti, an advertiser could \"specify where he or she would like the ads\" but that \"[m]echanically, I don't know how that actually happens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:20-22.) On cross examination, Benedetti stated that the advertisements \"are really designed to fit-we want them to fit within the standards and it's our belief that that will keep our riders safe, happy and not detract from our core mission of moving them around safely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:24-69:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Impact of AFDI Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Benedetti testified that SEPTA amended its standards after it was sued by AFDI in 2014, and that the SEPTA board approved the standards in October 2014 and revised them again after the\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   decision with a unanimous vote in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:10-15; 26:2-6.) These amendments, he said, were made in response to the \"public outcry\" from the AFDI advertisement that \"had reporters swarming SEPTA, it had our employees concerned. We had our customers concerned. So really wanted to avoid that kind of situation where we had-you know, to run that kind of ad on our system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:24-47:9.) Benedetti additionally testified that there was vandalism on buses that ran the AFDI ad, and that SEPTA had \"bus operators who were unwilling to operate the busses on which the ads were placed and so we honored their objections and then had to put someone else on those routes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:18-48:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In revising the advertisements, Benedetti engaged the help of counsel and \"reviewed the cases, reviewed memorandum from [counsel], reviewed standards that other authorities... had used, discussed them with the board, discussed them with the senior executive of SEPTA and came up with what now is embodied in\" the 2015 Amendments to the standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:9-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Benedetti stated that SEPTA wanted to \"make sure that the experience of the customer and the experience of the employee, our core mission-you know, safe efficient travel for the public, was maintained and protected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:14-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    2. SEPTA's Application of Standards, Including the Challenged Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   When asked about whether SEPTA considered including the word \"commercial\" in its advertising standards, Benedetti stated at trial, \"I really don't have a recollection of having that specific conversation with the client,\" but also noted that he was \"certain that I debated that with our counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:24-25, 103:1-2.) He testified that he did not think that they considered using the term \"public service\" in the revised standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:18-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Benedetti stated that SEPTA has multiple \"different lines of defense\" when reviewing proposed advertisements for compliance with the 2015 Advertising Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Benedetti explained that the first \"line of defense\" is through Intersection alerting him to a potentially violative advertisement. Benedetti had \"discussions with Intersection about what we think are things that would violate the standard so that they would have enough information to inform me of an ad that, you know, could violate the standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:18-21; 54:3-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Benedetti stated that the second \"line of defense\" involves the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   SEPTA advertising personnel-actual SEPTA employees, Mr. Jim Dellipriscoli being the primary one-who sees all the ads that before they go on the bus, after they go on the bus, and I've had conversations with him about what are the kind of things he needs to look out for to be able to bring to my attention so I can make a judgement about them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:22-53:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Once Benedetti has been alerted about a proposed advertisement that potentially violates the 2015 Advertising Standards, Benedetti testified that he follows the following process.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Well, the first thing I do is I look at the ad and I would-depending on the nature of the ad, I may get counsel involved. I also more recently-very recently actually would confide with one of my colleagues, Billy Smith, who's one of the lawyers that works in my office.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:10-25.) Benedetti also testified that he may look back at previous decisions about similar advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:22-24.) Benedetti stated that he uses common sense, and that his common-sense determination is based upon his life experiences, legal training, and \"discussions with other people about their opinions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:11-21.) He said that he does not consider \"the identity of the proposed advertiser, except to the extent that I would visit the advertiser's website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   When asked about prior application of the 2015 Advertising Standards, Benedetti stated that he had a \"shift of some sorts on\n   the public service ads because of some confusion I had about Judge Goldberg's ruling\" on the issue of whether public service ads were considered political speech. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:12-14, 21-23.) He stated that now he does not \"consider them to be automatically political speech. I just judge them against the standard like other ads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71:2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   When asked how many proposed advertisements SEPTA has rejected since the 2015 Advertising Standards took effect, Benedetti stated it had rejected \"not many.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:25-56:2.) Benedetti stated that he has sought advice from counsel regarding a potential advertisement \"maybe a half a dozen times\" in a year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:15-17.) He does not routinely offer the opportunity for a rejected advertiser to revise a rejected advertisement, but that it has happened \"a couple of times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:25-105:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Benedetti testified that the process he went through when reviewing the CIR ad under the Advertising Standards was that he first \"tried to understand the ad,\" then he \"went to CIR's website and I learned more about what the ad was about, what CIR was about, and what it was trying to accomplish with the ad,\" and then he did \"a more general search beyond CIR's website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:22-119:6.) While doing this \"more general search,\" Benedetti stated that he found an article from the American Bankers Association (\"ABA\"), an editorial in the New York Times, lawsuits and settlements about discriminatory lending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:7-12.) He stated that he found the ABA article \"important ... because it criticized the research upon which the ad CIR proposed was based,\" and determined that there was a \"real live debate\" between CIR and the ABA about discriminatory lending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:13-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Interpretation of the Challenged Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   With regard to Subsection (a) of the 2015 Advertising Standards, Benedetti testified that the words \"political\" and \"political in nature\" are \"essentially the same to me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:5-8.) Benedetti explained that the phrase \"an issue is political in nature in that it directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of the government entity\" is not separate from the phrase \"political in nature,\" but \"further defines or connects with what's political in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:11-18.) On cross examination, he stated that these two phrases have different meanings, and that it is possible for an ad to \"violate this provision without implicating directly or indirectly the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:15-88:3.) When asked if the word \" 'implicate' means advocates for or calls for,\" he answered that \"it could mean either.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88:13-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Regarding Subsection (b), Benedetti testified that a determination of whether something is within the prohibition on \"matters of public debate\" is \"kind of a mechanical type of analysis that we do. We look to see what is being argued, debated in society in general.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:19-22.) Benedetti stated that this evaluation involves \"the entire ad and then we also look at holistically about what is the subject matter of that ad being debated in society at large.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:1-4.) Benedetti stated that finding information online about a debate is \"not necessarily\" enough to make it a public debate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:22-24.) When asked about the difference between issues of public and private debate, he stated that he uses \"common sense and [I] have the discussion and have the conversations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:20-21.) Benedetti did clarify that a \"dispute about which football team you\n   prefer is not a matter of public debate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:13-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Benedetti testified that \"sometimes\" ads that violate Subsection (b) \"could be controversial ads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:13-15.) He also stated that an ad can involve politics but not violate the Challenged Provisions, such as with the \"Welcome, DNC\" ads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:13-17; Trial Ex. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Digital Displays/News Feeds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   There was extensive testimony that certain SEPTA vehicles now have the ability to display \"digital\" material, either advertisements or \"news feeds,\" which was sometimes referred to as \"infotainment\" digital displays on SEPTA vehicles. The news feeds were displayed on the digital displays through an agreement between Intersection and Screenfeed, a company that curates information from Reuters and the Associated Press. (Benedetti Dep. at 30:15-31:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The \"infotainment\" digital displays on SEPTA vehicles, Benedetti testified that he knew the spaces were to display advertisements and route information, but that his office was \"not involved in ... reviewing or being informed about the news feeds being pushed through the-digital displays.\" (Trial Tr. at 62:5-16.) He stated that the news feeds were brought to his attention through this case, and that \"I was initially of the understanding that the news feeds were there because they added value to the ads and I thought dollars and cents value so that an ad on a digital display would cost more ... than an ad on a panel on a bus.... I learned that that's not true.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:12-19.) He concluded that SEPTA has \"eliminated all the feeds at this point\" when he \"learned that there really wasn't any value being added in terms of the cost of the-the ads themselves.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:5, 12-20.) On cross examination, Benedetti admitted that the content in a news feeds \"could be\" \"compatible with the forum being closed to political speech and speech on matters of public debate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:20-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Regarding the news feeds on the digital \"infotainment\" displays, Benedetti noted during his deposition that SEPTA has not given any \"guidance or requirements regarding the content of the news items that Intersection allows to be posted on the infotainment systems.\" (Benedetti Dep. at 32:18-22.) He also stated that neither Screenfeed nor Intersection can \"determine what sorts of news to put out on the infotainment system\" and that he did not know if Intersection reviewed the news. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:23-32:8.) During trial, after stating that he did not know whether SEPTA \"had the option to pre-review or remove certain headlines that would run in the newsfeeds,\" Plaintiff's counsel presented him with a screenshot from the Screenfeed website permitting review of certain news items. (Trial Tr. at 79:15-80:19; Trial Ex. 110.) Benedetti stated that SEPTA had asked Intersection to look for the contract between itself and Screenfeed but that Intersection was not able to locate it. (Trial Tr. at 79:15-80:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Asserted Inconsistencies in Benedetti's Testimony and Other Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   One of CIR's principal arguments is that Benedetti's testimony was contradictory on some points and inconsistent with other evidence in the case. The Court agrees that Benedetti's testimony was not clear or totally consistent on a few issues. First, Benedetti seems to walk back his answer regarding the reasons for SEPTA's practice of leasing its advertising space. During his deposition, Benedetti stated that SEPTA's purpose for leasing space to advertisers was \"[t]o raise revenue independent of the fare box and taxpayer subsidies and to do so in a manner that provides for safety, efficiency and comfort of our passengers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (Benedetti Dep. at 17:5-10.) During trial, however, he notes that \"[r]evenue was a consideration\" but states that this was \"only in so much as this is a small percentage of the money that we raise, aside from the fare box and the taxpayer subsidies, but that revenue-and I think the standard states this-that was going to be balanced against the customer's experience.\" (Trial Tr. at 48:23-49:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Regarding the process by which SEPTA reviews proposed advertisements, when asked if SEPTA had \"come to any clarification with Intersection regarding how the term political is to be interpreted for the purposes of Subsection (a),\" Benedetti responded, \"We purposely don't do that because we want to evaluate each proposed ad against the standards and then engage in the process we engage in to determine whether or not it matches our standards or doesn't.\" (Benedetti Dep. at 69:3-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   During trial, Benedetti stated that Baranetsky conceded that the advertisement was political in a letter she wrote to SEPTA. (Trial Tr. at 119:23-120:7.) In that March 21, 2018 letter, Baranetsky stated, \"CIR's animation including facts and statistics on a political issue is protected speech.\" (Trial Ex. 16, at 2.) Baranetsky asserted that her March 21, 2018 letter was not an admission that the CIR ad falls within the prohibition on political advertisements. (Trial Ex. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   CIR focuses much of its criticism of SEPTA's policies, and Benedetti's practices, on the issue of what may be \"political.\" Although CIR has made clear that it did not object to the first sentence of Subsection (a) of the Challenged Provisions, relating to advertisements about political parties or political candidates, CIR asserts that in some ads SEPTA ignores that prohibition. CIR also objects strongly to the second sentence of Subsection (a), which has further examples of political content. On one hand, Benedetti fails to see certain advertisements as political or touching on public debate when they are for a commercial service. For example, the ad by the advertiser Fusion depicted people of color and displayed the words, \"As American Ads.\" (Trial Ex. 34.) The ad featured an image of an African American child wearing a shirt that said, \"My Life Matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When discussing this ad, Benedetti testified, \"I thought this was an ad promoting services of the sponsor of the ad, which was a television producer or network, I forget which.\" (Trial Tr. at 92:25-94:21.) He stated that he did not think that this ad was \"a message about two things being equally American,\" or \"implicat[ing] any matters of public debate on social issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On the other hand, however, Benedetti did not always draw clear distinctions about certain issues of public debate when the advertisement covered a commercial venture. For example, during trial the undersigned asked Benedetti about a hypothetical advertisement that \"didn't say anything about for or against [the Philadelphia soda tax'], but... let's say this was the Norristown local, which went to Montgomery County, all right? So suppose the ad said, do you know you can buy Pepsi Cola cheaper in Norristown than in Philadelphia?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:21-114:2.) Benedetti responded, \"I think that could still be a problem under sub-standard (a) or (b), because-particularly (b) because the notion of the soda tax and everything that surrounds it is being debated in the public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:6-9.) Despite Benedetti's testimony that he gives commercial advertisements the same treatment as non-commercial advertisements, and the fact that the 2015 Advertising Standards do not draw this commercial/non-commercial distinction, Benedetti apparently considers the\n   commercial nature of certain advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Benedetti also could not provide clear testimony about the definition of \"political in nature\" under Subsection (a). During his deposition, when Plaintiff's counsel asked Benedetti, \"Simply involving a political issue is not in itself dispositive of whether something violates Substandard (a) or not?\" he responded, \"It's hard for me to abstractly give you an answer to a question like that.\" (Benedetti Dep. at 116:15-20.) When asked if \"mentioning a law or regulation [is] political,\" he responded, \"I don't know. Could be. Could not be.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116:21-23.) At trial, Benedetti stated that an advertisement could be \"political in nature\" and thus violate the 2015 Advertising Standards without \"directly or indirectly implicating the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity.\" (Trial Tr. at 86:24-87:2, 24-88:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other Exhibits and Depositions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   CIR submitted exhibits in support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and supplemented those exhibits at trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 20.) Among the 114 trial exhibits are deposition transcripts, articles about CIR's research, comparator advertisements. The Court reviews the exhibits briefly below and considers them in our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The first set of exhibits can be categorized as CIR's financial information and information related to its report on disparate lending. (Trial Exs. 2-5, 7-9, 11-15, 81, 82.) These documents include, among other things, a summary of the CIR report that was the basis of the contested advertisement. (Trial Ex. 4.) This document stated the findings of the CIR report as being in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   We found 61 metro areas out of 409 where applicants of color were more likely to be denied a conventional home purchase mortgage, even after controlling for nine economic and social factors, including the applicants income, the amount of the loan and the neighborhood where they wanted to buy property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Among the exhibits are emails between CIR representatives and Roche from Intersection. (Trial Exs. 10, 30, 83.) There are also letters that followed SEPTA's rejection of the CIR ad, including one from Baranetsky to Roche (Trial Ex. 16), from Benedetti to Baranetsky (Trial Ex. 17), and from Baranetsky to Benedetti (Trial Ex. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The record contains documents that pertain to SEPTA's policies-including its prior advertising standards (Trial Ex. 23), its 2015 revised advertising standards (Ex. 22), and a screenshot of portion of SEPTA's website entitled \"advertising opportunities.\" (Trial Ex. 21.) News articles are also included in the record; there are articles about the new fleet of SEPTA hybrid-electric buses (Trial Ex. 26), the upcoming SEPTA video kiosks at bus shelters (Trial Ex. 27), and the fact that SEPTA is to make at least $150 million under their contract with Intersection (Trial Ex. 80). There are also pictures of video \"infotainment\" systems on the regional rail line (Trial Ex. 28), as well as a screenshot from the Screenfeed website addressing \"Options to moderate your feeds.\" (Trial Ex. 110.) Information about SEPTA's advertising billing, revenue, and spending is also in the record. (Trial Exs. 67-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The record additionally contains deposition transcripts from Benedetti (Trial Ex. 111), Baranetsky (Trial Ex. 115), and Thomas Kelly, SEPTA's Director of Sales.

Pa. 2010) (Baylson, J.). CIR contends that a First Amendment challenge to a law that vests\n   officials with unbridled discretion to censor speech may be brought as a facial challenge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CIR Post-Trial Br., at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   According to CIR, the Supreme Court recently placed the question of whether a restriction confers unbridled discretion on a governmental decisionmaker under the umbrella of a First Amendment reasonableness analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28) (citing\n   <em>\n    Mansky )\n   </em>\n   . Like the restrictions that were found to be too \"expansive\" in\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , CIR argues that the Challenged Provisions are equally, if not more, unconstitutionally vague. (CIR Post-Trial Br., at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   CIR also argues that, to the extent SEPTA relies on the government-speech doctrine to shield other agencies' advertisements from this Court's analysis, that doctrine should not apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Challenged Provisions are Not Viewpoint Neutral on their Face or As Applied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   CIR next contends that the Challenged Provisions are viewpoint discriminatory on their face and as applied to CIR's proposed advertisement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) To support its argument, CIR compares bank advertisements previously displayed by SEPTA whereby the banks purport to be \"equal housing lender[s]\" with its own ad reporting on discriminatory lending practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) To allow the bank ads while rejecting CIR's ad is an exercise of viewpoint discrimination, CIR asserts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   CIR also explains that, in practice, SEPTA interprets its 2015 Advertising Standards to prohibit ads that ask for changes to governmental policies, and simultaneously to allow ads promoting governmental policies and programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Finally, CIR argues that SEPTA's inclusion of the phrase \"matters of public debate\" in the 2015 Advertising Standards is\n   <em>\n    facially\n   </em>\n   viewpoint discriminatory because the phrase is indistinguishable from a ban on controversial speech. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) CIR cites various cases that have held that restrictions on \"controversial\" speech are akin to viewpoint discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Likening the word \"controversy\" to SEPTA's phrase \"a matter of public debate,\" CIR contends the restriction is facially viewpoint discriminatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Standards are Not \"Reasonable\" in Light of the Purpose of the Forum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   CIR contends that even if this Court finds SEPTA's advertising space to be a non-public forum, the 2015 Advertising Standards do not satisfy the requirements of the First Amendment. To pass Constitutional muster, CIR argues that SEPTA has not met its burden of showing that its standards are reasonable in light of the purpose of the advertising space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.) SEPTA explained at trial that the purpose of its advertising space is to generate revenue, and CIR avers that there is no evidence that the 2015 Advertising Standards were intended to advance that goal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39.) According to CIR, the standards would actually serve to reduce advertising revenue if they were enforced as written. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) To the extent SEPTA has offered \"rider comfort\" as a purpose of the advertising space, CIR argues that the standards are not clearly tied to that purpose when SEPTA regularly exposes riders to political speech and matters of public debate through the newsfeeds on its infotainment systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) Moreover, CIR argues that SEPTA does nothing to shield riders from political/public-debate content outside of its advertising spaces. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    4. SEPTA's Advertising Space is a Designated Public Forum, and the 2015 Advertising Standards Do Not Satisfy Strict Scrutiny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Finally, although CIR conceded during the preliminary injunction proceedings\n   that SEPTA had a limited public forum, it withdrew that agreement for purposes of the trial. CIR argues that SEPTA's advertising space is a designated public forum such that this Court should review the 2015 Advertising Standards under the rigors of strict scrutiny. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) SEPTA's advertising space has been deemed such a designated public forum in two prior judicial decisions. CIR argues that there is not enough evidence in the record to conclude that SEPTA has successfully closed its forum since those decisions were made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In a designated public forum, all restrictions on speech must survive strict scrutiny. In such a case, SEPTA would have the burden of proving that its restrictions are \"narrowly tailored\" to a compelling government interest that SEPTA could not achieve through less restrictive means. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) CIR points out that SEPTA has not attempted to justify the 2015 Advertising Standards under strict scrutiny, and thus has not met its burden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SEPTA's Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Advertising Space on Buses is a Non-Public Forum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   SEPTA contends that the relevant forum is the advertising space on SEPTA buses because that is the property to which CIR seeks access for its advertisement. (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 25.) That forum, according to SEPTA, is a non-public forum because the 2015 Advertising Standards expressly state that SEPTA intended the advertising space to be a non-public forum, and since enacting these Standards, SEPTA has \"operat[ed] such venue as a non-public forum requiring potential advertisers to adhere to SEPTA's Advertising Standards and [has] policed those standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) In other words, SEPTA's policy and practices reflect its intention to close the forum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4099284\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/723/766/#p803\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Advertising Standards are Reasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Next, SEPTA contends that the restrictions in the Advertising Standards are reasonable, and that SEPTA has reasonably applied the Standards, as required in a non-public forum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   First, SEPTA argues that it was within its rights and reasonable to revise its advertising policy and close the forum in light of its legitimate interest in increasing ridership by refraining from offending customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   SEPTA also refutes CIR's contention that the Advertising Standards serve no purpose because riders are exposed to newsfeeds on SEPTA buses, arguing that newsfeeds do not violate its Standards because there is a difference between \"hard news\" and prohibited political and issue advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Second, SEPTA contends that it has reasonably and consistently applied the Advertising Standards, explaining why it was reasonable to accept other ads that\n   CIR contends were \"political\" and concerned \"matters of public debate,\" including the Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Center ads and the ads about the 2016 DNC in Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   With respect to the DNC advertisements, unlike SEPTA's Opposition to CIR's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, SEPTA's Post-Trial Brief concedes that SEPTA made an incorrect determination in allowing one of the ads about the DNC in Philadelphia-the ad proposed by a union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although SEPTA's Opposition to CIR's Motion for Preliminary Injunction acknowledged that the DNC was \"political,\" SEPTA argued that it was reasonable to allow all of the DNC ads. (SEPTA Am. Opp'n, at 31-33.) There, SEPTA contended that the DNC ads did not constitute political advocacy, but rather welcomed visitors to Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SEPTA reasoned that just because the DNC ads \"touch[ed] on politics or a political issue\" did not render them \"political in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   SEPTA goes one step further in its Post-Trial Brief and concedes that it made an incorrect determination in allowing the union ad supporting DNC. (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 32.) However, SEPTA argues that its mistake in this \"close case\" does not render the Advertising Standards' policy on \"political\" advertisements unconstitutional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SEPTA distinguishes the DNC union ad from CIR's ad, arguing that the CIR ad did not present such a close case because CIR's ad would violate \"any reasonable interpretation\" of Subsections (a) or (b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   SEPTA also contends that the Challenged Provisions are not unconstitutionally vague because they are reasonable and do not allow for arbitrary enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 33.) In particular, SEPTA argues that the reference to \"political\" ads in Section 9(a) of the Advertising Standards does not render the Standards unconstitutionally vague, citing to the Second Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31) (citing\n   <em>\n    Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.

(SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 33.) SEPTA contrasts Subsection (b) with a transit authority advertising policy prohibiting \"controversial\" ads, which the Sixth Circuit held to be unconstitutional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am. Freedom Def. Initiative v. Suburban Mobility Auth. for Reg'l Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629242\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/885/#p894\">\n    698 F.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (6th Cir. 2012) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    SMART\n   </em>\n   \") ). According to SEPTA, because\n   its Advertising Standards do not expressly prohibit \"controversial ads,\" but instead ban ads on specific topics, not necessarily because they are controversial topics, the Standards are not unconstitutionally vague. (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Advertising Standards are Viewpoint Neutral\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   SEPTA contends that its Advertising Standards are viewpoint neutral both on their face and as applied in rejecting CIR's proposed ad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   First, SEPTA argues that its Standards are viewpoint neutral on their face because even if they \"incidentally prevent[ ] certain viewpoints from being heard in the course of suppressing certain general topics of speech,\" it is not \"[SEPTA's] intent to intervene in a way that prefers one particular viewpoint in speech over other perspectives on the same topic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am. Freedom Def. Initiative v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076496\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/571/#p582\">\n    781 F.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (1st Cir. 2015) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    MBTA\n   </em>\n   \") ). In other words, the Advertising Standards are viewpoint neutral because they restrict\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   viewpoints on \"matters of public debate,\" not\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   viewpoints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Second, SEPTA contends that it reasonably applied its Advertising Standards in refusing to run CIR's proposed ad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SEPTA specifically refutes CIR's contention that by approving ads of \"equal housing lender\" banks, while rejecting CIR's ad on the same topic of \"discriminatory lending,\" SEPTA engaged in viewpoint discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35; CIR Post-Trial Br. at 35.) SEPTA contends that it was reasonable for SEPTA to conclude that ads from \"equal housing lender\" banks did not pertain to the same topic as CIR's ad-discriminatory lending-because the bank ads did not acknowledge a debate or present data on discriminatory lending, nor did they address the disposition of loan applications by race, neighborhood, or otherwise. (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 35-36.) Further, the fact that the bank ads indicated that the banks were \"equal housing lenders\" did not mean that the ads took a position on discriminatory lending; rather, banks are required by law to indicate in their ads that they award loans on a non-discriminatory basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35) (citing Nondiscriminatory advertising,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20338.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) ). SEPTA also distinguishes the bank ads from CIR's proposed ads by alleging that the bank ads \"look forward, not back. The ads are designed to foster future borrowing; they do not address lending practices.\" (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 36.) In SEPTA's Opposition to CIR's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, SEPTA added that CIR's ad and the bank ads do not represent opposite views on discriminatory lending because CIR's ad is based on aggregate data, not on the lending activity of any particular bank. (SEPTA Am. Opp'n, at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   1. SEPTA leases space for conventional print advertising on the exterior and/or interior of many of the Authority's over 2,500 vehicles (including buses, trolleys,\n   and trains) and in more than 200 stations and facilities. (Benedetti Dep. at 15:21-16:6, 18:6-10; Trial Ex. 21; Trial Tr. at 67:7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   2. SEPTA leases its advertising space to generate revenue, but this purpose has been consistently balanced with SEPTA's \"core mission\" of transporting passengers safely, efficiently, and comfortably. (Benedetti Dep. at 17:5-10; Trial Tr. at 49:4-8, 67:18-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   3. According to SEPTA's website, it provides \"various ways for advertisers to effectively communicate with the approximately 1 million commuters that ride SEPTA each day.\" (Trial Ex. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   4. SEPTA contracts with Intersection, (formerly Titan Outdoor LLC), an independent, non-governmental entity, to sell advertising space on SEPTA vehicles and in SEPTA stations on SEPTA's behalf. (Benedetti Dep. at 20:13-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   5. Generally, at some times, some of SEPTA's advertisement space is empty or not leased. (Kelly Dep. at 15:20-16:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   6. SEPTA applies the same advertising standards (the 2015 Advertising Standards) to all of its advertising spaces in and on all SEPTA vehicles and facilities. (Trial Tr. at 65:19-23.) However, the only request for advertising in this case was made for bus advertising. SEPTA agrees that the same SEPTA standards would apply to advertisements inside subway and trolley cars. This Court finds that the other advertising spaces, such as the exterior of a bus or other transit vehicles, stations, platforms, or bus shelters may raise other issues and are outside of the scope of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   7. Any person or group may seek to advertise on SEPTA's advertising spaces, and SEPTA accepts both commercial and non-commercial advertisements.

The Advertising Standards, which are contained in the contract between SEPTA and Intersection, currently list twenty-two categories of prohibited advertisements.

The Advertising Standards do not have any separate rules that define or apply to \"public service ads.\" If SEPTA receives a proposal for a PSA, it reviews that advertisement against the same advertising standards as all other advertisements. (Trial Tr. at 64:21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   10. If any aspect of a proposed advertisement violates the Advertising Standards, SEPTA's policy is to reject the advertisement. (Trial Tr. at 58:7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   11. There are fifteen members of SEPTA's board. (Benedetti Dep. at 45:16-18.) Two members are appointed from each of the five counties in Pennsylvania that SEPTA serves: Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware. The Philadelphia representative is appointed by the Mayor and approved by the City Council, and the Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware County representatives are appointed by County Commissioners. The House of Representatives minority and majority party each appoint one member. The Governor appoints the final member. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:18-46:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   12. Of SEPTA's current operating budget of $1.2 billion, approximately half is made up of revenue generating by passenger fares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:2-5.) SEPTA generates between $12 and $15 million in net revenue from advertisements annually, with approximately $5.2 million from advertisements on buses. (Exs. 68, 69; 11/01/18 Tr. at 6:16-21; 7:12-15; 8:11-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SEPTA'S Response to\n    <em>\n     AFDI\n    </em>\n    Ad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   13. SEPTA adopted the Advertising Standards in May 2015, following Judge\n   Goldberg's decision in\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   , which declared that SEPTA's advertising spaces were a designated public forum and ordered SEPTA to allow AFDI's anti-Islamic advertisement to run on SEPTA's buses.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331948\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/314/\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   14. In its 2015 amendment, SEPTA added language that stated that the express purpose of the Advertising Standards was \"to accept such forms of advertising as will enhance the generation of revenues to support its transit operations without adversely affecting the patronage of passengers.\" (Trial Ex. 22, at \u00b6 (II)(A)(9)(b)(ii).) The amendment further stated that \"SEPTA will retain strict control over the nature of the advertisements accepted for posting on or in its transit facilities, products, and vehicles and will maintain its advertising space strictly as a non-public forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the amendment added new categories of prohibited content, including the Challenged Provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   15. By adding the new language, SEPTA intended to turn its advertising spaces into a nonpublic forum, subject to lesser judicial scrutiny, so that it could avoid having to run controversial advertisements like AFDI's that might prompt a negative response from riders, employees, or the media. (Benedetti Dep. at 54:12-55:13 (When asked whether SEPTA analyzed the impact of the proposed 2015 Advertising Standards on riders' experiences, Benedetti answered, \"I mean, we were adopting the standards to improve our riders' experience.\") (Benedetti Dep. 54:16-18; Trial Tr. 68:24-69:3 (\"[W]e want [ads] to fit within the standards and it's our belief that that will keep our riders safe, happy and not detract from our core mission of moving them around safely\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:8-11 (The 2015 Advertising Standards represent an attempt to balance SEPTA's \"revenue-generating goals for the ad space against the customer experience\") ); (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Benedetti Dep. at 58:2-59:2; Trial Tr. at 45:6-15, 46:23-47:17, 68:1-3, 69:12-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   16. This Court finds that SEPTA made a specific effort following the decision in\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   to promulgate standards/policies/regulations that would qualify the advertising space on the interior of its transit vehicles, including subways, buses, and railroad cars as a non-public forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   17. The record supports a finding that SEPTA has been successful in closing the forum and that these advertising spaces are uniquely but correctly designated as non-public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   18. Although CIR has submitted proposed findings on fact on \"SEPTA's digital displays,\" (CIR Post-Trial Br., at 6-7), the Court finds that SEPTA has effectively terminated the news feeds on those digital displays and therefore there is no issue for the Court to decide concerning this form of media in SEPTA buses. Digital displays remain showing advertisements and route information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   19. The Court credits SEPTA's contentions, as supported by the record, that it wants its transit spaces, in buses and subways, to be welcoming and comfortable for passengers. The Court finds that SEPTA has good and credible reasons to believe that advertisements that state any viewpoint on topics that involve economic, political, religious, historical, or social issues may deter a significant subset of passengers from using SEPTA transit facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   20. Benedetti's testimony that buses that ran the AFDI ad were the subject of vandalism, that \"bus operators ... were unwilling to operate the busses on which the ads were placed and so we honored their objections and then had to put someone else on those routes,\" and that there were \"reporters calling about reactions\" \"[n]early every day during the course of\n   litigation\" and upon the issuance of Judge Goldberg's decision, is credible. (Trial Tr. at 47:18-20, 48:6-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   21. The concerns expressed by SEPTA executives on these points, based upon their experiences with driver, rider, and public reactions to the AFDI ad, are credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   22. In order to test the effectiveness of the advertisements that would arguably be offensive to a certain subset of transit riders, SEPTA would have to actually run those advertisements in a transit space over a significant period of time to determine if ridership declined. SEPTA did not conduct such an analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kelly Dep. at 8:19-9:3.) SEPTA's AFDI experience is very probative to the Court's finding that SEPTA had good, rational, and reasonable reasons for its bus advertisement space to become a non-public forum, and to help insure that such experience was not repeated. These reasons, resulting in the Challenged Provisions, were reasonable and based on SEPTA's empirical experience. Under the circumstances, it was not necessary for SEPTA to conduct any specific new tests or experiments and doing so would have been very expensive and of doubtful probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   23. SEPTA accepts ads in general to help its revenue generation, but its advertising revenue is a small portion of its revenue. SEPTA has not submitted any empirical evidence that accepting ads that tend to be more controversial would directly impact its \"fare box\" revenue, but the Court finds SEPTA's concerns about accepting such ads to be credible. And based on its AFDI experience, SEPTA, with its expertise in transit matters, is entitled to substantial discretion in how it runs its business, including what ads it will accept or reject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    C. SEPTA's Process for Reviewing Proposed Advertising\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   24. All advertisements running on SEPTA's advertising spaces are reviewed by Intersection and at least one SEPTA employee, usually Jim Dellispriscoli. (Benedetti Dep. at 60:5-61:5, 64:13-17.) The Advertising Standards themselves state, \"All such advertising shall be submitted to SEPTA for review and written approval prior to display.\" (Trial Ex. 22, at \u00b6 11(A)(9)(a).) If Intersection deems an advertisement acceptable, the advertisement is relayed to at least one SEPTA employee through a copy receipt. Among other tasks, the SEPTA employee is supposed to ensure that the advertisement does not violate the Advertising Standards. (Benedetti Dep. at 63:24-65:3, 168:12-170:5.) Advertisements that Intersection deems compliant, and that are not rejected or removed by SEPTA's employee, run in SEPTA's advertising spaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   25. When Intersection receives a proposed advertisement that it believes may violate the Advertising Standards, it must alert SEPTA's advertising department for review and approval. (Trial Ex. Ex. 22, at \u00b6 II(A)(9)(a).) Advertisements that Intersection and the reviewing SEPTA employee believe fall in a \"gray area\" and may not comply with the Advertising Standards are elevated to SEPTA's General Counsel, Benedetti, for further review. (Benedetti Dep. at 168:12-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   26. Benedetti is generally the final arbiter regarding whether an advertisement complies with SEPTA's Advertising Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:17-21; Trial Tr. at 81:2-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   27. The Advertising Standards are the only written guidance SEPTA has published about what advertising content is or is not acceptable. Benedetti testified that \"everything related to our measuring whether or not a particular ad meets or doesn't meet the standards and our review\n   of those ads is - comes from [the Advertising Standards].\" (Benedetti Dep. at 66:19-22.) And, \"the only standard that SEPTA has in writing about what constitutes an ad that is political or not is in [the Advertising Standards].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116:2-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   28. The Advertising Standards are not available on SEPTA's website, and SEPTA does not offer the public any written guidance about how to determine whether or not an advertisement involves a \"political issue\" or a \"matter[ ] of public debate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:17-116:6; Trial Tr. 81:6-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   29. Benedetti credibly described his own personal process for determining whether a proposed advertisement elevated to his level of review violates the Challenged Provisions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   Q. How do you go about determining whether something is subject to debate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   A. That's a good question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   What I do, generally speaking, is I look at the ad first, and I just kind of absorb it, for lack of a better word. I think about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   And then I go on the internet and I Google various phrases about, you know, what the advertisement is projecting, what message it is, and I see what comes up, and I see if there's a meaningful debate about the issue that the advertisement is promoting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   (Benedetti Dep. at 102:13-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   29. Benedetti's process also may involve reviewing case law that he deems relevant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:12-16, 126:8-12.) SEPTA's interpretation of its Advertising Standards may evolve over time because \"[c]ase law can change how those standards are reviewed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277:1-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 70:9-71:4.) There is no case law interpreting SEPTA's current Advertising Standards. (Trial Tr. at 89:21-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   30. Benedetti's process may also include discussing the advertisement with other SEPTA or Intersection employees or in-house or outside counsel. (Benedetti Dep. at 183:4-185:13 (testifying that he could not answer questions about whether a particular ad would be permissible \"because I have to consult with counsel for sure on something like that and I would have to sit down with [in-house counsel] and talk it through and do searches and - it's not something I can do in a couple of minutes with you\"); Trial Tr. at 55:3-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   31. Intersection has received and accepted at least 2,736 unique proposals for contracts to advertise in SEPTA advertising spaces since SEPTA implemented its 2015 Advertising Standards. SEPTA has identified only twelve advertisements that it rejected in whole or in part, as well as two additional advertisements that SEPTA initially accepted, but which Benedetti then personally observed on SEPTA vehicles and ordered be taken down because they did not comply with SEPTA's Advertising Standards. (Trial Ex. 53, July 17, 2018 Email from J. Powell to Counsel; Benedetti Dep. at 74:10-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   32. At trial, when asked on direct, \"How many proposals has SEPTA actually rejected since the new standards come into effect in 2015?,\" Benedetti responded, \"Not many.\" (Trial Tr. at 55:25-56:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   33. At trial, Benedetti confirmed that Exhibit 53 and the pretrial stipulated facts erroneously list the \"Safe Sleep\" ad campaign (Trial Ex. 58) as having been rejected, when in fact it was accepted. (Trial Tr. at 88:20-89:8.) And, he could not say whether the Department of Homeland Security sex trafficking ad campaign (Trial Ex. 56) was rejected, but he could not offer any explanation as to why it would have been rejected. (Trial Tr. at 89:9-20; Benedetti Dep. at 266:1-267:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   34. SEPTA also rejected an advertisement for the Housing Equality Center. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 66.) Although it does not appear on SEPTA's counsel's list of rejected ads, neither does it appear in any of SEPTA's records as an ad that was accepted. Benedetti testified that he remembered the ad submission and could not explain why SEPTA would have rejected it. (Benedetti Dep. at 287:15-288:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   35. SEPTA has no formal appeal process following SEPTA's denial of an advertisement. (Benedetti Dep. at 78:17-79:16.) Sometimes, after deciding that a proposed advertisement violates the Advertising Standards, Benedetti will discuss the decision with the advertiser, and Benedetti might change his mind. If Benedetti does not change his mind, the advertiser's only recourse is to file a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   36. SEPTA has accepted and run numerous advertisements for governmental entities promoting government programs and policy, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   a. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the federal Centers for Disease Control proclaiming, \"Help him fight measles with the most powerful defense. Vaccines.\" (Trial Ex. 43.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   b. SEPTA ran an advertisement by the City of Philadelphia stating, \"Your landlord must ensure your home is safe.... If your landlord has not given you lead paint safety information, Call 311 or Visit Phila.Gov/LeadHealthyHomes.\" (Trial Ex. 44.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   c. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the Philadelphia Department of Labor stating, \"Employee or Contractor. Knowing the difference benefits you,\" and promoting a government website that helps the public learn about their legal rights. (Trial Ex. 45; Benedetti Dep. at 236:19-238:2.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   d. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the Montgomery County Health Department stating, \"Employers must provide a reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for one year after the child's birth, as well as a private place to do so.\" (Trial Ex. 46.) The advertisement directed readers in search of more information to a government website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   e. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania stating, \"Wanted by law enforcement? Tired of running? Surrender &amp; see favorable considerations. Safe Return.\" (Trial Ex. 47.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   f. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the City of Philadelphia proclaiming the City's \"bold goal of becoming a 90% zero waste AND litter-free City by 2035\" and prompting residents to take specific steps to advance those goals. (Trial Ex. 49.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   g. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health stating, \"Saving a Life Can Be This Easy,\" \"Carry Naloxone (Narcan ),\" and \"Prevent Opioid Overdose.\" (Trial Ex. 50.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   h. SEPTA also ran advertisements by the Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Center stating, \"Have you or someone you know been impacted by mass incarceration? Find out how to fight for your rights, and for the rights of your family, friends and community members.\" (Trial Ex. 51.) The advertisement features drawings of wrists in handcuffs behind bars, a heart behind bars, and two people speaking on a telephone in a prison's visitation room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At deposition, Benedetti testified that he was unsure whether this advertisement was consistent with the Advertising\n   Standards. (Benedetti Dep. at 255:11-257:4.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   37. SEPTA has run ads on other controversial topics and matters of public debate, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   a. SEPTA ran an advertising campaign by Facebook, Inc., with statements such as: \"Fake news is not your friend\" and \"Clickbait is not your friend.\" (Trial Ex. 113.) This campaign generated more than $250,000 in revenue for SEPTA in just three months. (Trial Ex. 70 (showing revenue in May, June, and July 2018 pursuant to contract 21821349).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   b. SEPTA ran an advertisement for the American Friends Service Committee that asked viewers to engage themselves in the fight for peace. The advertisement displayed quotes from civil rights leaders, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Lucretia Mott (all of whom SEPTA described as \"controversial\"), and, expressing the need for the viewer to be an active participant in fights for justice, asked rhetorically, \"What will you do for peace?\" (Trial Ex. 33; Benedetti Dep. at 182:5-14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   c. SEPTA ran a series of advertisements for Fusion media that posited that people of many races, ethnicities, and religions are \"As American As\" the viewer's preconceived notions of American-ness. (Trial Ex. 34; Benedetti Dep. at 187:5-11.) Each advertisement stated, \"Calling All Voices\" and contained in huge lettering \"As American As.\" (Trial Ex. 34.) One advertisement showed a split-screen image featuring a woman who appears to be Muslim on one side, and on the other side, a male soldier in camouflage fatigues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another advertisement in the series showed a split-screen image of a woman of color in boxing gear, in front of an American flag on half of the screen, and draped in the Mexican flag on the other half of the screen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another showed a young Black child wearing a T-shirt that says \"My Life Matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Others in the series featured children of color standing with their hands across their hearts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) as well as other images of men and women of color (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   38. SEPTA also accepted two ads welcoming members of the Democratic National Committee to the DNC held in Philadelphia in 2016. (Trial Exs. 31, 32; Benedetti Dep. at 171:11-174:18.) These ads generated more than $140,000 in revenue. (Trial Ex. 70, at 37) (showing revenue in July 2016 pursuant to contract 21629078) ). Benedetti testified that, in hindsight, he thinks some of these ads are acceptable, but that others violated the Challenged Provisions. (Trial Tr. at 61:4-20; Benedetti Dep. at 170:6-177:18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   39. The Court finds that Benedetti, and the other SEPTA witnesses who testified by deposition, are credible and their testimony deserves substantial weight. Benedetti impressed the Court as taking his corporate responsibilities, as the decision maker on advertisements on behalf of SEPTA, very seriously. The fact that he was not always consistent, and indeed was contradictory in some instances and examples, does not require rejecting his testimony or criticizing his performance of his job. Absolute consistency is not the appropriate test. In American corporate life, many companies depend on their general counsel for legal advice, and the application of legal principles to business decision making. Benedetti acted in this role and the Court believes his approach to his job was consistent with constitutional and legal standards. The fact that CIR, and perhaps\n   other SEPTA advertisers, disagreed with Benedetti's exercise of discretion, is not a determinative factor in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   40. Plaintiff has shown a number of arguably inconsistent decisions in the rejection and acceptance of certain advertisements. Reasonable individuals can disagree on the decisions made by SEPTA on specific ads, but this does not require the Court to find that SEPTA has acted unreasonably, or in violation of constitutional standards. The Court finds that SEPTA has acted in good faith, and that arguable inconsistencies from time to time do not warrant a finding that SEPTA is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bank Advertisements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   41. SEPTA has accepted numerous home loan-related advertisements identifying each advertiser as an \"Equal Opportunity Lender\" or \"Equal Housing Lender.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 35, 36, 38, 39.) Pursuant to federal law, the inclusion of those phrases or the equal housing lender logo is a representation that the lender makes home loans \"without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20338.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Although the regulation states the advertising regarding home loans must \"prominently\" indicate that the lender does not discriminate on the basis of any of these protected characteristics, the regulations specifically allow a showing of the equal opportunity logotype as satisfying this requirement with respect to written and visual advertisements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   42. The Court finds that SEPTA adhered to this requirement and that all of the bank advertisements in this record carried that logotype, without any additional representations or explanations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   43. Many of these advertisements feature non-white models. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 36, 38, 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 37 (featuring African-American couple in apparent new home with slogan \"Bank here to get there. Financial Solutions for Your Life[ ]\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   44. For example, an advertisement from Tompkins VIST Bank shows an image of an African American couple and child in front of a stack of moving boxes and says, \"Making your dream of home ownership a reality,\" and bears the Equal Housing Lender logo type. (Trial Ex. 38; Benedetti Dep. at 200:1-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   45. A Wells Fargo advertisement proclaims the virtues of Wells Fargo's \"NeighborhoodLIFT program,\" which provides down payment assistance and financial education to homebuyers of modest income. (Trial Exs. 39, 40.) Both the advertisement and the website prominently featured in the advertisement show various non-white individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   46. Benedetti testified that Wells Fargo was one of the parties to litigation concerning discriminatory lending, but he could not specifically recall if the litigation he reviewed was the high-profile litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. (Benedetti Dep. at 12:22-13:14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   47. One of SEPTA's letters rejecting CIR's advertisement noted, \"The subject of the proposed advertisement is disputed in class action litigation pending in the courts.\" (Trial Ex. 19, Mar. 29, 2018 Ltr. from G. Benedetti to V. Baranetsky).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    E. SEPTA's Denial of CIR's Proposed Advertisement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   48. In January 2018, CIR applied to place a paid advertisement on the interior of SEPTA buses. (Trial Ex. 30.) CIR wanted to post a journalistic graphic derived from the ten-panel comic appearing on Reveal's website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 81, 10.) The comic and advertisement arose out of CIR's reporting about racial disparities in mortgage lending-reporting that was confirmed by the Associated Press. (Trial Ex. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   49. Intersection informed CIR that SEPTA would not accept CIR's proposed advertisement because, according to SEPTA's legal department, \"[d]isparate lending is a matter of public debate and litigation.\" (Trial Ex. 30.) CIR and SEPTA then exchanged four letters between March 2, 2018 and March 29, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 16-19.) Ultimately, SEPTA reiterated its position that CIR's proposed advertisement is prohibited by the Advertising Standards because the advertisement \"takes a position on issues that are matters of political, economic, and social debate\" and \"indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity,\" in violation of the Challenged Provisions. (Trial Exs. 17, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   50. Other than violating the Challenged Provisions, SEPTA has disclaimed any other justification for rejecting CIR's ad. (Trial Ex. 24, Def.'s Resps. to Interrogs. 1, 3, at 5, 7; Benedetti Dep. at 85:8-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   51. Prior to this litigation, SEPTA never identified specific panels or aspects of the proposed advertisement that concerned SEPTA, stating only that, in SEPTA's view, CIR's advertisement addressed the subject of \"disparate lending.\" SEPTA did not invite CIR to amend its proposal in any manner before rejecting it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 16-19.) However, during his deposition, Benedetti identified two images in CIR's advertisement that personally stood out to him as violative of SEPTA's Advertising Standards: an image showing keys attached to sticks of dynamite handed from a white hand to a black hand, and an image Benedetti interpreted as showing protesters yelling at a white banker. (Benedetti Dep. at 156:9-12, 157:17-158:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   52. To address Benedetti's stated concerns, CIR drafted an additional proposed advertisement without those design elements, which it submitted to Intersection and SEPTA on August 6, 2018. (Trial Ex. 83, Aug. 6, 2018 Email from G. Hongsdusit to J. Roche, Aug. 6, 2018 Ltr. from J. Stapleton to M. Madden, et al.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   53. On September 21, 2018, after being directed by the Court to formally respond to CIR's additional proposed advertisement, SEPTA rejected the proposal. (ECF 32, Ex. A, Ltr. from M. Madden to J. Stapleton.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   54. Of great concern is the need for a viable public transit system in a large city such as Philadelphia, serving many neighborhoods, some more prosperous than others. It is a commonly accepted fact in Philadelphia that many taxicab drivers, and \"transportation network companies,\" such as Uber and Lyft, do not frequent high crime areas, or areas where there is a significant amount of drug trafficking or drug addicts. Many residents who live in these areas are forced to rely on public transportation to get to and from work, for child care, for school attendance, and many other reasons. This point was made in litigation before the undersigned involving taxi cab drivers alleging the failure of the Philadelphia Parking Authority to regulate transportation network companies.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Checker Cab Phila. v. Phila. Parking Auth.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-4669.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   55. The obvious facts of operating a transit system in a big city, as well as specific facts in this record, warrant giving SEPTA considerable discretion in adopting advertising standards that may preclude certain types of advertisements in an effort to avoid offending any particular passenger segment. The Court notes, as expressed in a number of judicial decisions, that passengers on a transit bus or subway are \"captive\" in the sense that they cannot avoid advertising media. This is opposed to consumers listening to radio or TV stations, or even reading ads in a newspaper, where the consumer can switch the station, turn the newspaper page, not buy the newspaper, or turn off the radio/TV. Advertisements in public transit vehicles are a unique advertising market and courts should refrain from supervision of rejected ads or interference with the business decisions of the transit company managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   56. The Court nonetheless recognizes its obligations to adhere to First Amendment jurisprudence and, for these reasons, has determined that certain phrases within SEPTA regulations are overly broad, potentially confusing, and unreasonably infringing on free speech. The Court notes these objectional phrases in the Conclusions of Law, which follow. With these deletions, the Court finds SEPTA's standards are consistent with First Amendment principles as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court and the Third Circuit and provide a workable and reasonable standard for SEPTA to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   57. The deletion of these phrases will not harm SEPTA or restrict SEPTA from rejecting or accepting advertisements that it believes are consistent with its standards. Rather, the Court believes the deletions of these phrases in the current regulations will make the regulations more consistent with established First Amendment jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   58. The Court also finds that advertisers seeking to place advertisements that SEPTA finds violates its standards have many other outlets in the Philadelphia area for access to the public for their views, such as the internet, billboards, leaflets, sound trucks - in addition to the more obvious advertising outlets mentioned above such as newspapers, radio and TV. Thus, the fact that SEPTA, as a non-public forum, has restrictions, does not deter the public flow of messaging of all types. In fact, the rejected CIR advertisement at issue had been accepted by the City of Philadelphia for placement on their bus shelters and newsstands. (Trial Ex. 10, Feb. 23, 2018 Email from J. Roche to H. Young et al.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. DISCUSSION OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Our analysis proceeds as follows. The Court first examines whether the advertising space at issue is a public, designated public, limited public, or non-public forum. The Court then proceeds to evaluate\n   whether, under the recent Supreme Court precedent in\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , the Challenged Provisions are so overbroad as to be incapable of reasoned application. Next, the Court discusses CIR's facial attack on the reasonableness of SEPTA's regulations and address the particular circumstances relevant to First Amendment challenges to speech restrictions on public transit. Following this discussion, the Court addresses whether SEPTA's content-based restrictions are viewpoint neutral-both facially and as-applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In keeping with its proprietary function as a provider of public transportation, SEPTA does not intend its acceptance of transit advertising to permit its transit facilities, products, or vehicles to be used as open public forums for public discourse and debate. Rather, SEPTA's fundamental purpose and intent is to accept such forms of advertising as will enhance the generation of revenues to support its transit operations without adversely affecting the patronage of passengers. In furtherance of that discreet and limited objective, SEPTA will retain strict control over the nature of the advertisements accepted for posting on or in its transit facilities, products and vehicles and will maintain its advertising space strictly as a non-public forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22.) Benedetti's testimony at trial explaining the process by which SEPTA adopted this Policy affirms the organization's explicit intent to close the forum. (Trial Tr. at 46:17-47:17.) (explaining that the primary objective in adopting the 2015 Advertising Standards was to become a non-public forum).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   This inclusion of an express intent to close the forum was apparently missing from SEPTA's earlier advertising standards.

Thus, the Court must review SEPTA's policies and practices to determine whether the forum has been closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   SEPTA's licensee, Intersection, solicits and places advertisements on SEPTA vehicles. With the assistance of salespeople and managers at Intersection, advertisements that potentially violate SEPTA's Policy are brought to Benedetti's attention. Benedetti testified that he has not rejected many advertisements since the\n   new standards were implemented in 2015. (Trial Tr. at 55:25-56:2.) Of the nearly 2,736 proposed advertisements Intersection has received, SEPTA has rejected or removed between twelve and fourteen advertisements for noncompliance with the standards. (Trial Ex. 53, Pl.'s Br. Stip. 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   In practice, SEPTA has accepted a number of advertisements that Benedetti testified it should not have, including, for example, an advertisement from a union expressing support for the Democratic National Convention. (Trial Ex. 32; Trial Tr. at 61:4-20.) The fact that SEPTA's process has missed certain advertisements does not alone demonstrate that SEPTA has created a public forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/#p77\">\n    390 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"One or more instances of erratic enforcement of a policy does not itself defeat the government's intent not to create a public forum.\"). Moreover, Benedetti testified that SEPTA employee Dellispriscoli \"sees all the ads ... before they go on the bus[,]\" and that only potentially problematic ads are brought to Benedetti's attention. (Trial Tr. at 52:23-25, 54:13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   This Court concludes that SEPTA's practices and policies have evolved since\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   such that SEPTA effectively closed the forum to public speech and debate. It is within SEPTA's power to close the forum, and it clearly exerts significant control over the advertising review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   In finding that SEPTA had failed to create a non-public forum in\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   , Judge Goldberg noted that SEPTA \"does not have an official policy which prohibits political or public issue advertisements to those which contain only commercial or uncontroversial speech.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331948\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/314/\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Benedetti has admittedly accepted certain advertisements that may have been violative of the policy, we do not find that these few instances demonstrate an intent on SEPTA's part to maintain a designated public forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/#p77\">\n    390 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   As discussed above, SEPTA had, until midway through this litigation, permitted Screenfeed to publish news feed data onto the digital displays on its buses. Before the news feeds were terminated, SEPTA reviewed the advertisements it published on the digital displays in the same fashion as it did other advertisements. We do not find that the infotainment systems are relevant to this analysis. Even if they were, however, we conclude that SEPTA has not created a public forum by permitting Screenfeed to publish scrolling news headlines on SEPTA buses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Language That Must be Stricken as Incapable of Reasoned Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   CIR has presented a facial challenge to the Challenged Provisions on the basis that the second sentence of Subsection (a) and the entirety of Subsection (b) are incapable of reasoned application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   The first provision, Subsection (a), prohibits \"advertisements that are political in nature or contain political messages, including advertisements involving political or judicial figures and/or advertisements involving an issue that is political in nature in that it directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity.\" (Trial Ex. 22, at \u00b6 II(A)(9)(b)(iv)(a).) Based on the reasoning employed in\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , SEPTA's prohibition on advertisements containing political or judicial figures can be applied in a reasoned manner. However, the phrase \"political in nature,\" as well as the latter clause of that sentence which prohibits \"advertisements involving an issue that is political in nature in that it directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity,\" are significantly less clear. At oral argument on November 1, 2018, SEPTA indicated to the Court that it would object to this Court requiring it to delete this phrase from its policy. (11/01/18 Hearing Tr. at 29:24-30:6.) This Court overrules SEPTA's objection, and in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , directs SEPTA to strike these phrases from its policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   The second Challenged Provision, Subsection (b) prohibits \"[a]dvertisements expressing or advocating an opinion, position, or viewpoint on matters of public debate about economic, political, religious, historical or social issues.\" (Trial Ex. 22, at \u00b6 II(A)(9)(b)(iv)(b).) The Court finds that \"economic, political, religious, historical or social issues\" are clear and discreet issues, but that the phrase \"matters of public debate\" is overly broad. When asked at oral argument about this, SEPTA said that it would not object to this Court requiring it to delete the \"matters of public debate\" language. (11/01/18 Hearing Tr. at 29:13-17.) CIR, however, did object, arguing that the proposed revision would not render the policy any more capable of reasoned application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:14-31:3.) (arguing that if SEPTA removed the phrase \"on matters of public debate,\" the standard would remain \"hopelessly vague and capacious\"). The Court likewise overrules these objections. The phrase \"matters of public debate\" is simply too broad to pass constitutional muster under\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , Thus, this Court will require SEPTA to strike the phrase from its policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Accordingly, the revised provisions of what is prohibited under SEPTA's policy will read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   (a) Advertisements promoting or opposing a political party, or promoting or opposing the election of any candidate or group of candidates for federal,\n   state, judicial or local government offices are prohibited. In addition, advertisements that\n   <s>\n    are political in nature or\n   </s>\n   contain political messages, including advertisements involving political or judicial figures\n   <s>\n    and/or advertisements involving an issue that is-political in nature in that it directly-or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity\n   </s>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   (b) Advertisements expressing or advocating an opinion, position or viewpoint on\n   <s>\n    matters of public debate about\n   </s>\n   economic, political, religious, historical or social issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and in light of\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , SEPTA has not met its burden of justifying the continuation of the entirety of its advertising restrictions. Considering CIR's facial attack, the overly broad portions of Subsections (a) and (b) must be stricken to nullify the threat of unfettered discretion on the part of SEPTA's decisionmakers. The Court's changes still allow SEPTA to exercise control over its advertising space because the revised provisions make clear that any ads on \"political\" issues will be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   As a result, because SEPTA is required to revise its overly broad language in the Challenged Provisions, CIR's other challenges to SEPTA's advertising restrictions-both facial and as-applied-must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Meet and Confer Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   In the past, SEPTA has engaged in a deliberative process with certain advertisers whose proposed advertisements were deemed to violate SEPTA's Advertising Standards. Benedetti testified that an advertiser called Fusion once submitted a proposed advertisement that violated SEPTA's Standards. (Trial Tr. at 59:20-60:9.) In response, Intersection and SEPTA \"talked direct[ly] to the folks at Fusion\" and then \"Fusion agreed to eliminate those concerns that [Benedetti] had raised.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:5-8.) SEPTA then ran the finalized advertisement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   SEPTA's advertising policy would benefit from a formalized meet-and-confer program similar to the deliberative process it undertook with Fusion. At oral argument on November 1, 2018, SEPTA agreed to add a formal \"meet and confer\" program to its Advertising Standards. (11/01/18 Hearing Tr. at 27:24-28:8.) Thus, in addition to striking the language the Court has found vulnerable, the Court will also require SEPTA to implement a meet-and-confer program for proposed advertisements that it deems violative of its Standards. The Court will further require SEPTA to post notice of the meet-and-confer program, as well as the rest of its advertising regulations, on its website. Subject to the order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion, the Court will allow time for SEPTA to draft this addition for SEPTA's website and, after any comments by CIR, submit it to this Court along with CIR's comments for final consideration and approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   <strong>\n    D. CIR's Facial Attack on the Restrictions (as to be Amended)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   CIR also argues that the Challenged Provisions are not reasonable in light of the purpose of SEPTA's advertising space.

The \"surrounding circumstances\" are especially important in cases involving advertising on public transportation. It is fundamental that the inside of a bus is not the same as the inside of a polling place or even an airport, and cases analyzing restrictions on speech in public transit spaces constitute a distinct subset of First Amendment jurisprudence that gives transit authorities some leeway over their non-public forums. Although this Court's analysis is not limited to such cases, this Court finds them particularly applicable because of their analogous sets of facts.

SEPTA's Restrictions (as to be Amended) Are Reasonable in Light of the Purpose of the Forum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Having considered\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   and the vast body of jurisprudence, both precedential and not, discussing transit authorities' abilities to restrict access to advertising space, the Court finds that CIR's facial attack is valid as to the portions of the existing language that we are striking, for the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part VII.C. However, with the stricken language removed, the Court finds that the Challenged Provisions are now facially valid, reasonable, and constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Applying the two-step test enunciated in\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   , this Court first finds that SEPTA has shown through record evidence that the purpose of its advertising space is to \"raise revenue independent of the farebox and taxpayer subsidies and to do so in a manner that provides for the safety, efficiency and comfort of [its] passengers.\" (Benedetti Dep. at 17:5-10; Trial Tr. at 48:23-49:8 (testifying that SEPTA considers the importance of advertising revenue as it is balanced against customer experience).) In addition to Benedetti's express statements on the subject, this purpose is evident from SEPTA's efforts to close its advertising forum following Judge Goldberg's\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   decision. At trial, Benedetti explained that while SEPTA considers the advertising space to be a source of revenue, \"not at the expense of happy customers and safe customers.\" (Trial Tr. at 49:4-8.) Although on cross-examination, Benedetti stated that SEPTA runs advertisements \"for revenue reasons,\" he qualified that by expressing a goal of not \"decreas[ing] the value that [SEPTA] bring[s] to the customers in moving them from one place to another,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   68:16-18, and of not \"detract[ing] from [SEPTA's] core mission of moving them around safely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:25, 68:16-18, 69:2-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69: 8-11 (stating on cross-examination that SEPTA was \"balancing [its] revenue-generating goals for the ad space against the customer experience\").) On this basis, and considering SEPTA's very serious post-\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   experience, as discussed in this Memorandum, the Court finds sufficient evidence to ascertain that SEPTA has dedicated the advertising space in its buses to revenue generation within important considerations of a safe, efficient, and comfortable customer experience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Turning to the second step of the\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   test, this Court finds that SEPTA has sufficiently shown that the Challenged Provisions (as to be amended) are tied to the purpose of the advertising space.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055563\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/435/#p443\">\n    834 F.3d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record here does not suffer from the same insufficiencies that the Third Circuit focused on in\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   . Rather, Benedetti specifically testified that the Standards were adopted largely due to \"public outcry\" about a problematic advertisement\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   that ran on its\n   buses in 2014. (Trial Tr. at 46:25.) The advertisement caused \"concern\" among SEPTA's employees and customers, resulted in vandalism on buses, and required SEPTA to rearrange bus operators' schedules after certain drivers objected to operating buses that displayed the advertisement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:6-9, 47:18-20, 48:6-11.) That situation clearly disrupted SEPTA's ability to provide a safe, comfortable and efficient customer experience, to say nothing of the commonsense inferences that can be drawn from how vandalism, plus customer and employee unrest, could affect SEPTA's ability to attract passengers, advertising revenues, farebox revenues, and overall operating expenditures. After the experience, SEPTA adopted the Challenged Provisions with advice from counsel and by reference to Judge Goldberg's decision in\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331948\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/314/\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as by reference to standards implemented by other transit authorities. (Trial Tr. at 45:10-15, 46:9-16.) SEPTA drafted the Standards so as to close the forum and add \"prohibitions on political ads and ads that sought to seek government action of some sort and ads that were matters of public debate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:19-22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   The Challenged Provisions (as to be amended) are thus not only\n   <em>\n    related\n   </em>\n   to the goal of revenue generation balanced along with the customer experience, but they were also implemented for the express purpose of remedying a former policy that put that goal in jeopardy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 48:14-21 (acknowledging that the advertising restrictions were amended \"to avoid a recurrence of those kinds of episodes\").) The First Amendment reasonableness inquiry does not require that SEPTA's restrictions be \"the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    473 U.S. at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p801\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . SEPTA's experience with the AFDI advertisement, as shown through record evidence and, to a lesser extent, commonsense inferences, provides more than enough justification to tie SEPTA's implementation of the Challenged Provisions to the lawful purpose of its advertising forum. In light of the \"captive\" nature of passengers on a public bus and the narrow body of First Amendment jurisprudence specific to transit authorities, the Court finds SEPTA's Challenged Provisions, as to be amended, reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/01/18 Hearing Tr. at 10:11-12.)

In the transit context, the Supreme\n   Court has concluded that a ban on political ads is permissible if it is a \"managerial decision\" aimed at increasing revenue by limiting ad space \"to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service oriented advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/#p304\">\n    418 U.S. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/#p304\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that the Challenged Provisions, by rejecting ads that are \"political\" or express or advocate an \"opinion, position, or viewpoint on economic, religious, historical, or social issues,\" inevitably exclude arguably more controversial ads, does not mean that SEPTA seeks to avoid controversy. Further, as the Court has stricken language from Subsection (a) and the phrase \"matters of public debate\" from Subsection (b), the Court need not address whether the Challenged Provisions, in their original form, improperly prohibited controversial speech. Even if SEPTA sought to avoid controversy by enforcing the Challenged Provisions in the past, that fact is not determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   <strong>\n    2. SEPTA's Restrictions are Viewpoint Neutral as Applied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   The only challenges CIR brings against the Challenged Provisions as applied pertain to viewpoint discrimination. CIR contends that SEPTA has applied the Challenged Provisions in a viewpoint discriminatory manner in two ways: (1) SEPTA has applied subpart (a) to prohibit ads seeking to change government programs/policies, while permitting ads promoting government programs/policies; and (2) SEPTA approved ads from \"equal housing lender\" banks, but rejected CIR's ad on the same topic of \"discriminatory lending\" because of the ad's viewpoint. (CIR Post-Trial Br., at 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   In response, SEPTA contends that it did not view the bank ads as addressing the same subject matter as CIR's proposed ad. (SEPTA Post-Trial Br., at 35.) Rather, SEPTA avers that the proposed bank ads \"appeared only to serve the promotional objective of generating business from persons who read the ad.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to SEPTA, it was reasonable for SEPTA to conclude that ads from \"equal housing lender\" banks did not pertain to discriminatory lending because the ads did not acknowledge a debate or present data on discriminatory lending, and they did not address the disposition of loan applications by race, neighborhood, or otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.) SEPTA further distinguishes these bank ads from CIR's proposed ad by contending that the bank ads \"look forward, not back. The ads are designed to foster future borrowing; they do not address past lending practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   The Court agrees with SEPTA and concludes that SEPTA did not apply the Challenged Provisions in a viewpoint discriminatory manner. SEPTA reasonably viewed CIR's ad as falling within the prohibition against ads expressing a viewpoint about economic, political, religious, historical or social issues. Further, SEPTA has shown that it does not reject certain \"political\" ads or ads taking a position on \"matters of public debate\" because of the viewpoints expressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   The Court concludes that SEPTA did not reject CIR's ad because of its viewpoint, but because it fell into one of the content categories that SEPTA determined it would not accept-either political, economic, or social-or all of them. In other words, SEPTA has demonstrated that it rejected CIR's ad because it was related to an impermissible topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   <strong>\n    a. SEPTA's Acceptance of Public-Service Advertisements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   CIR contends that SEPTA has accepted several ads from governmental entities that are also \"political in nature\" and \"involv[e] an issue that... directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government\n   entity,\" and that SEPTA rejected CIR's ad because of its \"political\" viewpoint. (CIR Post-Trial Br., at 15-16.) The \"public service\" ads that SEPTA accepted have been submitted in this case by CIR or SEPTA include the following exhibits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-389\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 43:\n   </strong>\n   Center for Disease Control ad stating, \"Help him fight measles with the most powerful defense. Vaccines.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-390\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 44:\n   </strong>\n   City of Philadelphia ad stating, \"Your landlord must ensure your home is safe....

SAFE RETURN.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 49:\n   </strong>\n   City of Philadelphia ad including the City's \"bold goal of becoming a 90% zero waste AND litter-free City by 2035[,]\" and stating that \"[t]he vision for a zero waste and litter-free City starts with one\" and \"it starts with you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-395\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 50:\n   </strong>\n   City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health ad stating, \"Saving a Life Can Be this Easy,\" \"Carry Naloxone (Narcan ),\" and \"Prevent Opioid Overdose.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-396\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 51:\n   </strong>\n   Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Center ads stating, \"Have you or someone you know been impacted by mass incarceration? Find out how to fight for your rights, and for the rights of your family, friends and community members.\" The ads depict wrists in handcuffs behind bars, a heart behind bars, and two people speaking on a telephone in a prison visitation room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-397\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Ex. 58:\n   </strong>\n   Philadelphia Department of Health ad stating, \"Same Room. Different Beds. Better Rest for All[,]\" and directing viewers to a website, \"SafeSleepPhilly.org.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   The Court disagrees that these ads are analogous to CIR's ad. SEPTA reasonably concluded CIR's ad, by suggesting that lending practices are discriminatory in violation of the law, was content about one of the issues that SEPTA has prohibited. Unlike CIR's ad, which promotes CIR's research and informs viewers that the banks that issued their home mortgages may be charging some borrowers more interest than others, because of race, the comparator ads are public service ads that merely inform viewers of their rights, the services available to them, or the City's objectives. This is true even of the FIGHT ads, which CIR highlights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 29; CIR Post-Trial Br., at 15.) The FIGHT ads inform viewers of their rights with respect to so-called \"mass-incarceration.\" SEPTA is entitled to discretion in such borderline cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SMART\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629242\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/885/#p894\">\n    698 F.3d at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a transit authority's advertising policy that prohibited \"[p]olitical or political campaign advertising\" was viewpoint neutral, and noting that \"merely because it is sometimes unclear whether an ad is political does not mean the distinction cannot be drawn in the case of a nonpublic forum.

(CIR Post-Trial Br., at 16.) However, the Court finds that these ads are similarly distinguishable from CIR's ad under Subsection (b). Though these ads may address \"matters of public debate,\" unlike CIR's ad, they do not \"express[ ] or advocat[e] an opinion, position, or viewpoint on matters of public debate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

SEPTA's Acceptance of Bank Advertisements is Not Accepting Viewpoint Advertisements and SEPTA's Rejection of CIR's Advertisements was Reasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   The Court concludes that SEPTA has shown that it did not reject CIR's ad and accept the bank ads based on the viewpoints the ads expressed on discriminatory lending. SEPTA has shown that it reasonably rejected CIR's ad under Subsection (b) because of the viewpoint it expressed on a prohibited topic. Therefore, SEPTA did not violate the First Amendment by rejecting CIR's ad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   CIR contends that because each bank ad\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   identified the bank as an \"Equal Opportunity Lender\" or \"Equal Housing Lender,\" they expressed a viewpoint on discriminatory lending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CIR Post-Trial Br., at 18-19.) However, the banks ads that CIR cites were required by law to indicate by a logotype that the banks were equal opportunity lenders or equal housing lenders. The Code of Federal Regulations governing Nondiscriminatory Advertising,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20338.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2005), requires banks to include in their ads a \"logotype\" to this effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Although CIR does not dispute that its ad reflects a viewpoint on discriminatory lending, the Court concludes that the bank ads do not. Just because the bank ads, as\n   required by law, contain a logotype that the banks are equal opportunity lenders, and depict both Caucasian and non-Caucasian customers, does not mean that the ads are expressing a viewpoint on discriminatory lending practices. Accordingly, although CIR's ad reflects a viewpoint on discriminatory lending, SEPTA's acceptance of the bank ads and rejection of CIR's ad do not amount to contradicting decisions. The bank ads did not advocate any viewpoint on discriminatory lending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   Neither party, nor the Court, has identified any Third Circuit or Supreme Court opinions holding that an advertiser states a \"viewpoint\" on a topic, such as discriminatory lending, by indicating in the ad, as required by law, that it complies with the law. However, other courts have distinguished ads that promote goods or services, like the bank ads, from ads like CIR's, which \"focus on convincing the reader to take sides in a[ ] moral or public debate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524545\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/303/11/#p26\">\n    303 F.Supp.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing ads promoting the availability of goods or services advertised from Milo Yiannopoulous ads promoting a political book, which violated transit authority prohibition on ads \"intended to influence members of the public regarding issues on which there are varying opinions\" or \"intended to influence public policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   The Court finds that SEPTA's bank ads are, as is obvious from their language, designed to secure loan business from a number of banks that do business in the Philadelphia area. No party introduced any direct evidence from a representative of any of these banks, but the Court can make certain inferences and findings from the content of the ads, other testimony introduced in the trial record as to SEPTA's practices with regard to ads, and the type of advertisers who advertise on the interior of SEPTA buses. These bank ads are commercial-they were placed by business entities, the banks, to promote their lending businesses. They do not state any viewpoint on any matter pertaining to politics or economics or social issues. Each bank ad is simply a straightforward invitation to SEPTA bus passengers to inquire about the bank's loan rates in the hope that a passenger will use that bank to provide the mortgages which most people need to purchase a home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Philadelphia is one of the largest cities in the United States and is blessed with many hardworking, law abiding families who contribute to the economic welfare of the entire city and related areas. Many of them are interested in buying a home and can afford to do so. Philadelphia has a strong middle class, with a large percentage of homeowners, who live in many demographically diverse neighborhoods. There are many more racially diverse neighborhoods in Philadelphia at the present time than in the prior fifty to sixty years, and this is a trend that is continuing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   Many people ride buses to work, for school, social life, or sports events. For some, a bus is the most convenient. There is nothing in the record to detract from the concept that although a bus passenger is voluntarily riding on a bus, it may realistically be their only way of getting to a particular place, whether it is work, education, sporting events, etc. Banks have concluded, by advertising on SEPTA, that SEPTA passengers are overall a good loan risk, and by these ads the banks are soliciting their business. SEPTA has reasonably concluded the bank ads do not contain content which SEPTA prohibited in subparagraph (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   The Court cannot criticize SEPTA's business policy of accepting ads from banks that promote bank services. The Court therefore will not force on SEPTA the additional \"cost\" of requiring it to take ads from CIR which attack lending practices of banks as racially discriminatory. By accepting these bank ads, SEPTA has not \"opened the door\" to an ad that undisputedly expresses a viewpoint on discriminatory lending, such as the ad proposed by CIR. SEPTA has not endorsed or permitted a forum to address discriminatory lending by accepting the bank ads. Racial discrimination in lending by banks subject to federal or state law is illegal and abhorrent. However, there is no evidence supporting CIR's contention that SEPTA must consider these bank ads as expressing a viewpoint on discriminatory lending such that SEPTA's acceptance of these ads required SEPTA to also accept the proposed CIR ad. If CIR's argument were valid, SEPTA's acceptance of ads from frequent commercial advertisers such as educational institutions and social service agencies, which regularly appear on SEPTA buses, would require SEPTA to accept all ads accusing these advertisers of racial discrimination, thus turning its advertising space into a \"traveling arena\" for combative attacks on SEPTA's commercial advertisers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   The Court considers SEPTA acted reasonably in rejecting the CIR ad because it stated a viewpoint on an impermissible topic and was not responding to any other ad reflecting a viewpoint on the same topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   In considering available advertising space, in our contemporary times, one must also consider the vast \"digital solar system\" that is open to virtually anyone who sets up their own internet site or \"domain\" and, within very broad bounds, advertises on social media outlets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   As noted above, a number of precedents in courts around the country have approved transit regulations that limit permissible ads to \"commercial\" ads-but SEPTA has good reason for not using the term \"commercial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   For reasons discussed above, the Court finds that CIR has succeeded in arguing that certain portions of the Challenged Provisions are incapable of reasoned application. Because this Court has ordered SEPTA to revise the overly broad language, CIR's other challenges to SEPTA's advertising restrictions-both facial and as-applied-must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   Perfection in the exercise of judgment is a human goal that few humans, including very few if any judges, will ever achieve. The Court concludes that SEPTA's policy,\n   as to be amended, effectively permitting advertisements that are commercial or that promote public services, but rejecting ads on political, economic, historical, religious, or social issues, is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-418\">\n    CIR has no objection to the first sentence of Subsection (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-419\">\n    The Court's September 25, 2018 Opinion denying CIR's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is also available at\n    <em>\n     CIR v.

SEPTA argues that that the American Friends Service Committee ad was not \"political\" and did not reflect a position on a \"matter of public debate\" because it only called for people to get involved in bringing about peace, but did not reference policies, programs, or actions for doing so.
