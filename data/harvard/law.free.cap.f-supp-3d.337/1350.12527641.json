By statute, the first possible day for Industrias to file their summons was thirty-one days after publication in the Federal Register, on October 16, 2017. Because Industrias filed too early, Defendant argues that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action at the time of filing, the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity, and therefore the court must dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. 6-7.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Icdas\n   </em>\n   examined U.S. Supreme Court cases decided after\n   <em>\n    Georgetown Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NEC Corp.\n   </em>\n   and found that the U.S. Supreme Court's clear pronouncements undercut the holdings of those two cases. The court finds similarly with the court in\n   <em>\n    Icdas\n   </em>\n   and concludes that the time limits in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a are nonjurisdictional in nature based on an analysis of the text, context, and historical treatment of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Consolidated Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Leave to Construe the Complaint as a Concurrently-Filed Summons and Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the time limits in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a do not divest the court of jurisdiction, the court now considers whether to grant Consolidated Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for leave to construe the complaint as a concurrently-filed summons and complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the Rules of the Court, if a plaintiff seeks to amend its complaint more than twenty-one days after service of the complaint, the complaint may be amended only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave, and the court should freely give leave when justice so requires. USCIT R. 15(a)(2). Granting a litigant leave to amend a complaint lies within the discretion of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zenith Radio Corp. v.

The Supreme Court has provided the following guidance regarding the circumstances in which a plaintiff should not be afforded an opportunity to amend a complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason--such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of\n   allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.--the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \"freely given.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Foman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    371 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   USCIT Rule 3 allows for the amendment of a summons at any time on such terms as the court deems just, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the amendment is allowed. USCIT R. 3(e). The language present in USCIT Rule 3 is similar to the equitable and lenient standard applicable to amending a complaint under USCIT Rule 15.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Icdas\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359904\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/1328/#p1334\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d at 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Rules of the Court require pleadings to be construed so as to do justice. USCIT R. 8(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The interests of justice favor granting Industrias' motion. The court in\n   <em>\n    Icdas\n   </em>\n   held that early notice of an action is \"something that is hard to characterize as prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    Icdas\n   </em>\n   , 39 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359904\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/1328/#p1334\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d at 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly here, Industrias' early filing of their summons provided Defendant and interested parties with early notice of their challenge to the Commission's final determination. If Consolidated Plaintiffs are not permitted to amend their pleadings, then they are foreclosed from seeking judicial relief. The court concludes that Consolidated Plaintiffs have met the equitable standard to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the above-mentioned reasons, the court concludes that the time limits prescribed in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a are nonjurisdictional in nature and that the facts of this case justify allowing Consolidated Plaintiffs to amend their pleadings. Accordingly, upon consideration of Defendant's motion and Consolidated Plaintiffs' cross-motion, and all other papers and proceedings in this action, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's motion is denied; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Consolidated Plaintiffs' motion is granted. The summons and complaint filed by Industrias shall be deemed concurrently filed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Rules of the Court are, to the extent practicable, in conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Rules of the Court at times deviate from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure where required to tailor the rules to the actions ordinarily brought before the Court.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , USCIT R. 56.2. Except for minor differences in USCIT Rule 15(c)(2), USCIT Rule 15 is identical to Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    USCIT R. 15\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Fed.
