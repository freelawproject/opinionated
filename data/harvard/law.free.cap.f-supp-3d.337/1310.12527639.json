Plaintiffs Failed to Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As discussed above, Plaintiffs first addressed the all-others rate to the agency in their ministerial error allegation; they did not file case or rebuttal briefs. The question, then, is whether an exception to the exhaustion doctrine applies that would\n   permit Plaintiffs to pursue the claims alleged in counts one and three of their amended complaint regarding Commerce's calculation of the all-others rate in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that exhaustion should not be required because Commerce first made the contested all-others rate determination in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   ; the propriety of Commerce's determination raises a pure question of law; and Commerce's determination departs from agency practice. Pls.' Exh. Br. at 14-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.-Int.'s Exh. Br. at 1-2.

As discussed below, Plaintiffs had the opportunity to raise their objections administratively, the pure question of law exception does not apply, and Commerce's all-others rate determination was consistent with the agency's recent practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs first assert that they lacked the opportunity to raise objections to Commerce's determination regarding the all-others rate in the absence of a calculated rate for a mandatory respondent because Commerce did not address that issue until the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   .

Plaintiffs' argument overlooks the fact that Commerce's decision to assign a rate based on adverse facts available to all mandatory respondents\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   the agency to reassess the all-others rate because the basis for that rate, Unicatch's preliminary calculated rate, was no longer available. At a minimum, Plaintiffs had the opportunity to file a rebuttal brief presenting arguments to the agency as to how it should determine the all-others rate pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B) in the event such a determination became necessary. Such an argument would clearly be considered a \"response\" to the argument raised in Mid Continent's case brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.309\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs further assert that Commerce failed to notify interested parties or the public that it would (1) no longer use prior calculated rates to determine the all-others rate when all mandatory respondents received rates based on adverse facts available in light of the Federal Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Albemarle\n   </em>\n   decision, or (2) assign Plaintiffs a rate based on adverse inferences. Pls.' Exh. Br. at 14-15. Plaintiffs' assertions lack merit. The Federal Circuit has stated that Commerce\n   <em>\n    need not\n   </em>\n   \"expressly notify interested parties any time it intends to change its methodology between its preliminary and final determinations\" when there is \"relevant data in the record and the advancement of arguments related to that data before Commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Boomerang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276911\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/908/#p912\">\n    856 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By placing Unicatch's preliminary calculated rate at issue in its case brief, Mid Continent effectively placed Plaintiffs' rate at issue as well. All arguments relevant to Plaintiffs' rate, therefore, should have been raised in an administrative rebuttal brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, Commerce had placed the \"public\" on notice about its post-\n   <em>\n    Albemarle\n   </em>\n   interpretation of what constitutes a \"reasonable method\" pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B) to determine the rate for non-examined companies when all mandatory respondents in market economy proceedings (or all mandatory respondents eligible for separate rates in nonmarket economy proceedings) receive rates based on adverse facts available: Commerce issued four preliminary determinations before rebuttal briefs were due in the underlying proceeding\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   applying the same reasoning and methodology it applied in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' failure to\n   argue the issue appears to stem from their belief that Commerce would follow its pre-\n   <em>\n    Albemarle\n   </em>\n   practice and assign them the investigation rate in the event none of the individually-examined respondents received calculated rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'
