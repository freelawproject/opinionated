These matters were submitted for consideration without oral argument. The Court has reviewed the record and files herein, and is fully informed. For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary or Permanent Injunction and Summary Judgment (ECF No. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; Defendants' Cross-Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for Preliminary Injunction and Summary Judgment (ECF Nos. 19; 20) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; and Unopposed Motion for Leave to Appear and File Brief as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   in Support of Plaintiffs by Members of Congress (ECF No. 26) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 21, 2018, Plaintiffs Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and Hawaiian Islands, and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland (collectively \"Planned Parenthood\") filed this Complaint against Defendants United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"); the Secretary of HHS, Alex Michael Azar II; and the Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS, Valerie Huber. ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from allocating funding under the 2018 Funding Opportunity Announcements (\"FOAs\") associated with the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (\"TPP Program\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the instant motion, Plaintiffs move to enjoin HHS from using the 2018 FOAs to select grantees and award funding.

ECF No. 19 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are primarily drawn from Plaintiffs' Complaint and documents appended to the instant motion, and are accepted as true\n   for the purposes of the motion to dismiss. The TPP was created by Congress for the 2010 fiscal year (\"FY\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 2. The appropriations languages states: \"$110,000,000 shall be for making competitive contracts and grants to public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy and for the Federal costs associated with administering and evaluating such contracts and grants....\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 28-30; 16-2 at 180, 235 (Ex. 2); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub.

Congress also directed the creation of the Office of Adolescent Health (\"OAH\"), which is responsible for implementing and administering the TPP Program. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 31. Plaintiffs assert that Congress has continuously funded the TPP Program at roughly the same levels, in the same manner, and with the same language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Plaintiffs also allege that Congress has maintained separate funding streams for evidence-based programs and abstinence-only education programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2010, HHS, through OAH, issued two FOAs soliciting applications for Tier 1 and Tier 2 five-year grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. The Tier 1 grant projects were designed to replicate programs that had demonstrated positive impact on key sexual behavior outcomes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. The Tier 2 grant programs were designed to develop and rigorously test new and innovative approaches to prevent teen pregnancy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   OAH funded 102 grantees through competitively awarded grants as part of the April 2010 FOAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Between FY 2010 and 2014, the projects reached more than half a million young people in 39 states and in the District of Columbia, trained a combined 6,100 facilitators, and created 3,800 community partnerships.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that the number of evaluations with positive impacts exceeded the norm for large-scale evaluation efforts in other fields.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. During the 2010 to 2015 grant cycle, teen pregnancy rates declined and many, including HHS, cited the TPP Program as contributing to this trend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2015, HHS, through OAH, issued new FOAs for a second cohort of five-year grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. A final award decision for the 2015 FOAs was made by the OAH Director. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 51. In July 2015, HHS awarded 81 new five-year TPP Program grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. In May 2017, President Trump's proposed budget for FY 2018 called for eliminating the TPP Program and sought a $277 million investment in extending abstinence-only education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. On June 5, 2017, Valerie Huber was appointed as Chief of Staff for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (\"OASH\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. Ms. Huber is now the Senior Policy Adviser at OASH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2017, HHS terminated all 81 TPP Program grants. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 63. In February 2018, nine of the grantees, including Plaintiffs, filed suit in four district courts to challenge the termination of their TPP Program grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The courts, including this Court, granted relief in favor of the grants and ordered HHS to process those grantees' applications for continued TPP Program funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appeals are pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 23, 2018, Congress fully funded the TPP Program for FY 2018, directing that \"$101,000,000 shall be for making competitive contracts and grants to public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy and for the Federal\n   costs associated with administering and evaluating such contracts and grants....\" ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 64; Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%20733\">\n    123 Stat. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress also appropriated $25 million and $75 million for two abstinence-only education programs. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants seek to repurpose the TPP Program to fund abstinence-only content rather than evidence-based programs through the FOAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. Plaintiffs assert that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA does not require applicants to replicate programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. It deletes the definition of \"Evidence-Based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It eliminates all references to HHS's evidence review and the list of evidence-based programs culled from nearly a decade of analysis and evaluation, even though HHS released a new installment of the evidence review the same week as Defendants issued the FOAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The phrase \"evidence-based\" appears nowhere in that FOA, and the words \"proven\" and \"rigorous evaluation\" only appear when describing evaluations that will occur after funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2018 Tier 1 FOA declares that it will \"fund the evaluation of replication strategies that focus on protective factors shown to prevent teen pregnancy, improve adolescent health, and address youth sexual risk holistically.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 71; 16-2 at 23 (Ex. 2). It instructs prospective grantees to replicate \"a risk avoidance approach or a risk reduction approach\" that incorporates the common characteristics of either the \"Center for Relationship Education's Systematic Method for Assessing Risk-Avoidance Tool (SMARTool)\" or the \"Tool to Assess the Characteristics of Effective Sex and STD/HIV Education Programs\" (\"TAC\"). ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 71; 16-2 at 18. \"Sexual Risk Avoidance\" is defined as \"the natural approach for an emphasis on sexual delay.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 72; 16-2 at 21. \"Sexual Risk Reduction\" is \"the natural approach for an emphasis on cessation support.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 72; 16-2 at 21. \"Sexual risk\" means \"engaging in any behavior that increases one's risk for any of the unintended consequences of sexual activity, including, but not limited to pregnancy.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 72; 16-2 at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that SMARTool and TAC have not been evaluated as a program or incorporate any of the findings of the evidence review or the TPP Program. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. Plaintiffs emphasize that TAC could not incorporate any of the findings given that it was created two years before the TPP Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75. The 2018 Tier 1 FOA and guidance issued by OAH make clear that prospective grantees \" 'have the freedom to choose\n   <em>\n    any curriculum\n   </em>\n   without regard to whether it has been proven effective, proven ineffective, or ever rigorously evaluated at all.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76 (emphasis in original). It does not require \"replication\" of the selected curriculum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs insist that the substance of the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is nearly indistinguishable from the 2018 Tier 2 FOA, which instructs applicants to choose a curriculum so long as it \"implement[s] protective factors and/or either elements from the SMARTool or the Tool to Assess the Characteristics of Effective Sex and STD/HIV Education Programs.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 78; 16-2 at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs state that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA also incorporate several changes to the scoring metric for grant applicants. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 79. It added a new application criterion worth a quarter of the available points for \"Realistic, Practical, and Meaningful Application of Project Expectations and Priorities.\" ECF Nos. 1 at\n   \u00b6 80; 16-2 at 65. This criterion rewards \"clearly communicating that teen sex is a risk,\" integrate \"optimal health into every component of the project,\" and provide \"cessation support\" for those who are already sexually active \"to make healthier and risk-free choices in the future.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 80; 16-2 at 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The FOAs also allow the grantee to determine what is or is not \"age appropriate\" as they are meant to conduct their own review of all materials to ensure they are age appropriate. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 84. Plaintiffs emphasize that the 2010 and 2015 FOAs relied upon scientifically determined cognitive and social development of young people at various ages. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 84. The 2018 Tier 1 FOA also changed the definition of \"Medical Accuracy,\" where the information is no longer required to be \"[v]erified or supported by the weight of research conducted in compliance with accepted scientific methods.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 85; 16 at 43. The 2018 Tier 2 FOA does away with the definition of the term entirely. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 85. Contrary to the previous two FOAs, final award decisions will be made by the Director of OAH \"in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Health.\" ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 87; 16-2 at 69. Once issued, award decisions are final and may not be appealed. ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 87; 16-2 at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they considered applying for grants under the 2018 FOAs because they were unsure if they would receive continued funding under their TPP Program grants as Defendants would not commit before July 1, 2018. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 93. Plaintiffs argue that the new 2018 FOAs put them at such a disadvantage for 2018 TPP Program funding that they cannot compete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94. Thus, Plaintiffs have not submitted 2018 TPP Program applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The 2018 FOAs do not require that a program only teach abstinence, but merely requires recipients to provide cessation support and skills to avoid sexual risk, such as pregnancy.

The Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to establish that they would be unable to fairly compete for the grant.
