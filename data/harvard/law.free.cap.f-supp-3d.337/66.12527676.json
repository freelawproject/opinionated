Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the City from denying permission to the Plaintiffs to display \"the Christian flag\" on a City Hall flagpole in conjunction with their Constitution Day and Citizenship Day event on or around September 17, 2018.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts, largely undisputed, are drawn from the complaint, D. 1, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, D. 7-8, and the City's opposition, D. 11. The City owns and manages three flagpoles located in front of the entrance to City Hall, in an area called City Hall Plaza. D. 11 at 2; D. 11-1 \u00b6 5. The three poles are the same height, approximately 83 feet tall. D. 11 at 2. One pole regularly displays the flags of the United States and the National League of Families Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (\"POW/MIA\") flag.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A second pole flies the flag of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The dispute in this case centers on the third flagpole, which displays the City of Boston flag except when replaced by another flag-usually at the request of a third-party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such a request is often made in conjunction with a proposed third-party event to take place at a location owned by the City, one of which is City Hall Plaza.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Examples of other flags that have been raised on the third flagpole are country flags, e.g., the flags of Brazil, Ethiopia, Portugal, Puerto Rico, the People's Republic of China and Cuba, and the flags of private organizations, including the Juneteenth flag recognizing the end of slavery, the LGBT rainbow pride flag, the pink transgender rights flag, and the Bunker Hill Association flag. D. 8 at 3; D. 11 at 2. As Plaintiffs allege, the flag of Portugal contains \"dots inside the blue shields represent[ing] the five wounds of Christ when crucified\" and \"thirty dots that represents [sic] the coins Judas received for having betrayed Christ.\" D. 1 \u00b6 36. The City of Boston flag includes the Boston seal's Latin inscription, which translates to \"God be with us as he was with our fathers.\" D. 1 \u00b6 41(a). As Plaintiffs note, the Bunker Hill Flag contains a red St. George's cross. D. 1 \u00b6 41(b). Many religious groups, including Plaintiffs, have held events at City-owned properties in the past. D. 8 at 4; D. 11 at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To apply for a permit to raise a flag at City Hall and hold an event on a City-owned property, a party submits an application to the City. D. 11 at 3; D. 11-1 \u00b6 13. The City has published guidelines on its website for applicants. D. 8 at 3; D. 11 at 3; D. 11-1 \u00b6 13. The guidelines state that an application may be denied if the event\n   involves illegal or dangerous activities or if it conflicts with scheduled events. D. 8 at 3-4; D. 11 at 3. In addition, an application may be denied if the applicant lacks an insurance certification, lies on their application, has a history of damaging city property or failing to pay city fees or fails to comply with other administrative requirements. D. 8 at 4; D. 11 at 3. After a party has submitted an application, the City reviews the request to ensure it complies with all guidelines. D. 1-8 at 2; D. 11 at 3; D.11-1 \u00b6 15. The Commissioner of Property Management reviews applications for the City flagpole to ensure flag requests are \"consistent with the City's message, policies, and practices.\" D. 11 at 3; D. 11-1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The City does not have a written policy regarding the content of flags to be raised. D. 8 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 28, 2017, Plaintiff Shurtleff emailed the City on behalf of his organization, Camp Constitution, requesting to \"raise the Christian flag on City Hall Plaza,\" accompanied by \"short speeches by some local clergy focusing on Boston's history\" on one of several dates in September 2017. D. 1-1. The email included a photograph of the Christian flag, D. 1-1, which \"displays a red Latin cross against a blue square bordered on three sides by a white field.\" D. 1-4. On September 5, 2017, the City denied Shurtleff's request to raise the Christian flag without explanation. D. 1-3. Shurtleff asked for the \"official reason\" for denying the permit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant Rooney wrote to Shurtleff that \"[t]he City of Boston maintains a policy and practice of respectfully refraining from flying non-secular flags on the City Hall flagpoles.\" D. 1-4. Rooney further explained that the City's \"policy and practice\" was based on the First Amendment prohibition on government establishing religion and the City's authority to decide how to use its flagpoles, which are a \"limited government resource.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rooney concluded that \"[t]he City would be willing to consider a request to fly a non-religious flag, should [Shurtleff's] organization elect to offer one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, Plaintiffs' counsel sent a letter to the City on September 14, 2017, taking the position that the denial was unconstitutional and declining to \"submit a 'non-religious' flag.\" D. 1-6 at 2. Plaintiffs' counsel attached a second application for \"Camp Constitution's Christian Flag Raising\" on October 19 or October 26, 2017. D. 1-5. The stated purpose of the event was to \"[c]elebrate and recognize the contributions Boston's Christian community has made to our city's cultural diversity, intellectual capital and economic growth.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852449\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/58/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter stated that if Plaintiffs did not receive a response by September 27, 2017, Plaintiffs would take \"additional actions to prevent irreparable harm to the rights of [their] clients.\" D. 1-6 at 4. The City neither issued a permit to Plaintiffs nor responded to the letter. D. 8 at 5; D. 11 at 4. Since receiving the letter, Plaintiffs have not applied to hold further events on City-owned property, with or without a flag. D. 11 at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the present complaint seeking injunctive relief, declaratory relief and damages against Defendants. D. 1. On July 9, 2018, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. D. 7. On August 9, 2018, the Court heard the parties on the pending motion and took this matter under advisement. D. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs have asserted six claims-three federal and three state constitutional: 1) a violation of the First Amendment free speech clause; 2) a violation of the First Amendment establishment clause; 3) a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause; 4) a violation of\n   the freedom of speech clause of Article 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; 5) a violation of the non-establishment of religion clauses of Articles 2 and 3 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and 6) a violation of equal protection under Articles 1 and 3 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, federal law governs the Court's analysis of the Plaintiffs' claims under both the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Here, neither party has meaningfully cited to Massachusetts law to assess the constitutionality of the City's actions. In a single footnote, Plaintiffs assert that rights to freedom of expression are generally coextensive under the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions and that where the two diverge, the state protections are \"more extensive.\" D. 8 at 6, n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Flaherty v. Knapik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093620\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/999/323/#p332\">\n    999 F.Supp.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (D. Mass. 2014) ). Plaintiffs, however, do not specifically address how these \"more extensive\" protections under Massachusetts law would apply to the instant case. Defendants assert that federal jurisprudence governs the analysis. D. 11 at 5, n. 3. Like Plaintiffs, they note that in some instances, provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution are more protective than those of the United States Constitution, but Defendants contend that those instances are inapplicable to the present case. Because neither party has argued that the Court should rely on Massachusetts law rather than federal law, the Court will address the Massachusetts constitutional claims coextensively with their federal counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the Court considers all factors of the preliminary injunction analysis, \"[t]he sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the merits: if the moving party cannot demonstrate that [it] is likely to succeed in [its] quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.\"\n   <em>\n    New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v.

This Court concludes that the selection and display of the flags on the City flagpole constitute government speech.

Certainly, an event to \"raise the Christian flag\" could serve some of Plaintiffs' cited secular purposes, such as the celebration of religious freedom in Boston and the contributions of Boston's Christian residents to the City. However, its primary purpose would be to convey government endorsement of a particular religion by displaying the Christian flag alongside that of the United States and the Commonwealth in front of City Hall. Blowing in the wind, these side-by-side flags could quite literally become entangled. If Plaintiffs were not seeking government endorsement, then Plaintiffs would presumably be content to raise their own flag on their own in the same location as has been suggested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590259\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2239/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that plaintiffs sought to have their speech displayed on a license plate, rather than on a sticker next to a license plate, because the license plate would \"convey government agreement with the message displayed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    3.

However, none of these cases apply to the regulation of government speech or even private speech in a limited public forum.

The names of the flags alone are enough to reveal their primary purposes.

Although Plaintiffs have not applied to the City to hold an event since September 2017, the record in this case indicates that the City will give Plaintiffs permission to communicate their ideas in several ways, on or around Plaintiffs' requested date this year. As the City has done in the past, it will allow Plaintiffs to hold an event on City Hall Plaza. It will also give Plaintiffs the opportunity to raise a non-secular flag on the City flagpole and display the Christian flag while on City Hall Plaza. D. 1-4; D. 11 at 10. The City has only denied Plaintiffs permission to compel the City to endorse a particular religion by raising the Christian flag.

Those cases, however, involved challenges to federal legislation restricting speech and religious expression, rather than a municipal policy regulating private speech in a limited public forum. Such legislation is reviewed under strict scrutiny, which places the burden on the government to demonstrate a compelling interest in limiting speech and narrow tailoring of the legislation, even at the preliminary injunction stage.\n    <em>\n     Gonzales\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/#p429\">\n     546 U.S. at 429\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/#p429\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

To the extent that Plaintiffs are being treated differently than the groups that raised those flags, that treatment is based on the City's reasonable choice to exclude religion as a subject matter on the flagpole and does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
