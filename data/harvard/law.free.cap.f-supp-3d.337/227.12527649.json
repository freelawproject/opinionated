As to that question, the court drew a distinction between those who\n   <em>\n    follow\n   </em>\n   an established policy, and those who are responsible for the\n   <em>\n    creation\n   </em>\n   of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court of Appeals did not expressly state that the defendants who confiscated plaintiff's Tsalot-Kob were entitled to qualified immunity, but the court's decision plainly focused on the adoption of the policy embodied in Directive 4202, rather than on the implementation of that policy in this instance. The court stated that \"[w]hile the individual corrections officers who confiscated Barnes's Tsalot-Kob may very well have been acting reasonably when following DOCS policy, a different analysis may apply to those responsible for the policy. On this record, it is not apparent whether there was a legitimate penological reason to limit only Tsalot-Kobs to inmates registered as Rastafarian.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Of the remaining defendants, only defendant Nuttall, who is identified as a Deputy Commissioner of Program Services, had anything to do with the creation of the policy in question. Nuttall \"signed off\" on Directive 4202 in 2004, indicating his endorsement of it. Levine Decl. (Dkt. # 194-7, Ex. A.) Defendants Fedele, Furman and Murphy are alleged to have confiscated plaintiff's crown. Defendants Stanley, Chappius and Bartlett reviewed and denied plaintiff's requests for the return of his crown. But other than Nuttall, none of those other defendants were involved in the creation or adoption of the underlying policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the context of the record then before it, the Second Circuit stated that it could not find, as a matter of law, that it was objectively reasonable for the persons responsible for the underlying policy to believe that denying a Tsalot-Kob to an inmate registered as Jewish was constitutional. The court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find, however, that it was objectively\n   <em>\n    un\n   </em>\n   reasonable for those persons to believe such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Rather, the court held that on the record as it then existed, the court could not decide that question at all. The court explained that defendants, up to that point, had not \"provide[d] any legitimate penological reasons behind prison officials' and chaplains' former adherence to a policy that limited Jewish inmates' head coverings to yarmulkes only,\" or \"for deferring to the New York State Board of Rabbis where the sincerity of Barnes's belief was apparently uncontested.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20Fed.%20Appx.%2052\">\n    629 Fed.Appx. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As stated, the court remanded the action to this Court, for further development of the record as to those matters. Thus, the court left open the possibility that on a fuller record, it might be possible to determine as a matter of law whether defendants-including those responsible for the policy-had a legitimate penological reason for the policy, at least sufficient to entitle them to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following the Second Circuit's remand, and in support of their present motion, defendants have stated that the reason for the policy was that Tsalot-Kobs can easily be used to hide contraband, such as drugs and weapons. For that reason, DOCS sought to limit the number of inmates who were allowed to wear Tsalot-Kobs. As defendants put it in their Rule 56 Statement, \"[t]he more inmates wearing crowns, the longer it takes to search the inmate population to find the contraband.\" (Dkt. # 194-1 \u00b6 7.) Therefore, defendants say, the policy \"was designed to make the operation of the correctional facility more efficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By any measure, reducing the risk of smuggled-in contraband is a legitimate penological objective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Thus, defendants having proffered that legitimate reason for the policy, the chief question before this Court is whether defendants could reasonably have thought that the means they adopted or used to effect those ends were constitutionally permissible. I find, as a matter of law, that they could have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The fact that this Court and the Court of Appeals later found that the policy of limiting crowns to self-identified Rastafarians, and allowing only yarmulkes for Jews, violated plaintiff's First Amendment rights, does not mean that the defendants-even those responsible for the policy-are not entitled to qualified immunity. The whole point of qualified immunity is that in certain circumstances, a defendant can be immune from liability\n   <em>\n    in spite of\n   </em>\n   a constitutional violation; in other words, the application of the doctrine presumes that there has been a violation of the plaintiff's rights, in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duffy v.

(Dkt. # 194-7, Ex. A.) The Second Circuit held in this case that by that date, its \"earlier decisions ha[d] clearly established that prison officials may not prohibit a sincere religious practice without some legitimate penological interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20Fed.%20Appx.%2052\">\n    629 Fed.Appx. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court stated that it could not \"say as a matter of law that it was objectively reasonable for [the persons who created the policy] to believe that denying a Tsalot-Kob to an inmate registered as Jewish was constitutional. Moreover, because defendants have not identified\n   any penological interests supporting the policy, we cannot assess the reasonableness of their actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20Fed.%20Appx.%2052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20Fed.%20Appx.%2052\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As stated above, defendants have now identified penological reasons for the policy underlying Directive 4202, insofar as it relates to the restrictions on Tsalot-Kobs. Until this Court and the Court of Appeals held that a policy restricting Tsalot-Kobs to Rastafarians is constitutionally infirm, Nuttall could reasonably have believed that such a restriction was constitutionally permissible, given the legitimate penological interest in reducing the risk of smuggling contraband into prisons. The policy was apparently intended to accommodate inmates' religious rights, while still taking account of genuine and serious security needs. That Nuttall may not have foreseen courts' eventual disapproval of that policy on constitutional grounds does not make his endorsement of the policy objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   And as noted above, the Supreme Court has cautioned that courts must take care to define the right in question at an \"appropriate level of specificity.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p615\">\n    526 U.S. at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p615\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In determining whether the relevant law is \"clearly established,\" courts \"consider the specificity with which a right is defined, the existence of Supreme Court or Court of Appeals case law on the subject, and the understanding of a reasonable officer in light of preexisting law.\"\n   <em>\n    Terebesi v.

But it does mean that in determining whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, a court should consider whether the specific right in question had been addressed by the courts, especially the Supreme Court and the relevant court of appeals. In this case, it does not appear that any higher courts had held, prior to Nuttall's \"signing off\" on Directive 4202, that religious headwear could not lawfully be restricted to members of particular religions. Nuttall cannot be held accountable in damages for failing to prognosticate that courts might later so hold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to the other defendants, Fedele, Furman and Murphy are alleged to have confiscated plaintiff's crown. Defendants' declarations are consistent with that allegation. Fedele states (Dkt. # 198) that on January 21, 2007, he saw plaintiff wearing a head covering that he believed was not allowed under Directive 4202. He reported this to Sergeant Furman, who directed him to confiscate the headwear. Defendant Murphy signed a contraband receipt for the crown, which was turned over to defendant Chaplain Stanley (Dkt. # 194-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In doing so, those defendants were simply following the then-existing DOCS directive. Nothing in the record indicates any reason why they should have questioned the constitutional legitimacy of that directive. Though both this Court and the Court of Appeals later held that the policy was unconstitutional, I find no basis in the record before me to conclude that those defendants acted unreasonably in enforcing Directive 4202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants Stanley, Chappius and Bartlett reviewed and denied plaintiff's requests for the return of his crown. At the time of the relevant events, Stanley was a (non-Jewish) chaplain at Southport. Based on her review of Directive 4202, she opined that a Tsalot-Kob or crown was not appropriate for followers of the Jewish faith. (Dkt. # 194-6.) Chappius, who was the Deputy Superintendent of Security at Southport, informed plaintiff that plaintiff's complaint had been investigated, and that there was no finding of wrongdoing. Chappius also states that based on his reading of Directive 4202, the confiscation of plaintiff's crown was justified. (Dkt. # 194-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Bartlett was a DOCS employee who was a Deputy Superintendent of Programs at Southport. She responded to plaintiff, informing him that in accordance with Directive 4202, he was only allowed to wear a yarmulke, because he had identified himself as a member of the Jewish faith. (Dkt. # 194-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As with the defendants who confiscated plaintiff's crown, these defendants acted reasonably under the circumstances, and had no reason to question the constitutional legitimacy of Directive 4202, insofar as it applied to plaintiff. I find as a matter of law that they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 194) is granted. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 199) is denied. The complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    DOCS has been renamed the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\").
