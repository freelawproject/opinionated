Familiarity with my several prior opinions on dispositive motions is assumed, and this Opinion should\n   be read in conjunction with them.

The current operative pleading is the Seventh Amended Complaint (\"7AC\", ECF no. 87). As to the Commissioner of DCA, my most recent substantive rulings dismissed most of the 7AC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion (\"Dismissal Op.\", ECF no. 97), and Order (\"Dismissal Order\", ECF no. 98); Memorandum and Order denying motion for reconsideration (\"Reconsideration Op.\"), ECF no. 103.)

Prior Court Decisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Some prior litigations involving the Garfield Property (and others) are relevant. I begin by quoting my summary of two prior State court decisions from the Dismissal Opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The first decision is Heine's appeal from separate court orders which, after trial, fined her $1500 for refusing to allow warrantless inspections, and fined her $1750 for maintaining three hazardous conditions in and around her Garfield building.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Super. Ct. App. Div. 2012). The Appellate Division agreed with Heine that the local ordinance, as applied, was unconstitutional insofar as it punished Heine's refusal to permit a warrantless inspection. However, it rejected Heine's challenge to the Garfield property maintenance code as vague, and likewise rejected her claim of selective enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The second decision involves the DCA's determination that plaintiff Heine's Garfield building was an unlicensed rooming house:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioner Ellen Heine appeals from the August 11, 2011 final decision of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (Department).

Moscowitz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This action concerns a property where petitioner and five or six other persons resided. The property, on Van Bussum Avenue in Garfield, had been cited for violations of the construction code and fire safety laws. In September 2010, the Commissioner notified petitioner that she was in violation of the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055\">\n    N.J.

The Appellate Division affirmed DCA's final decision that Heine failed to comply with a state statute requiring a license to operate a rooming house and assessing a $5,000 civil penalty. It considered Heine's argument that the State's definition of a rooming house is discriminatory and unconstitutional, but found it lacked sufficient merit to require discussion in a written opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Dismissal Op. at 2-4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A third case,\n   <em>\n    Heine v.

It is brought on behalf of Ms. Heine and purportedly on behalf of \"Tenants at 515 Van Bussum Ave., Grieco and Ruppert,\" as well as other parties. That case, which challenges the City's warrantless inspections of the Property, remains pending. The Hon. Esther Salas of this Court has dismissed certain of the claims, and a dispositive motion is briefed and pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A fourth decision, also by District Judge Salas, has been entered in\n   <em>\n    Heine v. Dir. of Codes &amp; Standards\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 15-8210,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203981135\">\n    2017 WL 3981135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Sept. 11, 2017) (Copy at Ex. H, ECF no. 164-3 at 50) (the \"8210 Action\"). Noting that the same plaintiffs, including plaintiffs here, had filed multiple, repetitive actions, Judge Salas dismissed the complaint in the 8210 Action with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I focus on the aspects of her decision that are most relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The claims in the 8210 Action involved properties in Montclair and New Brunswick, as well as the Garfield Property that is the subject of this action. Six of the twenty-one named plaintiffs either were tenants of or had a financial connection to the Garfield Property. Defendants included the Commissioner of DCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Salas first dismissed claims involving the towns of Montclair and New Brunswick on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Slip Op. 12-18) She then turned to the allegations against DCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to DCA, Judge Salas again applied\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . (Slip Op. 18-23) The claims against the Commissioner of DCA, she found, had been finally adjudicated in prior actions relating to the properties in Montclair and New Brunswick. Those claims against DCA, as Judge Salas described them, were (a) that DCA exercised inadequate oversight as to the municipalities' code enforcement activities; and (b) that it violated the Constitution by the manner in which it promulgated or enforced regulations under the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979, the Uniform Construction Code, and the Uniform Fire Code. Those claims, held Judge Salas, had already been decided in DCA's favor and against the plaintiffs, including Heine, by final judgments entered in the three actions cited. (See n.4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The 8210 Action's addition of Garfield plaintiffs (such as the Griecos), Judge Salas held, did not negate the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect of the earlier Montclair and New Brunswick judgments. The federal complaint in the 8210 Action, she wrote, did not \"identif[y] any additional conduct by the DCA\" that would distinguish the current complaint from the prior ones. (Slip Op. at 21-22) Thus the 8210 Action's claims as to DCA had already been adjudicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At any rate, Judge Salas wrote, the allegations against the Commissioner of DCA involving,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the Griecos and Burke (and therefore the Garfield Property) failed to meet Rule 8's pleading standards. (Slip Op. 20 n.23). The Complaint in the 8210 Action alleged generally that DCA somehow exercised inadequate oversight and violated the Constitution in relation to rooming house, fire safety, and construction regulations. (Slip Op. 19) It further alleged that the Griecos and others \"experienced negativity in housing due to single status\" because their residence had been incorrectly designated as a rooming house. They allegedly sought to reoccupy the Garfield Property, which the City had closed five years previously based on an Imminent Hazard Notice. Nothing about these allegations, wrote Judge Salas, came close to factually alleging a federal claim. (Slip Op. 20 n.23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Judge Salas carefully analyzed the grounds for dismissal and concluded, particularly in light of the plaintiffs many prior related actions, that amendment\n   would be futile. The 8210 Action was therefore dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this action the plaintiffs, Ellen Heine,\n   <em>\n    et at\n   </em>\n   , identify themselves as, among other things, \"occupants and tenants and beneficiaries\" of a building at 515 Van Bussum Avenue in Garfield, New Jersey (the \"Property\"). (7AC \u00b6 1) It is alleged that the Property was improperly regulated as a rooming house by the DCA, and/or improperly closed based on code violations and fire hazards. Plaintiffs filed the 7AC against the Commissioner of DCA in his official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Governmental entities also named as defendants were the Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards (\"BRBHS\") (a subdivision of DCA); the Bergen County Division of Youth and Family Services (\"DYFS\"); and \"other NJ state agencies and entities.\" All claims have been dismissed against those defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Opinion, ECF no. 97; Dismissal Order, ECF no. 98.) Also named as a defendant in one count was J.P. Morgan Chase, N.A. I granted Chase's motion to dismiss the 7AC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion and Order, ECF nos. 127, 128; Order and Opinion on Reconsideration, ECF nos. 142, 143.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only remaining defendant, then, is the Commissioner of DCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Surviving Allegations of the 7AC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In my prior Dismissal Opinion (ECF no. 97) I noted that all claims for damages, except for one under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), had earlier been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment. The 7AC, however, added claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. For the most part these, too, failed to survive Eleventh Amendment scrutiny; the only claims as to which I found subject matter jurisdiction were federal-law claims against the Commissioner of the DCA for injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Title II of the ADA, and the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"). I then held that the complaint failed to state a cause of action under the ADA, but did state a claim for injunctive relief under section 1983 and the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to surviving issues, for ease of reference I quote a relevant portion of the Dismissal Opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Injunctive Relief under \u00a7 1983 and the FHA\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   As discussed, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction only as to Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 and FHA claims against the Commissioner, insofar as they seek prospective relief-in practical terms, an injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   To obtain injunctive relief, the court must consider whether: \"(1) the moving party has shown actual success on the merits; (2) the moving party will be irreparably injured by the denial of injunctive relief; (3) the granting of the permanent injunction will result in even greater harm to the defendant; and (4) the injunction would be in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Coffelt v.

The State, however, focused primarily on matters such as the preclusive effect of my prior ruling or\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , grounds which I have found inapplicable. The merits of the claims have not been thoroughly briefed. I do note, however, that the Complaint, it is true, asserts a bewildering variety of half-expressed theories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Most if not all would probably be doomed by a showing that the properties were closed based on basic health and safety violations, as opposed to any concern unique to regulation of rooming houses or their occupants.

In Sections III.A, B, and C, I discuss the issues raised by the Commissioner. In Section III.D, I raise\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   other fundamental flaws in the plaintiffs' claims, chiefly the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bar and failure to establish the essential elements of a substantive claim under \u00a7 1983 or the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Throughout this case, the most active\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs have purported to speak for other persons named as plaintiffs. On March 27, 2018, Magistrate Judge Clark ordered that any named plaintiff wishing to continue \"shall either file their own motion and/or opposition to Defendant's forthcoming [dispositive] motion or shall submit a notice of joinder in a co-Plaintiffs motion in writing.\" (ECF no. 160) Failure to do so, wrote Judge Clark, would constitute \"confirmation of that Plaintiff's non-opposition to the dismissal of their claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Only four of the named plaintiffs have joined in the opposition to the Commissioner's motion or otherwise signaled their continued participation in this lawsuit. They are: Ellen Heine, Chris Grieco, Ann Schildknecht, and Unita Peri-Okonny. Preliminarily, then, the action will be dismissed as to the nonresponding plaintiffs: Caitlin and Therese Ruppert, Joseph Fabics (deceased), Ryan Moskowitz, Paul Wondowsky, and John F. Malone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Commissioner is Entitled to Judgment Because the Property was Closed by the City of Garfield Based on Hazardous Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs Heine,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , are suing the Commissioner, claiming that the State's regulation of the Garfield property as a \"rooming house\" is illegal. I set that issue aside until the following section, however, because a major premise of the argument-that the Commissioner as regulator of rooming houses is responsible for closing the Property and evicting the occupants-is factually unsustainable. As I pointed out in my prior Dismissal Opinion (quoted at p. 476,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), \"[m]ost if not all [of the remaining claims] would probably be doomed by a showing that the properties were closed based on basic health and safety violations, as opposed to any concern unique to regulation of rooming houses or their occupants.\" That showing has now been made. The City of Garfield (and not the DCA) closed the Property because it was in a hazardous condition (and not because Heine was operating an unlicensed rooming house).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Commissioner casts the argument as one of Article III standing-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that no injury cognizable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or the FHA is traceable to the Commissioner\n   or the DCA. Whether viewed as a standing issue or as failure to state a claim, however, the issue is the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Section 1983 imposes liability only on a \"person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Notice of Imminent Hazard and Order to Vacate, however, were issued by the City of Garfield, not the DCA. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9) The City was authorized to do so by its municipal Code. The Code empowers the local fire department and fire safety official to enforce the Uniform Fire Safety Act and New Jersey Uniform Fire Code within the City of Garfield.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   City of Garfield, N.J.

That determination was factually supported and upheld by the State appellate court, as discussed in section III.C,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . But even if incorrect, that determination was not the basis for closing the Property or evicting the occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In an attempt to attribute the closure to the DCA, the plaintiffs have made conclusory allegations of an oversight, agency, or other relationship between DCA and the City of Garfield. They have not produced any evidence, however, that DCA or its Commissioner, either by implementation of a policy or by direct action, brought about the City's closure of the Property in violation of \u00a7 1983 or the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiffs generally cite the DCA's statutory authority to enforce the Uniform Fire Safety Act (UFSA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2052\">\n    N.J.

The Appellate Division also considered Heine's contentions that the DCA's actions were discriminatory in rooming house matters, that the standard for unrelated single people is discriminatory, and that the actions of the DCA violated due process and property rights. It rejected those contentions without further discussion because they lacked sufficient merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It is thus\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   that the Property was correctly deemed a rooming house based on its physical and other characteristics, on a non-discriminatory basis. Even viewing the evidence afresh, no other conclusion\n   is possible.

The plaintiffs in that action included Heine and most or all of the plaintiffs here, and the defendants included the Commissioner of DCA. The complaint in the 8210 Action, as Judge Salas found, encompassed claims (a) that DCA exercised inadequate oversight as to the municipalities' code enforcement activities; and (b) that it violated the Constitution by the manner in which it enforced, or promulgated regulations under, the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979, the Uniform Construction Code, and the Uniform Fire Code. Judge Salas held that those claims had already been decided in DCA's favor and against the plaintiffs, including Heine.

Read very generously, they seem to start from the premise that rooming houses (with their smaller, single-room-occupancy units) would tend to attract the unmarried, or smaller families. (No evidence is offered as to the extent to which that is true.) The idea, at any rate, seems to be that by imposing fire safety and other requirements on rooming houses (as defined by State law), the DCA is somehow discriminating against certain family configurations: for example, people living alone, or\n   unrelated persons in nontraditional families.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"familial status\" that is a protected category under the FHA, however, is that of having one or more individuals under the age of 18 domiciled with a parent or guardian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even in such cases, however, policies of general application that only indirectly impact family status will be upheld.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mountain Side Mobile Estates P'ship v.

FHA claims found to be viable have typically involved facially family-averse policies, such as an apartment building's express refusal to rent upper-floor apartments to families with children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garden Homes Management Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494076\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/156/413/#p423\">\n    156 F.Supp.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423-26 (D.N.J. 2001). There is no such policy here; moreover, the only \"discriminatory\" action alleged is protection from fire and unsanitary conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The justification for health, safety, and fire regulations here, whether state or local, is obvious, and it is neutral as to family status. The concerns of the RBHA have nothing to do with the family arrangements of the building's occupants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The actions taken against the Garfield Property in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case-to the extent attributable to the DCA at all,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   -were taken for nondiscriminatory health and safety reasons, as demonstrated by uncontradicted record evidence. The cited violations (lack of smoke detectors, obstructed exits, locked units, etc.) would not fall more heavily on families with children than on others. Indeed, no particular impact on families, disparate or otherwise, appears in the record-except perhaps in the trivial sense that families, just like single persons,\n   may have to be relocated from properties found to be unsafe. These are not class-specific restrictions that \"did not apply to those outside the protected classes.\"\n   <em>\n    Curto v. A Country Place Condominium Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Jan. 31, 2018) (rejecting challenge to sex-segregated hours for swimming pool in apartment complex). And the only \"exclusion\" is the closing down of buildings unfit for habitation by anyone, married or single. The plaintiffs fail to allege, let alone prove, how anything about this enforcement related to the occupants' family status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The \u00a7 1983 claim is, if anything, flimsier. Based on the same allegations, it simply posits violations of the \"rights of individuals\" and lists a number of constitutional provisions. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , 7AC \u00b6 12) No specific claim of violation of a particular constitutional provision is specified. The \"discrimination\" alleged seems to revolve around evolving family standards, but no recognized claim is stated. And even these vague claims are not specifically tied to the family status of any occupant of the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Judge Salas found in relation to the earlier, similar claims, the plaintiff asserts generalized grievances about the running of government, untethered to specific claims of constitutional violations and a resulting cognizable, concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8210 Action, Slip Op. at 27 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fabics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205167153\">\n    2015 WL 5167153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For these alternative reasons, then, summary judgment would be appropriate even if this action surmounted the threshold bar of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 164) is GRANTED.
