(Dkt. No. 60, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50). This Court granted Defendants' motions for summary judgment.

As set forth below, the summary judgment motion by Defendants County of Rensselaer, Jack Mahar, and David Hetman (Dkt. No. 149) is granted with respect to Jack Mahar and David Hetman and denied with respect to the County of Rensselaer. The summary judgment motion by Defendant Elaine Young (Dkt. No. 151) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At all relevant times, the three Plaintiffs were employees at the Rensselaer County Jail (\"Jail\"), which the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department oversees. Defendant Jack Mahar (\"Sheriff Mahar\") was Rensselaer County Sheriff. Defendant David Hetman was a Lieutenant at the Jail. Defendant Elaine Young (\"Nurse Young\") was a Registered Nurse employed at the Jail as Nursing Supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The nearby Samaritan Hospital (\"Samaritan\") provided Jail nursing staff with access to its electronic medical records\n   through a computer terminal in the nurses' station. The nursing staff was authorized to access only inmate records and only for authorized purposes. Nurse Young was entrusted with the password for this system and was expected to keep the password secure. Plaintiffs claim that Nurse Young instead taped the password to a drawer in her office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in or around 2004, Sheriff Mahar instituted a policy to monitor and limit the use of sick days by Jail employees. Employees who violated the sick policy were placed on \"sick abuse\" status and were denied privileges or required to submit a physician's note explaining their absences. Plaintiffs allege that, in instituting this policy, Sheriff Mahar scrutinized the sick days of employees that he personally did not like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The amended complaint states that Plaintiff Keith Hancock was placed on sick abuse multiple times because he was a labor union official in the Sheriffs Employees Association of Rensselaer County. In March 2013, Hancock received a letter from Samaritan informing him that his medical records may have been improperly accessed by Jail employees on January 9, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Tamera Thomas injured her hand in January 2007 in the course of duty and was treated at Samaritan's emergency room. Thomas applied for workers' compensation for lost pay and medical expenses in connection with this injury, but was denied. She received a letter from Samaritan in March 2013 informing her that her medical records may have been improperly accessed on January 26, 2007, which she alleges was shortly after she applied for workers' compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Jason Dessingue underwent heart surgery in August 2011. He alleges that Sheriff Mahar was hostile toward him because he endorsed another candidate for Sheriff. Dessingue received a letter in March 2013 informing him that his records may have been improperly accessed by Jail employees on August 23, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   All three Plaintiffs allege that they did not give permission for the allegedly improper accesses. They further allege that Sheriff Mahar personally directed his employees, including Defendants Hetman and Nurse Young, to access Plaintiffs' records to verify their medical treatment. The amended complaint claims that, in so doing, Defendants violated Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy in their medical information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages from all Defendants and punitive damages from all Defendants except the County of Rensselaer (\"County\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Disputed Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is undisputed that none of Plaintiffs' accessed records revealed any psychological or emotional treatment. (Thomas Dep. 33; Dessingue Dep. 17; Hancock Dep. 16). Similarly, there is no evidence suggesting that Plaintiffs were treated for HIV or any\n   other variety of sexually transmitted disease. (See Hancock Dep. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The following facts remain in dispute. Defendants argue that Hancock does not know what records were accessed, nor did he confirm from Samaritan what records were accessed. (Hancock Dep. 34-35). Defendants contend that Thomas does not know what medical records were accessed, or what records could possibly have been accessed. (Dkt. No. 123-4, \u00b6 9). Defendants assert that the only records that could have been seen were Thomas' treatment for an injured hand and possibly a prescription for an emotional or psychiatric condition, although Thomas never went to Samaritan for \"any psychiatric related matter.\" (Thomas Dep. 19, 27, 33-34, 58). Plaintiffs contend, however, that although Thomas admitted she did not know what information was accessed, she knows it included her emergency room reports, each of which includes her present complaints and prior medical history, including her smoking habits and living situation. (Dkt. No. 132-16, pp. 1-2; see generally Dkt. No. 132-44). Plaintiffs also note that, according to the deposition testimony of Patricia Ahrens, the individuals accessing Plaintiffs' records could have seen all of Thomas' and Dessingue's emergency room visits and all related treatments, orders, and notes, as well as all of Hancock's lab test results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ahrens Dep. 67, 76-77, 115-116, 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants dispute that Plaintiffs have any evidence that any Defendant was responsible for accessing their medical records. (Dkt. Nos. 123-4, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 20, 26; 151-11, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24). Plaintiffs contend that circumstantial evidence, including the timing of the access, supports a finding that it was Defendants who accessed the records. (Dkt. No. 156, pp. 7-9). Hancock alleges that his records were accessed while the Sheriff's Department monitored him for sick abuse and that the Sheriff suspected him of illicit drug use. (Hancock Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 7). He also alleges that Sheriff Mahar was angry at him for resigning from an awards committee that was important to the Sheriff. (Id. \u00b6 8). Plaintiffs note that someone accessed Thomas' records at about the time she applied for worker's compensation benefits. (Thomas Dep. 66). Dessingue's records were accessed while he was on sick leave for a heart condition, and Plaintiffs allege that Hetman had on \"three or four\" occasions inquired why he was out and when he would return. (Dessingue Dep. 73-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants are the only people with a motive to access Plaintiffs' records. (Young Dep. 27 (stating that she did not \"know who would benefit\" from accessing Plaintiffs' records, but then admitting that Sheriff Mahar \"may.\") ). Regarding evidence that Defendants were the individuals responsible for acting upon this alleged motive, Plaintiffs direct the Court to the deposition testimony of Lieutenant James Karam, the Jail's head of internal affairs. Karam testified that Sheriff Mahar instructed him to tell Samaritan to delay notifying patients whose records were accessed because the Sheriff did not want another Jail employee whose records were also allegedly accessed to find out. (Karam Dep. 34, 83). Furthermore, Sheriff Mahar testified that he had instituted a policy in which employees requesting sick leave would be directed to his secretary so that the Sheriff could maintain a more accurate list of which employees were on sick leave. (Mahar Dep. 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to Nurse Young, Plaintiffs assert that she was at work on every occasion that Plaintiffs' records were accessed. (Dkt. No. 132-21; 132-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurse Young contends she was not at work on August 23, 2011, the day Dessignue's records were viewed, and denies accessing his or Thomas' records. (Dkt. No. 151-9; Young Dep. 26). She admits accessing Hancock's records on January 9, 2009, allegedly at his request. (Young Dep. 22). Hancock denies making such a request. (Hancock Dep. 46). Plaintiffs also allege that when Nurse Young was handed service of process in another lawsuit, she exclaimed: \"The Sheriff does his dirty work and I get screwed.\" (Dkt. No. 132-48). Furthermore, Nurse Young testified that the password to access Samaritan's records was kept in the desk in her office; that her office was kept locked when she was not present; and that only she, Hetman, and the watch commander had a key to her office. (Young Dep. 46, 57). Lastly, Plaintiffs note that Hetman oversaw the medical unit of the Jail. (Hetman Dep. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 25, 2016, Nurse Young moved for summary judgment, and on February 26, 2016 the remaining Defendants did the same (Dkt. Nos. 122 and 123). Defendants primarily argued that their conduct did not violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights to privacy, relying on\n   <em>\n    Matson v. Board of Education of City School District of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086517\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/57/\">\n    631 F.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2011). This Court agreed. The Court read\n   <em>\n    Matson\n   </em>\n   to hold that constitutional privacy protection attaches where a condition is serious and its disclosure would be \"stigmatizing,\" that is, the disclosure would expose a person not to understanding or compassion but to discrimination and intolerance. Concluding that, under\n   <em>\n    Matson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs did not possess constitutionally-protected privacy interests regarding the medical conditions in issue, the Court granted summary judgment and dismissed the action in its entirety with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208732374\">\n    2016 WL 8732374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Upon Plaintiffs' timely appeal, the Second Circuit vacated this Court's decision and remanded the case.\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n    882 F.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit ruled that the seriousness and stigma attached to a disclosed medical condition are factors for consideration, not threshold questions in determining whether a third party's disclosure of a plaintiff's medical records constitutes a Fourteenth Amendment violation. Thus, the Second Circuit held that when addressing Plaintiffs' claims herein, this Court should have engaged in a balancing of interests, taking into account all aspects of the individual privacy interest and the government's intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n    at 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings, including a consideration of whether the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, on March 19, 2018, Defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.

In conducting this analysis, the Second Circuit has identified three factors relevant to whether a right was clearly established: \"(1) whether the right in question was defined with reasonable specificity; (2) whether the decisional law of the Supreme Court and the [Second Circuit] support the existence of the right in question; and (3) whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would have understood that his or her acts were unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Shechter v.

The Court views all relevant facts in Plaintiffs' favor. Even assuming that the individual Defendants accessed the full breadth of medical information that Ahrens described as possible, there is no evidence in Plaintiffs' records of HIV, transsexualism, mental health treatments, or any other condition that would expose them to discrimination, intolerance, hostility, opprobrium, or other social stigma, or would otherwise \"provoke an intense desire to preserve one's medical confidentiality.\"\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720014\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/107/#p111\">\n    175 F.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, even accepting Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants acted maliciously, under what Defendants would have understood to be the applicable standard, they would not reasonably have known that their conduct violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.

Defendants dispute that Plaintiffs can prove any direct action on the part of Sheriff Mahar, but Plaintiffs assert that sufficient circumstantial evidence exists to create an issue of fact. (Dkt.

The Court finds that a sufficient question of fact exists as to whether Sheriff Mahar directed the alleged invasion of Plaintiffs' privacy and, if so, whether his conduct may be attributable to the County. The timing of the access to Plaintiffs' records and the procedure requiring employees requesting sick leave to contact Sheriff Mahar's secretary raise questions of fact as to whether the Sheriff was personally involved in Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   privacy violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Thomas Dep. 66; Hancock Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 7; Dessingue Dep. 41-43, 73-74; Dkt.

Evidence that Sheriff Mahar had a personal dislike for Hancock and Dessingue raises questions of fact as to whether: (1) Sheriff Mahar directed that Plaintiffs' records be accessed; (2) Sheriff Mahar acted arbitrarily or maliciously in doing so, as opposed to in furtherance of ensuring that no employees abused sick leave; and (3) whether Sheriff Mahar's actions were the result of a personal vendetta against Plaintiffs as opposed to an unconstitutional application of the official sick leave policy. (Hancock Aff. \u00b6 8; Dessingue Dep. 25-26, 51-53). Finally, in view of the Second Circuit's articulation in\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   of the weight given to the relative weakness of Plaintiffs' privacy interest, the Court finds a question of fact as to whether Plaintiffs' privacy interest is sufficient to overcome Sheriff Mahar's reasons for allegedly accessing or directing his employees to access Plaintiffs' medical records.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515977\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/58/\">\n    882 F.3d at 66-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
