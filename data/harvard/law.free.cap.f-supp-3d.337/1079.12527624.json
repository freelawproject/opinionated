Simon, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Scott E. Stafne (\"Stafne\") is an attorney in the State of Washington. He brings this action on his own behalf. Stafne asserts claims against three senior federal judges and a county sheriff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before Stafne filed this lawsuit, each Federal Judge Defendant had elected what is known as \"senior status\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   this lawsuit, Stafne challenges the constitutionality of that statute under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Stafne argues that after the Federal Judge Defendants elected senior status, they became mere \"judicial volunteers,\" who cannot lawfully exercise federal jurisdiction over Stafne, or any litigant whom Stafne represents, without the express consent of all parties in any particular lawsuit. Stafne also alleges that the Federal Judge Defendants have erroneously concluded in other cases that the court in those cases had subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and made other errors. In the lawsuit now before this Court, Stafne seeks various forms of relief against the Federal Judge Defendants, including: (1) a declaration that any orders issued by the Federal Judge Defendants in other cases are void; (2) an injunction requiring the Federal Judge Defendants to withdraw from continuing to preside over or hear any case in which Stafne is a lawyer or litigant; and (3) money damages. Against Sheriff Trenary, Stafne seeks declaratory relief, asking the Court to declare the legal consequences if Sheriff Trenary were to comply with a specific order that Judge Zilly previously issued in one of Stafne's cases. The Federal Judge Defendants have moved to dismiss the pending action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim. Sheriff Trenary has moved to dismiss this lawsuit for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A person allegedly aggrieved by an order, decision, or judgment in a federal case has several avenues for relief. \"Congress has provided carefully structured procedures for taking appeals, including interlocutory appeals, and for petitioning for extraordinary writs in Title 28 of the United States Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullis v. U.S. Bankr. Ct. for Dis. of Nev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6544808,1747932\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1385/\">\n    828 F.2d 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1394 (9th Cir. 1987). The collateral attack doctrine directs that challenges to the orders, decisions, or judgments of a court other than through these well-recognized procedures are generally improper, and to allow such collateral attacks would \"seriously undercut[ ] the orderly process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340034\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/300/#p313\">\n    514 U.S. 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119138,1340034\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1493/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340034\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/300/#p313\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). The complementary doctrine of absolute judicial immunity also serves to \"discourage[ ] collateral attacks\" and to \"help[ ] to establish appellate procedures as the standard system for correcting judicial error.\"\n   <em>\n    Forrester v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p225\">\n    484 U.S. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p225\">\n    108 S.Ct. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p225\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Stafne currently has two cases before the Federal Judge Defendants. Rather than seek relief for any alleged errors through proper channels in those cases, Stafne filed this lawsuit. Through this action, Stafne attempts an end-run around the carefully-crafted and well-recognized processes designed to protect the rights of all litigants and the orderly administration of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Longstanding principles providing for appellate review, finality, and the orderly process of law dictate dismissal of this lawsuit. Much of Stafne's Complaint is merely a collateral attack on the orders and decisions made by other judges in\n   other cases, which a different judge in a different case is without jurisdiction to hear. This district judge also lacks the authority to grant Stafne the declaratory or injunctive relief that he seeks because doing so would require this Court to issue what is, in effect, a writ of mandamus on a parallel or even superior court. Further, equitable relief is improper when a litigant has an adequate remedy at law. Under the facts alleged, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Stafne, he has an adequate remedy at law through direct appeal or mandamus in the cases in which he or his clients claim to have been injured. That is the proper route for addressing the arguments that Stafne raises in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity-itself a bulwark against collateral attack-bars Stafne's monetary claims against the Federal Judge Defendants. Judicial immunity is not overcome by Stafne's allegation that the position of \"senior federal judge\" violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Finally, Stafne's claims against Defendant Trenary must be dismissed because they constitute a collateral attack on an order of another district court and, to the extent Stafne seeks money damages, that claim is not ripe for review because Sheriff Trenary has not yet executed the court order at issue. Thus, the Court grants with prejudice the motions to dismiss filed by the Federal Judge Defendants and Sheriff Trenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Stafne's Earlier Lawsuits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Stafne is an attorney admitted to practice before the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. Stafne has represented clients before the Western District of Washington and the Ninth Circuit and states that he intends to continue to do so. Stafne also has represented himself as a party before the Western District of Washington and the Ninth Circuit and states that he likely will do so again. In addition to his legal practice, Stafne is engaged in educational and political activities, often concerning the American justice system. He also is involved with private legal publishing companies and in the home foreclosure industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Stafne currently is a party in two cases pending before the Federal Judge Defendants. The first is\n   <em>\n    Stafne v. Burnside, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:16-cv-0753-JCC (W.D. Wash.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   \"). Judge Coughenour presides over the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   case, in which Stafne alleges claims of unfair debt collection and unlawful trade practices. After the stipulated dismissal of one defendant, Judge Coughenour stayed the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second case is\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon v. Stafne\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:16-cv-0077-TSZ (W.D. Wash.) (\"\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   \"). Judge Zilly presides over the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case, which is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action to quiet title relating to property that Stafne owns in Snohomish County, Washington. The Bank of New York Mellon sought to foreclose on Stafne's property based on a 2005 deed of trust. Stafne moved to dismiss that case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and asked that Judge Zilly abstain from deciding the case. Judge Zilly denied Stafne's\n   motion. Stafne appealed that denial, and the Ninth Circuit dismissed Stafne's appeal on the ground that Judge Zilly's order was not yet final or otherwise appealable. Judge Zilly granted summary judgment in favor of the Bank of New York Mellon and entered a partial judgment, judicially foreclosing on Stafne's property. Stafne appealed that order to the Ninth Circuit. Stafne also moved for an order staying the district court's order of foreclosure pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While this second appeal in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   was pending, the Bank of New York Mellon moved to amend its partial judgment to include certain information required under Washington law to foreclose on real property. Judge Zilly issued an order stating that the district court could not amend the partial judgment without leave from the Ninth Circuit because Stafne had appealed the partial judgment and that appeal was still pending. Judge Zilly directed the Bank of New York Mellon to notify the Ninth Circuit under Rule 12.1 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that the district court would grant the motion to amend, if allowed to do so by the Ninth Circuit. A motions panel of the Ninth Circuit, which included Judge Silverman, remanded the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case to Judge Zilly for the limited purpose of considering the motion to amend the partial judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the Ninth Circuit's remand, Plaintiff's brother and a co-defendant in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   , Todd Stafne, passed away. The district court allowed substitution by Todd Stafne's personal representative. Afterward, Stafne asked Judge Zilly to recuse himself. Stafne argued both that Judge Zilly was not properly appointed as an Article III judge under the Appointments Clause after he took senior status and that Judge Zilly was biased in favor of the law firm representing the Bank of New York Mellon (Davis Wright Tremaine LLP) and against Stafne as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant. Judge Zilly denied Stafne's request for recusal and referred the motion to the Chief Judge for the Western District of Washington, who affirmed that denial. Stafne filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Chief District Judge again denied. The parties agreed to a continuance of the motion to amend the partial judgment. While the motion to amend was pending, Stafne filed a separate lawsuit, which is the case now before this Court. Based in part on Stafne's filing of this new lawsuit, Judge Zilly stayed the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Stafne's Claims in this Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Stafne alleges that the American judicial system is biased in favor of parties with significant financial resources and that federal courts unfairly discriminate against\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants and attorneys from small, rather than large, law firms. Stafne also alleges that federal courts routinely but improperly render decisions without explaining the bases of their jurisdiction and routinely act without subject matter jurisdiction, particularly in foreclosure disputes. Stafne argues that this practice has injured Stafne, his clients, and others who have litigated or will litigate foreclosure disputes in federal courts within the Ninth Circuit. In his Complaint, Stafne discusses several cases that he contends are examples of this behavior, including several in which Stafne has appeared as an attorney for others. Stafne also alleges that his exercise of free speech and his representation of some clients in foreclosure actions have led to unfair treatment and retaliation by judges in federal courts in the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Stafne also argues that Congress' creation of the position of \"senior judge\" violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, contained in Article II, \u00a7 2. Stafne incorporates by reference a law review\n   article written by David R. Stras and Ryan W. Scott.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stafne argues that for the reasons discussed by Judge Stras and Professor Scott, the Federal Judge Defendants do not validly exercise federal judicial power under Article III. Stafne argues that, as senior judges, the Federal Judge Defendants do not properly hold the office of an Article III Judge, but instead act as mere \"judicial volunteers.\" Stafne adds that although the Western District of Washington has a policy that litigants may consent to a case being heard by a U.S. Magistrate Judge or a U.S. Bankruptcy Judge, there is no similar policy for seeking or requiring consent to a case being heard by a \"senior judge.\" Stafne also asserts that \"active judges\" in the Western District of Washington do not provide meaningful oversight of the work of senior judges. Finally, Stafne alleges that senior judges are either incompetent based on their age or are biased because they are unpaid for the judicial work that they perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case specifically, Stafne alleges that the Western District of Washington and the Davis Wright Tremaine law firm \"worked together\" to arrange for Senior District Judge Zilly to be assigned to that case. Stafne also contends that in presiding over the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   lawsuit, Judge Zilly acted out of \"bias\" against Stafne and in favor of Davis Wright Tremaine and large law firms generally. Stafne further alleges that Judge Zilly agreed to hear\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   out of a \"desire to retaliate\" against Stafne and to impress upon Stafne that homeowners have no chance of obtaining justice in a foreclosure action. In addition, Stafne asserts that Judge Zilly improperly reached the merits in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   , failed to \"comprehend his duty to not arbitrarily and without explanation invoke jurisdiction an Article III district court does not have,\" and improperly authorized the foreclosure of Stafne's property, even though some facts that are needed to authorize a foreclosure had not yet been established. Stafne argues that in addition to occupying a position that violates the structural provisions of the U.S. Constitution designed to protect individual liberty, Judge Zilly has denied Stafne due process. Finally, Stafne alleges that actions taken by both Senior District Judge Zilly and Senior Circuit Judge Silverman in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   caused Todd Stafne, Stafne's brother, to suffer a stress-related heart attack and, ultimately, death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   case, Stafne alleges that Senior District Judge Coughenour was required to advise Stafne that Judge Coughenour had agreed to hear the case as a \"judicial volunteer.\" Stafne adds that he had the right to withhold consent to a senior judge presiding over that case and states that he never consented to Judge Coughenour hearing that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Stafne requests \"whatever relief may be available\" to prevent senior judges from hearing cases in which he is a litigant or an attorney or to prevent senior judges from hearing cases without the consent of all parties. Stafne also seeks an order requiring all senior federal judges to explain\n   how and why they have jurisdiction in each case in which their jurisdiction is challenged. Further, in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case, Stafne seeks to have Judge Zilly disqualified from that matter and requests an order be entered in this separate action that declares all of Judge Zilly's previous orders in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case are\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   on the grounds that they were entered in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction. Stafne also seeks an order in this case disqualifying Senior Ninth Circuit Judge Silverman from continuing to hear the appeal in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case. Stafne also seeks an order in this case directing the Ninth Circuit to rescind its previously-issued order of remand in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case. Similarly, in the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   case, Stafne seeks an order in this case directing Judge Coughenour to withdraw from continuing to hear the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stafne also seeks relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985 against Judge Zilly and Judge Silverman, arguing that by purporting to act as federal judges and ordering, or not vacating, a judicial sale of Stafne's real property, Judges Zilly and Silverman deprived Stafne of his constitutional rights. Stafne also alleges that Judges Zilly and Silverman purposefully exercised jurisdiction in a matter in which they lacked subject matter jurisdiction solely to retaliate against Stafne for his criticism of federal courts, in violation of Stafne's rights under the First Amendment. Stafne alleges that these actions have caused him physical, psychological, and financial injury. Finally, Stafne seeks contingent relief against Defendant Trenary, in the event that he were to cause the sale of Stafne's real property under an order issued by Judge Zilly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Federal Judge Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Federal Judge Defendants move to dismiss Stafne's claims on several grounds. Among other things, the Federal Judge Defendants argue that Stafne's claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985 are not cognizable against them because they did not act under color of\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law. The Federal Judge Defendants also argue that Stafne's claims are an improper\n   <em>\n    collateral attack\n   </em>\n   on other litigation and, to the extent that Stafne seeks injunctive relief relating to other cases, such equitable relief is unavailable because Stafne has an adequate remedy at law. Further, the Federal Judge Defendants argue that they have absolute judicial immunity against Stafne's claims seeking money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Whether the challenged actions are of a kind that are normally performed by a judge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   All of the actions of the Federal Judge Defendants about which Stafne complains are actions and functions that are normally performed by a judge. Although Stafne argues that the Federal Judge Defendants did not constitutionally continue to hold federal judicial office after they elected senior status, Stafne cannot-and does not-dispute that all of the actions taken by Judge Zilly and Judge Silverman in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case and all of the actions taken by Judge Coughenour in the\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   case were actions and functions normally performed by a judge in a lawsuit. These actions included receiving and reviewing legal memoranda and briefs, hearing oral argument in a courtroom, granting or denying motions, and entering orders or judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Stafne also argues, at least implicitly, that judicial immunity applies only to \"judges\" and after electing senior status the Federal Judge Defendants are no longer judges under Article III, based on Stafne's Appointments Clause argument. Stafne, however, does not explicitly argue that the Federal Judge Defendants are not \"judges.\" Indeed, he appears to concede that they can lawfully decide federal cases provided that all parties consent. Stafne, thus, is not arguing that the Federal Judge Defendants are not judges for purposes of judicial immunity, only that they no longer hold authority under Article III. Accordingly, the actions about which Stanfe complains were all judicial acts, and the first exception to judicial immunity does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Whether there was a clear lack of all subject matter jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The second exception is when there was a \"clear lack\" of all subject matter jurisdiction. Stafne's argument on this point takes two forms. First, Stafne argues that Judge Zilly and Judge Silverman lacked subject matter jurisdiction specifically in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   lawsuit because the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, upon which the Bank of New York Mellon asserted subject matter jurisdiction, were not met. Second, Stafne argues that all of the Federal Judge Defendants acted without subject matter jurisdiction because, as senior judges, they did not constitutionally continue to hold federal judicial office after electing senior status, at least without the consent of all parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   According to Stafne, Judge Zilly acted in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   because the plaintiff, the Bank of New York Mellon, failed to plead sufficient facts to invoke the district court's diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stafne argued before Judge Zilly that the Bank of New York Mellon did not allege the specific State in which it had its principal office. In its complaint, the Bank of New York Mellon alleged that it was a corporation. Thus, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, it is a citizen of both its State of incorporation and the State in which it has its principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The Bank of New York Mellon also alleged in its complaint that it was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business and headquarters in New York. Thus, for purposes of Stafne's lawsuit before the undersigned, Stafne's argument appears to be without merit, although that issue is more properly resolved in the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   lawsuit, including any appeal of that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Stafne also argued that the complaint filed by the Bank of New York Mellon failed to establish that it was the real party in interest, thus raising the issue of whether a different party's citizenship should be considered for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Stafne also argued in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the \"prior exclusive jurisdiction\" doctrine. Stafne also raised other challenges to the court's jurisdiction, including that the Bank of New York Mellon lacked standing and authority to bring the lawsuit. Judge Zilly heard and rejected all of these arguments, and Stafne may raise them in his appeal of that case. Stafne, however, has not shown a \"clear lack\" of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For judicial immunity to be pierced, the challenged conduct must be \"manifestly or palpably beyond the judge's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Bud Antle, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bud Antle, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that although it had determined that an adjudicative body lacked jurisdiction to hear a dispute, there was no reason to conclude that \"the Board members should not be immune from damages suits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701729\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/483/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Board's \"erroneous assertion of jurisdiction was not so grave as to warrant piercing the Board members' immunity\" and \"allegations of bad faith do not compel\" a different result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701729\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/483/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   case, a review of the record similarly shows no basis to conclude that Judge Zilly acted in the complete absence of all subject matter jurisdiction that was manifestly or palpably beyond the judge's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With regard to Judge Silverman, Stafne merely argues that Judge Silverman remanded Judge Zilly's order without having first determined that the Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction over that appeal, which Stafne challenged by motion. Thus, Stafne does not argue that the Ninth Circuit\n   had a \"clear lack\" of jurisdiction over the appeal, only that the appellate court did not determine (or expressly explain) the basis of its jurisdiction. In any event, \"[t]he courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Judge Silverman, sitting on a panel of the Ninth Circuit hearing an appeal from a final decision of a district court, did not act in the absence of all jurisdiction in entering an order of limited remand to Judge Zilly in\n   <em>\n    BNYM.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The second form of Stafne's argument relates to his constitutional challenge to federal senior status based on the Appointments Clause. Stafne's argument fails for several alternative reasons. First, \"[j]urisdiction refers to a\n   <em>\n    court's\n   </em>\n   adjudicatory authority. Accordingly, the term jurisdictional properly applies only to prescriptions delineating the classes of\n   <em>\n    cases\n   </em>\n   (subject matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) implicating that authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.

Incorporating the arguments presented in the law review article by Judge Stras and Professor Scott, Stafne argues that the Federal Judge Defendants, having elected senior status, are no longer Article III judges. There is no dispute, however, that each of the Federal Judge Defendants was constitutionally nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate when each first assumed his federal judicial office. Further, under the Constitution, each of the Federal Judge Defendants holds his federal judicial office until resignation, removal by impeachment, or death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST., art. III, \u00a7 1 (\"The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior ....\"). None of the Federal Judge Defendants have resigned, been impeached and removed, or died. Instead,\n   they simply elected senior status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Under that statute, each federal judge electing senior status shall \"retain the office\" but may \"retire from regular active service\" and \"continue to receive the salary of the office\" if they meet the requirements established by Congress. Because a federal judge who elects senior status continues to \"retain the office,\" that person, the Federal Judge Defendants argue, remains a federal judge under Article III. Indeed, as noted by Judge Stras and Professor Scott in their law review article:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Both the verb and the definite article in the phrase \"retain the office\" suggest that senior judges retain the particular office they have always held. \"Retain\" implies continuity of ownership, and \"the\" implies continuity with respect to a particular office. Standing alone, this language suggests that senior judges do not change offices, but merely change status within the same office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Stras &amp; Scott, 92 CORNELL LAW REVIEW at 471-72 (footnotes omitted). As Judge Stras and Professor Scott further explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   In 1948, Congress amended and consolidated several provisions relating to judicial retirement. The new statute, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provided that a judge \"may retain his office but retire from regular active service.\" A revision note explained that those \"[w]ords ... were used to clarify the difference between resignation and retirement.

For the reasons given in their article, Judge Stras and Professor Scott ultimately reject this reading of the text of \u00a7 371(b)(1). They do not, however, rely upon any case law for their conclusion. The Court also has found no case law supporting the conclusion urged by Judge Stras and Professor Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court does not question the structural importance of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which serves to protect separation of powers, a fundamental principle in our constitutional structure. The Supreme Court has stated that \"one who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case is entitled to a decision on the merits of the question and whatever relief may be appropriate if a violation indeed occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    515 U.S. 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182-83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). This discussion, however, brings into clear focus the primary flaw underlying all of Stafne's claims, including his argument under the Appointments Clause: this separately-filed lawsuit is not the proper time or place for Stafne to raise his arguments relating to the senior status of the Federal Judge Defendants. Further, as the Supreme Court also noted in\n   <em>\n    Ryder\n   </em>\n   , the remedy for an alleged Appointments Clause violation is not to \"subject public officials to personal damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At some point, the constitutionality of \u00a7 371 may need to be resolved. That may even occur in the appeal of either\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Burnside.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons already discussed, however, this separate action brought against the Federal Judge Defendants presents neither the proper place nor the proper time to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant Trenary's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Stafne also seeks a contingent recovery against Defendant Trenary. Stafner argues that if, in the future, Sheriff Trenary were to sell Stafne's real property pursuant to the judicial foreclosure order issued by Judge Zilly in\n   <em>\n    BNYM\n   </em>\n   , then, Stafne asserts, Sheriff Trenary would be liable to Stafne for damages. According to Stafne, it is improper for Sheriff Trenary to comply with a court order that he knows\n   or should know is invalid because it was issued by someone who does not hold the authority of a federal judge under Article III. Sheriff Trenary moves to dismiss on the ground that Stafne's claim against him is barred by quasi-judicial immunity. Sheriff Trenary also argues that Stafne's claim against him is an improper collateral attack on another court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As discussed above, Stafne's challenge in this lawsuit to Judge Zilly's order judicially foreclosing on Stafne's property constitutes an improper collateral attack. Furthermore, the very reason why Stafne argues that Judge Zilly's order is void-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Judge Zilly cannot constitutionally exercise the power of a federal judge under Article III, already has been heard and rejected in\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   case. A judgment in Stafne's favor on that point in this separate lawsuit would require this Court to invalidate or enjoin the execution of an order issued by another district judge, which, for all of the reasons previously discussed, is an action this Court is not empowered to take. Finally, to the extent that Stafne seeks damages relating to any such foreclosure and sale that has not yet occurred, Stafne's claim is not ripe. Not only has the judicial foreclosure not yet been executed, the case is currently stayed until further order by Judge Zilly. For all of these reasons, Stafne's claims against Sheriff Trenary are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court GRANTS both the motion to dismiss brought by the Federal Judge Defendants (ECF 19) and the motion to dismiss brought by Sheriff Trenary (ECF 10).
