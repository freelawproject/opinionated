(ECF No. 165).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case arises from allegations that two drug companies, Wyeth and Teva, engaged in an anticompetitive scheme that prevented the generic drug of Effexor XR from entering the market. Plaintiffs are end-payor purchasers (hereinafter \"EPP\") who claim to have paid inflated costs for the brand-named drug, Effexor XR, due to, among other things, a delayed entry provision included in Wyeth and Teva's settlement agreement. Unlike the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, who assert claims under the Sherman Act, the EPPs base their claims on their respective state's antitrust and consumer protection acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are a collection of organizations including insurance carriers, Taft-Hartley funds, municipalities, and individuals, who have been indirectly affected by Defendants' alleged schemes. For example, jointly administered Taft-Hartley fund and employee welfare benefit plaintiffs include: A.F.L.-A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan and IBEW-NECA 505 Health &amp; Welfare Plan, both of which are self-insured health and welfare benefit plans in Alabama and Florida, and Alabama, respectively (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21); Painters District Council No. 30 Health and Welfare Fund, a self-insured health and welfare benefit plan located in Illinois (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24); New Mexico United Food and Commercial Workers Union's and Employers' Health and Welfare Trust Fund and Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 572 Health and Welfare Fund, Taft-Hartley funds from New Mexico and Tennessee, respectively (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25); Sergeants Benevolent Association Health and Welfare Fund, a New York health and welfare fund (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). Health insurance carrier plaintiffs include Louisiana Health Services Indemnity Company d/b/a Bluecross/Blueshield of Louisiana, a corporation licensed to conduct business in Louisiana that provides health benefits to covered members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Municipality plaintiffs include the City of Providence, Rhode Island, a municipal corporation that operates a self-insured health and welfare benefit plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Finally, there is one named individual Plaintiff, Patricia Sutter, who is a Maine citizen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). All Plaintiffs purchased, paid, and/or provided reimbursement for Effexor XR or its generic equivalent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-28). Plaintiffs contend that they were all injured as a result of Defendants' anticompetitive schemes, since they paid a premium for the medication. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants in this case are Wyeth and Teva. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-38). Wyeth Inc., Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wyeth-Whitehall, and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Company are referred to collectively as Wyeth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Wyeth is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer with its principal place of business in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Wyeth wholly owns Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is located in Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Wyeth-Whitehall Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Company are Puerto Rican corporations that are subsidiaries of Wyeth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). The Complaint also identifies \"Wyeth applicants,\" who are inventors and prosecuting\n   attorneys that were responsible for purportedly fraudulently obtaining patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. are referred to collectively as Teva. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). Teva Limited is an Israeli corporation that develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes pharmaceutical goods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Teva USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Limited that is located in Pennsylvania, which focuses its efforts primarily on the generic pharmaceuticals business. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the Complaint, EPPs identify several anticompetitive schemes that purportedly give rise to the present lawsuit. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants fraudulently obtained three separate, but related patents, from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); listed these patents in the book of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the \"Orange Book\"); engaged in sham litigation relating to these patents; entered into an unlawful reverse payment agreement with Teva; and manipulated the 180 day first-to-file period\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to sustain Wyeth's and Teva's exclusivity and collectively prevent other generic companies from entering the market. The Court discusses each allegation in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1. Walker Process and Fraudulent Procurement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   EPPs first present a\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim against Wyeth, based on Wyeth's fraudulent procurement and enforcement of three separate patents. By way of background, in 1985, Wyeth - then operating as American Home Products - acquired a patent for the compound venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine ), commonly referred to as the Husbands patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70). Five years later, December 1993, Wyeth received FDA approval of its New Drug Application for Effexor, an antidepressant drug whose active pharmaceutical ingredient is venlafaxine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71). This initial patent was for an \"instant release\" formulation; that is, the tablet \"dissolves rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in blood plasma levels of venlafaxine shortly after administration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, the Husbands patent protected any type of venlafaxine-based product that Wyeth created from generic competition before June 13, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72). As such, Wyeth had market exclusivity for venlafaxine products for 14\u00bd years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, Effexor's instant release formulation had several significant drawbacks. First, the spike of venlafaxine into the patient's blood plasma levels could cause nausea and vomiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). Second, because the drug was rapidly absorbed into the body, patients were required to take the medication several times a day. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ). In response, Wyeth sought to develop an extended release formulation of Effexor to address these drawbacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, \"[b]y the early 1990s, methods for achieving sustained or extended release of the active ingredient in pharmaceuticals were well known in the drug industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77). To create an extended release form of venlafaxine, Wyeth took two approaches: (1) they worked in-house and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   entered into a business venture agreement with ALZA Corporation, a pharmaceutical formulation company that specialized in extended release technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wyeth's in-house development team used a coated spheroid approach to create its extended release version of Effexor, which had been previously utilized in another patented drug, Inderal LA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80). The coated spheroid approach used in Inderal LA was previously patented in the late 1970s and received Patent No. 7,138,475 ('475 Patent). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82). As a result, Plaintiffs contend that Wyeth's approach to extending the release of Effexor was already considered a prior art, despite their subsequent effort to seek additional patent protections of the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, ALZA used its osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (hereinafter, \"OROS\") to create an extended release version of Effexor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-88). As such, by 1993, Wyeth had two formulations of extended release venlafaxine and ultimately chose to focus on developing its own encapsulated spheroid version of Effexor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-90). According to the Complaint, clinical studies \"failed to establish any statistically significant improvement of the extended release over the instant release with respect to side effects such as nausea.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90). As such, Plaintiffs aver that \"Wyeth could not truthfully claim there was any valid scientific basis for claiming that the extended release version reduced side effects when compared to the instant release.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In any event, in June 1993, Wyeth made its first attempt to receive additional patent protections for venlafaxine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91). The 1993 application sought a method-of-use patent for using venlafaxine for various medical conditions, including obesity, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, just to name a few. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, this application did not specify any particular venlafaxine formulation and was later abandoned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91-92). Less than two years later, January 1995, Wyeth sought another method-of-use patent for using venlafaxine to treat hypothalamic menopause in non-depressed women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94). Again, they did not identify a particular formulation for approval, but did mention a sustained release composition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 94-95). The following year, April 1996, Wyeth received FDA approval of this composition and Patent No. 5,506,270 ('270 Patent). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As previously mentioned, ALZA had also developed an extended release formulation for venlafaxine, using its OROS technology; as such, in May 1993, ALZA also sought to secure patent protection for its formulation, which received FDA approval in August 2002 as Patent No. 6,440,457. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96). In addition, the World Intellectual Property Organization published a patent application ('589 PCT application) that was assigned to ALZA in 1994, which claims priority to ALZA's patent application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97). The '589 patent specifies the extended release osmotic formulation that ALZA developed and explained that an extended release formulation in general reduces negative side effects because these side effects result from spikes in blood plasma levels that occur when taking medication multiple times a day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98, 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Complaint, beginning in 1996, Wyeth made several attempts to receive additional patent protections for Effexor XR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103). By this time, Wyeth had already obtained a method-of-use patent for using venlafaxine to treat hypothalamic menopause in non-depressed women and ALZA's '589 patent had been published. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This being said, according to the Complaint, \"Wyeth submitted six sequential applications that led to three\n   patents, the '171, '958, and '120 patents, each of which contained ostensibly independent method-of-use claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104). Plaintiffs aver that Wyeth defrauded the PTO in obtaining these patents and, as a result, prevented generic extended release venlafaxine formulations from entering the market until June 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 1996, Wyeth applied for a provisional utility patent\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ('006 application) for extended release venlafaxine. The '006 application described the proposed patent as \"an extended release (ER), encapsulated formulation containing venlafaxine hydrochloride.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 120). According to Plaintiffs, the phrase \"encapsulated extended release formulation\" had two very distinct interpretations. One interpretation could indicate that '006 application concerned the coated spheroid formulation that Wyeth had previously developed, which would limit the patent protection to only this specific formulation design - thereby enabling competing companies to enter the market utilizing a different design that would not violate Wyeth's patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Alternatively, the phrase could be understood to encompass every formulation of venlafaxine; however, such an overly broad interpretation would render the patent invalid and unenforceable, since it was already disclosed in the '270 Patent and the '589 application submitted by ALZA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The following year, March 1997, Wyeth filed a non-provisional application (the '137 application) that was almost identical to the '006 application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108). In its application, Wyeth did not disclose the existence of the '270 Patent or the '589 PCT Application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the PTO Examiner discovered both and informed Wyeth that its claims about nausea and the spikes in blood plasma were not patentable as independent claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 136). Moreover, the Examiner noted that the '137 application could only be enforceable if Wyeth narrowed the description of the invention to the specific formulation that it created. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Eventually, Wyeth abandoned the '137 application and, in November 1997, filed a continuation-in-part application (the '328 application), which included additional information not mentioned in the '006 and '137 applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 109-10). Plaintiffs contend the '328 application was identical to the '137 application; however, despite having an obligation to disclose the claims that were previously rejected, Wyeth failed to do so in hopes that another PTO Examiner would overlook the ambiguous language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 143, 147). This being said, Wyeth eventually abandoned this application as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after abandoning the '328 application, Wyeth filed another continuation-in-part application (the '629 application), which claimed priority over all three previous applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111). The '629 application eventually led to the issuance of Patent No. 6,274,171 (the '171 Patent) in August 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). The '171 Patent was comprised of 25 claims, which included the extended release encapsulated spheroid version of venlafaxine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). It also claimed to reduce the drug's concentration in patient's blood plasma and incidents of nausea and vomiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Again, Plaintiffs contend Defendants did not disclose the rejection of the similar claims in the '137 application examined by\n   the PTO Examiner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157). By failing to disclose the PTO's prior rejection and explain the meaning of the '270 Patent, Plaintiffs aver that Wyeth committed fraud on the PTO in obtaining the '171 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 157-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Two months before the '171 Patent was issued, Wyeth filed a divisional application in June 2001 (the '412 application), which sought another method-of-use patent based on reducing incidents of nausea and vomiting, the drug's concentrations in the patient's blood plasma, and daily drug use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 165). According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]he specifications and claims of the '412 application were identical to those in the '629 application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161). However, unlike the other applications, the '412 referred to the formulation as \"an extended release formulation\" rather than \"an encapsulated extended release formulation\" as in the previous applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 161-62). Defendants again did not disclose that the '270 Patent\"identified the existence of an extended release formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride that rendered their method-of-use claims unpatentable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162). By failing to provide this information to the PTO Examiner, the '412 application eventually resulted in the issuance of the Patent No. 6,419,958 (the '958 Patent) in July 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). However, as noted above, the '270 Patent previously procured included a once a day venlafaxine formulation that spread its dosage over time, so Wyeth filed a provisional application, including claims for nausea and vomiting, to avoid being precluded by the '270 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, in September 2001, Wyeth filed the '965 application, another continuation in part application, that contained similar claims as the '412 application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166-67). By not disclosing the rejection of the prior applications, the '965 application resulted in the issuance of Patent No. 6,403,120 in June 2002 (the '120 Patent ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 170).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the Complaint, \"Wyeth's repeated pattern of nondisclosure and withholding highly material information in serial patent applications for virtually identical claims\" evinces its intent to deceive the PTO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184). As such, \"[b]ut for this fraud on the PTO,\" Plaintiffs aver that the '171, '120, and '958 Patents would never have been issued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    2. Wrongful Orange Book Listing and Sham Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After procuring the '171, '120, and '958 Patents, Wyeth then listed all three in the Orange Book; all three patents expired on March 20, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 112, 114 116). Thereafter, Plaintiffs claim that Wyeth engaged in sham litigation against seventeen generic manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 262). Plaintiffs claim that at least seventeen generic manufacturers sent Wyeth certifications informing it that they intended to manufacture generic versions of Effexor XR, which would not infringe Wyeth's patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 265). In response, Wyeth sued each generic for infringing on the '171, '120, and '958 Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 266). According to the Complaint, Wyeth was aware that its method-of-use patents were invalid or unenforceable; yet, nevertheless chose to seek its enforceability against generic manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 267). The purposes of these \"sham patent suits was to prevent, delay, and/or minimize the success of the entry of generic competitors, which would have sold generic equivalents of Effexor XR in the United States at prices significantly below Wyeth's prices ... and therefore would have taken most of Wyeth's market share.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 270). As such, by blocking the market entry of generic Effexor XR, Wyeth prevented the average market price\n   of its brand name drug from declining dramatically. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3. Reverse Settlement Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the validity of a reverse settlement agreement made between Wyeth and Teva, after Wyeth initially sued Teva for patent infringement of its three patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 272-304). On March 24, 2003, Wyeth sued Teva for infringing on its '171, '120, and '958 patent in the District of New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 275). One of the key issues before the court was whether the term \"extended release formulation\" was to be construed broadly or limited to the spheroid formulation developed by Wyeth, which - as discussed above - would enable generic manufactures to design a different formulation that would not infringe on Wyeth's patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 276). At the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing, the court ultimately interpreted the phrase to mean the latter, explaining that \"one of ordinary skill in the art would construe [extended release formulation] to include specific ingredients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, such a finding was fatal to Wyeth's case; as such, Wyeth sought to settle the matter with Teva and, as a result, avoid other generic companies challenging Wyeth's patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 2, 2005, the two signed a joint settlement and release agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 279). As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that the district court's prior\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   ruling would be vacated, thereby requiring other generic companies to relitigate the \"extended release formulation\" issue that the court had previously found in Teva's favor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 280). As it pertained to instant release Effexor, Wyeth allowed Teva to sell its generic version prior to the expiration of the patent in June 2008; in addition, Wyeth agreed not to compete with Teva by releasing its own authorized generic during that same period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 281). As a result, Teva had at least a year and a half market exclusivity of generic instant release Effexor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 283). The agreement also included a delayed entry provision, wherein Teva agreed to delay market entry for its generic extended release Effexor until as late as July 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 284). In return, \"Wyeth promised Teva that Wyeth would not market an authorized generic version of extended release venlafaxine during at least Teva's six-month 'exclusivity' and possibly longer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, by effectively blocking any other competing generic manufactures from entering the market, \"the Wyeth-Teva agreement worked a huge, and devastating, impact on competition in the market for extended release venlafaxine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 286).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this case on behalf of themselves and all End-Payor class members to recover damages, calculated by the increased price they had to pay due to Wyeth's conduct in delaying the market entry of generic Effexor XR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 411). The class contains individuals or entities who purchased or paid for Effexor XR and/or its generic version for consumption by themselves, their families, or members, employees, insureds, participants, or beneficiaries in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. The Class sues for overage damages occurred from June 14, 2008 until the effects of Defendants' conduct cease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Complaint outlines four different claims for relief in the class action. The first is for monopolization under state law against Wyeth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 421). The conduct\n   giving rise to this claim is the fraudulent obtainment of the '171, '958, and '120 Patents, its listing in the Orange Book, its sham litigation, and the unlawful reverse settlement agreement with Teva. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 424). The same factual allegations and theories asserted in Count I are again alleged in Count II against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 439). In Count III, Plaintiffs allege conspiracy to restrain of trade against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 448). Finally, Plaintiffs allege a claim unfair or deceptive trade practices against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 456). Plaintiffs contend that as a result of Wyeth's anticompetitive acts or practices, Plaintiffs and the Class were deprived of the opportunity to obtain a less expensive, generic equivalent to Effexor XR.

As such, EPPs' claims under these five statutes are dismissed without prejudice; Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint that specifically pleads compliance with each state's notice requirement. Similarly, EPPs' class claims under Tennessee's consumer protection statute are dismissed without prejudice; Plaintiffs may amend their complaint to include only claims in their\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   capacities. Lastly, because the failure to provide pre-file notice under Maine's Unfair Trade Practices Act does not bar pursuing\n   a claim under the Act, Defendants' motion for judgment as it relates to this statute is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Since the Supreme Court's decision, multiple states have enacted\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   repealer statutes that allow indirect purchasers to recover under their state law. On July 15, 2013, Rhode Island passed such a repealer, which states \"[t]he fact that a person or public body has not dealt directly with the defendant shall not bar or otherwise limit recovery.\" R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 6-36-7(d).
