(\"Foresco\"), a manufacturer and supplier of medium density fiberboard, brought this diversity action against defendant Albert Oh (\"Oh\"), President and Chief Executive Officer of Flash Ventures, Inc., a data storage technology and distribution business, alleging that Oh failed to make the required payments to Foresco pursuant to an alleged guaranty document signed by the parties (the \"Guaranty\"). (Dkt. No. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After trial in May 2018, the Court issued a judgment reflecting a jury verdict for Foresco against Oh. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the \"Judgment,\" Dkt. No. 86.) Twenty-one days later, Foresco moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) (\" Rule 59(e)\") to amend the jury award to add prejudgment interest totaling $355,401.87. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Interest Motion,\" Dkt. No. 96.) By letter dated July 6, 2018, Oh opposed Foresco's request for prejudgment interest. (\"Opposition,\" Dkt. No. 106.) For the reasons discussed below, the court GRANTS Foresco's Interest Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under Rule 59(e), Foresco requests that the Court (1) amend the Judgment to provide for an award of prejudgment interest under Section 5001 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"CPLR\") at the 9% per annum rate prescribed by\n   Section 5004 of the CPLR ; and (2) award Foresco postjudgment interest on the Judgment at the rate of 2.2275% in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Section 1961 until the jury award is fully satisfied by Oh. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interest Motion at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Oh opposes Foresco's request and takes no position in regard to the postjudgment interest request. (Opposition at 1.) Specifically, Oh argues that determining the accrual date of the Guaranty and awarding prejudgment interest are jury issues, so Foresco's only recourse was to move for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a)(1), and since its time to do so has expired, Foresco has waived the issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a threshold matter, a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment is the proper basis for bringing a request for prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osterneck v.

First, \"only where the judgment has failed accurately to reflect the actual decision of the decision-maker to award such interest,\" or second, \"where the judgment has failed to include an amount of interest that the governing law requires to be automatically included in the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Frigitemp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123451,1536238\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/781/324/\">\n    781 F.2d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Oh argues, without pointing to any cases, that because there was no jury determination of an accrual date, there is no applicable \"governing law\" for calculating interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But Rule 60(a) pertains to amendments and corrections based only on \"clerical mistakes.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a). The Second Circuit Court of Appeals analyzed Rule 60(a) only because the motion would not have been timely filed under Rule 59(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frigitemp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123451,1536238\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/781/324/\">\n    781 F.2d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As described earlier, multiple cases have recognized Rule 59(e) amendments to award prejudgment interest under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover, Oh's contention that the jury never determined the accrual date is mooted by the fact that Foresco sought prejudgment interest starting only from the date it commenced its action, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 97 at 1-2), clearly well after any possible accrual date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court entered the Judgment on June 5, 2018. Foresco filed the Interest Motion on June 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interest Motion.) Thus, Foresco filed the Interest Motion within the now-operative twenty-eight day period from the entry of the Judgment, and the Interest Motion is therefore timely under Rule 59(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the motion to amend the judgment (Dkt.
