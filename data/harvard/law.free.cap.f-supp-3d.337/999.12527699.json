Seattle Times Company (\"Seattle Times\") was represented by Jeff Kray and Jessica Ferrell of Marten Law PLLC. LeatherCare, Inc. (\"LeatherCare\"), Steven Ritt, and the marital community composed of Steven Ritt and Laurie Rosen-Ritt were represented by Jo Flannery and Kristin Meier of Ryan, Swanson &amp; Cleveland, PLLC. Touchstone SLU LLC and TB TS/RELP LLC (collectively, \"Touchstone\") were represented by Jeremy (Jake) Larson of Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP and Kenneth Lederman of Foster Pepper PLLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Trial proceeded for eighteen (18) days and ended on February 7, 2018, at which time the Court took the matter under advisement. Having considered the testimony of the witnesses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the exhibits admitted into evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the documents and PowerPoint slides offered for demonstrative purposes, the facts on which the parties have\n   agreed to the extent they are supported by the record,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Pretrial Order (docket no. 154) [hereinafter \"PTO\"], and the arguments of counsel, the Court now enters these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action concerns the remediation costs associated with hazardous substances, including PCE or Perc\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and various petroleum products, released on real property bounded by Fairview Avenue North, Thomas Street, Boren Avenue North, and Harrison Street in Seattle, Washington (the \"Property\"). The Property was contaminated as a result of dry-cleaning and other operations conducted by LeatherCare, which previously leased a portion of the Property, and Troy Laundry Co., which became Troy Linen and Uniform Service, Inc. in 1981 (\"Troy\"),\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1150, and which owned the Property. Seattle Times purchased the Property from Troy in 1985, and sold it to Touchstone in 2011. After acquiring the Property, Touchstone redeveloped it into a commercial complex. As part of construction efforts, Touchstone's contractors excavated over 100,000 tons of contaminated soil, which was transported to appropriate waste facilities. In addition, Touchstone had a series of injection wells installed at the Property to address groundwater contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this action, Touchstone seeks to recover over $9.88 million in connection with its remedial activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Touchstone has already recovered $4,783,434.17 from Seattle Times pursuant to a contract between the parties, and it seeks the balance of almost $5.1 million from Seattle Times or LeatherCare. Touchstone also requests a judgment declaring the parties' respective responsibilities for future response costs. Seattle Times seeks to recover from LeatherCare and/or Mr. Ritt, the current President of LeatherCare,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ritt Decl. at \u00b6 2 (docket no. 61), substantially all of what it has paid, or will be liable to pay, to Touchstone. LeatherCare and Mr. Ritt ask for declaratory relief, as well as contribution, contending that Mr. Ritt cannot be held personally liable and that the Court should equitably apportion the expenses\n   at issue among all of the parties. Seattle Times asserts its claims against LeatherCare and Mr. Ritt under both federal and state statutes relating to environmental cleanup, while Touchstone relies solely on state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Property consists of two tax parcels, covering approximately 2.5 acres of land, in a neighborhood of Seattle just south of Lake Union, as shown on the following map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Troy acquired a portion of the Property in 1925, and owned the entire block by 1951. When Seattle Times purchased the Property from Troy in 1985, the Property had three improvements, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, namely a vintage warehouse built in 1925, located at 334 Boren Avenue North (Building 1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a vintage industrial facility constructed by 1927 and expanded between 1943 and 1966, bearing an address of 307-311 Fairview Avenue North (Building 2), and a vintage structure erected in 1960, designated as 333 Fairview Avenue North (Building 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 107 at 10-11; Ex. 115 at 147-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Troy operated in Building 2 both an industrial laundry and a dry-cleaning plant. Troy also fueled and serviced its fleet of vehicles at the Property. In 1957, LeatherCare's predecessor, Seattle Fur Services, began leasing a portion of Building 2 from Troy. In 1981, LeatherCare also became a tenant of Building 3. LeatherCare continued to lease from Troy until March 5, 1985, when Troy sold the Property to Seattle Times for $3.5 million. From March until September 1985, LeatherCare leased space in Building 2 from Seattle Times, and LeatherCare occupied Building 3 until 1999.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1027-28. On June 10, 2011, Seattle Times sold the Property to Touchstone for $18.4 million. As a result of Touchstone's redevelopment efforts, the Property is now occupied by a two-building complex with a five-story, underground parking garage. Figure 4 shows the new office space in the final stages of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Hazardous Substances\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This matter involves two types of hazardous substances, namely (i) halogenated hydrocarbons,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (ii) petroleum products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Halogenated Hydrocarbons\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PCE or Perc, which is a halogenated hydrocarbon, is a synthetic chemical that is not known to occur in nature.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tab 11 to Dale Report (docket no. 183-13 at 19 &amp; 22). During the period when LeatherCare leased Buildings 2 and 3 from Troy, PCE was commonly used as a solvent in the dry-cleaning industry, and it was the dominant synthetic solvent.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Dale Report, Ex. 210 at 2 (filed as docket no. 118-1). Because of its tendency to transition from a liquid to a gaseous state at normal temperatures, PCE is considered a volatile organic compound (\"VOC\").\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tab 11 to Dale Report (docket no. 183-13 at 41 &amp; 47). PCE is also described as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (\"DNAPL\"), meaning that it has a higher specific gravity (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , it is heavier) than water, and that it will separate from water, in a manner similar to how oil and vinegar, or the fat and juice of roasted meat drippings, will settle into different layers.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   (docket no. 183-13 at 40-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PCE can degrade into trichloroethylene or trichloroethene (\"TCE\"), as well as other compounds, including vinyl chloride (C\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   H\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   Cl). Chronic inhalation exposure to these substances can lead to neurological disorders, kidney or liver disease, and/or reproductive dysfunction.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PCE Fact Sheet, Ex. 457;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Toxicological Profiles (available at www.atsdr.cdc.gov).

Like PCE, Stoddard solvent was once a popular compound in the dry-cleaning industry. Stoddard solvent is a flammable, volatile liquid, which is insoluble in water and smells similar to kerosene or gasoline. It is not generally regarded as carcinogenic, but very few studies have been done on the effects in humans of inhalation exposure to Stoddard solvent.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Toxicological Profile for Stoddard Solvent (June 1995), Ex. 452 at 23. Stoddard solvent is considered a gasoline-range petroleum hydrocarbon (\"GRPH\"). At the Property, Stoddard solvent was stored in underground tanks. Gasoline for use in Troy's fleet of vehicles and diesel fuel for use presumably as heating oil were also stored underground. Ecology has set a \"cleanup\" level for GRPH of 100 mg per kg of soil.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   WAC 173-340-900 at Tables 740-1 &amp; 745-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     PCE Emissions from Dry-Cleaning Operations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this matter, the parties have stipulated that, as a result of dry-cleaning operations, PCE was released into the subsurface soil and migrated to the groundwater beneath the Property.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Stip. &amp; Order at \u00b6 2 (docket no. 41); Stip. &amp; Order at \u00b6 2 (docket no. 52). The parties also agree that the contamination occurred primarily in two ways. First, it resulted from placing PCE-saturated materials in the back of a dump truck, which was owned and used by Troy to haul waste to a transfer station, and which was left, uncovered at times, in the partially-unpaved loading dock, thereby allowing rain water to soak through the rubbish and solvent to infiltrate the soil.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PTO at 10, \u00b6 22. Second, PCE was discharged into the subsurface soil because of degradation of the drainpipes and side sewers\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that carried effluent water commingled with solvent to the municipal sewer\n   main running under Boren Avenue North.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PTO at 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 13 &amp; 19;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Kransnoff Report at Op. 1, Ex. 213 at 5-13; Morrill's Rebuttal &amp; Supp. Report at Gen. Op. 4, Ex. 1145 at 21-22 (filed as docket no. 117-15) (opining that the drain and sewer lines at the Property were corroded before LeatherCare began using PCE in its operations). The parties dispute, however, the extent to which Troy, along with LeatherCare, is responsible for the PCE contamination at the Property, and whether Troy, in addition to LeatherCare, ran a PCE-based dry-cleaning plant at the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Components of a Dry-Cleaning System\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To fully comprehend the parties' stipulations concerning how PCE was released at the Property, knowledge about dry-cleaning operations is required. The term \"dry cleaning\" is a misnomer because the clothes still get wet during the process; however, they are immersed in a liquid other than water. Whether the liquid is PCE, Stoddard, or another non-aqueous solvent, the principal steps are identical to those of laundering in water: (i) one or more washes (baths) in the solvent; (ii) extraction of the solvent by spinning; and (iii) drying by tumbling in an air stream.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 270\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 14 (filed as Tab 48 to Dale Report, docket no. 183-50). The washing and drying components of a typical dry-cleaning system are shown in yellow in Figure 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because PCE is both expensive and toxic, PCE systems include additional equipment designed to capture and reuse the solvent. As illustrated in Figure 5, a basic PCE system has the following extra components (tinted in red): (i) a filter to separate particulates from the used solvent; (ii) a distillation unit (or still), which heats the recycled PCE to vaporize it; (iii) a condenser, which cools the purified gas and converts it to liquid form; and (iv) a separator to divide from the reclaimed PCE any water that has entered the system.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 16 (Fig. 2-1);\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Dale Report, Ex. 210 at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Morrill Rebuttal &amp; Supp. Report at Fig. 3-1, Ex. 1145 at 19 (filed as docket no. 117-15) (indicating that an operation using Stoddard solvent would likewise have, in addition to a washer/extractor and dryer, a filter, still, condenser, and separator); Ex. 392 at 17 (Fig. 2-1) (filed as Tab 72 to Krasnoff Report, docket no. 189-20). A PCE plant with emission control would also have a carbon adsorber, sometimes called a sniffer, along with an additional condenser and another separator, to collect solvent fumes from the air.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 270 at 16-17;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 210 at 3 (Fig. 1). These extra, emission-control elements are highlighted in green in Figure 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties agree that LeatherCare's PCE dry-cleaning system had reclamation elements (filter, still, condenser, and separator), as well as emission-control components (adsorber and additional condenser and separator).\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PTO at 9, \u00b6 18. For the reasons discussed later, the Court finds that Troy also operated a PCE dry-cleaning plant at the Property, and that Troy's facility was equipped with a reclamation\n   unit, but had no emission control.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   pp. 1019-21. PCE-reclamation and emission-control devices generate waste in two forms: (i) PCE-laden solid materials, like filter muck, filter cartridges, and still residue, that was, in connection with Troy's and LeatherCare's operations, deposited into the dump truck parked in the loading dock, and (ii) PCE-contaminated waste water, which in this matter ran through the side sewers before leaving the Property. The parties have offered disparate views concerning the quantity of PCE released at the Property via its disposal with solid waste and/or waste water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Quantifying PCE Releases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its 1978 report, a copy of which was admitted as Exhibit 270, the EPA provided estimates concerning typical PCE emissions from dry-cleaning facilities. The amount of PCE lost each year depends on the quantity of PCE used annually, which correlates with the size of the dry-cleaning operation. For purposes of its study, the EPA defined three types of dry-cleaning facilities: (i) independent or franchise stores offering coin-operated, self-service systems, which processed roughly 7,200 kg (16,000 lbs) of clothes per year; (ii) \"commercial\" operations, including neighborhood shops and specialty cleaners handling leather and other fine goods, which would each handle about 23,000 kg (60,000 lbs) of clothes per year; and (iii) \"industrial\" plants involved in supplying uniforms or other items to commercial customers, which would typically clean 240,000 to 700,000 kg (600,000 to 1,500,000 lbs) of clothes per year. Ex. 270 at 13. The parties agree that LeatherCare's PCE-based system at the Property was a \"commercial\" dry cleaner. As explained later,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1021, the Court finds that Troy's PCE dry-cleaning operation was also \"commercial\" in scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When the EPA issued its report in 1978, the typical \"commercial\" PCE plant had a 14-27 kg (30-60 lb) capacity washer/extractor and an equivalent-sized dryer (reclaiming tumbler). Ex. 270 at 17. Surveys conducted in the mid-1970s revealed that only 35-to-50% of \"commercial\" dry cleaners had carbon adsorbers (sniffers).\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   According to the EPA, a well-operated PCE system without a sniffer (like Troy's) was estimated to lose, through various emissions, between 8 and 21 kg of solvent per 100 kg of clothing laundered, while an adsorber-equipped plant (like LeatherCare's) was believed to experience less than 5 kg of solvent loss per 100 kg of clothing laundered.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. The EPA identified the following primary mechanisms of PCE loss: (i) evaporation at the washer and dryer, which is minimal if a sniffer is employed; (ii) retention in the filter muck, which can be reduced by cooking the muck to reclaim the solvent; (iii) retention in filter cartridges, which can be reduced by drying them in a cabinet vented to an adsorber; (iv) retention in the still residue; and (v) leaks from pumps, valves, flanges, seals, and storage vessels.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The EPA also recognized that carbon adsorbers and muck cookers are not perfect emission-control technologies. PCE vapor would still be released through a sniffer's exhaust, but at an estimated rate of only 0.3 kg per 100 kg of clothing laundered (as compared to evaporation losses without an adsorber of 4-to-7 kg per 100 kg of clothes in the aggregate at the washer/extractor and dryer).\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 18. A filter muck cooker could substantially reduce PCE loss, but not below 1 kg per 100 kg of clothing laundered.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Thus, even with the then state-of-the-art control technologies, a \"commercial\" dry cleaner operating during the timeframe at issue in this case could expect to lose about 1,150 kg (194.6\n   gal)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   of PCE per year through (i) disposal of filter muck, filter cartridges, and still residue, (ii) adsorber exhaust, and (iii) various leaks. In addition, both carbon adsorbers and muck cookers increase the amount of water that comes in contact with PCE, which results in solvent being discharged along with effluent water to the sewer system.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 48-51. Based on a figure of 100 ppm of PCE in effluent water, the EPA predicted that \"commercial\" dry cleaners using sniffers and muck cookers would dispose of at least 1.4 kg (0.24 gal) of PCE per year with their waste water, and that \"industrial\" dry cleaners with similar equipment would lose 13.4 kg (2.3 gal) of PCE per year down the sewer.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Seattle Times contends that LeatherCare experienced much higher losses of PCE than was estimated by the EPA to be typical for \"commercial\" dry cleaners, relying on the opinion of its expert Bruce E. Dale, Ph.D. Dr. Dale's calculations depended on the assumption that, to replace the PCE lost during dry-cleaning operations, LeatherCare purchased 1,977 gallons of PCE per year; Dr. Dale rounded this figure up to 2,000 gallons of PCE per year. Ex. 210 at 8 &amp; 12 (filed as docket no. 118-1). Of those 2,000 gallons of PCE lost per year, Dr. Dale believes that 30% (600 gallons of PCE per year) was released to the sewer, while the remaining 70% (1,400 gallons of PCE per year) was discharged with filter muck, filter cartridges, and still bottoms.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Dale's numbers are inconsistent with those of Bernard Tod Delaney, Ph.D., P.E., BCEE, another expert retained by Seattle Times, but in the related insurance coverage dispute,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Seattle Times Co. v.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Sur. Corp.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , W.D. Wash. Case No. C13-1463 TSZ. The experts in this case discussed Dr. Delaney's opinions in the other case, and his report was admitted into evidence as Exhibit 1140. The Court concludes that Dr. Dale's analysis is flawed because it ignores the amount of PCE released to the air. The Court further observes that Dr. Delaney's estimates\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   are substantially similar to those of LeatherCare's expert, Pamela J.

To make room for this 1964 addition, Troy removed a concrete laundry-loading shed with a ramp that had been built in 1950, and vacated the southern portion of an alley that ran through the Property, parallel to Boren and Fairview Avenues, and that had been in existence since at least 1893.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 107 at 16;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 115 (493) at 23-24.

According to Jack Ross, who worked for Troy from 1963 until 1984,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ross Dep. (Vol. 1) at 15:18 (docket no. 226), and became its Chief Engineer in the mid-1970s,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 43:2-5, Troy had two 400-pound Stoddard machines, through which it would process at least 6,000 pounds of clothing (roughly eight loads per machine) each day, five days per week,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 59:3-7, 59:14-15, &amp; 60:10-15. These figures indicate that, from 1965 until 1985, Troy's Stoddard equipment handled roughly 1.5 million pounds of clothing each year, which is consistent with the EPA's 1978 estimate concerning the quantum of work typically performed by \"industrial\" dry cleaners.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     \"Commercial\" Dry-Cleaning (PCE)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Ross further testified that, between 1965 and about 1972, Troy also operated a PCE-based dry-cleaning system for retail customers. During that timeframe, Troy would send its vans to residences to pick up items to be dry cleaned and then deliver them after processing. Ross Dep. (Vol. 1) at 17:2-8. This part of Troy's business was called the \"family laundry service\" or the \"family routes.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 27:24-28:3. Troy also received clothing to be dry cleaned at a call center on the Property (in Building 3). Ross Dep. (Vol. 2) at 243:4-16 &amp; 252:14-22 (docket no. 227). Mr. Ross recollected that Troy's PCE machines, namely a 30-pound washer, a 60-pound washer, and one or more dryers, had been at Troy's facility known as City Laundry, and that the PCE equipment was moved to the Property when the 1964 addition was finished. Ross Dep. (Vol. 1) at 19:1-22, 22:17-25, &amp; 24:9-20; Ross Dep. (Vol. 2) at 210:9-24 &amp; 214:4-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After the PCE system was relocated to the Property and other consolidation efforts were accomplished, Troy closed both the City Laundry facility and a linen-supply plant in Ballard.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ross Dep. (Vol. 1) at 24:23-25:9. At its peak, Troy's family laundry service had approximately 20 routes, involving about 25 vans.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 32:16-33:3. In the early 1970s, Troy sold the city routes and reduced its retail business.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 47:13-14. Sometime between 1970 and 1974, Troy ceased its PCE operations.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 27:18-23;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ross Dep. (Vol. 2) at 165:11-15, 243:13-19, &amp; 244:9-20. According to Mr. Ross, LeatherCare subsequently installed new PCE machines in the same area of Building 2 where Troy's PCE equipment had been located. Ross Dep. (Vol. 1) at 28:11-29:6 &amp; 114:21-25;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 65 &amp; 1009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Seattle Times and Touchstone challenge Mr. Ross's credibility. The Court, however, finds that Mr. Ross's memory was reliable and that his testimony was not controverted. Although Steven Ritt and Mark Chose did not believe that Troy ever had PCE equipment at the Property, neither of them worked at the facility during the time when Troy was engaged in a retail dry-cleaning business; Mr. Ritt was employed elsewhere from 1967 until 1974, Ritt Dep. (Aug. 5, 2015) at 19:13-18 (docket no. 141), and Mr. Chose did not start working for Troy until 1972, Chose Dep. at 8:22-23 (docket no. 225). As Chief Engineer for Troy, Mr. Ross had more opportunity and incentive to understand the nature of Troy's dry-cleaning operations; Mr. Ritt was concerned with LeatherCare's operations, not Troy's, while Mr. Chose's primary role at Troy related to the maintenance of its fleet of vehicles,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 11:22-12:23, 13:3-18, 53:22-54:2, 62:22-63:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Ross's explanation that Troy moved its PCE-based \"family routes\" operation to the Property from City Laundry as part of a consolidation plan is supported by other evidence in the record. A 1950 Certified Sanborn Map shows that City Dye Works Co. Inc. (which Mr. Ross called \"City Laundry\") was located at the corner of Fifth Avenue North and John Street, but a 1969 Certified Sanborn Map indicates that the same building was, by that time, vacant,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 186, lending credence to Mr. Ross's testimony that the business had been relocated and the premises had been abandoned in 1965. The accuracy of Mr. Ross's memory is further substantiated by an advertisement\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   appeared in the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Seattle Times\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   in July 1946, touting the services of City Dry Cleaners, which would pick up, clean, press, and deliver men's suits \"all for $1.00.\" Ex. 185.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Ross's description of Troy's PCE system was also consistent with the EPA's later observations in 1978 concerning the typical \"commercial\" dry-cleaning plant, which was likely to have a 30-to-60 pound per load capacity and no emission control.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1015. In addition, the two plumes of PCE-contaminated soil that were discovered during Touchstone's redevelopment efforts, in an area used exclusively by Troy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   corroborate Mr. Ross's representations that Troy used PCE in its operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having viewed a portion of the video recording of Mr. Ross's deposition, and having read the entire transcript of his testimony, the Court finds that Mr. Ross was a credible witness with no motive to fabricate information or obfuscate the facts. The Court finds that, for five to seven years after the 1964 addition was built, Troy had a PCE plant with throughputs (and PCE losses) comparable to those of the average \"commercial\" dry-cleaning facility (without emission control) as defined by the EPA in 1978,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , handling approximately 23,000 kg (60,000 lbs) of clothes per year and losing between 8 and 21 kg of PCE per 100 kg of clothing laundered.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Troy's Underground Storage Tanks\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   During its tenure as owner of the Property, Troy installed and/or maintained at least 18 underground storage tanks (\"USTs\").

Ex. 115 (493) at 26. When that same UST was opened in 2010, it contained approximately one inch of heating oil, floating on about one foot of water. Ex. 107 at 21. The 8,000-gallon UST containing leaded gasoline was apparently closed in place in 1996. Ex. 115 (493) at 26. During the course of excavation related to Touchstone's redevelopment efforts, three distinct plumes of petroleum-contaminated soil were discovered, one on the west side of the Property, near the latitude of the 7-barrel heating oil UST (Plume 1), one in the southwest quadrant of the Property, under the footprint of the 1964 addition, which was also contaminated with PCE (Plume 2), and one in the northern portion of the property, in the vicinity of the decommissioned 8,000-gallon UST that had housed gasoline (Plume 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Figure 8, on the next page, shows the three plumes of petroleum-contaminated soil. Although Seattle Times and Touchstone have asserted to the contrary, the Court finds that the plume of petroleum-only contaminated soil (\"PCS\") in the northern section of the Property (Plume 3) was not caused by LeatherCare's operations at the site. Troy undisputedly installed, maintained, and used the 8,000-gallon gasoline tank under the parking lot of Building 3, and no evidence has been offered that LeatherCare fueled its vehicles from or was otherwise associated with the UST that was the source of Plume 3, consisting solely of gasoline-range petroleum hydrocarbon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Troy's Acquisition and Dissolution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On March 1, 1985, American Linen Supply Co., a Washington corporation, d/b/a Maryatt Industries (\"Maryatt\"), acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Troy, and Troy became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maryatt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   PTO at 7,\n   \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 41.

Nine of these wells (AIW01-AIW09) are angled under Boren Avenue North and three of them (AIW10-AIW12) are angled under Thomas Street (the \"angled wells\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the remaining 91 vertical wells, 48 are installed along the northern, western, or\n   southern boundaries of the Property (the \"boundary wells\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the other 43 are within the western half of the Property, in a pattern that mimics the contours of groundwater flow (the \"interior wells\").\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 126 (491) at 59 (Fig. 15). Figure 14, on the next page, shows the locations of the various wells on the Property. The parties dispute whether the boundary wells serve the function of preventing contaminated groundwater from entering the Property or leaving the Property or both.

Touchstone's theory is that Seattle Times is responsible under the ERIA for the angled and barrier wells, while LeatherCare and/or Mr. Ritt are liable under Washington's Model Toxics Control Act (\"MTCA\") for the interior wells. Touchstone, however, has misidentified five interior wells as barrier wells,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   note 34, and its apportionment between Seattle Times and LeatherCare is therefore inaccurate.

Ex. 469;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PTO at 15, \u00b6 45. On July 8, 2016, SES forwarded to Ecology for its review a draft Vapor Intrusion Assessment Work Plan. Ex. 127. The draft proposed a schedule and methods for air quality sampling to determine whether indoor air at the Property is below remediation levels.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 4-8.

Ex. 478. In this Technical Memorandum, SES explained that, although the groundwater under the \"Site\" currently flows to the south and southeast, in 2013, the groundwater reversed direction as a result of construction dewatering occurring in the area bounded by Harrison Street, Ninth Avenue North, Republican Street, and an alley (\"Block 45\").\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 2 &amp; Fig. 1. Block 45 is roughly two blocks west and one block north of the Property, and the dewatering caused the groundwater to flow to the northwest for approximately twelve months.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   SES opined that the maximum distance contaminated groundwater might have traveled from the Property, during that twelve-month period, is 7-to-10 feet to the northwest, beneath the Boren Avenue North right-of-way.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 6. SES also expressed a belief that, because the excavation eliminated from the Property the source of groundwater contamination, which allows for natural attenuation processes to degrade the substances of concern, and given the recently installed boundary wells, the plume of contaminated groundwater beneath the Property will continue to shrink and the applicable cleanup levels will be achieved in a \"reasonable\" amount of time.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 6. As of the date of the trial in this matter, Ecology had not yet responded to SES's Technical Memorandum.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   PTO at 15-16, \u00b6 46. Whether and the extent to which Touchstone might incur additional expenses for cleanup actions at the Property or the \"Site\" remain uncertain at this time.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6\u00b6 58 &amp; 59.

No allegation has been made that, in running LeatherCare's PCE operation, Mr. Ritt acted inconsistently with the terms of the leases between Troy and LeatherCare or contrary to Troy's directions. The parties agree that the degradation of the side sewers and the manner of handling PCE-saturated waste were the mechanisms of PCE release into the soil and groundwater at the Property, and the Court concludes that Mr. Ritt cannot be treated as an \"operator\" with regard to those pollution-related operations or decisions under either federal or state law.

Seattle Times also pursues under MTCA reimbursement from LeatherCare for the costs of the SVE system designed, installed, and operated by AECOM. The Court concludes that the MTCA claims related to the Interim Action Plan (and Agreed Order No. 8996) are cognizable, but the MTCA claim premised on AECOM's SVE system lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   A prerequisite to cost recovery under MTCA is demonstrating that the remedial action at issue was the \"substantial equivalent\" of an action conducted or supervised by Ecology. RCW 70.105D.080 (\"Recovery of remedial action costs shall be limited to those remedial actions that, when evaluated as a whole, are the substantial equivalent of a department-conducted or department-supervised remedial action.\"). The Court evaluates substantial equivalence \"with reference to the rules adopted by\" Ecology.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567673\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/90/#p761\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ecology has defined three ways in which a remedial action satisfies the \"substantial equivalent\" standard: (i) it was conducted by Ecology; (ii) it was conducted under an order or decree and \"the remedial requirements of the order or decree have been satisfied for those portions of the remedial action for which the private right of action is being sought\"; or (iii) it was conducted independently and meets the five criteria enumerated in Ecology's regulation.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   WAC 173-340-545(2). Only the second and third tests for substantial equivalence are relevant in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Under the second \"order or decree\" definition articulated by Ecology, the Court concludes that the remedial action performed pursuant to the Interim Action Plan (and Agreed Order No. 8996), involving excavation and disposal of contaminated soil and installation of injection wells, qualifies as the \"substantial equivalent of a department-conducted or department-supervised remedial action.\" The remedial requirements of Agreed Order No. 8996 have been satisfied with respect to the costs for which Touchstone and Seattle Times seek reimbursement from LeatherCare in this action. The \"order or decree\" test does not apply, however, to the SVE system for which Seattle Times incurred expenses because AECOM's work was conducted independently of any order or decree issued by Ecology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Seattle Times contends that the SVE process was nevertheless substantially equivalent, relying on the third definition set forth by Ecology, which requires that the independent remedial action include the following elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   (i) Information on the site and remedial actions conducted has been reported to the department in accordance with WAC 173-340-300, 173-340-450 and 173-340-515, as applicable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   (ii) The department has not objected to the remedial action being conducted or any such objection has been cured as determined by the court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   (iii) Except for emergency remedial actions, before conducting an interim action or cleanup action, reasonable steps have been taken to provide advance public notice;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   (iv) The remedial actions have been conducted substantially equivalent with the technical standards and evaluation criteria described in subsection (4) of this section; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   (v) For facilities where hazardous substances have been disposed of as part of the remedial action, documentation is available indicating where these substances were disposed of and that this\n   disposal was in compliance with applicable state and federal laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   WAC 173-340-545(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court concludes that the SVE work performed for Seattle Times by AECOM did not adequately comply with this regulation. Pursuant to WAC 173-340-300(2), which requires disclosure of any release of a hazardous substance that might pose a threat to human health or the environment, AECOM sent to Ecology, on January 12, 2011, a 765-page \"Release Report.\" Ex. 111 (495). The Release Report indicated that AECOM was working with Seattle Times to install an SVE system on the Property.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 2. The record contains no evidence of any subsequent communication between AECOM and Ecology, other than a request, on July 8, 2011, for approval to dispose of roughly four cubic yards of contaminated soil (generated in connection with subsurface borings and SVE installation) at a RCRA Subtitle D facility, rather than treating the soil as \"dangerous waste.\" Ex. 113 (505);\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   WAC 173-303-040 &amp; - 070 through - 100 (defining \"dangerous waste\");\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206941\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 6949a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   AECOM did not perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study, develop a cleanup action plan, or submit a written report to Ecology within 90 days after decommissioning the SVE system, all of which were necessary, in some form, to satisfy the technical criteria for substantial equivalence. WAC 173-340-545(4)(a) &amp; (e) ; WAC 173-340-515(4)(a). Moreover, neither AECOM nor Seattle Times provided written notice to LeatherCare before commencing the SVE process, despite actual knowledge that LeatherCare might be a potentially liable party; such failure to advise LeatherCare violated WAC 173-340-545(3)(a)(v).\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that the soil vapor extraction conducted by AECOM was not the \"substantial equivalent of a department-conducted or department-supervised remedial action,\" and Seattle Times is not entitled to recover from LeatherCare for the costs ($348,087) associated with the SVE operation. The portion of the MTCA claim pursuant to which Seattle Times seeks reimbursement for its SVE expenses is DISMISSED. The extent to which Seattle Times may recover from LeatherCare under MTCA for work performed pursuant to the Interim Action Plan (and Agreed Order No. 8996) is addressed later, in connection with the allocation among the parties of the costs related to the excavation and disposal of contaminated soil and the installation and operation of injection wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Contractual Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Before turning to the equitable apportionment of remedial action costs among the parties, the Court must first focus on the contractual claim that Touchstone brings against Seattle Times for two reasons: (i) Seattle Times raises certain defenses to Touchstone's breach of contract claim that affect the amount to be allocated among the parties; and (ii) some of the expenses for which Seattle Times is liable under its agreement with Touchstone cannot be recovered from LeatherCare under MTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The contract at issue,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , the ERIA, is explicitly governed by Washington law. Ex. 100 at \u00b6 9. Washington courts follow the \"objective manifestation\" theory of contracts.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Hearst Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Each of these provisions is clear and unambiguous, and extrinsic evidence has not been considered in construing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Incremental Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Seattle Times contends that the expenses associated with (i) delineating between contaminated and clean soil, (ii) keeping track of the vehicles that disposed of contaminated soil (and the tonnage associated therewith), (iii) setting up an extra conveyor, and (iv) training personnel about handling the hazardous materials at issue (\"HAZWOPER training\") were not \"incremental costs\" for which Seattle Times is responsible under the ERIA because they were not \"costs of transporting or disposing\" of contaminated soil. With regard to the last item, the Court agrees with Seattle Times and finds that the expense of HAZWOPER training ($51,588.65) constitutes an item of LCL's overhead and is not recoverable under the ERIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The other three challenges, however, fail because the expenditures at issue are \"incremental costs\" within the meaning of the ERIA. The definition of \"incremental costs\" says what it means,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , Seattle Times must pay Touchstone for \"the difference between the costs of transporting and disposing of Contaminated Soils and the costs of transporting and disposing of Clean Soils.\" Ex. 100 at \u00b6 1(h). Soil delineation, truck monitoring, and operation of a second conveyor all satisfy this standard. Soil delineation was necessary to determine whether excavated soil was contaminated or clean and how the associated transportation and disposal costs would be treated under the ERIA. Tracking which trucks carried soil destined for RCRA Subtitle D facilities ensured an accurate accounting of transportation and disposal expenses. The extra conveyor was an integral part of the process of transporting the\n   contaminated soil from the point of its excavation to the rail container or truck that would take it to a landfill, and the additional conveyor served to avoid cross-contamination of clean soil. The Court concludes that Seattle Times is obligated under the ERIA to reimburse Touchstone for (i) soil delineation work performed by SES ($475,875.75) and LCL ($43,041.72\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), (ii) the wages that LCL paid to trucking monitors ($41,659.34\n   <sup>\n    48\n   </sup>\n   ), and (iii) the costs of a second conveyor ($62,500). The Court further concludes that Seattle Times cannot, under MTCA, recover from LeatherCare the amounts associated with LCL's soil delineation ($43,041.72) and truck tracking ($41,659.34) efforts because they are related solely to implementation of the ERIA, to which LeatherCare is not a party. Seattle Times may, however, recoup from LeatherCare under MTCA a pro rata share of SES's billings and the expense of the extra conveyor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Disposal Facility (Via Rail or Truck)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Seattle Times argues that, because it was allowed under the ERIA to select the disposal site, it should not have to pay the higher cost that Touchstone incurred to transport PCE-contaminated soil to a facility different from the one Seattle Times chose. On July 29, 2014, counsel for Seattle Times sent a letter to Touchstone indicating that it would treat as \"incremental costs\" only\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   those differentials between transport and disposal of Clean Soil[s] and Contaminated Soils, with the latter going either: a) by rail, through Republic Services, and disposed of at the Roosevelt Regional Subtitle D Landfill in Roosevelt, Washington (\"Roosevelt\"); or b) via another feasible option that is less expensive than option a), should such option become available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Ex. 182 at 2 (footnote omitted). This view lacks merit. Although the ERIA authorized Seattle Times to designate the Roosevelt facility, the contract did not permit Seattle Times to also specify the manner in which soil would be transported to the landfill. The ERIA did not preclude Touchstone from sending PCE-contaminated soil to Roosevelt via truck, at a much higher cost than trucking the material to the RCRA Subtitle D facility in Wenatchee. The Court concludes that Touchstone was authorized under the ERIA to send PCE-contaminated soil via truck to Wenatchee, rather than Roosevelt, when rail containers were unavailable, and that Touchstone's decision to do so was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Seattle Times also contends that the reason for delivering soil by truck to Wenatchee was to avoid construction delay as a consequence of rail container unavailability, and that the additional expense of trucking must be deducted from \"incremental costs\" in light of the ERIA's exclusion of \"costs, if any, that Purchaser incurs due to construction delays, inefficiencies, business interruption or the like.\" Ex. 100 at \u00b6 1(h). The Court is not persuaded. Although Touchstone's approach of trucking the soil (when rail containers could not be obtained) to a facility other than the one identified by Seattle Times served to keep the excavation on schedule, doing so was also consistent with the ERIA, which did not require Touchstone to use a particular mode of transportation, and which inhibited Seattle Times from unreasonably interfering\n   with Touchstone's development of the Property.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. The Court concludes that Seattle Times must compensate Touchstone for, at least, the base rates of sending PCE-contaminated soil by rail to Roosevelt (or a nearby facility in Arlington, Oregon) ($47.89/ton)\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by truck to Wenatchee ($59.14/ton).\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will not, however, permit Touchstone to recover for a premium\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   associated with delivering materials to the railway transfer station on Saturdays, which was necessary only to avoid delays or to compensate for inefficiencies during the work week, and was therefore not an \"incremental cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Indemnity for Third-Party Claims (Injection Wells)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The ERIA requires Seattle Times to indemnify Touchstone for claims asserted by third parties, including Ecology, relating to contaminated soil or groundwater that \"has or may have migrated off of the Property.\" Ex. 100 at \u00b6 3. On the theory that Ecology has, by issuing Agreed Order No. 8996, made a \"claim\" concerning groundwater, Touchstone seeks reimbursement from Seattle Times, pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the ERIA, for the costs associated with the 12 angled and 48 boundary injection wells, but not the 43 interior wells installed at the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seattle Times objects, arguing that these various injection wells are not \"associated with Contaminated Soils or Contaminated Groundwater that has or may have migrated off of the Property.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that all 12 angled wells were necessary to address ongoing groundwater contamination resulting from PCE that migrated from the Property and into soil under Boren Avenue North and Thomas Street, which could not be removed during the excavation process, and that the ERIA requires Seattle Times to compensate Touchstone for the design, installation, maintenance, and operation of those wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Court also concludes that Seattle Times must bear the expenses associated with the 19 boundary wells along the southern edge of the Property, which serve two purposes, one of which is to keep toxic substances from migrating to the Property from Thomas Street, and the other of which is to mitigate contamination to the surrounding area as the groundwater flows in a southeasterly direction from the Property to the adjacent right-of-way and beyond.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 478 at 5-6. The latter goal falls squarely within the terms of Paragraph 3 of the ERIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   In contrast, the Court finds that the eight (8) boundary wells along the northern facade of Building 1 (IW01-IW08) and\n   the 21 boundary wells running the length of the western border of the Property (IW09-IW15, IW26-IW32, IW45-IW46, and IW52-IW56) serve only to prevent further contamination of the groundwater beneath the Property; they act as a barrier to pollutants travelling from the north and west with the groundwater as it flows in a southeasterly direction toward the Property.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   The Court therefore concludes that Seattle Times is not obligated by the ERIA to reimburse Touchstone for the 29 boundary wells near Harrison Street and Boren Avenue North. Seattle Times will be responsible for the 12 angled wells and the 19 boundary wells along Thomas Street, for a total of 31 wells, and the Court will use a ratio of 31\n   <strong>\n    /\n   </strong>\n   103 to calculate the pro rata share of injection-well costs that Seattle Times owes to Touchstone under the ERIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Other Components of Cost Recovery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Both Seattle Times and LeatherCare challenge various aspects of Touchstone's alleged expenses for transporting contained-out materials and for addressing soil and groundwater contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Other Premium\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   In its bid, CTI included a premium of $4.75 per ton for an additional conveyor belt system, a belt scale, personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), a health and safety plan (\"HASP\"), and decontamination.

This written bid from CTI, submitted on April 11, 2014, indicated that it was for contained-out soil to be transported to either the RCRA Subtitle D facility in Wenatchee, operated by Waste Management of Washington, Inc. (\"WM\"), or the RCRA Subtitle D facility in Roosevelt, Washington, operated by Republic Services, Inc. (\"Republic\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2019 at 8. CTI's markup was not separately stated in the bid, but was instead imbedded in the rates CTI proposed to charge for transportation and disposal of the contaminated soil.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   The relevant portion of CTI's written bid is reproduced below, with the disposal facilities highlighted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Ex. 2019 at 8 (modified). Using a quotation from WM for its Columbia Ridge facility in Arlington, Oregon, which is across the Columbia River from Republic's Roosevelt facility and which accepts contaminated soil by rail container, Trial Tr. (Jan. 24, 2018) at 112:1-6 (docket no. 264), Ms. Testa translated CTI's bid into different unit rates, thereby breaking out CTI's markup, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-213\"><strong>ITEM</strong> <strong>CTI's Bid</strong> <strong>Shannon Testa's</strong> <strong>(April 11, 2014)</strong> <strong>Interpretation</strong> Disposal $24.00/ton $23.15/ton Transportation<sup>53</sup> $34.35/ton $31.84/ton Premium Costs $4.75/ton $4.75/ton CTI Markup imbedded $3.36/ton Clean Soil Credit ($7.10/ton) ($7.10/ton) <strong>TOTAL</strong> <strong>$56.00/ton</strong> <strong>$56.00/ton</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2003 (Ex. 2006 at 5); Ex. 2019 at 8 &amp; 11-13;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr.

In July 2014, before excavation began, Riley Conkin, a geologist acting on behalf of Seattle Times in connection with the execution of the ERIA, posed a number of questions to Touchstone's representatives concerning how LCL had derived the rates for transportation of contained-out soil. In this pre-excavation correspondence, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   On page 2 of 4 of the CTI quote dated 4/11/14 [Ex. 2019 at 7-10], CTI references both WM's Wenatchee Subtitle D Landfill and Republic's Roosevelt Subtitle D Landfill as disposal locations. However, WM's Wenatchee landfill is not set-up for rail transport. The CTI quote for Contaminated Soil disposal and transport appears to only include pricing for rail transport. Correct, the pricing on page 2 of the CTI quote is for disposal via container to either WM or Republic's local transfer yard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Ex. 181 at 2 (colors in original: Mr. Conkin's query on behalf of Seattle Times is in blue, and Ms. Testa's response on behalf of LCL and Touchstone is in red).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   In the same email chain, Mr. Conkin requested on behalf of Seattle Times a \"detailed breakdown\" of the items included in Touchstone's proposed rates per ton for transporting contaminated soil, asking in particular about CTI's markup.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Touchstone offered only the following explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   The pricing for both facilities [WM's Columbia Ridge facility and Republic's Roosevelt facility] for disposal via [rail] container is based on 30 tons. Costs include disposal fee, refuse tax, liners, ODEQ fee, rail costs per load, trucking to the transfer station, other premium costs ..., CTI markup and a credit for the disposal of clean soil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   (color in original). Unsatisfied with this response, Seattle Times again asked Touchstone to provide \"the actual numerical costs per ton for each of the items listed,\" indicating that the information presented by Touchstone did not indicate \"the exact fees for items such as trucking to the transfer station or CTI's markup.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   According to Mr. Conkin, Touchstone never gave Seattle Times the requested data, and the first time he saw the dollar amounts of the CTI markups was when they appeared in Touchstone's expert's report, which is dated April 19, 2017, and which was admitted as Exhibit 2006 (filed as docket no. 116).\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr.

The Court finds that Touchstone did not quantify CTI's markups until it disclosed its expert's report during the course of discovery in this action. Moreover, despite Touchstone's (overdue) disclosure, the mystery surrounding how CTI's markups were calculated continued through trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   During trial, after Ms. Testa had already testified, the Court had the following colloquy with Paul Klansnic, Touchstone's\n   senior project manager for the development at the Property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   THE COURT: As I understood your testimony, this [Exhibit 2019 at 7-10] was a fixed bid by CTI for the disposal of all contaminated soil; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   THE COURT: It was a fixed price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   THE WITNESS: Fixed unit price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   THE COURT: It didn't matter where it went, did it?

Is that where we are?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   THE WITNESS: That's what I see here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Trial Tr. (Jan. 29, 2018) at 80:19-82:4 (docket no. 267).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   In an attempt to address the problem identified in CTI's written bid, Touchstone recalled Ms. Testa, who explained that CTI \"quoted the project several times\" and \"unfortunately, they had some things left behind on their quote.\" Trial Tr. (Jan. 31, 2018) at 7:20-22 (docket no. 268). According to Ms. Testa, CTI \"left the fact that Waste Management, Wenatchee Regional Landfill, up under the contaminated soil, contained-out. That should not have been there.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 7:25-8:3. When asked whether she received any other written bid from CTI after April 11, 2014, the date of the bid admitted as Pages 7 through 10 of Exhibit 2019, Ms. Testa indicated that she \"did not receive a full bid from them,\" and only obtained \"supplemental information to their bid.\" Trial Tr. (Jan. 31, 2018) at 9:9-13 (docket no. 268).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Although CTI's bid erroneously indicated that the quoted rates were for disposal at both the Roosevelt and Wenatchee facilities, regardless of whether the mode of transportation was rail or truck,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2019 at 8, the Court finds, in light of Ms. Testa's testimony, that this bid was meant to apply solely to the hauling of soil via rail container, and that CTI's markup for PCE-contaminated soil transported to either the Roosevelt or the Arlington facility was $3.36 per ton.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2003. With regard to the CTI markups for trucking PCE-contaminated soil to Wenatchee ($6.01/ton) and for transporting petroleum-laden material to the WM transfer station on Alaska Street ($5.11/ton), the Court concludes that the summary, namely Exhibit 2003 (Ex. 2006 at 5), offered to prove these amounts is not supported by any evidence in the record. The record contains no written bid from CTI relating to the costs of delivering soil to Wenatchee or the Alaska Street transfer station, and no person, including Ms. Testa, testified about the rates quoted by CTI for such services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, because Touchstone paid\n   a \"guaranteed maximum price\" to LCL,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   note 5, Ms. Testa's representation that LCL paid CTI at the rates set forth in Exhibit 2003 (Ex. 2006 at 5),\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (Jan. 31, 2018) at 12:23-13:7 (docket no. 268), is not sufficient to establish that Touchstone paid the markups at issue. Thus, the Court will allow a CTI markup of only $3.36 per ton regardless of the mode of transportation or the type of toxic substance involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Markup-Lease Crutcher Lewis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Touchstone seeks reimbursement for LCL's allegedly standard markup of 4.414% over the charged amount.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2002. According to counsel for Touchstone, Invoice No. 10, admitted as Exhibit 148, shows how the markup at issue was typically billed by LCL. Invoice No. 10 itemizes the components of LCL's markup as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-243\">\u2022 Data Processing 0.09% \u2022 Fee 2.25% \u2022 State Business and Occupation (\"B&amp;O\") Tax 0.471% \u2022 City B&amp;O Tax 0.215% \u2022 Professional Liability and Property Damage Insurance 0.8% \u2022 Payment and Performance Bond 0.5% ====== 4.326%</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 148;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (Jan. 24, 2018) at 144:15-19 &amp; 179:4-20 (docket no. 264). The Court finds that Invoice No. 10, which shows a total markup of only 4.326%, does not support the requested figure of 4.414%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The Court further concludes that Seattle Times cannot be required under the ERIA and LeatherCare is not obligated under MTCA to pay the proposed B &amp; O tax surcharges of 0.471% and 0.215%. RCW 82.04.500 states that B &amp; O taxes \"shall constitute a part of the operating overhead\" of \"persons engaging in business\" and shall not be construed as a tax on such persons' \"purchasers or customers.\" During closing argument, Touchstone's counsel attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Peck v.

The Court sees no basis for disregarding the decision in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , which made clear that allowing companies to charge a B &amp; O tax surcharge, in addition to the \"distinctly different sales tax,\" would effectively tax the customer twice, thereby improperly rendering RCW 82.04.500\"meaningless\" and the B &amp; O levy on businesses \"illusory.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20P.3d%20304\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20P.3d%20304\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20P.3d%20304\">\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20P.3d%20304\">\n    275 P.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the issue before the Court is not whether LCL could recoup its B &amp; O taxes from Touchstone, but rather whether Touchstone can pass along to Seattle Times and/or LeatherCare any B &amp; O surcharges it might have paid. The Court concludes it cannot. Thus, Touchstone's right to recover against Seattle Times and LeatherCare for LCL's markup will be limited to the rates relating to data processing (0.09%), insurance (0.8%), and bond expenses (0.5%), as well as LCL's\n   project fee of 2.25%, which in the aggregate equal 3.64%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Invoices-SoundEarth Strategies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   In connection with SES's invoices, Touchstone seeks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   \u2022 $475,875.75 for SES's soil delineation services, 100% of which Touchstone has billed to Seattle Times, but Seattle Times has not paid;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   \u2022 $598,258.21 in connection with SES's work on the design, installation, and operation of the various injection wells, which Touchstone proposes to divide between the other two parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   with 63% allocated to Seattle Times pursuant to the ERIA, and 37% apportioned to LeatherCare under MTCA; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   \u2022 $1,168,185.54 for which Touchstone suggests LeatherCare is 100% liable under MTCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   LeatherCare contends that Touchstone has engaged in double-dipping with respect to SES's billings, and that the SES invoices admitted into evidence do not support the total amount sought by Touchstone.

With regard to SES's \"projected\" billings, Mr. Klansnic offered no testimony concerning the method he used to derive the figure of $664,016, and Touchstone identified no materials to support this number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The second table included in Exhibit 2004, titled \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet,\" was prepared by SES,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (Jan. 29, 2018) at 61:10-14 (docket no. 267), and the Court concludes that Mr. Klansnic, as a project manager for Touchstone, and not SES, had no personal knowledge concerning how the second table was generated. Touchstone called no other witness to lay foundation for the \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet.\" The \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet\" indicates as follows: (i) from February 2013 through November 2017, the sum of SES's invoices was $1,799,608.60; (ii) Seattle Times was invoiced for $852,778.42;\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) the balance\n   of charges not billed to Seattle Times was $946,830.18,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2004 at 3-4, which is the same figure that appears in Mr. Klansnic's table,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2004 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   During the course of Mr. Klansnic's testimony, Touchstone reoffered Exhibit 2004 for all purposes. Trial Tr. (Jan. 29, 2018) at 64:11 (docket no. 267). With regard to Mr. Klansnic's table and the \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet,\" LeatherCare objected, explaining that it had not been provided the underlying SES invoices.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 65:8-16 (\"We have not seen backup for the SoundEarth Strategies' costs....\"). The Court admitted Mr. Klansnic's table, but not the \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   at 65:17-66:15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Touchstone subsequently offered, through a different witness, SES's invoices from February 26, 2014, through August 19, 2015, which were admitted into evidence as Exhibit 2026. Trial Tr. (Jan. 29, 2018) at 130:19-131:20 (docket no. 267). Touchstone, however, never provided SES's invoices for the periods preceding February 2014 or after August 2015. A revised version of Exhibit 2004, including SES's \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet,\" was later admitted into evidence by stipulation of the parties, Trial Tr. (Jan. 31, 2018) at 36:14-37:13 (docket no. 268), but the only SES invoices in evidence total $931,527.33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   This figure does not match either the costs to date ($946,830.18) or the total projected costs ($1,610,846) set forth in Mr. Klansnic's table, and it is not even close to the total amount ($1,799,608.60) shown on SES's \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   The Court concludes that, with regard to SES's billings, Touchstone failed to lay an adequate foundation for the two tables in Exhibit 2004. As the proponent of the summaries, Touchstone bore the burden of demonstrating that it had made the supporting documents available to the opposing parties.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Paddack\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"593111\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1254/#p1259\">\n    745 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1259 ;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Touchstone has not met this burden. In objecting to the two tables in Exhibit 2004, LeatherCare indicated that it had \"not seen\" the underlying materials on which\n   the SES cost figures were based, and Touchstone has not established, or even asserted, that the supporting documents were disclosed or otherwise made available to LeatherCare in discovery. Touchstone eventually supplied only a portion of SES's invoices,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2026, thereby inducing LeatherCare to withdraw its objection, but given the course of these proceedings, the Court finds that LeatherCare did not waive its challenge to Exhibit 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concludes that the tables in Exhibit 2004 cannot be treated as summaries under Rule 1006, and the tables will be considered only to the extent that supportive documents were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     SES's Billings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   In light of Touchstone's attempt to obtain duplicative damages, the substantial disparity between SES's invoices of record (Exhibit 2026) and the summaries allegedly based on them (Exhibit 2004), LeatherCare's objections and Touchstone's failure to overcome them, and the lack of testimony from someone with personal knowledge concerning how SES's \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet\" was generated, the Court concludes that the \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet\" is not sufficiently reliable to prove the contents of SES's invoices for the period from February 2013 to November 2017, and the Court declines to award Touchstone the total ($1,799,608.60) set forth in the \"Budget Tracking Spreadsheet.\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 1006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   The Court will instead include as the costs associated with SES's services the amounts originally billed to Seattle Times before Touchstone attempted to apportion the expenses between Seattle Times and LeatherCare. These figures are set forth in three invoices, namely Invoices Nos. 14, 15, and 16, which were admitted as Exhibits 152, 153, and 2010. Attached to each invoice was a cover letter from an individual employed at the relevant time by SES, summarizing the costs being charged, and several pages of billing detail, identifying the various tasks performed, the personnel who engaged in the activities, the date on which they occurred, and the amount of time they required.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 152, 153, &amp; 2010. The Court concludes that Invoices Nos. 14, 15, and 16 qualify, under Rule 1006, as summaries with the requisite supporting materials, which have been made available to both Seattle Times and LeatherCare. These invoices support the following amounts relating to SES's work: (i) $475,875.75 for excavation and soil delineation work, and (ii) $598,258.21 ($208,581.45 plus $389,676.76) for groundwater treatment system design, installation, and operation, for a total of $1,074,133.96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Invoices-Regulatory Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The parties do not appear to dispute the sum that Touchstone alleges it has paid to Ecology to date, specifically $88,511.27. Ex. 2004 at 12. LeatherCare asks only that Touchstone be allocated a greater share of these fees because it has pursued regulatory approval to further its own business interests. The Court concludes that the regulatory charges were reasonable and will include them in the amount to be allocated among the parties based on equitable factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    f.\n    <em>\n     Sales Tax\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Touchstone seeks $648,674.31 in sales tax allegedly incurred in connection with the remedial action.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2002. Both Seattle Times and LeatherCare contend that Touchstone may not recover sales tax from them. They are only partially correct. In Washington, sales tax must be collected on all non-exempt \"retail sales\" from the buyer and then paid by the seller to the Washington Department of Revenue.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   RCW 82.08.020 &amp; .050. A retail sale includes charges for labor and services rendered in \"constructing, repairing, ... or improving\" new or existing buildings \"under, upon, or above real property of or for consumers,\" including \"the clearing of land and the moving of earth.\" RCW 82.04.050(2)(b) ;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   RCW 82.04.190(4) (defining \"consumer\" as including any person who owns real property being constructed, repaired, improved, or otherwise altered). Excluded from the definition of retail sale are certain services like engineering, accounting, consulting, and administrative work that is provided to either the consumer of, or the person responsible for performing, the construction, repair, or improvement. RCW 82.04.051(1). Touchstone does not appear to have been charged, or to seek reimbursement for, sales tax related to SES's services or Ecology's fees, which do not qualify as \"retail sales.\" Thus, the sole question before the Court is whether sales tax was owed, and can be recovered, with respect to LCL's and CTI's services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Some services LCL provided to Touchstone were for accounting or administrative purposes, for example, tracking trucks and regulatory compliance efforts (which were billed along with, and cannot be disentangled from, soil delineation charges). Likewise, a portion of LCL's markup (1.39%) involves administrative matters, namely data processing, insurance, and required bonds. Thus, as to these items, the Court will not include sales tax in the computation of the amount to be apportioned among the parties. The balance of LCL's charges, however, including its project fee on non-administrative tasks (at the rate of 2.25%), as well as all of CTI's services, fall squarely within the definition of retail sales for which sales taxes are due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   In arguing otherwise, both Seattle Times and LeatherCare rely on statutes relating to B &amp; O taxes, not sales tax. Seattle Times cites RCW 82.04.051(2) for the proposition that the appropriate tax rate is the one that applies to the predominant activity involved. This statute contemplates that, if the predominant activity is not explicitly taxed under a separate provision, the catch-all rate of 1.5% should be used to calculate the B &amp; O tax owed on the gross income of the business.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2050025\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/370/719/#p728\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   RCW 82.04.290(2). LeatherCare references former RCW 82.04.2635, which expired on July 1, 2003. That provision set forth a B &amp; O tax of 0.471% times the gross income of persons engaged in the business of environmental remedial action. RCW 82.04.2635(1) (2002). When the statute expired, contaminated-site cleanup was again considered a \"retail sale,\" and the B &amp; O tax rate for such work now depends on the specific activity performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The authorities\n   mentioned by Seattle Times and LeatherCare relate only to the B &amp; O tax that LCL, CTI, and SES must pay on their gross proceeds, which is distinct from the sales tax that consumers owe in connection with retail sales.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Bravern Residential, II, LLC v.

The Court also finds that the contained-out boundaries delineated on SES's lift maps approximate with sufficient accuracy the scope of material that was itself contaminated or that needed to be extracted to access deeper soil in which PCE concentrations were above the cleanup level. The Court reaches this conclusion based on the evidence indicating that the expense associated with transporting contaminated soil to RCRA Subtitle D facilities served as an incentive to demarcate the contained-out regions as narrowly as possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, with the exception of 6,500 cu. ft.

Nevertheless, as the parties have stipulated, the manner of handling both solid and liquid waste from the PCE equipment was the root cause of the PCE contamination at the Property,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   pp. 1012-15, and the Court concludes that Troy and LeatherCare were equally at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Troy participated in contaminating the Property by providing and operating the dump truck that served as a waste receptacle, which was left open to the elements between runs to the transfer station, allowing PCE to seep into the subsurface soil. In addition, in its capacity as owner and landlord, Troy was responsible for any deficiencies in the pipes and side sewers that carried waste water to the municipal sewer mains. Troy's own use of PCE, which would have generated both solid and liquid waste, also contributed to the contamination, but perhaps at a slower rate than LeatherCare's PCE operations. Both companies benefitted from the mechanism of PCE release at the Property, deriving income from the dry-cleaning operations. During the period 1979 through 1985, LeatherCare's gross receipts exceeded $7 million,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 7, 10, 15, 16, 18, 20, &amp; 22, and it used over 10,000 gallons of PCE, a little over 27% of which was lost along with solid waste (filter muck, filter cartridges, and still bottoms) or waste water,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   p. 1016-17, resulting in PCE contamination of the soil and groundwater at the Property. In the absence of other involved entities, and if Troy was still solvent, the Court would hold Troy and LeatherCare each 50% liable for the remedial action costs; however, the facts of this case are not so simple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Seattle Times\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Bearing in mind all the equitable factors applicable to this matter, which were previously outlined, the Court observes that, in contrast to LeatherCare's six-year period of PCE use, Seattle Times owned the\n   Property for over 25 years. During most of that period, Seattle Times took few corrective actions, and PCE plumes were allowed to travel farther and deeper in the subsurface soil, reaching the adjacent right-of-way and the groundwater. Although Seattle Times did not play an active role in the original contamination, it is no less culpable than Troy and LeatherCare, particularly given (i) its knowledge at the relevant times that the Property had been or was being used as a dry-cleaning facility, (ii) its failure to conduct any meaningful investigation prior to purchasing the Property, (iii) its inadequate exploration after acquiring the Property, and (iv) its insufficient efforts at remediation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, at a time when Troy could still be sued, Seattle Times forever released it from all \"causes of action or suits of any kind or nature ... in any way arising out of the presence of various flammable, hazardous and/or toxic wastes\" on the Property. Ex. 1069 at 1. The settlement involved the essence of the claims being litigated in this matter and, with the passage of time after Troy's dissolution, effectively released from liability an entity that should have borne a substantial share of the excavation-related and groundwater-treatment costs at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   In addition, despite serving as LeatherCare's landlord for roughly 14 years, when concerns arose about PCE contamination at the Property, Seattle Times did not alert LeatherCare in connection with AECOM's efforts to reduce the concentration levels using SVE technology, prior to entering into the ERIA with Touchstone, or before Touchstone commenced or completed excavation. As a result, LeatherCare was unable to participate in the analysis of remediation alternatives or propose ways in which response costs could be reduced or contained. LeatherCare has also been hampered in its defense in this litigation, being forced to rely on Touchstone's consultant's work and data rather than that of its own expert. In sum, with respect to its MTCA claim against LeatherCare, Seattle Times does not come to the Court with clean hands, and the Court will attribute to Seattle Times a 60% portion of Troy's 50% share of the PCE-related remedial action costs, which is equivalent to 30% of the total amount being allocated pursuant to MTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Touchstone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Unlike the other entities involved, Touchstone did not create or exacerbate the hazardous situation at the Property, but Touchstone is the only party that benefits from the remedial action. If successful in obtaining the necessary approvals from Ecology, Touchstone will be poised to sell the now redeveloped Property. Before purchasing the Property, Touchstone knew about the contamination, and the condition of the Property affected its purchase price. In negotiating an indemnification agreement\n   with Seattle Times, Touchstone addressed its two primary concerns, namely the increased cost of transporting contaminated soil to appropriate disposal facilities and its possible exposure to claims by third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   To the extent that Touchstone receives compensation from Seattle Times for these components of its remedial action costs, it will have realized the benefit of the bargain struck with Seattle Times, and any remaining expenses are arguably what Touchstone expected to absorb as part of its redevelopment efforts. Indeed, but for being brought into this litigation as a third-party defendant by LeatherCare, Touchstone might not have pursued any claim against LeatherCare. For these and other reasons articulated in the next section, the Court will apportion a little over 40% of the groundwater treatment and regulatory review expenses to Touchstone, but it will not allocate to Touchstone any of the excavation-related costs, other than those Touchstone must bear because they are unrecoverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Methods of Allocating Remedial Action Costs Under MTCA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   The remedial action costs to be apportioned fall into two categories: (i) expenses associated with installation and operation of injection wells for groundwater treatment and regulatory review ($942,824.26); and (ii) expenses related to the transportation and disposal of PCE-contaminated soil ($7,385,681.24). The Court concludes that, for each category of remedial action costs, a different allocation method is appropriate. For the reasons explained later in this section, the groundwater treatment and regulatory review costs will be shared among all three parties in the following manner: Seattle Times (31/103); LeatherCare (29/103); Touchstone (43/103). The expenses associated with transporting PCE-contaminated soil and disposing of it at RCRA Subtitle D facilities, however, will be divided between Seattle Times (30%) and LeatherCare (70%).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Groundwater Treatment and Regulatory Review Expenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Because the bulk of the remedial action costs that Touchstone seeks separately from LeatherCare (and not from Seattle Times) involve groundwater treatment, for which monitored natural attenuation was never proposed as a viable alternative, and concerning which LeatherCare was not provided a meaningful opportunity to be heard in advance of the work being performed, the Court declines to award Touchstone the full measure of its claimed damages. Instead, the Court will allocate the expenses of installing and operating the various injection wells as follows: Seattle Times (31/103),\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   LeatherCare (29/103), and Touchstone (43/103). As explained earlier,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   pp. 1056-67, Seattle Times is apportioned the costs relating to the 12 angled wells and the 19 boundary wells along the southern boundary\n   of the Property. The Court concludes that, under MTCA, LeatherCare must reimburse Touchstone for the other 29 boundary wells, near the northern and western boundaries of the Property, which act as a barrier to contaminants flowing from the adjacent right-of-ways. At least with respect to Boren Avenue North, such pollutants likely originated from the Property, but could not be removed from under the road as part of the Interim Action excavation, and the continuing threat to the Property from these contaminants is causally linked to LeatherCare's historic operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   The Court further concludes that Touchstone is the appropriate party to shoulder the expense of the 43 interior wells. The Court finds that those wells were proposed to Ecology, instead of monitored natural attenuation, for the sake of expediency, in order to move forward on construction efforts without the risk of redesigns or rework in the future. Although such decision made business sense, it is not a fair basis for passing along the costs to a party who was not \"in the room where it happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   The Court will apportion the regulatory review expenses ($88,511.27) in the same manner as the injection well costs because Ecology focused more on groundwater treatment issues than on transportation of contaminated soil. In addition, assigning Touchstone a larger share (43/103) of the regulatory review expenses is consistent with Touchstone's status as the primary (or sole) beneficiary of Ecology's work. Consistent with the foregoing analysis, the groundwater treatment and regulatory review expenses are equitably allocated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-311\"><strong>Table 3: Apportionment of</strong> <strong>Seattle Times</strong> <strong>LeatherCare</strong> <strong>Touchstone</strong> <strong>Groundwater Treatment and</strong> <strong>(31/103)</strong> <strong>(29/103)</strong> <strong>(43/103)</strong> <strong>Regulatory Review Expenses</strong> LCL - Installation of Injection Wells TOTAL: $225,890 +$5,082.52 (LCL 2.2.5.% Project Fee) + $3.139.87 (LCL 1.39% Administrative Marimp) + $77,065.03 $72,093.09 $106,896.66 $21,942.39 (9.5% sale tan) = $256,054.78 SES - Injection Well Services TOTAL: $598,258.21 $180,058.30 $168,441 63 $249,758 28 Regulatory Review TOTAL: $88,511.27 $26,639.31 $24,920.65 $36,951.31 <strong>TOTALS ($942,824.26)</strong> <strong>$283,762.64</strong> <strong>$265,455.37</strong> <strong>$393,606.25</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     PCE-Contaminated Soil Transportation and Disposal Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Because the Court has already reduced the amount of PCE-contaminated soil transportation and disposal costs to be allocated among the parties (by disallowing the Saturday premium, certain markups, items of overhead, and sales tax on administrative services), the Court does not attribute any of these expenses to Touchstone.
