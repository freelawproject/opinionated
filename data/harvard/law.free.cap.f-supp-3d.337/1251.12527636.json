Therefore, Commerce's determination is not in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce's decision is also unsupported by substantial evidence.

Further, there is record evidence that the senior board management of the collapsed companies that owned fixed asset owning companies overlapped with companies that were collapsed, but did not own assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Collapsing Memo at 8 (citations omitted). Commerce does not address the senior management structure of the non-collapsed group in the final determination, and no party directs the court to record evidence of the non-collapsed group's individual senior board management. There is also no evidence on the record supporting the contention that the non-collapsed group could not have manufactured the subject merchandise.
