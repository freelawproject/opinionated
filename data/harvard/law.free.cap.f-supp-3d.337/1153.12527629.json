She processed payments for persons attending the Center's \"Space Camp\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and performed other duties relating to accounts receivable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was hired as a full-time employee\n   in 1999, and was classified as a \"Camp Accounting Clerk.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her job title later was changed to \"Senior Camp Accounting Clerk.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Center's accounting department was reorganized in 2007, and plaintiff was designated a \"Camp Collections Manager,\" a position that required her to be responsible for accounts receivable, payroll processing, and customer service functions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's initial supervisor in the accounting department (Mildred Davis) retired in 2013, and Brenda Perez was hired to replace her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One of the goals established for plaintiff by Perez as part of her initial, January 10, 2014 performance evaluation, was: \"Avoid negative politicking and gossiping amongst fellow co-workers/peers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perez's second, May 8, 2014 evaluation of plaintiff's performance contained instructions that she \"immediately\" cease personal telephone conversations during working hours, and that \"Personal cell phones [were to] be used for emergencies only.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Center installed new accounting software during the Fall of 2014. The upgrade automated many of plaintiff's previous duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, in order to justify plaintiff's continued employment, Perez assigned new duties to her, including the responsibility for \"billing specific events\" and \"all of the regular accounts receivable\" for which\n   <em>\n    Brenda Perez\n   </em>\n   previously had been responsible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Louie Ramirez became the Center's Chief Financial Officer during January of the following year (2015), and Brenda Perez's job title was changed from \"Accounting Manager\" to \"Controller.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was redesignated a \"Senior Accounts Receivable Specialist\" and her pay was increased to $21.00 an hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later that year, after plaintiff had received a written reprimand for \"discourtesy\" on May 8, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   she met with Perez and Vickie Henderson, the Center's Vice President of Human Resources. Henderson explained the reason for the reprimand: an incident that had been documented on an \"Employee Disciplinary/Counseling\n   Report\" authored by a Center employee identified only as \"Teen.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The substantive portion of that report read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Tamela Rabon [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] from upstairs was in crew galley and scream [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] out \"there's a bug in my food\" and then later says \"oh, no it's not\" but everyone heard her. I have been told that she does things like this all the time. She and her blonde girlfriend from upstairs do things like this all the time I am told. She refuses piazza [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] that she is served saying she wants a \"Fresh One.\" This not only makes foodservice look bad but also the entire museum.

The policy read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Center's business phones are to be used only for official business. Personal telephone calls should be kept to a minimum so as not to interrupt the business processes.

Cell phone usage while operating Center vehicles or Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) on Center business should be used with caution. All employees operating Center vehicles shall obey all traffic laws to include those concerning cell phones.\n   <em>\n    Please be reminded that supervisors and managers will monitor telephone and especially cell phone usage while you are at work.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Doc. no. 15-1 (Plaintiff's Deposition: Part 1), Ex. 12, at ECF 87 (italicized emphasis\n   supplied).

She recorded the following statements under the category labeled \"Job Knowledge &amp; Performance\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Tamela had several complaints filed in the spring of 2015 regarding being discourteous to food service staff.

However, there have been complaints regarding Tamela's behavior in the Accounting suites relating to the volume of her conversations and constant negative attitude.

When evaluating the objective severity of offensive conduct, courts examine the totality of circumstances, including such factors as: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct was threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with plaintiff's work performance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

It is not necessary to prove each of the factors individually. However, the factors, taken together, must reveal conduct that is so extreme that it caused a material change in the terms and conditions of plaintiff's employment, and created a working environment that a reasonable person would find discriminatorily abusive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

The severity factor does not weigh heavily in plaintiff's favor. None of the actions she complained of can be considered extreme, in the sense of working a material change in the terms and conditions of her employment. The rearrangement of the office suite, the direction to cease personal telephone calls in the suite, and the monitoring of plaintiff's activities were legitimate efforts by Perez to maintain a productive working environment. When plaintiff complained to Kimberlin about notation of her personal information on the staff calendar, Kimberlin promptly complied with her request to remove it. Finally, while plaintiff may have felt humiliated by the comments and laughter of employees about the relocation of her cubicle, that conduct was not sufficiently severe to meet the legal standard. Defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's hostile work environment claim is, therefore, due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Disparate Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff claims that she was subjected to race-based disparate treatment when the cubicles in the accounting suite were rearranged and her cubicle was relocated to the back of the suite.

Under that analytical framework, a plaintiff must first establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of disparate treatment in order to create a presumption of discrimination. To rebut the presumption, the employer must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for\n   the disputed employment action.
