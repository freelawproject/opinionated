[D.E. 64], which Miami Chocolates, LLC, Charles McDonald, and Judy McDonald's (the \"MC Defendants\") joined [D.E. 67].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Overview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Starr, an insurance company, has filed this declaratory action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , requesting that this Court declare that it has no duty to defend or indemnify the MC Defendants against claims that Peterbrooke brought against them in an underlying lawsuit (the \"Underlying Suit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For context, the Underlying Suit involves an action by Peterbrooke against the MC Defendants, former franchisees, alleging that they had continued operating a previously franchised chocolatier shop as if it remained associated with Peterbrooke even after Peterbrooke had terminated their franchise agreement (the \"Agreement\"). As a result, Peterbrooke asserted the following claims against the\n   MC Defendants: Count I for trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham Act; Count II for false designations of origin, also in violation the Lanham Act; Count III for trademark infringement in violation of Florida common law; Count IV for common law unfair competition; and Count V\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (alleged against Miami Chocolates alone) for breach of the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The dispute here concerns specifically whether Starr, as the MC Defendants' insurer, must defend and indemnify the MC Defendants against Peterbrooke's abovementioned claims. As to that, Starr contends that each of Peterbrooke's claims in the Underlying Suit is either not covered by or is excluded under the relevant insurance policy (the \"Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And indeed, at a hearing this Court held on July 2, 2018, Peterbrooke and the MC Defendants conceded that all but Count IV, the unfair competition claim, are subject to applicable Policy exclusions. As to Count IV, Peterbrooke and the MC Defendants raised new arguments at the July 2, 2018 hearing for why it is not subject to the same exclusions that they conceded apply to Counts I, II, III, and V. The Court thus allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs regarding coverage of Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After considering the parties' supplemental briefs, the briefing related to their cross summary judgement motions, the Policy, and the underlying complaint, the Court holds that Starr's Policy also excludes Count IV and that Starr thus has no duty to defend or indemnify the MC Defendants against any claim in Peterbrooke's Underlying Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whether Starr owes a duty to defend the MC Defendants against Peterbrooke's unfair competition claim depends on (A) what coverage, as well as exclusions from coverage, Starr's Policy provides and (B) what facts Peterbrooke alleged in the Underlying Suit to support its claim. These considerations are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Policy's Relevant Coverage and Exclusion Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Regarding coverage and the relevant exclusions, the Policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION II-LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pursuant to the Agreement, [Peterbrooke] granted Miami Chocolates a limited license and authority to use and display the Peterbrooke Mark, but only in such manner, and at such locations and times, as were expressly authorized by [Peterbrooke]. In no event was Miami Chocolates or its owners or affiliates authorized to use the Peterbrooke Mark after the termination of its franchise. Such unauthorized use was and is expressly prohibited under the terms of the [Franchise] Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   28. Section 19 of the Agreement contains provisions that set forth the rights and obligations of the parties in the event of termination. Specifically, pursuant to Section 19.2, Miami Chocolates and its owners are prohibited from identifying themselves as current or former Peterbrooke franchises, from using any of [Peterbrooke's] trade secrets, promotional materials, the Peterbrooke Mark, or any mark that is confusingly similar. Miami Chocolates and its owners were required, upon termination, to immediately remove or change the signs on the Shop in order to effectively distinguish their premises from its former appearances and from any association with [Peterbrooke]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   30. Despite the [above-referenced] post-termination provisions, Defendants continue to hold themselves out to the public as operating a genuine and authorized Peterbrooke Chocolatier Shop by continuing to use the Peterbrooke Mark subsequent to termination of the\n   Agreement. In so doing, Defendants infringed upon the Peterbrooke Mark and breached their explicit post-termination obligations under the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   31. Defendants Charles McDonald and Judy McDonald personally and blatantly infringed on Peterbrooke's Marks following the termination of the franchise relationship. In particular, Charles McDonald and Judy McDonald continued to utilize the Peterbrooke Mark and signage and continued to sell products under the Peterbrooke name for several months after the Agreement was terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   32. Defendants' post-termination use and display of the Peterbrooke Mark and/or any items associated with the Peterbrooke brand at their former Peterbrooke Shop was without [Peterbrooke]'s license or consent, and has caused and continues to cause mistake, confusion, or deception in the minds of the public as to the source, affiliation, and sponsorship of Defendants' products. Defendants' unlawful use of the Peterbrooke Mark deceives customers into concluding that Defendants' products are made or supplied by [Peterbrooke], were prepared under [Peterbrooke]'s supervision, are sponsored and endorsed by PFA, and bear the Peterbrooke Mark pursuant to [Peterbrooke]'s authority and permission. Such impressions are calculated to, and will have the effect of, misleading customers in their purchasing decisions, thus unfairly capitalizing on [Peterbrooke]'s goodwill, reputation, and appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [D.E. 1-2. at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28, 30-32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on these allegations, Peterbrooke asserted in the Underlying Suit that the MC Defendants' post-termination use of its intellectual property and other items associated with its brand constituted, among other things, common law unfair competition.
