For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit arises from personal injuries allegedly sustained when a cigarette lighter exploded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dorothy Herbert was using a disposable cigarette lighter on October 10, 2016 when it exploded, lighting Herbert's shirt on fire and causing third degree burns on the upper portion of her body. The lighter was distributed by Wing Sale, Inc. On April 17, 2017, Herbert sued Wing Sale, claiming that Wing Sale violated the Louisiana Product Liability Act and breached it warranty\n   that the lighter would be safe for use. On October 11, 2017, Wing Sale sued Xuzhou Aliter Products Co., Shanico Enterprise Corporation, and NSL Group USA, Inc. Xuzhou Aliter designed and manufactured the lighter, and its principal place of business is in China. Shanico and NSL are both California corporations, with their principal place of business in California. They facilitated the importation of lighters between Xuzhou Aliter and distributors in the United States. Typically, Shanico imports lighters from Xuzhou Aliter. Over the last ten years, all of the lighters that Shanico handled were manufactured by Xuzhou Aliter. Shanico then sells those lighters to NSL, usually around ten million lighters per year, who then resells them to distributors and retailers. In 2009 and 2010, Shanico facilitated the importation of two shipments of lighters, which were purchased by Wing Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wing Sale alleged in its third party demand that the lighters manufactured, imported, and distributed by Xuzhou Aliter, NSL, and Shanico were not properly tested and were unsafe, and that the three third-party defendants are responsible to Hebert for any alleged injury and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wing Sale voluntarily dismissed its claims against Xuzhou Aliter on April 4, 2018 because it was unable to serve it. On April 24, 2018, NSL answered the third party complaint. The same day, Shanico moved to dismiss Wing Sale's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On June 14, 2018, the Court ordered that Wing Sale and Shanico complete jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to present by motion a defense that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When nonresidents like the defendants move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court bears the burden of establishing it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luv N' Care v.

Shanico and NSL are both based in California; they share a building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   They typically receive the lighters in California and inspect them before they are sold to distributors. Shanico has no offices or employees in Louisiana, does not advertise in Louisiana, and does not maintain a website whereby a person or entity in Louisiana can make arrangements online for Shanico to facilitate the import of cigarette lighters. Additionally, in the last ten years, Shanico has not facilitated the import of any cigarette lighters for a Louisiana customer or client. However, in 2009 and 2010, Wing Sale, a New Jersey corporation, purchased two large orders of cigarette lighters from Xuzhou Aliter. Some of those lighters were then sold in Louisiana. It is unclear to the Court whether the parties agree if the lighter that injured Hebert originated from the Shanico shipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Shanico's role in the sale is disputed. Shanico attempts to distance itself from the importation of the lighters. BoQi Wang, Shanico's president and corporate representative, states in his deposition that Shanico was a mere consignee to the importation of lighters, and did not ever own them. Shanico contends that it merely helped Wing Sale import the lighters by completing some paperwork, but it never bought or sold the lighters. Wing Sale disagrees, and contends that Shanico imported the lighters, then sold them to it. A 2009 correspondence signed by Wang states that the shipment \"has been sold in transit to Wing Sale, Inc.\" Wang states that he did not prepare that letter, and blindly signed it. Additionally, Shanico allowed Wing Sale to rely on Shanico's U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission certification to import the lighters. All lighters imported into the United States must meet CPSC regulations, and the importer is required to complete inspections on the imported lighters. Shanico contends that it simply allowed Wing Sale to use its CPSC certification for the lighters. However, it maintains, and Wing Sale does not contest, that Shanico did not place the order with the manufacturer, retain the forwarding company, clear United States customs, or receive the shipment. It also did not inspect the lighters, because the shipment was received by Wing Sale in Newark, New Jersey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court must resolve any conflicts in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Belin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509723\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/644/#p648\">\n    20 F.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (5th Cir. 1994). Accordingly, the Court will accept Wing Sale's evidence that Shanico imported the lighters, but will still consider the undisputed facts that Shanico's role as importer was limited. After Shanico imported the lighters, it promptly sold the lighters to Wing Sale, who distributed them nationally. The 2009 shipment contained 649,000 lighters, and the 2010 shipment contained 1,100,000 lighters, totally 1,749,000 lighters. Of the nearly 1.75 million lighters imported by Shanico and purchased by Wing Sale, about 14,000 lighters were sold to customers in Louisiana, or 0.8%. Wang testified that he never placed any restriction on where Wing Sale could sell the lighters, or even inquired as to where he would sell the lighters. He stated in his deposition that he \"ha[d] no idea\" whether the lighters Shanico helped to import would eventually be sold in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court does not have personal jurisdiction over Shanico because Shanico did not purposefully avail itself in the state of Louisiana. It did not regularly import products that were sold to distributors in Louisiana; it has not sold to a distributor in the state in the last ten years. It has not done \"something more\" to develop a relationship with Louisiana-no advertising, marketing, contact, or even a website-nor has it done anything \"special.\" The plaintiff has not submitted evidence that Shanico even marketed its services to distributors, who in turn would sell in the state. And although it has sold a large volume of lighters to Shanico, it did so in only two shipments, eight years ago. There is no indication that the lighters were specifically designed to appeal to Louisiana customers, or that Louisiana customers have a special affinity for lighters above other states. In fact, less than 1% of its sales to Wing Sale ended up in Louisiana. Although Shanico never instructed Wing Sale to avoid selling its lighters in Louisiana, it never encouraged it either. Shanico did not profit from Wing Sale's sale of the lighters it procured; it had no interest in the lighters after Wing Sale took them, including where they were sold. When only a small fraction of the lighters were sold in Louisiana, and Wing Sale cannot show any sales effort on behalf of Shanico to sell the lighters in the state, it cannot be said that Shanico purposefully directed the lighters towards Louisiana. Because Wing Sale has not met its burden to show that Shanico has minimum contacts with the state, the Court does not have specific jurisdiction over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED: that Shanico's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    NSL was also involved in supporting the purchase of lighters between Xuzhou Aliter and Wing Sale.
