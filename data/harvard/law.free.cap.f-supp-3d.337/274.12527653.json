Bank Operations and Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   KBC operates a branch office in New York (\"KBC-NY\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. ADB was licensed to maintain a representative office in New York (\"ADB-NY\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, ADB's New York operations were limited. The terms of ADB's representative office license prohibited ADB-NY from providing banking services or making decisions about originating loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such decisions were reserved for ADB's \"Head Office\" in Antwerp, Belgium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, employees at ADB-NY were limited to conducting research on the United States market, marketing the bank, introducing New York-based clients to the Head Office, and monitoring those clients' activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While employees at ADB-NY could negotiate credit arrangements with clients or potential clients, the members of ADB's credit committee at the Head Office were ultimately responsible for actually approving credit decisions with respect to the bank's clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. In some instances, KBC's credit committee also had to weigh in on the decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Services Agreement Between ADB and KBC-NY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of ADB-NY's limited capacities, on October 15, 1999 ADB entered into a Services Agreement with KBC-NY to provide certain operational services to ADB's New York-based clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such services included \"allowing diamond clients to open current accounts in their books and effectuating both local and international payments and other banking services on behalf of the diamond client.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arrangement was designed to allow ADB clients in New York to receive their funds during the same business day, notwithstanding the six-hour time difference between New York and Belgium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the Services Agreement, KBC was \"free to charge the diamond clients for transactions effectuated on their behalf,\" and ADB was permitted to charge interest to those customers \"[s]ince the credit risk [was] occurred and acted upon by ADB.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Services Agreement, KBC-NY would \"communicate all payments effectuated by the diamond clients to ADB\" so that ADB could \"make internal entries to adjust the customer's credit position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KBC-NY maintained a \"pooling account\" in ADB's name to \"fund the payments effectuated by KBC on behalf of the diamond clients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court will briefly describe how this Agreement functioned in practice. Essentially, when an ADB client in New York desired to draw down on its line of credit from ADB, the payment order went to KBC-NY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. KBC-NY then confirmed that the client had sufficient credit available in its ADB credit line and that there were sufficient funds in ADB's pooling account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the client had sufficient credit and the pooling account had sufficient funds, KBC-NY would debit the client's account and carry out the payment as directed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If ADB had insufficient funds in its pooling account, however, KBC-NY could choose to effectuate the client's payment by overdrafting the pooling account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KBC-NY would then alert ADB to the payment so that ADB could \"debit[ ] the diamond customer['s] account in its books against the KBC pooling account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KBC-NY also \"accept[ed] and registrate[d] all incoming funds\" to ADB's customers, crediting those clients' accounts and sending the information to ADB so\n   that it could \"credit[ ] the diamond clients' accounts in its books against the KBC pooling account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Services Agreement provides that \"[e]ach day, KBC clears the customer's account via ADB's pooling [account].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Typically, this final reconciliation between a client's KBC account and the ADB pooling account happened at the end of the day, rather than intra-day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This process was referred to as \"clearing,\" \"zeroing-out,\" or \"sweeping\" the customer's credit or debit activity into ADB's pooling account with KBC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. For this reason, KBC and ADB representatives referred to clients' accounts at KBC-NY as \"zero balance accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. As a result of this process, during the course of a given day either the client's or KBC-NY's funds were being used to satisfy ADB clients' payment requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, by the end of the day, KBC-NY would be made whole via funds from ADB's pooling account-unless the bank chose to allow ADB to overdraft the pooling account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lazare's ADB Credit Facility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 14, 2000, ADB and Lazare entered into an agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") by which ADB extended Lazare a $10 million credit line.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this time, Lazare-Belgium had a line of credit with ADB, but Lazare did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The credit limit was extended several times, ultimately reaching $45 million by the time the parties terminated their relationship ten years later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 2 of each Credit Agreement provided that the credit was to only be utilized for overdrafts in current accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. \"Current accounts\" referred to accounts that ADB's clients had with the bank in Belgium, and they were the means by which ADB extended credit to its customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A client could not have an overdraft facility with ADB without also being an account holder at ADB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a general matter, a customer with a line of credit from ADB in the form of an overdraft facility accessed that credit by overdrafting its ADB account, meaning by withdrawing more funds than were deposited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Each Credit Agreement provides that the credit is governed by two sets of conditions: (1) General Conditions for Banking Operations (\"Banking Conditions\") and (2) General Credit Granting Conditions (\"Credit Conditions\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The documents were registered in Antwerp on November 2, 2000 and March 11, 1999 respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Lazare's Accounts at ADB and KBC-NY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Around the same time that Lazare entered into the 2000 Credit Agreement with ADB, Lazare applied to open accounts at ADB and KBC-NY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Sometime after March 29, 2001, Lazare signed KBC-NY's Account Agreement and General Terms and Conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The KBC-NY account became operational on November 16, 2001.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With the exception of certain \"straight loans,\" there is no dispute that, from the time that Lazare's KBC account became operational, Lazare used the KBC account as the exclusive vehicle for all payments and disbursements under its credit facility with ADB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Indeed, on May 31, 2001, William H. Moryto, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Lazare, signed a letter on behalf of Lazare requesting that \"all disbursements and payments under our credit facility with [ADB] shall be effected through our account with [KBC-NY] and shall result in a same day debit or credit to our loan balance with ADB.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter also allowed KBC and ADB to exchange all credit, financial,\n   and any other information concerning Lazare and its accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nothing in the record states that a KBC-NY zero-balance account was required for a credit line with ADB; rather, to the extent that a client based in New York wanted convenient access to their credit line during New York business hours, ADB preferred that all debits and credits went exclusively through a single account (the KBC-NY account) rather than through both their KBC-NY and ADB accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Forum Selection Clauses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lazare's agreements with KBC-NY and ADB each contained a forum selection clause (\"FSC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    i. ADB Forum Selection Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Article 37 of ADB's Banking Conditions provides that \"Each of the account holder, any correspondent, surety, guarantor, third-party pledgor and other third party hereby further agree that the courts of Antwerp, Belgium shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any action brought against the Bank.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (quoting ECF No. 193-38 at 6 (\"Antwerp FSC\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. KBC-NY Forum Selection Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Article 35 of the KBC-NY General Terms provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Any claim or action you bring must be brought before the courts of the County of New York, State of New York, or the Federal Courts situated in the Southern District of New York, which you agree shall have exclusive jurisdiction over these Terms and Conditions or any other agreements you have with KBC Bank relating to any accounts or disputes arising thereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citing ECF No. 190-31 at 6 (\"New York FSC\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Alleged Unlawful Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff contends that KBC and ADB engaged in racketeering and other fraudulent and corrupt practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint (ECF No. 251) (\"FAC\"). From around 2007 to 2010, KBC and ADB, their customer Erez Daleyot (\"Daleyot\"), and various other individuals associated with them, engaged in a systemic money laundering scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. In short, the scheme involved stealing \"LKI Diamonds\" and LKI Diamond Proceeds; transferring those diamonds through a series of legitimate and illegitimate transactions that made them difficult to trace; laundering the LKI Diamond Proceeds through a network of legitimate and illegitimate businesses and accounts and the New York Pooling Account, and preventing them from reaching Lazare; using the LKI Diamond Proceeds to repay certain financially disastrous loans that the Banks had made to Daleyot and his companies; and covering up and obstructing Lazare's investigation into this scheme, in order to personally enrich senior executives of the Banks and Daleyot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Formal sector diamonds were delivered to Dubai and Hong Kong, and moved through Switzerland, Israel, and, ultimately, Belgium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-34. Informal and sight rough diamonds were purchased from Angolan sellers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149. Transfers of LKI Diamond Proceeds occurred in U.S. dollar denominations and through Lazare's Pooling Account at KBC-NY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In early 2009, Lazare expressed concerns to senior officers at the Banks that it had not received proceeds from the sales of LKI Diamonds from certain Daleyot Entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Lazare repeatedly sought the Banks' assistance in investigating these issues, but the Banks refused to assist and obstructed Lazare's attempt to investigate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The Banks then tried\n   to intimidate and extort Lazare by threatening it with claims of defaults over its own lines of credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. The Banks ultimately terminated Lazare's credit lines, devastating its ability to conduct its business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Belgium Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In March 2010, ADB commenced proceedings against Lazare in Antwerp, Belgium, pursuant to the Antwerp FSC, to recover the $45 million lent to Lazare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Direct Testimony of Veerle Snyers \u00b6 86 (ECF No. 193-3) (\"Snyers Testimony\"). Lazare and Lazare-Belgium asserted counterclaims against ADB based on virtually the same allegations as those brought in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Bob Delbaere \u00b6 21 (ECF No. 30) (\"Delbaere Decl\"). Lazare-Belgium also has separate ongoing litigation involving the same facts between Daleyot and certain Daleyot Entities, which has been ongoing for several years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-38. Additionally, in 2013 Lazare served a criminal summons on ADB and filed a criminal complaint in Antwerp.

Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint commencing this action on December 23, 2011. ECF No. 1. On September 5, 2012, this Court granted Defendants' motion to transfer this case to Belgium based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62. Plaintiff appealed and on June 20, 2013 the Second Circuit vacated and remanded this case for further proceedings-namely, to determine the applicability of each forum selection clause to the various aspects of this litigation. ECF No. 68. On February 14 and 15, 2017, this Court held a\n   <em>\n    New Moon\n   </em>\n   Hearing to determine facts relevant to the applicability of the Banks' forum selection clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On March 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions.

Also at that time, the Court granted Defendants leave to move to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of this Court's Findings. ECF No. 230. The matter was fully briefed and this Court denied the motion for reconsideration on August 16, 2017. ECF No. 241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. ECF No. 251 (\"FAC\"). On October 27, 2017, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and supporting declarations. ECF Nos. 254-58 (\"Def Mem\"). On November 7, 2017, Defendants filed a notice of supplemental authority. ECF No. 259. Plaintiff filed its opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss and supporting declaration on November 27, 2017. ECF Nos. 261-62 (\"Pl Mem\"). Defendants filed their reply brief on December 11, 2017. ECF No. 263 (\"Def Reply\"). At that point, the Court considered this matter fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Following the completion of briefing, on January 25, 2018, Plaintiff filed a supplemental letter advising the Court of \"new information\" bearing on the pending motion to dismiss. ECF No. 264. Both parties subsequently filed a series of supplemental letters and supporting declarations. ECF Nos. 265-68; 271-84. Defendants urge the Court not to consider such supplemental filings in its consideration of the pending motion.

Additionally, Defendants argue that the New York FSC is too narrow to\n   cover Plaintiff's claims and, in any event, claims under the New York FSC would be time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Antwerp FSC has no application to its claims because they do not relate to any banking activity at ADB. To the extent that any FSC mandates where its claims must be brought, Plaintiff contends that the New York FSC requires litigation here in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Plaintiff's Claims Against ADB\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Whether the Banking Conditions Require Litigation in Antwerp\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff argues that its agreement with ADB does not even require it to litigate in Belgium. Plaintiff signed two contracts with ADB: Banking Conditions and Credit Conditions. Article 37 of the Banking Conditions contains the FSC requiring litigation in Antwerp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antwerp FSC. Article 24 of the Credit Conditions provides that ADB can sue in New York courts. Credit Conditions Art. 24 (ECF No. 193-39). Article 24 does not dictate where borrowers may or may not sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Antwerp FSC only applies to claims against the bank based on a plaintiff's status as an\n   <em>\n    account holder\n   </em>\n   (such as Plaintiff's account with ADB), while Article 24 of the Credit Conditions governs claims based on a plaintiff's status as a\n   <em>\n    borrower\n   </em>\n   (such as Plaintiff's Credit Facility). According to Plaintiff's reading, since Plaintiff's claims relate to its status as a borrower, they are not governed by the Banking Conditions and Plaintiff is thus free to sue in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants dispute this interpretation. Defendants assert that the FSCs in the Banking and Credit Conditions should be read together: ADB can sue in New York, Belgium, or any other competent jurisdiction, while accountholders-which includes Plaintiff-can only sue in Belgium. And since, as this Court found, every borrower at ADB was also an accountholder, a lawsuit related to credit agreements\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a lawsuit related to that individual's bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants have the better of the argument here. Plaintiff's agreement with ADB requires Plaintiff to litigate claims against the Bank in Belgium. The question is whether the Antwerp FSC applies to Plaintiff's claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the Antwerp FSC was Reasonably Communicated to Lazare\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In determining whether a FSC presumptively applies, \"[t]he first inquiry is whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047242\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/378/#p383\">\n    494 F.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Application of New York FSC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The parties agree that the New York FSC was clearly communicated and mandatory. The issue, then, is whether the clause encompasses Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff contends that, if any FSC governs this case, the New York FSC covers all of its claims. This is so because the clause covers \"[a]ny claim or action\" by Lazare against KBC \"relating to any accounts or disputes.\" New York FSC. Plaintiff argues that Lazare's credit activity was conducted \"exclusively\" with its KBC-NY account, whereas \"no activity of consequence\" occurred in the ADB account. Pl Mem at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants counter that the New York FSC does not cover Plaintiff's claims because it is narrow. Whereas the Antwerp FSC governs \"any action\" brought against ADB, the New York FSC contains qualifying language, limiting its application to \"these Terms and Conditions or any other agreements [Plaintiff has] with KBC Bank relating to any account or disputes arising thereunder.\" Defendants contend that since (1) Plaintiff's claims against KBC do not relate to the Terms or Conditions and (2) Plaintiff had no other agreements with KBC, the New York FSC is inapplicable to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff overstates the role of the KBC-NY account to this case. To be sure, Plaintiff interfaced with KBC-NY and its funds passed through the pooling account. However, this Court found that the KBC-NY account existed to facilitate access to Plaintiff's account at ADB in Belgium. Findings at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Next, the New York FSC is meaningfully narrower than the Antwerp FSC. It is more akin to clauses that courts have deemed too limited to govern non-contract claims. For instance, \"where a clause applied by its terms to 'any suits or causes of action arising directly or indirectly from this AGREEMENT,' the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the clause encompassed a [tort] claim,\" while by contrast \"where a clause applied more narrowly to 'litigation between the parties concerning the alleged breach of this Agreement or the meaning, effect, application and/or interpretation of its terms,' the court found that the clause encompassed the plaintiff's breach of contract claim but not a tort claim of fraudulent inducement.\"\n   <em>\n    Direct Mail Prod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201277597\">\n    2000 WL 1277597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(B)(i)(4). Thus, the New York FSC only governs Plaintiff's claims if they relate to the Terms or Conditions or any other agreements relating to accounts or disputes arising thereunder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, Plaintiff does not have any \"other agreements ... relating to\" its account with KBC. The ADB Banking Conditions do not constitute another agreement with KBC. Plaintiff argues the ADB Banking Conditions became an agreement with KBC when KBC absorbed ADB. However, under New York law absorption does not alter the parties' contractual rights and obligations and \"any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for or against it that might have been rendered for or against such other corporation if the merger had not occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Banking%20Law%20%C2%A7%20602\">\n    N.Y.

KBC was not a party to the letter. Moreover, as this Court found, Lazare was not required to use the KBC-NY account; the letter merely evinced ADB's preference to direct its' clients transactions through a single account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings at 12-13. In any event, Plaintiff does not allege any violation of the May 31, 2001 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Second, Plaintiff brings only one claim that mentions the Terms and Conditions: its claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 326-32. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the KBC-NY contract, along with the May 31, 2001 agreement and the Lazare Credit Facility with ADB, by making false claims regarding outstanding amounts due and applying funds belonging to Plaintiff to outstanding obligations of the Daleyot entities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants contend that since the KBC-NY account only existed to facilitate access to the ADB account, the substance of Plaintiff's claim arguably relates primarily to ADB, not KBC-NY's Terms and Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court determines that Plaintiff's claim here relates to the Terms and Conditions and thus would be covered by the New York FSC. However, as discussed below any claim under that clause is time-barred, and thus not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Time Bar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants argue that, in any event, Plaintiff's claims under the New York agreement are time-barred. The KBC agreement required that individuals \"promptly notify [the bank] of any fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, including unauthorized signatures or alterations of forged endorsements.\" KBC Credit Agreement \u00b6 10 (ECF No. 190-31). Such notice must be made \"in writing within thirty (30) days after [a] statement containing the first such irregularity was received, or otherwise made available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Agreement further prohibited individuals from \"bring[ing] a legal proceeding or action against KBC bank to recover for any claim or error or fraudulent transaction\" unless such timely notice was given.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants argue that since Plaintiff never gave the bank written notice of perceived irregularities as required under the contract, any claims under the KBC agreement are time-barred. Plaintiff contends that the time bar applies only to banking irregularities, not this type of fraud which could not be detected from reviewing bank statements. Defendants respond that Plaintiff knew of the alleged fraud as early as 2008, years before the Complaint was filed in 2011 and with plenty of time to provide KBC with the required notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Here, the time bar would render this clause inapplicable. According to the complaint, throughout 2009 and 2010 Plaintiff provided the Banks with \"detailed descriptions of, among other things, false documentation filed by Daleyot and the Daleyot Entities.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 195-97. On July 22, 2009, Plaintiff sent ADB a letter that \"showed how [a Daleyot Entity] had falsified certain documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 204-05. This appears to be the type of banking irregularity Plaintiff contends it could not have detected. Yet it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not notify KBC as required for suit under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, any claims under this FSC would be barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Application of Antwerp FSC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Since the New York FSC does not govern Plaintiff's claims against KBC, the Court must next determine whether such claims are covered by the Antwerp FSC or whether they lie beyond both FSCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants assert that the Antwerp FSC governs Plaintiff's claims against KBC under the \"closely related\" doctrine. Plaintiff does not contest that the entities are closely related. However, Plaintiff contends that the \"closely related\" doctrine cannot nullify a separate FSC to which the non-signatory is actually a party-here, the New York FSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Neither party cites any cases for or against the proposition that the \"closely related\" doctrine nullifies a FSC to which a non-signatory is actually a party. Nevertheless, since the Court determined that the New York FSC does not apply to this case, that clause cannot nullify the \"closely related\" doctrine here. The Court holds that the Antwerp FSC governs Plaintiff's claims against KBC under the \"closely related\" doctrine because, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's claims against KBC and ADB are nearly identical; they arise out of the same transaction; and KBC consents to Antwerp's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horvath v.

App'x 61, 63 (2d Cir. 2012) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Finally, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff has not provided any allegations to rebut the presumption of enforceability of the Antwerp FSC or to show that public interest factors counsel against its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, the Antwerp FSC requires that Plaintiff's claims against ADB and KBC be litigated in the courts of Antwerp, Belgium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Forum Non Conveniens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   If this Court had held that some or all of Plaintiff's claims fell beyond the scope of the FSCs, the Court would nevertheless determine that this case should be tried in Belgium under a traditional\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   (\"FNC\") analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, the convenience of Plaintiff's residence in relation to the chosen forum counts somewhat in favor of deferring to Plaintiff's chosen forum. Plaintiff is a U.S. citizen entity with its principal place of business in New York. This counsels in favor of significant deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Nevertheless, the substantive issues and conduct here have a greater relation to Belgium. Although Plaintiff is a U.S. citizen, Defendants are Belgium corporations.

Okrent \u00b6 5 (ECF No. 25) (\"Okrent Decl\"). And while Plaintiff contends that New York law governs the Credit Facility and its KBC-NY account, since the Court determined that Plaintiff's claims are beyond the scope of the KBC-NY contract, \"those contractual provisions have a limited impact on the overall calculus.\"\n   <em>\n    Lfoundry Rousset SAS v.

Namely, money moved through the KBC-NY pooling account and transactions occurred in U.S. dollar denominations. However, the KBC-NY account facilitated access to Plaintiff's account with ADB in Belgium. Findings at 12-13. Additionally, courts have held that the use of a \"New York branch by one of the defendants ... to route the loan proceeds ... cannot be regarded, in the overall scheme of things, as other than peripheral.\"\n   <em>\n    Sussman v. Bank of Israel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7408401\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/801/1068/#p1073\">\n    801 F.Supp. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1074 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Instead, here the brunt of the alleged conduct took place outside of the United States. Plaintiff consigned diamonds to Lazare-Belgium, which in turn consigned diamonds to the Daleyot Entities. FAC \u00b6 52.

Thus, this case's connection to New York is peripheral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, the parties are already litigating substantially similar issues in Belgium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Bank of Anguilla (Private Banking Trust) Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410224\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/64/#p86\">\n    580 B.R. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (considering fact that \"Plaintiffs were already seeking the same relief for the same wrongs in the foreign forum\" when dismissing on FNC grounds).

Defendants contend that witnesses and evidence relevant to this case are located in Belgium. Plaintiff, meanwhile, argues that they are located in New York. While at this stage it is difficult to discern where the majority of witnesses and evidence will be located, as discussed further\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Section III(b)(iii)(l), given that all of the participants in the unlawful enterprise are Belgian or otherwise foreign citizens, and since the majority of conduct occurred abroad, witnesses and evidence will likely be located outside of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Third, Defendants' amenability to suit in this district weighs somewhat in favor of deferring to Plaintiff's choice of forum. Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in New York. However, they are also subject to suit in Belgium and, indeed, the parties are litigating in Belgium. Thus, this is not a case where the forum was selected \"to obtain jurisdiction over defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Norex Petroleum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936057\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/146/#p153\">\n    416 F.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Fourth, the availability of appropriate legal assistance weighs slightly in favor of deference to Plaintiff's chosen forum. Both parties have access to competent counsel capable of litigating in New York. However, as with Defendants' amenability to suit, both parties also have competent counsel\n   capable of litigating - and, indeed, currently litigating - in Belgium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, this case presents a plausible inference that Plaintiff's choice of forum was motivated by tactical reasons. Plaintiff had threatened ADB with a \"high visibility\" RICO suit in the United States.

The parties were already litigating essentially the same issues in Belgium before this case was filed. Snyers Decl \u00b6 20. And as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , New York is a less convenient forum than Belgium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Accordingly, this Court accords Plaintiff's chosen forum a moderate level of deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Snyers Decl \u00b6 29; Haeck Decl \u00b6 18. Likewise, much of the relevant documentary evidence is located in Belgium. Snyers Decl \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27; Haeck Decl \u00b6\u00b6 11, 17. A substantial amount of these documents are in Dutch, including most internal ADB and KBC electronic communications. Snyers Decl \u00b6 27; Haeck Decl \u00b6 17. These documents must be collected in Belgium and translated into English for use in this litigation, increasing the Defendants' litigation costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Snyers Decl \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court notes that, \"[w]hen evaluating a motion for dismissal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   [ ] the availability of letters rogatory is relevant to a court's analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Strategic Value Master Fund, Ltd. v.

Thus, \"where the number of nonparty witnesses is large, coupled with the Court's natural preference for live testimony and the time-consuming nature of using letters rogatory, a district court's decision to weigh this factor in favor of dismissal will not be overturned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408102\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/21/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Second, the cost to transport witnesses to trial weighs slightly in Defendants' favor. Some potential witnesses for Plaintiff reside in New York. Many potential defense witnesses reside in Belgium, however, and will have to fly to New York to testify. Nevertheless, given that Defendants conduct other business in New York, \"any inconvenience caused by travel to New York for this litigation will not be oppressive.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Optimal U.S. Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5765951\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/837/244/#p258\">\n    837 F.Supp.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Third, the availability of compulsory process for unwilling witnesses weighs significantly in favor of litigating in Belgium. Most of the individuals and entities identified in the Complaint reside in Belgium or other foreign jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 43. Those potential witnesses fall outside of this Court's subpoena power and thus cannot be compelled to give evidence in this case. However, if any of these entities is sued in a Belgium court, that court would also have jurisdiction over any foreign co-defendant that was connected to the Belgian defendants or claims asserted. Vanlerberghe Decl \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. Thus, while Daleyot is no longer considered a Belgian resident, he could still be sued in Belgium and compelled to testify in a case against the Belgian entities or intrinsically linked claims. Supplemental Declaration of Beatrix Vanlerberghe \u00b6 13-14 (ECF No. 256) (\"Vanlerberghe Supp Decl\"). Further, certain of the Daleyot Entities that are located in countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil and Commercial Matters, such as the United Arab Emirates, and cannot be subject to any discovery in connection with a U.S. proceeding, are subject to Belgian jurisdiction. Vanlerberghe Decl \u00b6\u00b6 37-41. These factors count strongly in favor of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pollux Holding Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123942\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/64/#p70\">\n    329 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (2d Cir. 2003) (affirming district court's determination that unavailability of compulsory process weighed heavily in favor of dismissal where defendant \"identified several key witnesses whose testimony can be compelled only in England while plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any material witnesses would be unavailable there\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strategic Value Master Fund\n   </em>\n   , 421 F.Supp.2d at 768 (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Finally, the fact of Belgium's exclusive jurisdiction clause and the pendency of the Belgian proceedings could render any judgment of this Court unenforceable in Belgium. Plaintiff contends that it can enforce its judgment in the U.S. given KBC's billions of assets at KBC-NY. However, \"it is undisputed that Plaintiffs would have less difficulty enforcing a [Belgian] judgment in [Belgium], which favors dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    RIGroup LLC v. Trefonisco Mgmt.

First, \"this Court has an interest in preventing unnecessary congestion of the court's docket.\"\n   <em>\n    BMR &amp; Associates, LLP v. SFW Capital Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333333\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/128/#p142\">\n    92 F.Supp.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). While not dispositive, \"it should be noted that this Court sits in one of the busiest districts in the country, ... making this one of the congested centers of litigation referred to in [Gulf Oil].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333333\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/92/128/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Second, a New York jury has some interest in this matter as the injuries were allegedly felt on a New York-based bank. However, this interest is relatively small since, as discussed further below, the alleged misconduct occurred overseas and only peripherally touches New York or the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Online Payment Solutions Inc. v. Svenska Handelsbanken AB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175895\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/638/375/#p391\">\n    638 F.Supp.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (S.D. N.Y. 2009) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Third, while both fora have a connection to this action, the substantive allegations are much more closely connected to Belgium than to New York or the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both New York and the United States have a strong interest in determining the truth of whether Belgian citizens committed fraud, theft, misconduct, and conspiracy against a New York entity. New York is also interested in protecting New York residents who conduct business with foreign banks in New York. The United States further has an interest in protecting its citizens from racketeering activity. However, this is not dispositive as \"the United States' interest in applying its own ... RICO laws ... is merely one consideration to be weighed in the totality of the\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Alfadda v. Fenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615622\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/41/#p47\">\n    159 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (2d Cir. 1998) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Further, as discussed throughout this opinion, the brunt of the alleged misconduct took place in Belgium or otherwise outside of the United States. New York does not have a strong interest in the alleged misappropriation of diamond proceeds and banking activities that occurred abroad. The fact that the alleged conduct may be sufficient to trigger the application of RICO laws does not mean that the United States has a strong public interest in pursuing this particular case in this forum. Moreover, \"the argument that dollar transfers through banks in the United States creates a strong public interest in favor of the United States has been rejected by courts in this Circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    LaSala v. UBS, AG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693227\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/510/213/#p229\">\n    510 F.Supp.2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Meanwhile, Belgium shares the strong interest in determining whether its citizens committed the alleged conduct. Likewise, Belgium has a strong interest in regulating its own banks and holding a Belgium bank liable for allegedly harming a New York\n   company.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693227\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/510/213/#p229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Switzerland possesses a strong interest in regulating the conduct of banks within its borders\" and \"[t]here is no question that this dispute centers around events occurring there.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Fourth, while the Court need not resolve the choice-of-law issue in a FNC analysis, Belgian law may very well apply to these proceedings. The ADB Banking Conditions provide that disputes \"shall be governed by Belgian law.\" Banking Conditions Art. 37;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Delbaere Decl \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Plaintiff contends that Defendants concede that New York law applies. Pl Mem at 42 (citing ECF No. 51 at 11). However, Plaintiff relies on a footnote in Defendants' reply brief in the initial motion to dismiss, which is not a relevant pleading before the Court on the instant motion. Defendants plainly have not conceded the application of New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def Mem at 37. In any event, while it appears that New York law would apply to claims involving \"loans or the granting of credit,\" such provisions would not necessarily encompass the substantive claims at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Banking Conditions Art. 37; Delbaere Decl \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Finally, judicial economy counsels in favor of litigation in Belgium. Litigation is currently pending in Belgium between the same parties over essentially the same issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abert Trading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20272408\">\n    2002 WL 272408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (when similar litigation was pending in Belgium, \"[t]he interests of judicial economy would best be served by resolving issues in this case with the Belgian case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Accordingly, the public and private interest factors weigh substantially in favor of a Belgian forum. If any or all of Plaintiff's claims were not covered by the Antwerp FSC, the Court would exercise its discretion to dismiss this case in favor of litigation in Belgium under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Court therefore need not consider Defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court holds that the Antwerp FSC is valid and enforceable as to Plaintiff's claims against both Defendants. Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED and this case is dismissed for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   The Clerk of Court is kindly directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Where the two statements of facts conflict, this Court's Findings control.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    If the Court considered all of the information contained in the supplemental letters, it would not change its decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The Second Circuit has clarified that \"questions of enforceability are resolved under federal law, while interpretive questions-questions about the meaning and scope of a forum selection clause-are resolved under the substantive law designated in an otherwise valid contractual choice-of-law clause.\"\n    <em>\n     Martinez v.
