(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Petition,\" Dkt. No. 1.) The Summonses request various records and documents (the \"Document Requests\"), and were issued in connection with an IRS investigation into Fridman's tax liabilities for the tax year 2008. One of the Summonses was issued against Fridman in his individual capacity, and the other was issued against Fridman in his capacity as trustee of the David Marcelo Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 25, 2015, the Court granted the Petition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"November 2 5 Order,\" Dkt. No. 2 8.) The Court determined that (1) Respondent's blanket invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was insufficient to establish his entitlement to that protection; (2) even if Respondent's invocation of the Fifth Amendment had been sufficient, Respondent would have been required to produce the documents requested by the Summonses because of certain exceptions to the Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege; and (3) the United States satisfied its burden and demonstrated that it was entitled to enforcement of the Summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) The Court therefore\n   ordered Respondent to \"produce all documents in his possession, custody, or control that are responsive to the Summonses' document requests\" and to \"appear for an interview ... to provide testimony identifying and/or authenticating documents produced by Respondent in his capacity as a representative of a trust.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fridman appealed, and on December 13, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a summary order vacating and remanding the November 25 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Appellate Order,\" Dkt. No. 33.) While the Second Circuit found that the Court did not err in determining that the United States satisfied its burden of showing the relevance of the requested documents (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3), the appellate court concluded that the record was insufficiently developed for it to review the Court's determination regarding the applicability of the Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The Second Circuit directed the Court to \"(1) provide a record sufficient for appellate review in determining whether Fridman properly invoked his Fifth Amendment act of production privilege; and (2) identify any applicable exceptions to the act of production privilege for each document request and determine the period of time for which the exception applies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 28, 2017, Fridman filed a brief on remand objecting to enforcement of the Summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Respondent Brief,\" Dkt. No. 39.) He asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege as the basis for his objection to the Document Requests that remain open, namely, Document Request Nos. 1-4, 7-17, and 20. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 8.) Fridman argues that no exception to the Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege -- i.e., the required records doctrine, the foregone conclusion doctrine, and the collective entity doctrine -- applies to these Document Requests, thus meaning that he cannot be compelled to produce the documents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-20.) Additionally, Fridman argues that he does not possess or have control of documents responsive to Document Request Nos. 3, 8, 9, and 10. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23.) Finally, Fridman argues that\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of responsive documents, as contemplated by the Second Circuit, would be inappropriate and unnecessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 23, 2017, the United States filed a brief on remand in support of its petition to enforce the Summonses and requesting oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Petitioner Brief,\" Dkt. No. 42.) Petitioner asserts that Respondent has conceded that the required records exception applies to certain Document Requests, and that Fridman has produced documents responsive to Document Request Nos. 4 and 13 that fall within that exception. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.5.) Petitioner argues that the Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege does not protect Fridman from producing documents and providing testimony in response to the other Document Requests because one or both of the other exceptions -- the collective entity doctrine and/or the foregone conclusion doctrine -- apply to the requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-24.) In support of its arguments, Petitioner filed the declarations of Theresa Alvarez\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Alvarez Declaration,\" Dkt. No. 43), Tina B. Masuda\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 44), and John M. Gillies\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 28, 2017, Respondent filed a reply memorandum. (\"Respondent Reply,\" Dkt. No. 51.) In addition to reasserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, Respondent argues that the United States cannot expand the scope of the Summonses to cover documents held by Respondent as custodian of any corporation or as trustee of any trust other than the David Marcelo Trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3.) On August 18, 2017, Petitioner filed a sur-reply memorandum. (\"Petitioner Sur-Reply,\" Dkt. No. 53.) Petitioner not only counters Respondent's objections relating to the foregone conclusion doctrine and the collective entity doctrine, but also argues that the scope of the Summonses is not limited by the capacity in which Fridman was served. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 25, 2018, the United States sent the Court a letter informing it of a recent decision in another case in this district --\n   <em>\n    United States v. Glaister, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-mc-213 -- regarding enforcement of IRS summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"September 25 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 56.) On October 3, 2018, Fridrman responded to the September 25 Letter, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Glaister\n   </em>\n   is inapposite to the present case because it involved \"business entities,\" not \"domestic trusts\" like the David Marcelo Trust at issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"October 3 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 59.) On October 15, 2018, the United States responded to the October 3 Letter, arguing that the collective entity doctrine does not distinguish between domestic and business trusts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"October 15 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court previously determined that the United States has made a sufficient showing that the documents sought by the Summonses are relevant to the IRS investigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Government satisfied its burden under\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the Second Circuit found no error in the Court's prior determination that the United States satisfied its burden of showing the relevance of the requested documents (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellate Order at 3), the Court now considers only the questions of whether Respondent properly invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and, if so, whether any doctrine applies such that Respondent is nevertheless required to respond to the Summonses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the following reasons, the Petition to Enforce the Summonses is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person ... shall be [c]ompelled in any criminal case to be a [w]itness against himself.\" U.S. Const.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Glaister\n   </em>\n   , the Honorable Paul A. Engelmayer considered a petition by the IRS to enforce summonses issued to Sarah and John Glaister (the \"Glaisters\").

The Second Circuit, however, concluded that the record was insufficiently developed for appellate review, and therefore directed the Court to \"provide a record sufficient for appellate review in determining whether Fridman properly invoked his Fifth Amendment act of production privilege.\" (Appellate Order at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On remand, Respondent objects to the production of documents responsive to the open Document Requests. Fridman specifically asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to each of the contested Document Requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent Brief at 8, Exhibit A.) Respondent makes the following objections:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1.

Respondent invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the trust-related documents contemplated by Document Request Nos. 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20, and argues that the collective entity exception is inapplicable to trusts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-20)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3.

Respondent contends that he does not have possession or control over the documents contemplated by Document Requests Nos. 3, 8, 9, and 10 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On remand, the United States does not contest the fact that Respondent appropriately invoked his Fifth Amendment act-of-production privilege. (Petitioner Brief at 2.) But the United States argues that Fridman's invocation of the Fifth Amendment fails because the collective entity and/or foregone conclusion doctrines apply to the Document Requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Specifically, Petitioner argues that Respondent must produce the corporate and trust-related documents contemplated by Document Request Nos. 3, 4, 7, 10-17, and 20 because the collective entity exception is applicable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-14.) Moreover, Petitioner argues that Respondent must produce the documents contemplated by Document Request Nos. 1-4, 7-9, and 12 because the foregone conclusion doctrine forecloses his invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Required Records Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For each of the Document Requests for which Fridman invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, Respondent argues either that the required records doctrine is inapplicable or that he has already provided responsive documents to the extent required by the doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent Brief at 9-20.) In opposition, the United States does not\n   rely on the required records exception in its arguments for enforcing any of the Document Requests. Instead, the United States notes that \"Fridman has conceded that this exception applies and has represented that he has produced all documents responsive to the [Document Requests] in his possession or control that fall within the exception.\" (Petitioner Brief at 7 n.5.) Since there is no live controversy regarding the applicability of the required records doctrine, the Court does not consider it at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Foregone Conclusion Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Second Circuit directed the Court on remand to \"evaluate whether the foregone conclusion exception applies in light of [the] decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In response to Document Request Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 7, Fridman invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine is inapplicable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent Brief at 9-20.) Specifically, Respondent argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine is inapplicable because the United States \"has not identified with reasonable particularity that it knows of the existence and location of the summoned documents\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) and/or the United States has not identified with reasonable particularity the accounts for which it seeks information (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-14). In opposition, Petitioner argues that Fridman must produce documents covered by the foregone conclusion doctrine because the United States knows with \"reasonable particularity\" of the existence and location of the requested documents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner Brief at 14-24.) The Court considers each Document Request in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Document Request No. 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Document Request No. 1 seeks the following information: \"For all of the foreign bank account[s] over which you have signatory authority since 1999, please list the opening date and closing date of each.\" The United States has modified this Document Request to mean \"existing documents sufficient to show\" the opening and closing dates for \"each of the Known Accounts\" that are listed in Exhibit B. (Petitioner Brief at Exhibits A &amp; B.) For each of the Known Accounts, the United States has identified the name of the account holder, the bank, the country, and the account number (provided to the Court in redacted form). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Respondent asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, arguing that producing the documents contemplated by Document Request No. 1 would \"go[ ] beyond the normal implicit testimonial aspects of the act of production, by communicating to the IRS that the produced documents comprise the relevant list.\" (Respondent Brief at 10.) This argument ignores Petitioner's modification to the request. As modified, Document Request No. 1 seeks existing documents sufficient to show the opening and closing dates for each of the Known Accounts. Since the United States has identified the accounts for which it seeks documents (i.e., \"the relevant list\"), Respondent will not be forced \"to use his discretion in selecting ... the responsive documents,\" and he will therefore not \"tacitly provid[e] identifying information.\"\n   <em>\n    Greenfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350144\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/106/#p116\">\n    831 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Respondent further argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine is inapplicable to Document Request No. 1 \"because the government has not identified with reasonable particularity that it knows of the existence and location of the summoned documents.\" (Respondent Brief at 11.) The Court is not persuaded by this argument. The United States has provided the name\n   of the account holder, the bank, the country, and the account number for each of the Known Accounts. The United States knew of the existence of these bank accounts at the time it served the Summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alvarez Declaration \u00b6 5.) Because the \"appropriate moment for the foregone-conclusion analysis is when the relevant summons was issued,\" the Court is satisfied that the United States knew of the existence, location, and authenticity of the requested documents at the relevant time, as required by the foregone conclusion doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Greenfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350144\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/106/#p116\">\n    831 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court therefore finds that the foregone conclusion exception is applicable to Document Request No. 1, and Respondent must produce the documents contemplated by this request (as modified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Document Request No. 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Document Request No. 2 seeks \"the 2006 &amp; 2007 bank statements for all your foreign bank accounts.\" Respondent argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine does not apply to Document Request No. 2 \"[b]ecause the IRS has not even identified the accounts for which it seeks information.\" (Respondent Brief at 12.) In opposition, the United States seems to imply that Document Request No. 2 seeks \"all 2006 and 2007 statements for each foreign account\" included in the list of \"the Known Accounts.\" (Petitioner Brief at 16-17.) Indeed, Petitioner's Exhibit A describes this request as one for \"[a]ll responsive documents for each of the Known Accounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To the extent that Document Request No. 2 seeks records for accounts that the United States has not identified, the Court agrees with Respondent that the foregone conclusion doctrine does not apply to the request. However, to the extent that Document Request No. 2 seeks records for those foreign bank accounts included in the list of Known Accounts, the Court finds -- for the same reasons described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.1 -- that the foregone conclusion exception is applicable to Document Request No. 2. Respondent must therefore produce the documents contemplated by this Request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Document Request No. 4\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Document Request No. 4 seeks the following information: \"All bank statements and account opening documents, including but not limited to, Know Your Customer Account information including signature cards, opening deposit slips, passport copies, certificate of beneficial ownership, letters of reference, certificate of clean funds and/or other source of funds documentation for the following accounts from opening date to 1/31/2009: UBS 29, Credit Suisse 3, Leumi Bank 49, Leumi Bank 02, Safra 37, HSBC 15, Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse) S.A.\" Respondent argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine is inapplicable to Document Request No. 4 because \"the Summons does not identify with reasonable particularity the documents it seeks\" and \"the [G]overnment has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it can establish Respondent's current possession or control of the requested documents.\" (Respondent Brief at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court disagrees.

In fact, Document Request No. 4 -- which\n   provides examples of the types of records it seeks --is more specific than the request at issue in\n   <em>\n    Greenfield\n   </em>\n   , which \"required Greenfield to produce 'all documents' in his possession for each bank account.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350144\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/106/#p116\">\n    831 F.3d at 112-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the case to which Respondent points in support of his argument,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Respondent argues that the foregone conclusion doctrine is inapplicable to Document Request No. 7 because \"the government has made no showing that it knows with reasonable particularity the question it asks.\" (Respondent Brief at 13-14.) In its brief, the United States clarifies that Document Request No. 7 seeks \"records sufficient to show several known transfers of funds between the HSBC account and an unknown Citibank account on particular dates in 2004, 2008, and 2010.\" (Petitioner Brief at 17, 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the same reasons as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.1, the Court is persuaded that the United States knew of the existence, location, and authenticity of the requested documents at the relevant time, as required by the foregone conclusion doctrine.

Similarly, the David Marcelo Trust (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Petitioner Brief at 13), like the trust in\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , \"is a formally organized entity, legally distinct from its trustees.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466066\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/653/359/#p361\">\n    653 F.2d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, the David Marcelo Trust (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Petitioner Brief at 13), again like the trust in\n   <em>\n    Hutchinson\n   </em>\n   , has \"independent functions\" separate from its trustees and beneficiaries.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1298191\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/633/754/#p756\">\n    633 F.2d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court's conclusion is further informed by the reasoning of Judge Engelmayer in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

July 11, 2018) (ECF No. 18) (overruling Respondents' invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to \"any records concerning foreign business entities or trusts that Respondents hold in their representative capacities as custodians for foreign business entities or trusts\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court therefore finds that the David Marcelo Trust is a collective entity. As a result, Respondent must produce all trust-related documents contemplated by Document Request Nos. 1-4, 7, 10-17, and 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Oral Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Petitioner requests that the Court order Respondent to appear for an interview with the IRS to provide oral testimony identifying and/or authenticating any documents produced by Respondent in his capacity as a representative of a collective entity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 5.) In the event the Court agrees with Petitioner, Respondent argues that the United States should be precluded from using Respondent's oral testimony against him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent Brief at 23-24.) Specifically, Respondent requests that the Court \"include a limitation protecting Respondent's Fifth Amendment rights by preventing the United States from using any oral testimony by Respondent in any criminal proceeding against Respondent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Petitioner counters that \"there is no need for this Court to prematurely address this potential future issue in its decision in this case.\" (Petitioner Brief at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The law clearly requires the custodian of the records of a collective entity to provide oral testimony identifying and/or authenticating any documents produced in such a capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p110\">\n    487 U.S. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p110\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159225\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/118/#p123\">\n    354 U.S. at 123-125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159225\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/118/#p123\">\n    77 S.Ct. 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since the Court has determined that Respondent must produce the documents he holds as trustee of the David Marcelo Trust, the Court also finds that he must appear for an interview to provide oral testimony identifying and/or authenticating any such documents. Furthermore, the Court declines as premature Respondent's request for a limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Respondent's Lack of Possession or Control (and the Scope of the Summonses)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The final dispute between the parties relates to Document Request Nos. 3, 8, 9, and 10. For each of these requests, Respondent argues that he lacks possession or control of the requested documents. The Court considers each Document Request in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Document Request No. 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Document Request No. 3 seeks the following information: \"All bank statements and all the account opening documents, including but not limited to, Know Your Customer Account information including signature cards, opening deposit slips, passport copies, certificate of beneficial ownership, letters of reference, certificate of clean funds and/or other source of funds documentation for accounts held under the name of the [listed] Entities from opening date to 1/31/2009.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent contends that he \"does not have possession and control of any documents responsive to Document Request No. 3\" in either his individual capacity or his capacity as trustee of the David Marcelo Trust. (Respondent Brief at 21-22.) While Respondent concedes that the entities listed in Document\n   Request No. 3 \"appear to be collective entities,\" he notes that \"[n]either of the Summonses served were served on Respondent in his capacity as custodian of records for any of these entities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Respondent, the United States must therefore subpoena either the entities listed in the Document Request or Fridman in his capacity as custodian of the entities. Respondent further develops this argument in his reply brief, arguing that the United States inappropriately seeks to expand the scope of the Summonses to cover documents held by Respondent \"in his capacity as custodian of certain listed corporations.\" (Respondent Reply at 1, 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Petitioner objects to this characterization of the Summonses, arguing that the capacity in which Respondent was served does not affect the scope of the Summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner Sur-Reply at 1-4.) Petitioner further contends that the IRS was not required to serve Fridman with separate summonses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In support of his argument, Respondent relies principally on\n   <em>\n    Securities and Exchange Commission v. Forster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269281\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/223/\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2015). In that case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") sought enforcement of a subpoena served on an individual \"in his\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   capacity and not as the custodian [of] records for the listed companies\" -- a distinction that the court found to be \"significant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269281\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269281\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/223/\">\n    at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this distinction, the court found that \"the SEC cannot compel [the individual] in his personal capacity to produce any documents simply because they relate to the four named companies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269281\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, a later case --\n   <em>\n    In re Cinque Terre Financial Group Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 CV 4774-LTS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206952349\">\n    2016 WL 6952349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 28, 2016) -- calls into question the scope of\n   <em>\n    Forster\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the Honorable Laura Taylor Swain noted that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Forster\n   </em>\n   Court did not ... specifically hold that a subpoena served on an individual who may be in possession of material in multiple capacities is void unless it specifies each such capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cinque Terre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206952349\">\n    2016 WL 6952349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court agrees with Judge Swain that \"a subpoena addressed to the individual\" is not \"invalid insofar as it may seek information the individual holds as a custodian rather than as an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206952349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Respondent's argument regarding the manner in which the Summonses were served emphasizes form over substance. Regardless of the capacity in which Fridman was served, the result is the same: Respondent is required to produce documents responsive to Document Request No. 3 to the extent that he possesses such documents in his individual capacity or his capacity as the custodian of a collective entity, including the corporations listed in the Document Request. Requiring the IRS to issue additional summonses to Fridman in his capacity as custodian of the listed corporations would add duplicative administrative steps to this process. The Court declines to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, to the extent that Respondent possesses -- either in his individual capacity or his capacity as custodian of a collective entity -- any of the records contemplated by Document Request No. 3, he must produce them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Document Request Nos. 8 and 9\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Document Request No. 8 seeks \"[a]ll account opening documents, including but not limited to Customer Profile and signature card for Citibank Account 50.\" Document Request No. 9 seeks \"[t]he bank statements for Acct 50 from 12/1/03 to 1/31/09.\" In its brief, the United States describes these requests as seeking \"the U.S. Citibank Account's opening documents and statements from December 1,\n   2003, to January 31, 2009.\" (Petitioner Brief at 17.) Respondent argues that he is \"not in possession or control of these documents\" because the referenced account belongs to third party. (Respondent Brief at 23.) Nevertheless, and \"[a]lthough this account is in the name of Fridman's son and wife,\" Petitioner argues that \"the IRS reasonably believes that Fridman has control over its records.\" (Petitioner Brief at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.D, Respondent must produce any responsive documents that he holds as trustee of the David Marcelo Trust.
