Although there are eleven and one-half months between Plaintiff's resignation from the Union (November 14, 2014) and the Commissioner's transfer of Plaintiff out of his SWAT Operations Supervisor position (October 27, 2015), there are only five days from the date the Commissioner allegedly learned that Plaintiff had resigned from the Union (October 22, 2015) and the transfer; and there is only one day between the closed-door meeting between the Commissioner and Matthews (on October 26, 2015) and the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Granted, Plaintiff was promoted to that SWAT position (effective May 15, 2015) during the one year period after Plaintiff's resignation from the Union, but there are no allegations that the Commissioner personally directed Darcy to select Plaintiff for the promotion to Operations Sergeant of SWAT. In contrast, the allegations in the Complaint specify that on October 22, 2015, the Commissioner first learned of Plaintiff's resignation from the Union. Doc. 1, \u00b6 47.

Rather, based on the Commissioner's alleged interactions with Union President Matthews immediately prior to her announced decision to transfer, the Commissioner may have had an ulterior, unconstitutional motive in effecting this transfer. Granted, time elapsed after the Plaintiff resigned his position in the Union, the filing of his lawsuit against the Union, and his appointment to the leadership of SWAT. However, at this stage of the proceedings, there is no evidence that this appointment was made at the Commissioner's behest, that the Commissioner knew of Plaintiff's resignation from the Union at the time of the appointment, or that the Commissioner could not have subsequently formed a retaliatory intent to transfer Mercer after the appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In sum, based on the allegations in the Complaint, the Court cannot find as a matter of law that the Commissioner had alternative motives for the transfer, much less that her sole motive was to prevent the erosion of the public's confidence in DESPP and/or SWAT. At this time, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, absent a supporting factual record, the Court finds that the Commissioner is not shielded from suit by \"qualified immunity\" via her arguments of lack of causation and/or the \"reasonableness\" of her decision to transfer Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the Commissioner transferred Mercer out of his SWAT leadership position in retaliation for his opposition to the Union. If she did so, she could not have reasonably believed that her conduct would not violate Mercer's First Amendment rights. On the basis of the Complaint, the Court cannot find that she is entitled to qualified immunity at this time. As the factual record develops, she may be able to present the necessary proof to establish such a defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11686952\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/7/341/#p350\">\n    7 F.Supp.2d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (due to minimal discovery, construing summary judgment motion as 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and holding that Superintendent McMahon and Chief Inspector Fitzgerald of New York State Police were not entitled to qualified immunity where Plaintiff police officers were allegedly transferred into unwanted positions and/or denied promotions and requested transfers as a result of their efforts to investigate and oppose corruption within the State Police).

In addition, the Union Defendants point out that Mercer was not relieved of command when the Union filed its first grievance concerning his assumption of Operations Sergeant position on June 22, 2015. Only after the SWAT shooting and fatality incident in Old Saybrook on October 9, 2015, did the Commissioner act to transfer Plaintiff. After that event, the Union repeatedly raised concerns regarding Plaintiff's leadership within SWAT during a series of meetings, threatened to hold a damaging press conference about the Emergency Services Unit, and filed a second institutional grievance regarding that incident. Doc. 36-1, at 15. According to the Union Defendants, the Commissioner did not transfer Plaintiff due to his resignation from, and/or lawsuit against, the Union. They thus conclude that Plaintiff has failed to plead the key element of causation to bring his claim for constitutional violations under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As to whether Plaintiff's speech to non-union members and in filing his lawsuit were protected speech under the First Amendment, the Court has concluded that they were.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1.c.1.

Granted, Plaintiff was appointed to his position as Operations Sergeant of the SWAT unit after he resigned his membership in the Union on November 14, 2014, and filed a lawsuit against it on March 14, 2015. However, he was promoted to Operations Sergeant by Major Mike Darcy, the commanding officer of SWAT, who is not a defendant in this action. Doc. 1, \u00b6 17. There is no indication in the Complaint that either the Commissioner or the Union Defendants were involved in that\n   promotion in any way.

R. Civ. P. In that count, Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants' actions of transferring Sgt. Mercer, or seeking his transfer, due to his nonmembership and/or objections to the payment of political and other non-bargaining expenditures, and/or advocacy on behalf of the rights of nonmembers, [were] violations of Sgt. Mercer's freedom of speech and association rights protected under the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Connecticut.\" Doc. 1, \u00b6 84. Plaintiff concludes that because these actions violated his rights to free speech, the Union Defendants violated Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q. As set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that statute provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]ny employer, including the state and any instrumentality or political subdivision thereof, who subjects any employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise\" of his or her rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or sections 3, 4 or 14 of article first of the Connecticut Constitution, \"shall be liable to such employee for damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The Union Defendants argue that they were never Plaintiff's employers so that \u00a7 31-51q has no application to them.
