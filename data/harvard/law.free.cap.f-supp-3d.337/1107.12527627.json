BROOMES, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This case comes before the court on Defendant's motion to suppress and motion to dismiss count 4. (Docs. 28, 30.) The motions have been fully briefed and the court held an evidentiary hearing on August 21, 2018. (Docs. 29, 31, 32, 33.) Defendant's motion to suppress is DENIED and Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED for the reasons herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court finds the following facts from the evidence presented at the hearing. On July 29, 2017, Wichita Police officers Atkins and Fisher were patrolling in the area of 21st and Grove streets in Wichita, Kansas. Atkins is currently on active duty for the Kansas National Guard and had been a police officer for more than four years at the time of the stop. Fisher has been an officer for eight years. Both officers had extensive training and were part of the Special Community Action Team (SCAT). On the evening of July 29, around midnight, they were patrolling in a high crime area. They observed a vehicle traveling without lights, which is a violation of Kansas law. As the driver turned the corner, the vehicle's lights came on. Atkins was driving the patrol car and he activated the emergency lights to pull over the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the stopping the vehicle, Atkins exited the patrol car and approached the driver. Fisher approached the passenger side of the vehicle for safety reasons. Defendant Deshawn Wheaton was the driver of the vehicle. Defendant handed over his license and insurance. Atkins asked Defendant where he was headed. Defendant stated that he was going to a friend's house. Atkins noticed a strong fragrance in the vehicle that smelled like an air freshener. Atkins asked Defendant if he was covering up something in the vehicle. Defendant said that he was not. Atkins told Defendant that he was stopped for not having his lights on. Defendant admitted that he had been driving without headlights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Atkins returned to his patrol car to do a check on Defendant's driver's license. As a practice, Atkins always does a criminal history check on the computer. The check tells the officer if a particular driver has any history of arrests or any outstanding warrants for the City of Wichita. The computer\n   check does not display actual convictions. In order to confirm a driver's actual convictions or warrant status, the officer calls into dispatch. After running Defendant's information, Atkins learned that Defendant had various arrests for violent crimes, drugs and guns. Upon learning this information, coupled with the facts that there was a strong smell in the car and Defendant's lights had been off, Atkins believed that Defendant may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and/or that there were drugs in the vehicle. Atkins testified that driving without lights is an indication that the driver is impaired. Additionally, an air freshener can be used to cover up the smell of marijuana. Atkins decided to ask Defendant to step out of the vehicle for additional questioning and to determine if he was impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Atkins returned to the driver's side of the vehicle and told Defendant to step out of the vehicle. At this time, Fisher remained standing on the passenger side of the vehicle. Fisher observed Defendant take something out of his pocket and shove it under the driver's seat. Fisher could not tell what it was because his flashlight was not working. When Defendant stepped out of the vehicle, Atkins led him to the sidewalk for safety reasons. Atkins asked Defendant if he had any weapons and then patted him down to check. Atkins told Defendant that he was not under arrest and asked him if he was under the influence. Defendant denied being under the influence. Fisher then asked Atkins for his flashlight so that he could shine it in the vehicle to look under the driver's seat. Fisher walked to the driver's side of the vehicle with the flashlight. Atkins then asked Defendant if he could search the vehicle. Defendant said no and denied having any drugs in the vehicle. Atkins testified that Defendant's nervousness was increasing during the conversation on the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During this time, Fisher was standing outside the driver's side window and shining the flashlight in the vehicle. Fisher did not stick the flashlight through the open window while looking in the vehicle. As Fisher shined the flashlight, he observed the grip of a gun sticking out from under the driver's seat. Fisher then decided to place Defendant in handcuffs. Fisher testified that individuals can decide to flee upon learning that a weapon has been discovered and that potential threat is avoided with handcuffing the individual. Fisher approached Defendant and placed him in handcuffs. Fisher informed Defendant that he would be in handcuffs until they determined why he stuffed a gun under the seat. Defendant denied shoving a gun under the seat. Fisher testified that in his experience an individual would hide a firearm if that individual was a prohibited person or if the gun was stolen. Fisher asked Defendant if he was a convicted felon. Defendant stated that he was. Fisher asked Defendant about his conviction and Defendant responded that he was convicted of possession with intent to distribute. Fisher informed Defendant that they would verify his record. Fisher stated that if his conviction was a particular age then Defendant's rights to possess a gun may have been restored. Atkins then went to the driver's side of the vehicle and shined the flashlight into the vehicle. Atkins did not stick the flashlight inside of the vehicle. Atkins was able to see the grip of the gun after shining the flashlight through the windshield. The detention on the sidewalk lasted approximately three to four minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers made the decision to detain Defendant because he had shoved the gun under the seat and they believed that he was either a felon in possession of a gun or that the gun was stolen. Defendant was placed in the patrol car. Fisher then made\n   a call to dispatch to confirm Defendant's criminal history. Fisher also checked the Kansas Department of Corrections' (KDOC) website for Defendant's prior convictions. The website, KASPER, showed that Defendant had a prior felony conviction. Atkins testified that he did not seize the gun until Fisher informed him that Defendant was a felon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Atkins returned to Defendant's vehicle and retrieved the gun from under the seat. When he seized the gun, Atkins also observed an open bottle of cognac under the driver's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After seizing the gun and the open container, Atkins then proceeded to search the vehicle. Based on the allegations in the indictment, the vehicle contained cocaine, marijuana and four handguns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 1, 2017, an indictment was filed charging Defendant possession with intent to distribute controlled substances, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and felon in possession of a firearm. (Doc. 1.) Reviewing Defendant's criminal history, Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana after a prior conviction on November 26, 2012. (Doc. 29, Exh. 1.) Under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines, which uses a grid box to determine sentencing, Defendant's conviction was designated as a level 4 non-person felony. Defendant's criminal history was a classification of \"H,\" which placed him in a box that called for presumptive probation. In addition, the presumptive sentencing range was 12 to 14 months. On February 15, 2013, Defendant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with probation granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant has now moved to suppress the items seized from his vehicle, on the basis that the search violated the Fourth Amendment, and to dismiss count 4, felon in possession, on the basis that his prior conviction was not punishable by more than imprisonment exceeding one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Supreme Court has liberally interpreted \"seizures\" to encompass routine traffic stops, \"even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware v. Prouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187389\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/648/#p653\">\n    440 U.S. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187389\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/648/#p653\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187389\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/648/#p653\">\n    59 L.Ed.2d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). An initial traffic stop is justified at its inception if \"an officer has (1) probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred, or (2) a reasonable articulable suspicion that a particular motorist has violated any of the traffic or equipment regulations of the jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384105\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1129/#p1134\">\n    557 F.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (10th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this case, the undisputed facts show that the traffic stop was justified. Defendant was traveling without his lights at night in violation of Kansas law. Even when the initial stop is valid, any investigative detention must not last \"longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p500\">\n    460 U.S. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p500\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p500\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). An officer \"conducting a routine traffic stop may request a driver's license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931426\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/1149/#p1156\">\n    423 F.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1156 (10th Cir. 2005). The uncontroverted testimony shows that Atkins approached the vehicle upon initially stopping it and then obtained Defendant's driving documents. Atkins returned to his patrol car to run a license and background check, which was appropriate. Therefore, the scope of the traffic stop was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which initially justified the interference.\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p20\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p20\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p20\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Lengthening Initial Stop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues that the stop was then unreasonably prolonged when Atkins asked Defendant to step out of the vehicle. \"Lengthening the detention for further questioning beyond that related to the initial stop is permissible in two circumstances. First, the officer may detain the driver for questioning unrelated to the initial stop if he has an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion illegal activity has occurred or is occurring. Second, further questioning unrelated to the initial stop is permissible if the initial detention has become a consensual encounter.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hunnicutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11878688\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/1345/#p1349\">\n    135 F.3d 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349 (10th Cir. 1998) (internal citations omitted). Based on the testimony at the hearing, it is clear that Defendant was not free to go and was required to step on to the curb after Atkins approached the vehicle. Therefore, the prolonged detention is permissible only if Atkins had an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity had occurred or was occurring. The court views the \"totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Villa-Chaparro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11984988\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/797/#p802\">\n    115 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802 (10th Cir. 1997) and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit stated that \"knowledge of a person's prior criminal involvement (to say nothing of a mere arrest) is alone\n   insufficient to give rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840515\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/537/#p542\">\n    29 F.3d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Villa-Chaparro\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[t]he scent of a masking agent alone is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11984988\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/797/#p802\">\n    115 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit, however, clarified that \"although the scent of a masking agent alone is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion,\n   <em>\n    we have repeatedly held that air freshener coupled with other indicia of criminal activity supports a reasonable brief inquiry\n   </em>\n   ....The fact that air freshener [or laundry detergent] may be used innocently does not mean that it cannot be used under other suspicious circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Villa-Chaparro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11984988\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/797/#p802\">\n    115 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The officers in this case did not rely solely on the air freshener - or Defendant's criminal history - to detain Defendant for further questioning. Rather, Atkins testified that there were several facts that led to his decision to detain Defendant. Atkins testified that he decided to ask Defendant to step out of the vehicle because he believed that Defendant may have been impaired and/or had controlled substances in the vehicle. Atkins based this decision on Defendant's arrest history, which included arrests for drugs, the smell of air freshener in the vehicle and the fact that the lights had been off which is an indicator of an impaired driver. Additionally, Defendant did not put the vehicle in park when he first pulled over. Atkins testified that this is a safety concern and can mean that the driver intends to flee. After a review of all the circumstances, the court finds that the officers provided a particularized and objective basis for suspecting Defendant was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Therefore, the officers were justified in lengthening Defendant's detention and asking him to step out of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Observation of Gun in Defendant's Vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to exiting the vehicle, Fisher observed Defendant shove something under the driver's seat. The bodycam videos were played for the court during the suppression hearing. Fisher's video clearly shows Defendant removing something from his pocket and stashing it under the seat. Because it was dark outside, the video does not clearly show what the object was. Defendant then exited the vehicle. The detention and questioning lasted mere minutes. During the initial questioning by Atkins, Fisher obtained Atkins' flashlight and used it to attempt to determine what Defendant shoved under the seat. Atkins also later viewed the gun by shining his flashlight in the vehicle. The videos show the officers shining their flashlights into the vehicle. The officers testified that they did not breach the interior of the vehicle with the flashlights. The testimony was supported by the videos. As testified to during the hearing, the videos show that the light from the flashlight was reflected on the frame of the window or the window glass. This shows that the flashlight was not inside of the vehicle as there would not be a reflection of the light on the outside of the vehicle if the flashlight had breached the interior of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court finds, based on the evidence during the hearing, that Fisher (and Atkins) did not breach the interior of the vehicle while shining the flashlight into the vehicle. Rather, the flashlight, at all times, was outside of the vehicle. A police officer may utilize a flashlight to view the interior of a vehicle \"without any infringement of Fourth Amendment rights.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, the officers' actions in using a flashlight to view the interior of the vehicle, without breaching the interior, did not constitute a search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon observing the gun, Fisher then placed Defendant in handcuffs. Fisher took this action as a safety measure because suspects' reactions are unpredictable when told that officers have located a weapon. Fisher testified that Defendant may have attempted to flee. The court finds that the use of handcuffs during the detention was reasonable: the area was a high crime area; Defendant had a criminal arrest history that included drugs, guns and violent crimes; it was late at night; and Fisher reasonably believed that Defendant was trying to conceal the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Upon a review of all the circumstances, the court further finds that Defendant was not under arrest at the time he was placed in handcuffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant was placed in handcuffs as a precaution due to factors discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Defendant was told that he was restrained in order to determine why he stuffed the gun under the seat. Defendant was further told that he would be released if it was determined that he could lawfully possess the gun. However, both officers testified that they believed that Defendant was either a felon or that the gun was stolen due to Defendant's actions in concealing the gun, as possession of a gun is otherwise lawful in Kansas. Defendant confirmed those suspicions by informing Fisher that he was a felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Defendant stated that he was a felon, the officers were going to verify his criminal history through dispatch, which was routine. Defendant was placed in the back seat of the patrol car. At that time, Fisher called in to dispatch to request Defendant's criminal history. After giving Defendant's information to dispatch, Defendant waited for a return call that would confirm Defendant's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Fisher did view the KDOC's website and observed that it confirmed Defendant's felon status; however, the officers also would routinely confirm the information through dispatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court finds that the officers did not conduct a search by viewing into the interior of the vehicle with the flashlight and that the use of restraints after observing the gun was reasonable given the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Seizure of Gun\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While waiting for confirmation from dispatch, Atkins returned to the vehicle and seized the gun. Under the plain view doctrine, \"a law enforcement officer [may] seize evidence of a crime, without violating the Fourth Amendment, if (1) the officer was lawfully in a position from which the object seized was in plain view, (2) the object's incriminating character was immediately apparent...and (3) the officer had a lawful right of access to the object.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He was sentenced to 24 months' probation and an underlying 12-month term of imprisonment. The sentencing court did not depart from the guidelines and the defendant successfully completed probation. The defendant presented similar arguments to the arguments raised in this case. Judge Crabtree, relying on a pre-\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ' decision of this court, rejected the defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   In [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Kan. 2008) ], the defendant moved to dismiss a charge under \u00a7 922(g)(1). He argued-as Mr. Nichols argues here-that his 2000 Kansas conviction for burglary was not a predicate felony because the applicable Kansas sentencing grid box called for Presumptive Probation. The\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   defendant was situated at precisely the same level as Mr. Nichols: his criminal history scored as a Level I and the severity level for his offense of conviction was VII. Judge Lungstrum's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   explained how the Kansas sentencing grid in effect in 2000 viewed the defendant. \"The corresponding [grid] box on the sentencing table grid show[ed] an imprisonment range from eleven to thirteen months. The box also [was] located under the disposition line, indicating that there [was] a presumptive disposition of nonimprisonment, or in other words, presumptive probation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Judge Lungstrum was not persuaded by the defendant's argument that his earlier conviction was not punishable by more than one year in prison and so Judge Lungstrum rejected his motion to dismiss.

Absent some intervening\n   change in law, the court would follow it and overrule Mr. Nichols's motion. On close review, the court concludes that much has changed with federal precedent since\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   was decided in 2008. But as explained in the next three subsections, the court concludes that these changes do not call for a different result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   For one thing,\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   conducted a defendant-specific analysis.

And nothing in these cases (or the Eighth and Fourth Circuit cases, for that matter) requires the court to focus on the presumptive disposition. Indeed, the opposite is true. Each opinion focuses on the maximum term of imprisonment the defendant faced. Equally important, the Circuit decisions reviewing a Kansas state conviction-\n   <em>\n    Haltiwanger\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   -did not consider the presumptive disposition to decide the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   's holding, the court finds that the maximum term of imprisonment Mr. Nichols could have received in 2013 was 13 months. Thus, Mr. Nichols's 2013 Kansas state conviction is a predicate felony under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20420029\">\n    2018 WL 420029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, 9 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   , Judge Murguia came to a similar result.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, building on the rationale from\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   , this court finds it is the durational sentencing range that is determinative of whether a conviction may count as a predicate felony under \u00a7 922(g) because probation, under Kansas law, is not a sentence. Kansas defines probation as \"a procedure under which a defendant, convicted of a crime, is released by the court after imposition of sentence, without imprisonment except as provided in felony cases, subject to conditions imposed by the court and subject to the supervision of the probation service of the court or community corrections.\" K.S.A. \u00a7 21-6603(g) (emphasis added). The Kansas Supreme Court has found that a person on probation is not serving a sentence and that \"probation is separate and distinct from the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   , 53 P.3d at 850. Probation is a disposition \"alternate to the serving of a sentence\" and it does not increase or decrease the \"sentence required to be imposed by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ct. App. 1977) (\"As the Kansas Supreme Court has indicated, however, probation represents a grace period during which the defendant has the opportunity to demonstrate that rehabilitation can be achieved without incarceration.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   So although defendant was granted a term of probation, probation was not his sentence. The court was required by law to give defendant both a prison sentence and to order a nonprison sanction. K.S.A. \u00a7 21-6804(e)(3). And defendant did receive a 12-month prison sentence that was suspended pending successful completion of the terms of probation. Probation was merely a \"grace period\" mandated by the sentencing guidelines to give defendant a chance to avoid serving his prison sentence. Regardless of whether defendant ever had to serve that prison term, he was still convicted of a crime that was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Nothing in the definition of a felony requires the defendant actually serve the term of imprisonment; only that the crime is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20572094\">\n    2018 WL 572094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the gridbox had a range of 12-14 months, Judge Murguia\n   held that the defendant was faced with a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 months and denied the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20572094\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the court is not bound by the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Wattree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   , it is persuaded by the rationale therein. While Kansas law requires notice and specific findings for a dispositional departure, which clearly did not happen here, Kansas law also requires a defendant to be sentenced to a prison term even when the sentence is presumptive probation. \"When a sentence falls in the presumptive nonprison grid box, the sentencing court is required to pronounce the prison sentence and the duration of the nonprison sanction at the sentencing hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   , the sentencing court was not required to do any additional fact-finding in order to sentence Defendant to a term of 14 months. Rather, that was a potential sentence under Kansas' sentencing guidelines. \"Nothing in the definition of a felony requires the defendant actually serve the term of imprisonment; only that the crime is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\"\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20572094\">\n    2018 WL 572094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant's motion to suppress is DENIED (Doc. 30) and Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. 28) is DENIED for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 17th day of September, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Fisher testified that he initially checked Defendant's criminal history on KDOC's website and also called into dispatch. Fisher testified that he could not recall when he relayed the information about Defendant's criminal history to Atkins. Ultimately, Fisher stated that he informed Atkins about Defendant's criminal history confirmation after he received the information from dispatch. Fisher stated that Atkins was searching the vehicle at that time. The court notes that Atkins and Fisher's testimony do not necessarily conflict as Atkins testified that he did not know how the criminal history was confirmed at the time the information was relayed to him. Nevertheless, the timing of the confirmation is not critical as the court finds,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , that Defendant's voluntary statement, coupled with all of the facts discussed, provided probable cause to search the vehicle.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The officers did not testify about cocaine, marijuana, or multiple firearms being found in the vehicle. The indictment, however, alleges that all of the offenses occurred on the same date. Presumably, those items were all seized from Defendant's vehicle on the date of the stop.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In his initial brief, Defendant argued that the purpose of prolonging the stop was to seek consent to search Defendant's vehicle. (Doc. 11 at 11-12.) The testimony does not support this position. While Atkins did ask Defendant if he could search the vehicle, Defendant was detained due to suspicions that he was impaired and/or had controlled substances in the vehicle, see discussion\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Although Defendant makes a single statement that he was not\n    <em>\n     Mirandized\n    </em>\n    prior to the questioning regarding his status as a felon, Defendant does not move to suppress his statements under\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    nor assert that he was in custody for the purposes of\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    . Defendant also does not argue that the seizure of the gun should be suppressed due to the taint of the failure to give a\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning. Therefore, the court does not see a need to address this issue. Moreover, even if Defendant should have been given\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings prior to being asked about his status as a felon, the remedy would be to exclude the statements during trial but not any nontestimonial physical fruits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Defendant is of mature age and appears to be of at least average intelligence; the length of his detention and questioning was exceedingly brief, only a couple of minutes; he was not advised of his right to remain silent and was questioned in a police-dominated atmosphere, but at the same time he was not subjected to any physical improper tactics, trickery, or coercion to compel him to make a statement.
