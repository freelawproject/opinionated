This allegation is sufficient to satisfy the standing requirement. In this regard, the Fourth Circuit has recently held that, in the context of a FDCPA case, a plaintiff can establish the existence of an injury in fact by showing that she has suffered and continues to suffer from emotional distress due to the defendant's violations of the FDCPA.\n    <em>\n     Moore v.

Here, plaintiff testified in his deposition that he works for the United States Marshal Service, has a top-secret clearance, and has had previous employment-related problems attributable to credit issues, which he wanted to avoid repeating. Dep. of Robert Yergovich at 7:16-20. He further testified that because of the potential impact of defendants' actions on his security clearance and defendants' threats to put a lien on his home and to accelerate the payments of his HOA dues, he has suffered stress, anxiety, irritation, frustration, and loss of sleep.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 77:9-78:9. Additionally, plaintiff testified that he has taken over-the-counter medicine to help with the anxiety.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    This evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that plaintiff has suffered emotional distress as a result of defendants' allegedly improper debt-collection activity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In response, defendants have cited no evidence to contest plaintiff's assertion and\n    evidence that he has suffered emotional distress as a result of defendants' alleged violations of the FDCPA. Instead, defendants merely seek to belittle the seriousness of plaintiff's alleged distress and assert, without evidentiary support, that any emotional distress resulted from plaintiff's own failure to monitor his account. In the face of plaintiff's uncontested record evidence, these bare, conclusory assertions by defendants are insufficient to overcome plaintiff's demonstration of standing at the summary judgment stage.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , 477 U.S. at 248,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     106 S.Ct. 2505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that a party opposing summary judgment must \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Plaintiff points to a second independent basis for standing, namely that defendants' allegedly wrongful practices, in violation of the FDCPA, are a separate and independent ground for standing. Although the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff \"cannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation,\" the Supreme Court went on to note that the judgment of Congress plays an important role in identifying and elevating intangible harms that may form the basis of a concrete injury-in-fact.\n    <em>\n     Spokeo, Inc. v.

Therefore, plaintiff's allegations that defendants have violated the FDCPA by failing to provide the disclosures required by the FDCPA, by attempting to collect a debt through means prohibited by the FDCPA, and by failing to cease collection of a debt after plaintiff gave notice that the debt was disputed are sufficient to support standing on each of these counts. Likewise, defendants' subsequent write-off of the allegedly improper charges does not, as defendants argue, render the case moot because the write-off does not erase the substantive injury created by defendants' alleged FDCPA violations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The FDCPA's requirements apply only to \"debt collectors,\" which the statute defines as \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Consistent with this, the Fourth Circuit has noted that the FDCPA \"defines a debt collector as (1) a person whose principal purpose is to collect debts; (2) a person who regularly collects debts owed to another; or (3) a person who collects its own debts, using a name other than its own as if it were a debt collector.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     Henson v.

This is so because it is settled that \"not all who collect debts are 'debt collectors' for purposes of the [FDCPA].\"\n    <em>\n     Harris v. Liberty Community Management, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646679\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/1298/#p1302\">\n     702 F.3d 1298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1302 (11th Cir. 2012). Importantly, the FDCPA exempts from its coverage several categories of entities that, among other activities, collect debts. Specifically, \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i) of the FDCPA excludes from the definition of \"debt collector\" \"any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity ... is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i). To be covered by this exemption, (i) defendants must owe a fiduciary obligation to the party for whom they are performing debt collecting services and (ii) defendants' debt-collection activity must be incidental to that fiduciary obligation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    There is little doubt that SCS owed The Village HOA a fiduciary obligation. Specifically, the Virginia Code addresses the relationship between an HOA and its community manager, stating, \"[a] common interest community manager owes a fiduciary duty to the associations to which it provides management services with respect to the manager's handling the funds or the records of each association.\" Va. Code \u00a7 54.1-2353.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The parties dispute whether the language in this Virginia statute is sufficiently broad to create a fiduciary obligation with respect to defendants' collection of assessments. This dispute misses the mark. Whether the Virginia statute extends to an HOA's collection activity is immaterial as long as a fiduciary obligation exists between the HOA and the community manager because \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i) of the FDCPA asks only whether the collection activity is incidental to\n    <em>\n     a bona fide fiduciary obligation.\n    </em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i). Here, there is no doubt that SCS owed a fiduciary obligation with respect to handling The Village HOA's funds and records, pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 54.1-2353. This is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i) analysis, which requires the existence of a fiduciary obligation between the creditor and debt-collecting party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Of course, the existence of a fiduciary obligation does not end the inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The \"critical inquiry\" under \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i) is whether defendants' actions are \"incidental\" to the fiduciary obligation.\n    <em>\n     Wilson v.

In\n    <em>\n     Harris v. Liberty Community Management, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , the Eleventh Circuit held that although the community management company, Liberty, collected unpaid assessments for the HOA, this activity was incidental to its fiduciary obligation to the HOA and Liberty was not a debt collector under the FDCPA.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646679\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/1298/#p1302\">\n     702 F.3d 1298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1302 (11th Cir. 2012).

Thus, in\n    <em>\n     Wilson v. Draper &amp; Goldberg, P.L.L.C.\n    </em>\n    , the Fourth Circuit held that a law firm that was retained solely to foreclose on a property pursuant to a deed of trust did not fall under the exemption because the actions were \"central\" to its fiduciary obligation and debt collection was the \"principal purpose\" of its work.\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2655629\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/373/#p377\">\n     443 F.3d at 377-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And in\n    <em>\n     Goodrow v.

Therefore, the undisputed record evidence of defendants' numerous duties and activities unrelated to\n    debt collection demonstrates that defendants' debt-collection activity was \"incidental\" to-not \"central to, or the primary purpose of\"-the fiduciary obligation owed to The Village HOA.

This argument fails. To be sure, \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) of the FDCPA excludes from the definition of debt collector any person who, on behalf of a creditor, collects a debt that was not in default when the person acquired the authority to collect the debt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) ;\n     <em>\n      Henson v.
