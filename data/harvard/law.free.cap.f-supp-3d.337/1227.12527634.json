Plaintiffs, Diego Krukever, Karem Sandgarten, and Amir Rahimi filed a Response [ECF No. 62], to which Defendants filed a Reply [ECF No. 63]. The Court has carefully considered the Second Amended Class Action\n   Complaint, the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law. For the reasons that follow, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are individual investors who opened brokerage and commodities accounts with Case 1:18-cv-21399-CMA Document 72 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/05/2018 Page 1 of 23 Defendants to trade \"put options\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on \"futures contracts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the Globex electronic trading platform in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the \"Exchange\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25). The put options in which Plaintiffs invested have value tied to the Standard &amp; Poor 500 stock index, which is comprised of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Exchange (the \"Underlying Markets\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). To invest and trade in put options on futures contracts, Plaintiffs entered into a Futures Client Agreement [ECF No. 56-1] (the \"Agreement\") with TDAFF. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 34). The Agreement warned Plaintiffs trading in commodity interests \"INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK, AND IS APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR PERSONS WHO CAN ASSUME RISK OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF THEIR MARGIN DEPOSIT.\" (Agreement \u00b6 23 (capitalization in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' investments are generally traded on margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 31). For customers trading on margin, the Agreement warned TDAFF had the right to determine how much margin Plaintiffs were required keep in their accounts - an amount which TDAFF could \"set and revise ... without prior notice to Client.\" (Agreement \u00b6 4 (alterations added) ). The Agreement gave TDAFF the right \"without prior notice and in its sole discretion, to liquidate any assets held by TD Ameritrade Clearing Inc. in a Securities Account\" in the event of a margin deficiency or insecurity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). TDAFF also had \"sole discretion\" to decide whether a margin deficiency or insecurity existed in Plaintiffs' accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TDAFF exercised this right on February 5, 2018, when it liquidated Plaintiffs' put option futures investments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42). This liquidation happened after the Underlying Markets had closed for the day. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Plaintiffs allege the time after the Underlying Markets close is an \"After Hours Market\" for trading put options on futures contracts, and that the \"After Hours Market does not exhibit the same trading behavior as the regular market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). The After Hours Market on February 5, 2018 was \"illiquid and dysfunctional\" because of the volatile market conditions at the time the Underlying Markets closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 68). In those volatile\n   conditions, the prices on put options \"skyrocketed,\" as the S &amp; P 500 index fluctuated significantly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 48). Because Plaintiffs held \"short\" put options on the futures contracts, any increase in the value of the options had a \"disastrous\" effect on the value of their investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When TDAFF liquidated Plaintiffs' investments in the After Hours Market, Plaintiffs lost millions of dollars. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55 60). Plaintiffs allege their losses would have been far lower had TDAFF liquidated their positions during the \"daytime market\" - that is, when the Underlying Markets are open for trading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). Liquidation in the After Hours Market was thus reckless and commercially unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims arise out of the losses incurred in the After Hours Liquidation of their investments. Although Plaintiffs understood and accepted the inherent risk stemming from investments in put options on futures contracts, they \"did not know or accept [ ] that TDA and TDAFF would expose them to even greater risk by recklessly liquidating Plaintiffs' and class members' positions in a commercially unreasonable way in an illiquid and dysfunctional After-Hours Market that would exponentially increase their losses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs did not know the commercially unreasonable and reckless liquidation could occur because of two fraudulent omissions made by TDAFF in the Futures Client Agreement: (1) the Agreement \"does not state that TDAFF may liquidate at any time;\" and (2) the Agreement \"does not disclose that Defendants were reserving for themselves the right to liquidate Plaintiffs' commodities in an illiquid and dysfunctional After-Hours Market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit under federal law, contending (1) the two omissions made by TDAFF in the Agreement operated as a fraud or deceit on Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-93); and (2) TDA aided and abetted the omissions, which operated as a fraud or deceit on Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-101). Plaintiffs also bring a single state-law claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the Agreement's allegedly fraudulent omissions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The SAC contains four claims for relief: (1) in Count I, a claim against TDAFF under the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. section 6b(e)(3) ; (2) in Count II, a claim against TDAFF under federal commodities regulations, 17 C.F.R. section 180.1 ; (3) in Count III, a claim against TDA for aiding and abetting TDAFF's violations of federal law; and (4) in Count IV, a state-law claim against both Defendants for violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SAC). As stated, Defendants challenge each claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count I: Violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(e)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs assert TDAFF \"engaged in an act, practice, or course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon Plaintiffs,\" in violation of 7 U.S.C. section 6b(e)(3). (SAC \u00b6 84). Section 6b(e)(3) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any registered entity, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery (or option on such a contract), or any swap, on a group or index of securities (or any interest therein or based on the value thereof) -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(e)(3) (alteration added). Defendants argue Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under section 6b(e)(3) because (1) the SAC does not meet the heightened fraud pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) ; (2) TDAFF had a contractual right to liquidate Plaintiffs' investments in the manner in which it did; (3) Plaintiffs cannot identify any incentive for Defendants to defraud them; (4) Plaintiffs' claims are nothing more than fraud by hindsight; and (5) the SAC fails to allege facts establishing Plaintiffs' reliance on Defendants' alleged fraud caused their losses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 9-18). The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Alleging Fraud with Particularity Under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(e)(3)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to Defendants, Plaintiffs are required to \"allege, with particularity, that Defendants committed an act that operated as a fraud or deceit.\" (Reply 2). It appears that no federal court, to date, has analyzed the pleading requirements of a section 6b(e)(3) claim. Where there is an absence of case law interpreting a section of the CEA, courts have \"traditionally looked to case law developing similar provisions of the securities laws.\" (Mot. 9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Waters v. Int'l Precious Metals Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"444881\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/172/479/#p485\">\n    172 F.R.D. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (S.D. Fla. 1996) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants and Plaintiffs ask the Court to analogize section 6b(e)(3) to identical language found elsewhere in securities laws, but the parties have different provisions in mind. Defendants ask the Court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. 9-10) to look outside the CEA, to case law interpreting Rule 10b-5, which makes it unlawful \"[t]o engage in any act,\n   practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5(c) (alteration added). In contrast, Plaintiffs ask the Court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resp. 9-10) to look to 7 U.S.C. section 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   in the CEA, which makes it unlawful \"to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1)(B). Both Rule 10b-5 and section 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1)(B) employ nearly identical language to that found in 7 U.S.C. section 6b(e)(3), which, as stated, makes it unlawful for a person \"to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants do not provide the Court with legislative history or other support for their contention the Court should look to Rule 10(b)-5 when interpreting section 6b(e)(3), rather than identical language elsewhere in the CEA itself.

(SAC \u00b6 35). Defendants contend the first allegation fails to meet federal pleading standards because \"[i]t was obvious from the Agreement's context and lack of limiting language that TDAFF could trade at any time the [Exchange] was open for trading.\" (Mot. 10 (alterations added) ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 18-20). Plaintiffs, also citing a number of cases from outside of Nebraska, argue \"courts throughout the country have uniformly held that the concept of good\n   faith and fair dealing applies even where a contract grants 'sole' or otherwise broad discretion.\" (Resp. 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Agreement clearly allows TDAFF to decide to liquidate Plaintiffs' investments. (Agreement \u00b6 6). Plaintiffs do not contest that Defendants could have unilaterally liquidated Plaintiffs' investments in the \"daytime market\" - i.e., either before the close of the Underlying Markets on February 5, 2018 or after they opened on February 6, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 41). The relevant question, then, is whether the Agreement's provision authorizing TDAFF to liquidate Plaintiffs' positions \"in its sole discretion\" expressly allows liquidation to occur at any time, including during the After Hours Market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The parties have not provided the Court with any case law from Nebraska (or any analogous jurisdiction) exploring whether a contractual provision granting \"sole discretion\" to liquidate (1) merely affords TDAFF the right to decide to liquidate Plaintiffs' positions in a commercially reasonable manner; or (2) expressly permits liquidation\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   - including when liquidation would not be commercially reasonable, such as in the allegedly illiquid and dysfunctional After Hours Market. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.; Resp.; Reply). Even if the contractual provision granting TDAFF \"sole discretion\" allows it to liquidate at any time, TDAFF may have still been required under Nebraska law to exercise good faith when choosing what time to liquidate Plaintiffs' investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Looking to other jurisdictions, the Court notes while \"[l]iquidation provisions in securities broker-customer contracts have been upheld by courts,\" courts have also held \"this contractual power must be exercised in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Modern Settings, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs allege TDAFF's liquidation of their investments was \"reckless, commercially unreasonable[,] and in bad faith.\" (SAC \u00b6 61 (alteration added) ). The allegation of bad faith is bolstered by the SAC's allegation - which the Court takes as true - that \"Defendants benefitted from TDAFF's actions by capping and limiting Defendants' own exposure to their margin lending to Plaintiffs' and class members' accounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants' reliance (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. 11) on\n   <em>\n    Capital Options Investments, Inc. v.

Count III merits dismissal because it makes no allegations connecting TDA to the drafting of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 59]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.
