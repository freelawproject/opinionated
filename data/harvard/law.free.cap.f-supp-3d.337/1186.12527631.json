(Doc. 211.) The Government then filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty as to the Kidnapping Offense. (Doc. 230 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Notice\n   </strong>\n   \").) This Notice identified the factors the Government contends warrant the imposition of the death penalty under the provisions of the Federal Death Penalty Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3598 (\"\n   <strong>\n    FDPA\n   </strong>\n   \").

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing \u00a7 3592(c)(1) ).) Last, the Government proposed two non-statutory aggravating factors: victim impact and pattern of domestic abuse.

Federal Death Penalty Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To be eligible for the death penalty under the FDPA, a defendant must first be found guilty of a death penalty eligible crime.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A kidnapping charge under \u00a7 1201 that results in \"the death of any person\" counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201 (\"[I]f the death of any person results, [the Defendant] shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.\"). Thus, if a defendant is found guilty of kidnapping with a resulting death, a separate sentencing hearing follows \"to determine the punishment to be imposed.\" \u00a7 3593(b). Before a jury may consider death, it must make specific findings beyond a reasonable doubt: First, a threshold inquiry into the defendant's mental state under \u00a7 3592(a)(2); and if statutory intent is found, at least one of the statutory aggravating factors in \u00a7 3592(c). Only after the jury makes these findings is the defendant death penalty eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If eligibility is met, the jury \"shall consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death.\" \u00a7 3593(e). To that end, the FDPA allows the presentation of information \"as to any matter relevant to the sentence ... regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.\" \u00a7 3593(c). The Government maintains the burden of establishing aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defendant has the burden of establishing mitigating factors by a preponderance of the information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous vote ... shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.\" \u00a7 3593(e).

(Doc. 304, p. 4.) On November 15, 2016, R.M. reported a domestic violence incident to the Indiana state police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the incident Defendant confined R.M. inside his car, at gunpoint, and verbally threatened to kill her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6 6) When R.M. first attempted to escape, Defendant fired a single round shot at R.M, narrowly missing her. (Doc. 304, p. 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.) On her second escape attempt, R.M. succeeded, taking refuge in a Wal-Mart where a store employee called 911. (Doc. 304, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An Indiana State Police Trooper responded to the 911 call and made an official report concerning the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6 7.) By the time law enforcement arrived, Defendant fled the scene. (Doc. 304, p. 4.) Following the incident, R.M. left Indiana with her aunt, traveling to Ormond Beach, Florida where she resided with her aunt until her disappearance on November 27, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to the Government, beginning on November 15, 2016, after R.M. fled to Florida, Defendant began travelling southbound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) On November 27, 2016, he arrived in Volusia County where he first surveilled the house of R.M.'s aunt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6 9.) That same day, R.M. went jogging and Defendant, disguised, approached R.M. (Doc. 304, p. 6.) At some point between November 27, 2016, and December 2, 2016, Defendant shot R.M. multiple times while she was a passenger in his car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following R.M.'s disappearance, her aunt reported her missing to law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) On December 2, 2016, law enforcement located and arrested Defendant in Louisville, Kentucky\n   where he ultimately admitted to shooting R.M. three times while inside his car but claimed she voluntarily went with him from Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6 12.) Defendant then agreed to assist law enforcement in locating R.M.'s remains, and that evening he led agents to the site of R.M.'s burial where they located R.M.'s partially buried body.

(Doc. 301, pp. 2-20.) The Government opposes, noting that Defendant's argument is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court did not categorically bar imposing the death penalty on individuals with mental illnesses or severe brain damage; and Defendant's social policy arguments are legally unsupported. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 314.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On review, the Court agrees with the Government. Since\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has not added individuals\n   with mental illnesses or severe brain damage to the category of individuals who cannot receive the death penalty. Rather, evidence of a defendant's mental illness may be presented to the jury during the sentencing phase as a mitigating factor for not imposing the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Given this established framework, Defendant's argument that applying the death penalty to those with mental illnesses violates the constitution rings hollow. The Court is bound to apply the law as written, and currently, the Eighth Amendment does not exclude individuals with severe mental illnesses and serious brain damage from the death penalty. The motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

(Doc. 264.) Relying on statistical findings, Defendant contends that when the victim is a white female, the likelihood of a federal death sentence increases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.) From this correlation, Defendant avers he has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that: (1) he has suffered and is likely to continue to suffer prejudice compared to similarly situated death-eligible federal defendants; and (2) the federal death penalty is arbitrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-20.) So, beyond striking the death penalty notice, he seeks related discovery and an evidentiary hearing to explore the white female victim effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, 20.) To that end, Defendant filed a separate motion for this discovery (Doc. 274), which was denied without prejudice (Doc. 284). No renewed motion was filed, despite Defendant being given the opportunity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 284, p. 2.) Thus, it appears Defendant no longer seeks the discovery or hearing initially requested. In any event, Defendant's arguments are again foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent, so none of this requested relief is due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, \"to prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, [Defendant] must prove that the decisionmakers in\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   case acted with discriminatory purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCleskey v.

And adding the two non-statutory aggravating factors charged-victim impact and a pattern of domestic abuse-further narrows the jury's discretion in imposing the death penalty, thus ensuring the requisite \"\n   <em>\n    individualized\n   </em>\n   determination.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195530\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/862/#p877\">\n    462 U.S. at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195530\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/862/#p877\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What is more, by requiring a jury to find a gateway intent factor and statutory aggravating factor and then weigh the aggravating factors against mitigating circumstances, the FDPA follows a constitutional sentencing scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248419\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/373/\">\n    527 U.S. at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248419\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/373/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Next, Defendant claims that geographic disparity, the white female victim effect, infrequency of capital prosecution for felony murder, the lack of aggravated circumstances, defense counsel funding discrepancies, the jury death-qualification process, the lack of clarity in jury instructions, and the Department of Justice's (\"\n   <strong>\n    DOJ\n   </strong>\n   \") administration of the death penalty all render the imposition of the death penalty here unconstitutional. (Doc. 303, pp 6-19.) As support, Defendant relies on statistics, summaries of other capital cases, various studies, and the United States Attorneys' Manual protocol for capital cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248419\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/373/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) And again, Defendant strikes out in the face of settled precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For starters, Defendant's cited evidence does not overcome\n   <em>\n    McCleskey\n   </em>\n   , as Defendant still points to general statistical disparities without application to his circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D.

(Doc. 245, pp. 1-2.) First, the merits phase would determine Defendant's guilt of the crimes charged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) If Defendant is found guilty of Count One, kidnapping, the jury would then determine in the eligibility phase whether he is eligible for the death penalty, considering his mental state and the existence of the felony murder statutory aggravating factor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Last the jury in the selection phase would consider the appropriate penalty to recommend, weighing evidence related to the non-statutory aggravating factors of victim impact and pattern of domestic abuse against Defendant's mitigating factors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant contends trifurcation is appropriate to ensure the jury's eligibility determination is not prejudiced by powerful victim impact and domestic abuse testimony, and because it will conserve judicial resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, the Government argues that: (1) trifurcation is not statutorily or constitutionally required; (2) Defendant's concerns of spillover prejudice from victim impact or pattern of domestic abuse testimony are unfounded and can be addressed by carefully crafted jury instructions; and (3) trifurcation unduly burdens everyone involved in the case and causes jury confusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 267.) In reply, Defendant delved into cases the Government relied on to support its position, distinguishing them. (Doc. 276.) On review, the Court agrees with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The FDPA requires splitting a capital case between the merits and sentencing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As noted earlier,\n   the FDPA relaxes the evidentiary standards in the sentencing phase. \u00a7 3593(c). At sentencing, the jury decides death eligibility and whether death should be imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3591(a) (setting forth requirements for sentence of death); \u00a7 3592 (outlining statutory mitigating and aggravating factors); \u00a7 3593 (procedural requirements). Different evidence is offered for each finding: eligibility focuses on Defendant's mental state and proving at least one statutory aggravating factor, while selection considers additional non-statutory aggravating factors and mitigating factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Iowa 2005) (finding no probative value to \"considering information concerning 'non-statutory' aggravating factors to a jury's determination of 'gateway' and 'statutory' aggravating factors\"); (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 230). Indeed, this eligibility inquiry is \"entirely severable factually from the jury's consideration of any other factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017183\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/362/1043/#p1105\">\n    362 F.Supp.2d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the question then becomes why\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   trifurcate?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   According to the Government, trifurcation is not necessary because any risk of \"spillover prejudice\" from victim impact evidence or pattern of domestic abuse evidence-which it \"no doubt\" recognizes \"may be emotional and powerful\"-can be addressed \"by carefully worded jury instructions.\" (Doc. 267, p. 6.) For this, it relies on\n   <em>\n    Bolden\n   </em>\n   , where the Eighth Circuit found no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of a motion to bifurcate the penalty phase premised not on the risk of prejudice from victim impact testimony, but on the risk presented by introducing the defendant's criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858035\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/609/#p619\">\n    545 F.3d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only on appeal did the defendant claim two sentencing phases were necessary based on the risk of victim impact\n   testimony prejudicing the jury's eligibility determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858035\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/609/#p619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858035\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/609/#p619\">\n    at 618-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But because the district court instructed the jury on how to consider victim impact testimony and the record didn't indicate the jury deviated from these instructions, the Eighth Circuit found no abuse of discretion in denying the motion to bifurcate the penalty phase.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858035\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/609/#p619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858035\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/609/#p619\">\n    at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So given that procedural posture,\n   <em>\n    Bolden\n   </em>\n   is not helpful here where Defendant is arguing in a pre-trial motion that trifurcation is necessary given the potential prejudice of offering victim impact testimony before eligibility is determined. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 245.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At this juncture, decently apprised of the type of evidence the Government would put on for victim impact and pattern of domestic abuse factors, the Court is absolutely persuaded of its prejudicial import. And hearing this evidence before deciding whether Defendant is eligible for the death penalty carries a high, if not insurmountable, risk that it will unfairly skew that finding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017183\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/362/1043/#p1105\">\n    362 F.Supp.2d at 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Jury instructions may and likely will effectively curb this, but trifurcation portends certainty. So the Court will go with the sure thing-separating the eligibility determination into a distinct phase. To the Government, this veers the ship off course because trifurcation entails additional proceedings. (Doc. 267, pp. 8-9.) But the risk of unfair prejudice in a single sentencing proceeding dwarfs any resulting practical complications from trifurcation. What is more, the Court entrusts the parties will work together to calm the waters. Therefore, Defendant's motion to trifurcate the proceedings is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having disposed of Defendant's pre-trial motions, the Court turns to the Government's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Government seeks exclusion of evidence or argument by Defendant comparing the facts of this case to \"any other case, particularly similarly situated cases in which a sentence of death was not imposed.\" (Doc. 256, p. 1.) Such evidence is not constitutionally required, and the Government contends comparing this case to others is not relevant to Defendant's presentation of mitigating factors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Moreover, the Government argues that the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its potential for confusing the issues here and misleading the jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In response, Defendant notes that his preliminary analysis of comparative proportionality reveals this case is in a world of its own. (Doc. 271, pp. 1-5.) Based on this, any evidence Defendant might present diverges from comparative proportionality evidence historically sought to be admitted and rejected on a probative value assessment-what the Government cites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-13.) Plus, Defendant does not know yet what proportionality evidence he might seek to admit, so he ultimately asserts that this motion is premature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) When the time comes that Defendant's comparative proportionality assessment is complete, he asks the Court to then balance its probative value against the risk of unfair prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On review, the Court agrees with Defendant. At this point, neither party knows what, if any, comparative proportionality evidence Defendant may seek to admit. So any present attempt to assess its admissibility\n   would be going in blind. Should Defendant's comparative proportionality investigation unearth relevant and probative evidence that he seeks to offer in the penalty phase, and the Government objects, the Court will then assess its admissibility. But not now. Hence, the Court denies this motion without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Preclude Execution Impact Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At bat now is the Government's penalty phase motion in limine to preclude execution impact evidence (Doc. 257), which Defendant opposes (Doc. 265). Acknowledging a capital defendant's right to present any relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase, the Government submits that this does not extend to evidence on the impact Defendant's execution would have on those who love him. (Doc. 257, pp. 5-10.) Specifically, the Government seeks to exclude testimony from Defendant's family and friends regarding their love for him, the impact his death would have on them, their personal views on the death penalty, what they consider an appropriate sentence, or general pleas for sympathy or mercy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Testimony of this nature, the Government contends, falls outside the scope of relevant mitigating evidence and improperly spotlights the impact of a death sentence on third parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-10.) Furthermore, the Government notes that execution-impact testimony is not required and has been excluded on these grounds before. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But the issue is not quite so clear cut. As Defendant points out, many courts have permitted some form of execution impact testimony as relevant mitigating evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 265, pp. 2-7 (collecting capital cases); pp. 7-9 (state cases).) Certainly, the Government is correct that some courts have adopted a categorical exclusion approach.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Snarr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653677\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/368/#p401\">\n    704 F.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401-02 (5th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But that's not the only \"appropriate\" option.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p991\">\n    502 F.3d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (9th Cir. 2007). A \"fine\" line can be drawn, where witnesses are permitted to testify \"regarding their affection for [the defendant] and their wish for his life to be spared, but ... not allow[ing] them to offer an opinion about what they thought the jury's verdict should be.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p991\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such a ruling \"ke[eps] the jury focused on relevant mitigating evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p991\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Con-Ui\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-CR-123,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201410913\">\n    2017 WL 1410913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (M.D. Penn. Apr. 20, 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260715\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/18/1065/#p1069\">\n    18 F.Supp.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1069-72 (D. Haw. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Ultimately, the Court finds it appropriate to adopt the nuanced approach. Whether such testimony constitutes relevant mitigating evidence will depend on what Defendant seeks to introduce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756169\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/167/#p193\">\n    721 F.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193-97 (4th Cir. 2013) (analyzing piece-by-piece the admissibility of execution impact evidence proffered). As it stands, Defendant has not indicated what type of execution impact evidence he would introduce, if any. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 265.) Rather, both parties seek a blanket admissibility ruling. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 257, 265.) Yet the Court will not act uninformed. So, like before, the Court will deny this motion without prejudice and revisit this issue once Defendant knows what execution impact testimony, if any, he seeks to offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion to Preclude Unsworn Allocution by Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Moving along, the Government filed another penalty phase motion in limine to preclude unsworn allocution by Defendant. (Doc. 258.) Its argument is rooted in the absence of a constitutional or\n   statutory right of allocution and the inapplicability of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 in capital jury trials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5.) The Government also opines that allocution would not constitute admissible mitigating evidence under the FDPA's evidentiary standard and notes that Defendant already has the right to testify during which he could personally address the jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In response, Defendant objects to a pre-trial ruling on this matter and raises the issue of his competency. (Doc. 272, p. 2.) Then, substantively speaking, Defendant argues that precluding allocution deprives him of a fair jury trial and due process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On review, the Court agrees with Defendant that this issue cannot be decided pre-trial. Rather, in the event of a penalty phase, Defendant's right of allocution must take into account whether he testifies, mitigating evidence, and other factors that simply cannot be assessed at this time. With this, the Court will deny this motion without prejudice. The Government may raise an appropriate objection at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion in Limine to Admit Statements of Victim Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Last but certainly not least, the Court turns to the Government's motion in limine to admit statements of the victim under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3). (Doc. 322.) The Government seeks to admit statements R.M. made to family members and others following her alleged escape from Defendant on November 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3.) The Government maintains these statements are relevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 and admissible under Rule 803(3) as an exception to hearsay because they are statements of a declarant's then-existing state of mind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) In response, Defendant seeks exclusion of these statements as unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. (Doc. 335, pp. 4-6.) But if these statements are to be admitted, Defendant seeks to limit the testimony to R.M.'s state of mind, without accompanying explanation of why she felt that way, and requests a limiting instruction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On review, the Court will grant the motion in part, limiting testimony to R.M.'s state of mind without any accompanying explanation. Contrary to Defendant's 403 argument, the probative value of these statements is clear: they paint a picture of the circumstances surrounding R.M.'s alleged escape and stint in Florida. And because the Court will limit their content, as explained next, this lessens their prejudicial import.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874631\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/627/#p631\">\n    713 F.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (11th Cir. 1983) (\"[I]n a criminal trial relevant evidence is inherently prejudicial; it is only when\n   <em>\n    unfair\n   </em>\n   prejudice\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   outweighs probative value that [Rule 403] permits exclusion.\"). But, as Defendant rightfully points out, the full statements the Government submitted are not admissible under Rule 803(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Samaniego\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9091020\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/1280/#p1282\">\n    345 F.3d 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282 (11th Cir. 2003). Indeed, \"the state-of-mind exception does not permit the witness to relate any of the declarant's statements as to why he held the particular state of mind, or what he might have believed that would have induced the state of mind.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9091020\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/1280/#p1282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, 803(3) \"narrowly limit[s] those admissible statements to declarations of condition-'I'm scared'-and not belief-'I'm scared because [someone] threatened me.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10596835\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/631/1223/#p1225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (first alteration added, second in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10596835\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/631/1223/#p1225\">\n    631 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1225 ).
