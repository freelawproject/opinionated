(\"PPNYC\") challenges the issuance by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") of two Funding Opportunity Announcements (the \"2018 FOAs\") that describe the terms whereby applicants can seek grant funding under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (\"TPP\") Program. Plaintiff moves for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and seeks either a permanent injunction preventing defendants from implementing the FOAs or a preliminary injunction pursuant to Section 705 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. Defendants move to dismiss for lack of standing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and cross-move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The governing statute for the TPP Program establishes requirements for two tiers of grants: Three-quarters of the funding is allotted to Tier 1 Grants, which are for \"replicating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy.\" The other quarter is designated for Tier 2 Grants to \"develop, replicate, refine, and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy.\" Applications for both tiers of grants are solicited through FOAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff has been the beneficiary of TPP funding since the Program's inception in 2010, but alleges that it is now ineligible for and can no longer compete for Tier 1 and Tier 2 grants as a result of new FOAS adopted by HHS that it contends are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. We first address whether plaintiff has standing to challenge HHS's actions, and conclude that it does. We then consider whether the matter is committed to agency discretion and therefore unreviewable, and conclude that it is not. Next, we find that the adoption of the FOAs constitutes final agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having resolved these threshold issues, we turn to the merits. We hold that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is contrary to the applicable statute because the evaluative tools that applicants for Tier 1 grants must \"replicat[e]\" are not \"programs\" and have not \"been proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\" We reach a different conclusion as to the 2018 Tier 2 FOA because these tools and HHS's \"public health priorities\" are not inconsistent with Tier 2's statutory mandate to \"test additional models and innovative strategies.\" Accordingly, we grant plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in part and permanently enjoin defendants from using the 2018 Tier 1 FOA as the basis for awarding or disbursing TPP Program funds, and grant defendants' motion for summary judgment as it relates to the 2018 Tier 2 FOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The relevant facts of this case are largely uncontested; we will note any facts in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since 2010, Congress has annually allocated funding to HHS for \"grants to public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy.\" Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub.

Most directly, $6,800,000 in funding is made available to \"carry out evaluations.\" 2018 CAA, 132 Stat. at 733. Indeed, this funding has been used for the TPP Evidence Review, which, until the 2018 FOAs, provided the list of program \"proven effective by rigorous evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2010 Tier 1 FOA, Torrance Decl. Ex. A at 7, 38, ECF No. 46-1. Tier 2 is also structured to serve as a laboratory for Tier 1. The TPP Program sets aside Tier 2 funding to \"develop, replicate, refine, and test\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   models\" - that is, ones that may not yet have been \"proven effective\" - and \"innovative strategies\" that, based on their novelty, have not yet been subject to \"rigorous evaluation.\" 2018 CAA, 132 Stat. at 733. The statute thus contemplates that \"programs\" will prove their mettle, either through smaller Tier 2 grants or by other means of rigorous evaluation, before they can be eligible to serve as a model for programs that receive Tier 1 funding. Plainly, evaluative tools like the SMARTool and TAC have not been and cannot be evaluated by these means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Our understanding of the 2018 CAA is further supported by its legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Disabled in Action of Metro.

The July 22, 2009 Committee Report from the House Committee on Appropriations specified that the TPP Program provided funding \"for\n   <em>\n    evidence-based\n   </em>\n   programs that have shown through rigorous evaluation, defined as\n   <em>\n    randomized controlled trials\n   </em>\n   , to reduce teenage pregnancy, delay sexual activity, or increase contraceptive use.\" H.R. Rep. No. 111-220, at 176 (2009) (emphasis added). Most notably, this Report defines \"rigorous evaluation,\" which is not otherwise defined in the 2018 CAA, to mean \"randomized controlled trials.\" The August 4, 2009 Committee Report of the Senate Committee on Appropriations similarly explained that Congress's intent was to fund \"a wide range of\n   <em>\n    evidence-based\n   </em>\n   programs,\" S. Rep. No. 111-66, at 160 (2009), and the December 8, 2009 Conference Report used the same language, recognizing that the TPP Program would fund \"a wide range of evidence-based programs,\" H.R. Rep. No. 111-366, at 1043 (2009). All three Reports thus highlight Congress's intent to require that TPP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   model \"programs\" be \"evidence-based\" and backed by precise empirical evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Unsurprisingly, defendants do not point to any empirical study or analysis of the SMARTool or TAC in the administrative record. As the SMARTool and TAC are themselves evaluative tools, they cannot readily be subject to the types of rigorous testing expected of a Tier 1 model \"program.\" Defendants argue instead that it was \"rational\" to select the SMARTool and TAC as model programs for Tier 1 funding based on their \"promise.\" Defs.' Reply at 14, Aug. 16, 2018, ECF No. 53. But promise is no substitute for proof, which is what the statute requires.

Mem of Law at 29, Aug. 2, 2018, ECF No. 49. Specifically, defendants identify the following evidence that they contend supports their decision: (1) three documents related to a study entitled \"Meta-Analysis of Federally Funded Teen Pregnancy Prevention Programs,\" by Randall Juras, et al., dated November 2, 2017 (the \"Juras Study\"); (2) a press release entitled \"Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program Facts,\" dated August 28, 2017 (the \"TPP Program Press Release\" or the \"Press Release\"); and (3) a report entitled \"The Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (2010-2015): Synthesis of Impact Findings,\" by Amy Feldman Farb and Amy L. Margolis, dated June 24, 2016. Defendants contend that these materials show that \"quantitative analyses of individual program models fail[ed] to generate viable options for replication,\" such that it was reasonable to abandon the use of model \"programs\" altogether and instead turn to the SMARTool and TAC. Contrary to defendants' contentions, analysis of these materials makes clear that the agency had numerous \"viable options\" that complied with Tier 1's statutory requirements such that the adoption of the 2018 Tier 1 FOA, which did not comply with the statutory requirements, was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We begin with the Juras Study. The index of the Administrative Record submitted to the Court by defendants lists three documents associated with the Juras Study: (1) the Study itself; (2) a summary description of a presentation describing the findings of the Study at the Association for Public Policy Analysis &amp; Management's (\"APPAM\") Fall Research Conference on November 2, 2017 (\"the Juras Summary\"); and (3) the presentation slides from the APPAM Conference (the \"Juras Presentation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The first of these documents, however, is not actually in the Administrative Record because defendants have withheld it from the Court and plaintiff, citing \"deliberative process privilege.\" Administrative Record Index at 4 n.*, Aug. 2, 2018, ECF No. 47 (\"Although the study described\n   by this document is complete, the study report continues to undergo internal revision.

Where the Juras Presentation discusses\n   <em>\n    programs\n   </em>\n   , it identifies twelve evaluations that found evidence of effectiveness based on at least one statistically significant behavioral impact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR000009;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at AR000016 (displaying a chart identifying twelve programs that outperformed the control group as to the variable \"Recent Sex\").

Mem. of Law at 6, Aug. 2, 2018, ECF No. 49. But this counter-argument amounts to a concession that there were programs available that have been proven effective, including by the Juras Study itself. Even assuming that the Juras Study provided defendants with \"a reasoned explanation\" to no longer rely upon the TPP Evidence Review, it did not give them an \"adequate reason\" to flaunt the statutory requirement to \"replicat[e] programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2125 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoag Mem.

We begin again with the text of the Tier 2 provision in the statute, which makes funding \"available for research and demonstration grants to\n   <em>\n    develop, replicate, refine, and test additional\n   </em>\n   models and\n   <em>\n    innovative\n   </em>\n   strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy.\" 2018 CAA, 132 Stat. at 733. Unlike Tier 1, Tier 2 does not require proof of effectiveness nor faithfulness to a proven program. Rather, Congress's use of \"develop, refine and test\" all suggest experimentation. We define the fourth verb, \"replicate,\" the same way as above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. S.E.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874004\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/210/#p218\">\n    671 F.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (2d Cir. 2012) (defining \"willful\" the same way in different subsections of a statute), but it nonetheless takes on new meaning when it modifies \"additional models\" instead of \"programs that have been proven effective.\" The use of \"additional\" denotes that the models to be replicated in Tier 2 can include some that had not been sufficiently \"proven effective\" to make the cut for Tier 1. HHS is afforded broad discretion by the statutory use of \"innovative strategies,\" which by nature of their novelty may not yet be supported by proof of effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiff does not argue that the 2018 Tier 2 FOA violates any portion of this statutory language, but rather points to the introductory clause of the TPP Program statute, which provides that any funding, even if it is used to develop an \"innovative strategy,\" must be for \"medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy.\" 132 Stat. at 733. Plaintiff therefore asserts that the 2018 Tier 2 FOA is contrary to the statute because its \"public health priorities\" dictate that HHS will fund programs that are not \"medically accurate.\" Pl.'s Reply at 20, Aug. 9, 2018, ECF No. 50. This argument fails as a matter of statutory structure. Tier 2's place in the TPP Program is the laboratory where applicants can test programs that might someday be eligible for replication in Tier 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kantor Decl. \u00b6 38, Aug. 9, 2018, ECF No. 52 (\"The Tier 2 funding is designed to support new and innovative approaches to teen pregnancy prevention programs that do not have previous rigorous research demonstrating their effectiveness.\"). At this juncture, the Court cannot conclude as\n   a matter of law that any program developed under the SMARTool or TAC and analyzed through the lens of the \"public health priorities\" would lack \"medical accuracy.\" If HHS actually awards Tier 2 grants to applicants whose proposals are not medically accurate, that may be the basis for future litigation, but that issue is not currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The relevant distinction between the Tiers is statutory. While defendants are precluded from using evaluative tools like the SMARTool and TAC as a substitute for \"programs proven effective through rigorous evaluation,\" they may use them to \"develop and \"test innovative strategies\" under Tier 2. TPP FY 18 Tier 2 FOA at AR000137. Indeed, plaintiff argued that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is contrary to law because it would improperly fund unproven programs that belonged in Tier 2. Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 21, July 24, 2018, ECF No. 36 (\"The 2018 Tier 1 FOA also seeks to transfer the funding for Tier 1 into the Tier 2 appropriation.\"); Kantor Decl. \u00b6 38, ECF No. 52 (\"By shifting to an approach that allows applicants to create or choose a program with no previous rigorous evidence of effectiveness, the Tier 1 program has essentially been discontinued in favor of a Tier 2 approach....\"). If relying on the SMARTool, TAC, and \"public health priorities\" in Tier 1 meant adopting \"a Tier 2 approach,\" it logically follows that they were not improper considerations for Tier 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The same problems plague plaintiff's argument that the 2018 Tier 2 FOA is arbitrary and capricious. While defendants cannot rely on the SMARTool and TAC in violation of the statutory requirements of Tier 1, defendants adequately justify employing these tools to test novel approaches in an attempt to improve the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program. Tier 2 serves as a laboratory for developing new model programs, and, in defendants' view, the SMARTool and TAC identify the \"key elements of effective programs recognized by social science research to affect adolescent risk behaviors.\" TPP FY 18 Tier 2 FOA at AR000137. Nothing in the record suggests that these tools are so inherently flawed that it would be inappropriate to use them as a reference point in devising a grant proposal. Defendants need not demonstrate that this approach is better than the ones used for the 2010 and 2015 FOAs: \"it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency\n   <em>\n    believes\n   </em>\n   it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    556 U.S. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
