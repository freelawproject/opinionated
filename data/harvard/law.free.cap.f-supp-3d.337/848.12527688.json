Twenty-one of these are in Iowa, two are in Moline, Illinois, and three are in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PJ Iowa employed Frazier as an hourly tipped delivery driver in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, from September 15, 2016, until April 10, 2017. PJ Iowa never paid Frazier minimum wage in Iowa, which at the relevant time was $7.25 an hour. Instead, as PJ Iowa clarifies, Frazier was paid a base cash wage of $5.25 or $5.75 per hour (wage increased on January 5, 2017), plus tips. PJ Iowa is allowed to pay this seemingly subminimum wage under the FLSA's \"tip credit\" policy. That is, for employees who regularly receive over $30 in tips a month, the FLSA allows employers to deduct a chosen amount from the otherwise-mandatory minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m), (t) ; U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Field Operations Handbook (DOL Handbook) \u00a7 30d00 (Nov. 17, 2016), www.dol.gov/whd/FOH/FOH_Ch30.pdf.

The DOL Handbook states that when an employer takes a tip credit, the cash wage paid to the employee is not technically \"a subminimum wage.\" DOL Handbook \u00a7 30d00(a). Instead \"[t]ipped employees are entitled to the full ... minimum wage, which may be comprised of both a direct or cash wage and a tip credit ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As is required of employers who use a \"tip credit\" system, PJ Iowa provided Frazier with notice of his hourly rate of pay, the amount of tip credit claimed by PJ Iowa per hour ($2.00, then $2.50, aligned with wage increase), and that Frazier had the right to retain all tips.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30d00(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PJ Iowa employed Kearns in Marion, Iowa, as an hourly tipped delivery driver during two separate time periods: May 14, 2014, to October 16, 2014, and July 4, 2016, to February 17, 2018. Instead of paying Kearns the minimum wage, PJ Iowa paid her a base hourly wage of $5.35, $5.50, or\n   $5.90 per hour, plus tips. PJ Iowa applied a tip credit against Kearns's minimum wage. Therefore, PJ Iowa also provided Kearns with notice of her hourly rate of pay, the amount of tip credit claimed by PJ Iowa per hour ($2.00, $2.00, and $2.50, aligned with wage increases), and Kearns's right to retain all tips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 13, 2017, Frazier filed a Petition in the Iowa District Court of Polk County against PJ Iowa for violation of the FLSA, the Iowa Minimum Wage Law (IMWL), Iowa Code \u00a7 91D, and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law (IWPCL), Iowa Code \u00a7 91A.

PJ Iowa filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss Frazier's claims on May 19, 2017, arguing Frazier violated the rule against claims-splitting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court denied that motion on July 20, 2017. Frazier filed a Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint on July 19, 2017, adding Plaintiff Kearns. Upon opposition by PJ Iowa, Plaintiffs withdrew the Amended Complaint on August 14, 2017. On August 29, 2017, Frazier again filed a Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint, which was granted on the same day. Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Helen C. Adams issued a scheduling order allowing for a period of limited discovery focused on collective action and class certification. In accordance with the scheduling order, the parties served initial disclosures, interrogatories, and document requests. At the conclusion of limited discovery, Plaintiffs filed this motion for conditional collective action certification and class action certification. As named representatives of the putative collective action, Plaintiffs properly filed opt-in consent forms with the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relevant to this Motion, Plaintiffs make three class-based claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count I, which is brought under the FLSA, and Count II, which is brought under the IMWL and the IWPCL, allege that PJ Iowa improperly applied a tip credit to wages of delivery drivers who spent over 20% of their time performing non-tipped duties or performed duties unrelated to their tipped duties. Count III alleges that PJ Iowa's vehicle reimbursement policy resulted in net wages below the minimum wage in violation of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for conditional certification of Counts I and III as an FLSA collective action of PJ Iowa delivery drivers during the applicable limitations period, including Kearns's subcollective of PJ Iowa delivery drivers who used their personal vehicles for deliveries. Plaintiffs also seek class certification of the IMWL and the IWPCL claims-Count II-under Rule 23, as to the class of PJ Iowa delivery drivers during the applicable limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dual Jobs Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Counts I and II are based on the same alleged circumstances, which are contemplated by the Department of Labor regulations on \"dual jobs.\" Typically, dual jobs regulations are at issue when an employee has two occupations with an employer, one requiring the performance of tipped duties and the other requiring performance\n   of non-tipped duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"[F]or example, where a maintenance man in a hotel also serves as a waiter.\").

This flexibility is limited by a twenty-percent rule.

Counts I and II are both claims relating to dual jobs in this sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PJ Iowa's delivery drivers spend most of their time delivering pizzas to customers. This is a tipped occupation, for which PJ Iowa pays cash wages below the minimum wage and applies a tip credit. Delivery drivers are generally \"responsible for delivering customers' orders to the customers' specified delivery locations.\" Donaldson Decl. \u00b6 3 - Ex. 1 to Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 55-1. PJ Iowa also employs general managers, assistant managers, and restaurant team employees, all of whom spend their working hours inside restaurant locations. Restaurant team employees are paid at least the minimum wage, are not tipped, and are without need for a tip credit. Each restaurant location uses a list of cleaning and miscellaneous tasks, which must be completed regularly. Local managers assign these tasks. Tasks can be assigned to delivery drivers when drivers are at the store between deliveries. Management tracks employee time spent delivering (\"road hours\") and in the store (\"store hours\") through daily reports. The daily reports do not track the specific tasks completed during store hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, prior to May 29, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   PJ Iowa required drivers to engage in a substantial amount of non-tipped duties while paying them as if they were being tipped. Plaintiffs allege that this practice resulted in delivery drivers failing\n   to receive the minimum wage, in violation of (1) the twenty-percent rule, and (2) the rule against applying a tip credit to work not incidental to the regularly tipped occupation. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that delivery drivers spent over 20% of their \"working time engaged in non-tipped labor and/or performing duties not incidental to their tipped occupation,\" including \"folding pizza boxes, washing dishes, sweeping, mopping, scrubbing the freezer, working at the cut station, working at the preparation station, answering telephone calls, cleaning bathrooms, washing walls, ... and general maintenance,\" which should have been compensated by at least the minimum wage. First Am. Compl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Vehicle Reimbursement Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PJ Iowa's delivery drivers use their own cars to deliver pizza to customers. In doing so, they incur various expenses, most regularly for fuel. Drivers must also ensure that vehicles are kept in satisfactory condition. PJ Iowa reimburses drivers at the rate of 5% of net sales per each delivery. Kearns argues that this reimbursement formula results in drivers' wages falling below the minimum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this calculation does not reflect actual mileage, and because drivers are paid less than, or close to, minimum wage, Kearns argues that the reimbursement is inadequate and results in a wage under the minimum required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, Plaintiffs' request typifies those made by named representatives for conditional certification of a collective action: They provide evidence of their own situation, provide evidence to support their belief that they are similarly situated to others, and then ask the Court to extrapolate.

PJ Iowa's request for potential defense cost liability language is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   PJ Iowa's third objection is that the Consent Form automatically designates counsel. PJ Iowa argues that the consent form should either allow plaintiffs to designate their own counsel, or include no counsel designation. The proposed Notice informs recipients they \"are free to hire an attorney of your choosing, but you may have to pay that lawyer, and you will have to file your own separate lawsuit.\" Proposed Collective Action Lawsuit Notice 3, Pls.' App. 89, ECF No. 44. Potential plaintiffs will receive the Consent Form together with the Notice, and therefore, the Court finds that the language of the Notice is sufficient to inform potential plaintiffs of their right to hire separate counsel. This Court previously authorized collective action consent forms and notices with similar language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 36 to Mot. To Cert.

This Court sees no reason to alter the standard practice of instructing potential plaintiffs to send their consent forms to Plaintiffs' counsel. PJ Iowa cites cases from district courts in New York, which have directed class members to send consent forms to the applicable Clerk of Court. There is currently no such practice in Iowa, and this Court will not attempt to create it here. Plaintiffs' chosen counsel will be charged with filing Consent Forms submitted to them with the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Concerning the timing of the notice process, PJ Iowa requests that this Court set an opt-in period of 45 days.
