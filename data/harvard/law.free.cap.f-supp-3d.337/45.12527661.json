Both arguments fail.\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n      Defendant has, at various points in this case, elected to represent himself. He is an able advocate for his cause. Nonetheless, the court appointed standby counsel, Mr. Thomas Butters, who tried the case to the jury and has taken the lead on the post-verdict matters, aside from this motion for a new trial. Mr. Butters has performed admirably, protecting defendant's interests at every turn and ensuring that the mistakes described in this opinion found the light of day. The court thanks Mr. Butters for his exceptional service.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Regarding his first argument, petitioner fails to allege any facts supporting abandonment by Attorney Butters or a denial of the right to a speedy trial. Moreover, based upon the court's familiarity with these proceedings and a review of the docket, petitioner's claims are simply untrue. Petitioner was retried within the 70-day time limit imposed by the Speedy Trial Act, and Attorney Butters represented him at that trial and post-trial proceedings. This contention is without merit.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      Regarding petitioner's second argument, as stated above, there is no basis for concluding that Attorney Butters' representation failed to meet the constitutional standard. Moreover, even if petitioner were able establish that counsel performed \"below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" the ineffective assistance claim would still fail because petitioner cannot show prejudice.\n      <em>\n       Strickland\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n       466 U.S. at 688, 694\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n       104 S.Ct. 2052\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      All the alleged deficiencies relate to the\n      <em>\n       Brady\n      </em>\n      issue, including that (1) \"counsel failed to explore the fact that the chemist was called and told to alter evidence\"; and (2) \"counsel failed to enter the [first] drug cert[ificate] in evidence or erred by not objecting when Judge answered the Jury's question about the second cert[ificate] saying it wasn't in evidence.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket # 341 at 5. Contrary to petitioner's assertions, it was counsel who on cross-examination of the chemist unearthed the erroneous date on the certificate. Moreover, neither of these alleged errors prejudiced petitioner. Rather, as both this court and the First Circuit determined, the information or evidence withheld by the government was not material. Docket # 275 at 19-20 (\"no reasonable jury could have doubted that the sample delivered to [the chemist] was the same one\" involved in petitioner's offenses);\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Spencer\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263353\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1/#p17\">\n       873 F.3d 1\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 11 (affirming ruling and noting that \"the undisclosed evidence does not suffice to cast doubt on whether [the chemist], due to her alleged sloppiness or her ties to the prosecution, tested the wrong sample.\"). Since any failure by Attorney Butters to further explore these issues at trial could not have changed the ultimate result of petitioner's conviction, the ineffective assistance argument fails.\n      <em>\n       Cf.\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       United States v.
