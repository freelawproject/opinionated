The plain language of the statute allows Commerce to select the highest rate, but only after Commerce examines the circumstances that led to the application of AFA. In other words, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(d)(2) clearly requires Commerce to conduct a fact-specific inquiry and to provide its reasons for selecting the highest rate out of all potential countervailable subsidy rates in a particular case. It is axiomatic that Commerce must explain the basis for its decisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NMB Singapore Ltd. v.

Electricity is one of the primary inputs used in the production of hot-rolled steel. The Government of Korea acts as a producer and distributor of electricity in POSCO's home market and is responsible for setting the nation's electricity rates through KEPCO, its state-owned and state-controlled electricity provider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim.

This cost includes the operational cost for generating and supplying electricity to the consumers as well as taxes. The cost for each electricity classification was calculated by (1) distributing the overall cost according to the stages of providing electricity (generation, transmission, distribution, and sales); (2) dividing each cost into fixed cost, variable cost, and the consumer management fee; and (3) then calculating the cost by applying the electricity load level, peak level, and the patterns of consuming electricity. Each cost was then distributed into the fixed charge and the variable charge. KEPCO then divided each cost taking into consideration the electricity load level, the usage pattern of electricity, and the volume of the electricity consumed.
