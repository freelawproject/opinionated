The Department finds that these emails indicate a sales process devoid of normal price negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Additionally, Commerce finds the lack of Jianlong USA's sales expenses particularly troubling \"because the sale under review, allegedly made by Jianlong USA, was reported as a constructed export price (CEP) sale,\" the calculation of which requires the examination of the expenses involved in a typical transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The expenses reported did not include those required to \"identify or communicate with potential customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Collectively, this, the Department finds, \"is not representative of Jianlong/Jianlong USA's normal business practices, which is one factor that supports a finding that the NSR sales transaction is not\n   <em>\n    bona fide.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For its part, Jianlong contests Commerce's findings, stating that \"the record evidence contradicts these conclusions.\" Pl.'s Comments at 5. With regard to price negotiations, Jianlong points out that there was a line of communication that: 1) altered the price from the invoice to the purchase order and 2) resulted in technical specifications and certain modifications to the order. This, Jianlong argues, demonstrates that \"Jianlong USA clearly acted on its customer's behalf to provide superior services for its U.S. customer,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   6, while \"Jianlong participated in many aspects of the sale to ensure clear communication ... and to ensure that there was an enhanced meeting of the minds regarding all terms of sales and other aspects of the NSR transaction,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Jianlong also argues that Commerce failed to consider that its \"normal office expenses,\" including those expenses for \"salaries and office equipment,\" may in fact cover the sales expenses the Department found to be lacking from the record-particularly those associated with communicating with potential customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, the court finds that whether or not a newly formed business has followed its normal sales process is a reasonable factor for Commerce's consideration under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(iv)(VII). As part of its\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis, Commerce may consider \"any other factor [it] determines to be relevant as to whether such sales are, or are not, likely to be typical of those the exporter or producer will make after completion of the review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(iv)(VII). Clearly, where the circumstances indicate that the establishment of a U.S. entity is indicative of an atypical transaction, it is within Commerce's discretion to consider that factor as a part of its totality of the circumstances analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To support its\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide\n   </em>\n   finding, the Department cites a mismatch between the\n   reported process and that which Jianlong followed in executing this transaction. Where there is but a single sale reported in the POR, Commerce obviously does not have the benefit of comparing the transaction in question to other transactions the new shipper has undertaken; as a result, the best evidence upon which the Department can rely may very well be the normal sales process reported by the new shipper. Certainly, a failure to follow a firm's own reported sales process may indicate that the sale in question is atypical. Here, the evidence in the record supports the view that the mismatch suggests that Jianlong's sale to [ [ ] ] was non-\n   <em>\n    bona fide.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As Jianlong reported that \"Jianlong USA negotiates directly with the unaffiliated customers,\" Section A Resp. at A-5, a genuine price negotiation is highly probative of whether the sale in question is, or is not, \"likely to be typical\" of sales Jianlong will make in the future. Here, the absence of \"independent price negotiations,\" Section A Resp. at A-5, proves fatal to Jianlong's claim that the sale to [ [ ] ] followed its normal sales process. Surely, a genuine negotiation typically includes some combination of modifications related to price, quantity, or means of delivery. Indeed, Jianlong claims that it has proven Jianlong USA's involvement in \"determining and confirming the unit price\" and addressing certain \"technical specifications.\" Pl.'s Comments at 5. However, Commerce reasonably determined that the terms of the sale had \"already been established,\" Final Remand Results at 39, and that Jianlong USA's role did not reflect the typical sales process reported by Jianlong,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   What's more, Commerce cites a lack of evidence to show that Jianlong USA engaged in one of its most crucial roles, identifying potential customers. Final Remand Results at 40-41 (citing Section A Resp. at A-17). Rather, Commerce found that the customer, [ [ ] ], had already been identified through personal contacts and that Jianlong,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   Jianlong USA, had engaged in a prolonged period of relationship-building prior to the sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 16-17, 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Jianlong attempts to demonstrate Jianlong USA's participation in customer identification activities through reported expenses, Pl.'s Comments at 5-6, Commerce found no support for that explanation in the record. Final Remand Results at 40. No other evidence exists on the record to show that Jianlong USA engaged in customer identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Resultantly, Commerce finds no evidence in the record demonstrating that Jianlong USA engaged in either of its two primary functions: price negotiations and customer identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, substantial evidence supports the notion that Jianlong did not follow its typical sales process by establishing Jianlong USA to conduct the sale and this factor calls into question the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   nature of transaction as a whole. In the absence of evidence that Jianlong USA undertook its reported responsibilities during the transaction in question, Commerce was left with no choice but to conclude that the sales process was not reflective of sales Jianlong is likely to engage in in the future. As a result, the court sustains Commerce's findings related to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Timing of Sale\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Likewise, Commerce supported with substantial evidence its determination that the timing of Jianlong's sole transaction suggested that the sale was\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide.\n   </em>\n   The Department reasonably concluded that the timing of the sale \"called into question whether the sale was made and timed specifically to obtain an NSR rate.\" Final Remand Results at 16. As such, the court sustains Commerce's findings as to this particular element of the Department's\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Commerce viewed the timing of the sale significant because it signaled that the \"focus was on making a U.S. sale of subject merchandise during the POR to obtain a NSR.\" Final Remand Results at 46-47. This, Commerce viewed, was supported by the following circumstances: \"(1) a sales process executed within 4 days at the end of the POR, even though Jianlong was in contact with the U.S. customer [ ] a year and a half earlier; (2) [ [ ] ]; (3) [ [ ] ]; and, (4) [ [ ] ] instruction to Jianlong USA [ [ ] ].\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, Jianlong contends that the fact that no sample was provided before shipment is of no moment (because samples had already been provided), that there is no record evidence to support the conclusion that rushing to make shipment is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   typical, and that \"there is no evidence ... that shipment of the merchandise\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   was expedited\" because the shipment was made by \"normal sea freight\" and not some other expedited means.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   By its terms,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(iv)(III) enables Commerce to consider the timing of a sale in its totality of the circumstances analysis. That consideration enjoys its due weight and the Department may consider when the sale was made both in relation to other sales and the timing relative to the POR itself. The timing of a single sale may give the Department pause as it may indicate that the sale was made in an expedited manner so as to complete the transaction within a given POR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Jianlong asserts that the Department's findings in this space are lacking in that they rely on the sort of \"suspicion and innuendo\" the court had previously found deficient.

Specifically, Jianlong argues that Commerce relies on no evidence to conclude that \"there was no communication between the parties over 450 days\" and that the parties \"rushed to complete the sale ... in 37 days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. (citing Final Remand Results at 17). Jianlong contends that Commerce disregarded \"the long history and relationship between Jianlong and its U.S. customer\" and that \"[i]t is not reasonable ... for Commerce to consider a year-and-a-half long process to be a 'rush to complete a sale.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Regardless, the Department's finding that the timing of the sale is suggestive of a non-\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   sale is reasonable and, therefore, sustained by the court. Certainly, that \"the xanthan gum was shipped [ [ ] ] days prior to, and invoiced [ [ ] ] days prior to, the end of the POR,\" Final Remand Results at 42, is a relevant consideration. That timing becomes questionable when combined with the following: 1) there were interactions between the firms at least a year and a half prior to the reported sale; 2) there was no evidence in the record that Jianlong and [ [ ] ] had any communication for 450 days before the sale; and 3) the communications that ensued\n   between [ [ ] ] and Jianlong USA spanned over only four days, during which time Jianlong represents that Jianlong USA negotiated and completed a sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. That narrative has left Commerce to consider an initial relationship, a period of silence, and then a quickly executed sale near the end of the POR. Under such circumstances, it is reasonable for Commerce to conclude that the sale in question was timed specifically to obtain an NSR and, therefore, atypical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Further, Commerce considered several other reviews in which the timing of a sale similarly suggested that a given NSR transaction was\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide.\n   </em>\n   Final Remand Results at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Certain Preserved Mushrooms from the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%201%2C317\">\n    82 Fed.

Commerce thus has demonstrated its consistent, reasonable practice such that the court declines to overturn its reasoned determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the court sustains Commerce's findings as to the timing of Jianlong's sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Sales Price\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Next, Commerce has marched through a methodology for comparing Jianlong's transaction to Fufeng's sales, but has failed to support with substantial evidence the selection of the input sales. As the sales price is, most often, the most important factor in the Department's\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis, the need for substantial evidence supporting any determination in this area is of paramount importance to the court's consideration. The analysis provided to this point remains unsatisfactory to the court. Without substantial evidence supporting Commerce's selection of input sales, the court cannot sustain the Department's conclusions. As a result, the proceedings are remanded for further consideration in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At the outset of the proceedings, Commerce placed on the record certain sales from Fufeng for comparison against Jianlong's one sale; ultimately, that comparison produced results indicating to Commerce that the sales price was atypical and, thus, another factor showing that this was a\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide\n   </em>\n   sale. Having provided a reasonable rubric for the comparison of Jianlong's NSR transaction with similar Fufeng sales, Commerce's methodology is sustained. However, Commerce has left the record bereft of any meaningful indication of how the Fufeng subset was selected. The court, therefore, remands to Commerce\n   1) for additional consideration of the input sales placed on the record that takes the entire Fufeng AR2 dataset into account and 2) to engage in the same price comparison methodology, if appropriate, using any new sales information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In general, Commerce compared Jianlong's sales against the input sales, concluding that Jianlong's U.S. sales price was high and, therefore, indicative of a\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide\n   </em>\n   sale. Commerce's methodology \"reduced Jianlong USA's sales price for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   appropriate transportation expenses, customs duties, taxes, and U.S. direct and indirect selling expenses,\" Final Remand Results at 48-49; declined to make adjustments for customer types, instead following its practice to use \"control numbers (CONNUMs) for product matching purposes that reflect the physical characteristics of the merchandise,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C147\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C147\">\n    at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and followed its practice of not adjusting \"for cash deposit rates when calculating net prices in its price comparisons,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C147\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C147\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Where there is substantial variability between product characteristics, it is reasonable for Commerce to choose a comparison product and evaluate the price at which that comparison product was sold.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huzhou Muyun Wood Co. v.

Accordingly, pursuant to this opinion, on remand Commerce must: 1) articulate its selection of the Fufeng subset with reference to the entire Fufeng AR2 dataset, 2) engage in a proper sales comparison, and 3) make an ultimate finding as to the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   nature of the transaction at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    1. Input Sales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court agrees that sales of the same grade of xanthan gum are the relevant sales for Commerce's price comparison, but finds insufficient evidence on the record to verify the Department's representation that it extracted all relevant sales from the complete Fufeng AR2 dataset. Commerce cites to no methodology for its selection of the Fufeng subset upon which it relies in its price comparison, but rather merely asserts that the Department has placed the complete relevant subset of Fufeng sales on the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at cmt. 2 (stating Commerce \"believe[d] [it] ha[d] the complete relevant sales data from AR2 on the record\" because it placed on the record only \"the reported sales of xanthan gum of the same grade as the grade of xanthan gum sold by [Jianlong].\"); Final Remand Results at 51 (\"The complete relevant subset of Fufeng's AR2 sales data, which were extracted from Fufeng's full U.S. sales database and used in the comparison, is on the record.\"). Without a more developed record, articulating the methodology used for identifying input sales with reference to the entire Fufeng AR2 dataset, the court cannot sustain on the grounds invoked by the Department, namely that it has placed on the record the relevant input sales and reliance on the Fufeng subset was reasonable. Because this process falls short of the substantial evidence threshold required for\n   the court to sustain, the proceedings are remanded to Commerce for further consideration of the sales price and how that further analysis impacts the Department's ultimate\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   While it is true that this court typically does not \"upset Commerce's reasonable choice\" of sales data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huzhou Muyun I\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 1228 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v.

While Commerce claims that it has \"compared the price of Jianlong's NSR sales transaction to the average export price and maximum export price of the same type of xanthan gum sold by Fufeng,\" Final Remand Results at 20, the Department provides no explanation of how it initially determined which of Fufeng's reported sales belonged in the subset of input sales. When Commerce placed the Fufeng subset on the record, it merely described its methodology as follows: \"We compared the quantity and unit price of the sale under review to the quantities and unit prices of sales of similar subject merchandise, with similar sales terms, reported by the mandatory respondents in [AR2] in this proceeding, which covers the same period as this NSR.\" Prelim.\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Sales Analysis 4, ECF No. 50, Confidential J.A.

Because the court is unable to gauge the reliability of the input sales, the Department's omission amounts to a failure to \"articulate any rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    371 U.S. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    83 S.Ct. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fufeng subset does not, on its own, contain the requisite indicators of reliability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Sales Analysis at attach. III. Commerce's assurances that it \"believes\" it has placed all \"relevant\" sales on the record likewise provide little comfort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As such, the court cannot sustain Commerce's finding that the sales price is indicative of an atypical sale. Without substantial evidence supporting the Department's view, this factor does not support Commerce's\n   <em>\n    non-bona fide\n   </em>\n   finding. Accordingly, the court remands this portion of the proceedings to Commerce for a further sales price analysis that indicates the methodology employed by Commerce for selecting the input sales. Commerce is to conduct this assessment with reference to the complete Fufeng AR2 dataset. Once that final piece of the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis is complete, the Department should be able to resolve the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   sales inquiry informed both by reference to the factors sustained here, as well as a sales price determination (hopefully) supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    2. Methodology\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Notwithstanding the deficiencies in Commerce's selection of input sales, the court sustains the Department's methodology for comparing sales-if not the result-employed by the Department. Following additional consideration of the complete Fufeng AR2 dataset, if appropriate, Commerce should utilize the same methodology, along with a reasoned decision explaining its selection of input sales-and possibly a new subset of input sales, depending on the results of Commerce's price determination-in the remand proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Commerce's methodology compared sales of the same grade of xanthan gum-[ [ ] ] xanthan gum-with the same terms of sale. Commerce began by narrowing the Fufeng dataset to only [ [ ] ] xanthan gum sales. Prelim. Sales Analysis at attach. III. By \"limiting [its] comparison to similar products,\" Commerce appropriately limited\n   the scope of Fufeng's sales that it would consider. Final Remand Results at 51. Then, Commerce \"reduced Jianlong USA's sales price for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   appropriate transportation expenses, customs duties, taxes, and U.S. direct and indirect selling expenses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49. This second step enabled Commerce to either \"compare[ ] prices of sales with the same terms [ [ ] ], after making adjustments, or ma[ke] conservative comparisons with Fufeng's [ [ ] ] sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The result of Commerce's methodology produced a comparison showing that Jianlong's sale price of [ [ ] ] was high when compared to Fufeng's average of [ [ ] ], Prelim. Sales Analysis at attach. II-that is, \"[ [ ] ] than the average price of the same grade of xanthan gum sold by Fufeng during the POR,\" Final Remand Results at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, Commerce's view that \"differences in timing, sales terms, customer type, and dumping duties\" are not to be included in the comparison is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Remand Results at 47-48. With respect to the selection of the input sales, \"Commerce placed on the record data from AR2 for all the reported sales by Fufeng of xanthan gum that matched the grade of xanthan gum sold by Jianlong,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51, and compared only Fufeng's sales of the particular grade of xanthan gum which Jianlong sold to [ [ ] ]. As to the timing of the sales, Commerce reviewed a substantial number of Fufeng transactions from the same period, [ [ ] ], and the average gross unit sales price of Fufeng's sales were similar across different time periods, [ [ ] ].\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. That indicated to Commerce that the timing of Fufeng's sales across the POR remained stable. Commerce also explained that its methodology is to \"use[ ] control numbers (CONNUMs) for product matching purposes that reflect the physical characteristics of the merchandise, not differences in customer type,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49, and Jianlong has failed to raise a significant reason to depart from this practice. Last, Commerce dismissed \"Jianlong's claim that Commerce should adjust for dumping cash deposit rates\" by explaining that the Department has a \"longstanding practice [ ] not to adjust for cash deposit rates when calculating net prices in its price comparisons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In each instance detailed above, Commerce either articulated a specific reason why departing from its regular practice was not appropriate or supported its choice with substantial evidence. For considerations of customer type and dumping cash deposit rates, Commerce followed its respective practices in these spaces. As those practices reflect a reasonable interpretation of the Department's duties, the court finds the agency's reasonable interpretations to be in accordance with law. As to the issues of timing and sales terms, the Department supported its given approaches with convincing rationales and reasonable adjustments. Accordingly, the court sustains those determinations as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   All in all, Commerce's methodology itself was reasonable. Commerce reasonably explained its methodology and the reasons that it did not undertake to make the adjustments Jianlong sought. However, as explained above, the court cannot now say that this process resulted in a reasonable comparison. Accordingly, the court remands\n   for further consideration of the sales price of the [ [ ] ] transaction and comparison to Fufeng's relevant sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. Other Factors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although the court remanded to conduct a totality of the circumstances analysis \"sufficiently supported by substantial evidence, explaining how the establishment of Jianlong USA, the timing of the sale, and the sales price support a finding that the transaction in question was, or was not,\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Jianlong I\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 1342, Commerce furthered its analysis by considering additional factors beyond those three referred to in the court's remand order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Final Remand Results at 22 (commercial quantities);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (expenses arising from the sale). The totality of the circumstances test is a flexible one, allowing the Department to prioritize certain factors depending on the context, but it at least requires that Commerce consider as many factors as are relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Jianlong now challenges a new, additional factor considered by Commerce: \"that [ [ ] ] ... did not purchase xanthan gum after the sale in question ....\" Final Remand Results at 23.

As part of that price comparison, the Department placed new information on the record as to sales reported by mandatory respondents in AR2, including Fufeng.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519514\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/1524/#p1529\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Deadline for Submission of Comments on New Factual Information, ECF No. 50, Confidential J.A.

Jianlong challenged Commerce's sales price finding, arguing that the Department should take a more holistic view of the sales price comparison and should place on the record \"the full sales data reported by the mandatory respondents.\" Jianlong's Resp. to CP Kelco's Request to Reject Jianlong's Submission 2, ECF No. 50, Confidential J.A. Tab 12, P.R. 141 (Apr. 4, 2016) (\"Jianlong's Resp. to Request to Reject Submission\"). Doing so, Jianlong argued, would clarify the input sales and allow that sales data to serve as a reliable means of comparison.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519514\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/1524/#p1529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce itself described Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 as \"contain[ing] the full U.S. sales databases and responses to Section C of the Department's questionnaire of the mandatory respondents in AR2 and the Section A supplemental questionnaire response of one of the mandatory respondents in AR2,\" but nevertheless rejected Jianlong's submission as a mere confirmation of the information the Department had already placed on the record.

Final Remand Results at 54. The Department rebukes Jianlong's alleged failure to \"explicitly state[ ] that there were errors that needed to be corrected,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519514\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/1524/#p1529\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Commerce has missed the forest for the trees. In painting Jianlong's submission as one aimed at \"confirm[ing] the accuracy of the subset of sales from AR2 which Commerce placed on the record,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, the Department overlooks how Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 may clarify the nature of the input sales. Moreover, Commerce appears to demand that Jianlong meet the artificial burden of \"assert[ing] that there were errors in the data Commerce used.\" Def.'s Comments at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Department has seemingly ignored-yet again-Jianlong's stated purpose\n   for submitting Exhibits 1, 2, and 3: \"the Department's claim that it compared [Jianlong's] sale under review to sales of similar subject merchandise, with similar sales terms, cannot be relied upon unless the full sales data reported by the mandatory respondents (and a complete description and examination of those data) are available for comparison.\" Jianlong's Resp. to Request to Reject Submission at 2-3. Jianlong asked\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that the entire Fufeng dataset be accepted so that the parties could confirm what was already known, but so that the information could clarify at least the means by which the Department selected the information on which it relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Department's explicit justification for rejecting Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 relies on its view that those documents can only serve to confirm that which is already on the record. Given the circumstances, that is clearly unreasonable and is an abuse of discretion. The full Fufeng AR 2 dataset would certainly serve to clarify which of those sales Commerce selected as input sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Further, Commerce's determination implicitly rejected the notion that the entire dataset cannot clarify its selected subset. On its face, such a reading of the regulation's use of the word \"clarify\" is unreasonable. The regulation is designed to ensure that the Department \"obtain the information it needs in its antidumping investigations,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guangzhou Maria Yee Furnishings, Ltd. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20CIT%201470\">\n    29 CIT 1470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1475,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1001870,9011247\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/412/1301/\">\n    412 F.Supp.2d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1306 (2005), and that information certainly can include that from which input data is derived. The regulation does not free Commerce from its duty to support its determinations with substantial evidence nor does it grant the Department carte blanche to reject information simply because the data on the record is not explicitly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In a situation such as this, where the Department has left the record bereft of its reasoning and supplementing the record may elucidate Commerce's rationale, rejecting such documentation may be an abuse of discretion. That is the precise situation the court now faces. Accordingly, the Department's decision to reject Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 due to their failure to clarify reflects an abuse of discretion and the court remands for the purposes of verifying that the proper subset was chosen from among the complete Fufeng sales dataset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The court recommends that Commerce reopen the record on remand and accept Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 as clarifying information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thai Plastic Bags Indus.

Such a step seems to be the most straightforward-and quite possibly the best-way to support the selection of input sales with substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In any event, the court remands the case to Commerce with directions to articulate its methodology for choosing the Fufeng subset, with reference to the entire Fufeng AR2 dataset. With that information in tow, the court will be properly situated to assess the reasonableness of Commerce's findings with regard to sales price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court remands on a limited basis: with reference to the complete Fufeng AR2 dataset, Commerce shall articulate a reasonable method, supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law, for selecting the\n   input sales for the purposes of its sales price analysis. As part of that determination, the court recommends that Commerce reopen the record and accept Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 as a means of clarifying the Fufeng subset.

However, this characterization misses the mark. Commerce considered Jianlong's stated reasons, but dismissed them as improbable, concluding in the alternative that even if that were true, \"the facts show that Jianlong and Jianlong USA did not follow their typical sales process, as reported to Commerce.\" Final Remand Results at 15. Rather than take Jianlong's word for it, Commerce diligently reviewed the record and uncovered evidence that countered Jianlong's proffered narrative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13-15, 16-18, 23.

Critically lacking from this argument, though, is a satisfactory explanation as to how customer\n    <em>\n     identification\n    </em>\n    may be folded into those costs. As such, notwithstanding these asserted communication expenses, Jianlong cannot overcome the dearth of evidence to demonstrate that Jianlong USA engaged in its other critical functions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Jianlong claims that Commerce has a practice dictating that \"the date of factory shipment is the appropriate date of sale for constructed export price sales, which are sold back-to-back through U.S. affiliates, if the shipment date precedes the date of invoice.\" Pl.'s Comments at 8-9. As a result, Jianlong believes that \"the actual date of sale took place almost a month before the end of the POR when the merchandise first was shipped from China.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10.
