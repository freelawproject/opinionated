In addition, this cause is before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 72), to which Defendants filed a Response (Doc. 78), Plaintiff filed a Reply (Doc. 82), and Defendants filed a Sur-reply (Doc. 92). Lastly, before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion in Limine (Doc. 94) and Defendants' Response (Doc. 98).

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a declaratory judgment action brought by Plaintiff, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, against its insured, Rosen Millennium, Inc. (\"Millennium\"), and Rosen Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. (\"RHR\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff does not have a duty to defend Millennium against a claim made by RHR. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., Doc. 32). Plaintiff issued Millennium two consecutive commercial general liability insurance policies (the \"CGL Policies\"), which were in effect during the relevant time period. (2014 Insurance Policy, Doc. 32-1, at 10; 2015 Insurance Policy, Doc. 32-2, at 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CGL Policies require Plaintiff to defend Millennium against claims of bodily injury or property damage to which the insurance applies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32-1, at 78-79; Doc. 32-2, at 78-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Millennium provided data security services for RHR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Santos Dep., Doc. 68-1, at 21:22-24). In February 2016, RHR became aware of a potential credit card breach at one of their hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:7-17). Soon after, RHR hired a forensic investigator to determine whether a data breach occurred and, if so, to discover its source. (RHR's Answers to Pl.'s Interrogs., Doc. 72-1, at 8). The forensic investigator found malware installed on the payment network, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ; Flores Dep., Doc. 69-1, at 30:18-31:5), and determined that customers' cards used between September 2014 and February 2016 may have been affected, (Doc. 72-1 at 8; Jan. 11, 2017 E-mail, Doc. 72-2, at 2). On March 4, 2016, RHR disclosed the data breach to potentially\n   affected customers. (RHR Release, Doc. 72-3, at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 29, 2016, Millennium submitted a Notice of Claim, (Doc. 72-10, at 1), to Plaintiff in response to an e-mail Millennium received from RHR, indicating that RHR believed that the data breach was caused by Millennium's negligence and inquiring as to whether Millennium had insurance to cover such a loss, (Dec. 24, 2016 E-mail, Doc. 72-11, at 2). On March 2, 2017, Plaintiff issued a reservation of rights, indicating that there was no coverage for the claim, but inviting Millennium to provide additional information. (Mar. 2, 2017 Letter, Doc. 72-14, at 1, 9-10). Plaintiff did not provide additional information. Later that month, Plaintiff initiated this action, seeking a declaratory judgment as to its duty to defend Millennium against RHR's claim (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., Doc. 1). On June 8, 2018, Plaintiff received a demand letter from Millennium, in which RHR alleged that it was entitled to payment from Millennium as a result of the data breach. (June 5, 2017 Letter, Doc. 72-15, at 2). Although RHR has not filed suit against Millennium, Plaintiff contends that the demand letter from RHR combined with Millennium's Notice of Claim sufficiently creates a case and controversy with regard to Plaintiff's duty to defend Millennium under the CGL Policies. Now, Plaintiff moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants disagree, arguing that the personal injury provisions apply. Defendants also advance two additional theories of coverage under the CGL policies: (1) the customers' loss of the use of their credit cards, and the inevitable replacement of those cards, is covered as \"property damage\"; and (2) the costs incurred by RHR in complying with notification statutes are covered under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, when determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend, the Court must confine its analysis to the allegations in the underlying claim.\n   <em>\n    Lime Tree Vill.

The Notice of Claim is devoid of any substantive information other than the fact that a \"[c]redit card systems breach\" occurred and the relevant dates of the breach. (Doc. 72-10 at 2). The detail set forth in the demand letter is also quite\n   sparse, but it does specifically state that Millennium \"made private information known to third parties that violated a credit card holder's right of privacy.\" (Doc. 72-15 at 2). As noted this language tracks the language in the personal injury provision of the CGL policy. Conversely, the demand letter makes no mention of, let alone a claim for, property damage or the costs incurred from complying with notification statutes. Instead, the Court would be addressing Plaintiff's duty to defend a hypothetical claim. Thus, because Defendants have not made such claims, the issue of whether the CGL Policies would cover those claims is not ripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selective Ins. Co. of Se. v.

According to Defendants, Plaintiff admitted that RHR's claim against Millennium is covered under the policies. Defendants point to language in Plaintiff's June 16, 2017 coverage letter, stating that a \"claim for 'making known ... covered material that violates a person's right to privacy,' could potentially fall within the policy's definition of 'personal injury.' \" (June 16, 2017 Letter, Doc. 32-5, at 9). However, Defendants neglected to include the second half of that same sentence, which provides that \"the June 5, 2017 demand letter provides no facts to support RHR's conclusion that Millennium made known RHR's customers' private information to third parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). No where in the June 16, 2017 coverage letter does Plaintiff admit the existence of coverage. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not admitted that RHR's claim is covered under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff waived its ability to deny coverage because it failed to include the relevant coverage defenses it in its coverage letters. Under Florida law, an insurer \"shall not be permitted to deny coverage based on a particular coverage defense unless ... [w]ithin 30 days after the liability insurer knew or should have known of the coverage defense, written notice of reservation of rights to assert a coverage defense is given to the named insured.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.426\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). The Florida Supreme Court has held that noncompliance with the notice requirements in section 627.426(2) does not preclude an insurer from denying\n   coverage where coverage was excluded under the policy.\n   <em>\n    AIU Ins. Co. v. Block Marina Inv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7561139\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/544/998/#p1000\">\n    544 So.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1000 (Fla. 1989). Stated differently, \" section 627.426 does not create or extend nonexistent coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7439772\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/653/371/#p374\">\n    653 So.2d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374 (Fla. 1995). Here, Plaintiff is not asserting a coverage defense but rather that RHR's claim is not covered under the CGL Policies. Therefore, Plaintiff is not barred from arguing that RHR's claim is excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    2. Contract Interpretation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff asserts that it has no duty to defend Millennium because RHR's claim is not covered under the personal injury provisions of the CGL Policies, which is a matter of contract interpretation. It is undisputed that Florida law governs the interpretation of the CGL Policies. In Florida, \"[s]ummary judgment is appropriate in declaratory judgment actions seeking a declaration of coverage when the insurer's duty, if any, rests solely on the applicability of the insurance policy, the construction and effect of which is a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Northland Cas.
