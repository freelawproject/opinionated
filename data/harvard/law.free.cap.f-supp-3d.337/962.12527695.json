Rule 15.\" Unlike Rule 15(a)'s liberal amendment policy which focuses on the bad faith of the party seeking to interpose an amendment and the prejudice to the opposing party, Rule 16(b)'s \"good cause\" standard primarily considers the diligence of the party seeking the amendment. The district court may modify the pretrial schedule \"if it cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\" Moreover, carelessness is not compatible with a finding of diligence and offers no reason for a grant of relief. Although the existence or degree of prejudice to the party opposing the modification might supply additional reasons to deny a motion, the focus of the inquiry is upon the moving party's reasons for seeking modification.

Plaintiff objects to the portion of the F &amp; R recommending that Plaintiff's motion to amend be denied with respect to Plaintiff's proposed additional claims for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , invasion of privacy, and retaliation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and Oregon law. Plaintiff also objects that Judge Acosta failed to consider Plaintiff's motion under Rules 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff does not object to the F &amp; R's recommendation that Plaintiff's motion be denied with respect to asserting claims against new defendants, adding a second count of age discrimination against Defendant, or adding additional factual allegations supporting a \"cat's paw\" theory of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For those portions of the F &amp; R to which neither party has objected, the Court follows the recommendation of the\n   Advisory Committee and reviews those matters for clear error on the face of the record. No such error is apparent. Accordingly, the Court adopts those portions of the F &amp; R. The Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the portions of the F &amp; R to which Plaintiff objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Rule 16 Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that he was not aware of the underlying facts supporting his invasion of privacy and defamation claims until after he took the deposition of two witnesses, which occurred on May 18 and 23, 2017. Defendant does not dispute this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim, Defendant filed its counterclaim, which is the subject of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, on March 29, 2017. Defendant alleges that Plaintiff breached his employment contract by misappropriating Defendant's confidential information-specifically, Defendant's software code. Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not timely or diligently challenge Defendant's counterclaim because Plaintiff did not move to dismiss Defendant's counterclaim and because Plaintiff knew at least by December 2016, when Plaintiff's counsel sent a letter in response to Defendant's cease-and-desist letter sent to Plaintiff, that Defendant's employee Daniel Barrett had \"forked the code\" from Plaintiff's personal GitHub account. Plaintiff asserts that although Plaintiff knew as of at least December 2016 of that fact, Plaintiff did not have sufficient knowledge as to whether Barrett reviewed the code, informed anyone else at Defendant about Plaintiff's treatment of the code, or sufficient other facts that would support the high bar of plausibly alleging that Defendant's counterclaim is retaliatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff contends that he did not have sufficient information on which to make a Rule 11-compliant claim of retaliation until after completing additional discovery. This discovery included deposing several witness, including Barrett, whose deposition was taken on June 13, 2017. Plaintiff attempted to take Barrett's deposition in May, but Barrett was unavailable due to unexpected paternity leave. On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff obtained additional new information from witness Derek Miller regarding Defendant's use and treatment of purportedly confidential information, which Plaintiff obtained to support Plaintiff's theory that Defendant's counterclaim is retaliatory and not genuine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 16, 2017, three days after Barrett's deposition, Plaintiff's counsel sent an email to Defendant's counsel, providing notice of Plaintiff's intent to file a motion to amend the schedule and file an amended complaint, and requesting conferral. A few days later Defendant's counsel responded, asking to review the proposed amendments. On Friday, June 23, 2017, a \"working draft\" of a second amended complaint was provided to Defendant's counsel that asserted additional claims for retaliation under state law, invasion of privacy, and defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's counsel requested that Defendant's counsel notify Plaintiff's counsel by June 26, 2017, whether there would be any objections to Plaintiff's proposed amendments. Defendant's counsel did not respond. On June 26th, Plaintiff's counsel sent a second draft amended complaint to Defendant's counsel, this one with additional proposed claims against new individual defendants and a retaliation claim against Defendant under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 27, 2017, at depositions, counsel for Plaintiff asked counsel for Defendant whether Defendant would object to the proposed amendments. Counsel for Defendant asked for three more days to decide. On June 30, 2017, counsel for Defendant\n   stated in an email that Defendant would oppose the amendments. Counsel for Plaintiff asked for a further discussion regarding the basis of the opposition. Counsel for Defendant was not available to confer until July 3rd. At that time counsel for Defendant stated that Defendant considered the amendments not to be brought in good faith and to be brought only to complicate the litigation. Plaintiff then filed the pending motion on July 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Considering all of the facts, the Court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause for the delay in bringing his claims for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , invasion of privacy, and retaliation under state and federal law. He diligently pursued discovery related to these claims and then diligently pursued amending his complaint. The fact that Plaintiff did not move to dismiss Defendant's counterclaim, when such a motion would be evaluated considering the allegations in Defendant's answer and counterclaim as true, does not mean that Plaintiff was not diligent in pursuing his retaliation claims. The Court also does not find that the mere fact that Plaintiff knew Barrett \"forked the code\" from Plaintiff's personal GitHub site is sufficient to require Plaintiff to have filed his retaliation claims earlier. As discussed in Section C below, there is a high bar to allege that a counterclaim is retaliatory. Had Plaintiff made such an allegation based solely on the fact that Barrett copied code from Plaintiff's personal site, without any further supporting facts, Plaintiff's allegation may not have overcome that high bar. Accordingly, the requirements of Rule 16 are met and the Court considers the proposed new claims under the requirements of Rule 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiff alleges that this implies that his performance was \"beyond the pale\" despite \"clear warnings and counseling,\" which Plaintiff alleges was false because he did not receive any warnings, counseling about poor performance, or even direction about the identity of his supervisor from whom he could expect critical feedback.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in his specific claim for defamation, that during the all-employee meeting Giannini and Scott announced that Plaintiff was terminated for cause, thereby insinuating that Plaintiff had engaged in egregious misconduct. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant's management advised employees that Plaintiff \"inexplicably rejected opportunities to improve his performance.\" Plaintiff further alleges that these statements were false, they concerned Plaintiff's conduct in his trade or profession, they are defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , and that as a result of these statements Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer lost income, benefits, and out-of-pocket expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in his specific claim for invasion of privacy that Plaintiff had a reasonable expectation that personnel decisions relating to him would not be publicized to his coworkers. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant announced to all employees that Plaintiff had been terminated for cause \"because he had ignored clear coaching that would have given him an opportunity to improve.\" Plaintiff alleges that this conduct would be offensive to a reasonable person, particularly because Plaintiff did not receive any previous discipline or warning regarding job performance. Plaintiff also alleges that the personnel decision publicized by Defendant was founded on false information, that some of the information publicized was false, that Defendant had knowledge or acted recklessly with regard to the falsity of the publicized matter, and that as a result of Defendant's conduct Plaintiff has suffered emotional and mental distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under Oregon law, to establish a claim of defamation, a plaintiff must show that the defendant communicated a defamatory statement about the plaintiff to a third party.\n   <em>\n    Wallulis v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's proposed amendment to add this claim is not futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant summarily contends that allowing the addition of these new claims would be prejudicial because they would require additional discovery, research, analysis, and motion practice. The F &amp; R had concluded that the amendments would be substantially prejudicial because additional discovery would be required because Defendant would likely need to depose more of its own employees who attended the meeting held the week of June 1, 2015. Defendant, however, does not need to\n   <em>\n    depose\n   </em>\n   its own employees, and interviewing one's own employees is not burdensome discovery. Defendant makes no assertion that there are relevant former employees for whom it would have to issue a subpoena and conduct a deposition. Moreover, Plaintiff states that he does not intend to conduct any further depositions, so it does not appear that these claims require much additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if some additional discovery would be required, the case schedule was stayed in August 2017, after Plaintiff filed his motion to amend. The schedule for dispositive motions has not yet been set and it would not be difficult to extend discovery if needed. Thus, Defendant fails to meet its burden of demonstrating\n   <em>\n    undue\n   </em>\n   prejudice, even if some additional discovery is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brinkley v.

Proposed Claims for Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's proposed retaliation claims should not be permitted under Rule 15 because they are unduly delayed, futile, and prejudicial. As discussed in considering the Rule 16 factors, the Court finds that Plaintiff diligently pursued his retaliation claims in the fourteen week after Defendant filed its counterclaim. Accordingly, there was no undue delay. The Court also does not find that allowing these claims would result in undue prejudice to Defendant. Defendant chose to file its counterclaim involving the underlying subject matter and presumably has already engaged in factfinding to ensure that its counterclaim is compliant with Rule 11. Much of the information needed to defend Plaintiff's retaliation claim would be that same information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff's counsel had notified Defendant as early as December 2016 that if Defendant chose to pursue what Plaintiff believed would be a baseless counterclaim relating to misappropriation of Defendant's confidential information, Plaintiff would consider filing a claim for retaliation. Thus, Defendant was on notice of the possibility of this claim during ongoing discovery and witness depositions. Moreover, as discussed above, even some additional discovery is needed, that does not necessarily result in undue prejudice. Under the circumstances of this claim, the Court finds that even if additional discovery is required, it would not result in undue prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Regarding futility, first, the Court agrees with the significant weight of authority holding that a counterclaim filed in ongoing litigation can serve as an adverse action to support a retaliation claim, many of which rely on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

Plaintiff meets the first prong because Plaintiff filed this pending action. The question is whether Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that Defendant's filing of its breach of contract counterclaim constitutes an adverse employment action, as that has been defined discussed above, and whether Plaintiff plausibly alleges the requisite causal connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that on December 5, 2016, one and one-half years after firing Plaintiff, Defendant delivered a cease-and-desist letter to Plaintiff demanding that he remove certain source code that he had written while employed with Defendant from GitHub and threatening to file a breach of contract counterclaim against Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that in this letter Defendant asserted that it had \"only very recently learned\" that Plaintiff had placed this code in a publicly accessible location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he responded to this letter by explaining that he had placed that code on GitHub in conformance with industry standards and the demonstrated practice and procedure at Defendant. Plaintiff also explained that Barrett knew about Plaintiff's placing this code on GitHub while Plaintiff was employed at Defendant, including in March 2015 when Barrett reviewed the code in Plaintiff's\n   GitHub library. Plaintiff was never told to move the code or disciplined for having the code on that site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that on or about May 29, 2015, when Plaintiff was terminated, Barrett \"forked the code\" from Plaintiff's public GitHub repository and moved it to Defendant or Barrett's public GitHub repository. On or about that same day, Garrett informed David Gorman, Defendant's Vice President, Product, about Plaintiff having the code on a public website. Plaintiff alleges that neither Barrett nor Gorman requested at that time that Plaintiff remove the code from his GitHub site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant's counterclaim was filed on March 29, 2017. Plaintiff alleges in his specific retaliation claims for relief that Defendant filed its breach of contract counterclaim with no basis in law or fact and in response to Plaintiff's assertion of his rights under state and federal law. Plaintiff further alleges that Barrett \"knew with certainty facts that precluded a good faith counterclaims [sic] and Mr. Barrett informed [ ] Gorman of these facts.\" Plaintiff also alleges that Gorman caused the counterclaim to be filed despite his knowledge that the counterclaim did not have a basis in law or fact. Plaintiff additionally alleges that Scott caused the counterclaim to be filed either without a good faith investigation that would have revealed the facts known to Gorman and Barrett, or with knowledge of the facts known to Gorman and Barrett. Plaintiff also alleges that Scott's hostility to Plaintiff's claims is further evidenced by the fact that he announced to all of Defendant's employees that Plaintiff's claims were frivolous. Plaintiff alleges that all of this conduct was intentional. Finally, Plaintiff's alleges that as a direct and proximate result of Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff suffered various harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations are more detailed than most of the allegations in the cases recited above in which courts have allowed retaliation claims to be added under Rule 15. Plaintiff's allegations plausibly allege that Defendant's counterclaim is baseless, has no reasonable basis in law and fact and was brought for a retaliatory motive, or was otherwise brought to deter Plaintiff from seeking legal redress, and that the counterclaim would not have been brought but for Plaintiff filing this lawsuit. The Court cannot say at this stage in the proceedings that there is \"no set of facts\" that Plaintiff can prove \"that would constitute a valid and sufficient claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Barahona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275401\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1122/#p1134\">\n    881 F.3d at 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiff plausibly states a claim for retaliation under the FLSA and Oregon law. Thus, Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint would survive a challenge under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and therefore is not futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Findings and Recommendation (ECF 84) is ADOPTED IN PART. The portions to which no party has objected are adopted. The portions to Plaintiff has objected are not adopted and are resolved as set forth in this Opinion and Order.
