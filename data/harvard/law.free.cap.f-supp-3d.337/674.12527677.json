Hinkle asks the court to revise its July 19 dismissal order under the third circumstance, arguing that the court's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   was clear error warranting reconsideration of the court's previous memorandum opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hinkle correctly notes that the Third Circuit later repudiated the deferral-of-payment portion of\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   upon which this court relied.

Hinkle's motion for reconsideration is granted, and the court revises its memorandum opinion and order of July 19, 2016, as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hinkle is a resident of Delbarton, West Virginia. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.) Defendant Safe-Guard Products International, LLC (\"Safe-Guard\"), a Georgia limited liability company doing business in West Virginia, offered Guaranteed Auto Protection (\"GAP\") insurance to vehicle purchasers in West Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 17.) In the event of an accident resulting in the total loss of a vehicle, GAP insurance is alleged by Hinkle to cover any \"gap\" between the purchaser's outstanding balance owed on the vehicle and the amount paid by the purchaser's primary insurer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In July 2006, Hinkle entered into a \"Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement\" for the purchase of a vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) As part of that transaction, Hinkle also purchased GAP insurance from Safe-Guard by signing a \" 'Gap Contract Insurance Policy' or 'Deficiency Waiver Addendum.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The Security Agreement and the Insurance Policy, both of which are referenced in the amended complaint, are attached to Safe-Guard's motion for partial dismissal as Exhibits A and B, respectively. Both documents show that Hinkle paid $495 upfront for the GAP insurance, which was the only payment due to Safe-Guard for the purchase of the policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Partial Dismissal, Exs. A and B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 1, 2011, Hinkle was involved in an automobile accident resulting in the total loss of her vehicle. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12, 29.) At the time, Hinkle's outstanding balance on the vehicle was $11,983.81. After Hinkle's primary insurer paid the vehicle's cash value, Hinkle still owed a \"gap\" of $4,698.81. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) By letter of July 21, 2011, Safe-Guard denied Hinkle's claim under the GAP policy and did not pay the deficiency, stating that Hinkle lacked coverage because of \"inconsistencies in [her] payment history, such as late payments, [that caused] the loan [to be] re-amortized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Mot. Partial Dismissal, Ex. E.) In effect, Safe-Guard asserts that had payments been timely made, the amount owing at the time of the accident would have been around $5 thousand, which is less than the $7 thousand insurance accident recovery, leaving no gap to be covered by the Safe-Guard policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Partial Dismissal, Exs. B, E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hinkle initiated this action on July 20, 2012, in the Circuit Court of Mingo County. In the state court, Safe-Guard sought a writ of prohibition from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to prevent enforcement of an order finding that the GAP policy Safe-Guard sold to Hinkle was insurance.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In the amended complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hinkle claims that Safe-Guard sold GAP insurance without a license in violation of West Virginia Code section 33-3-1. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 46.) Hinkle alleges that this unlawful sale of insurance constituted a violation of various provisions of the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions of article 2 and general consumer protections of article 6. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The operative paragraph of the amended complaint states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   By collecting premiums that [it was] not entitled to recover and selling an insurance product while not licensed to sell such product, Safe-Guard ... violated West Virginia Code \u00a7 46A-2-127 and engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices as set forth in 46A-6-102, -104, and -106.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hinkle seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , compensatory damages, a refund of premiums paid, punitive damages, and statutory penalties pursuant to the WVCCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   WHEREFORE Clause.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After Hinkle moved to amend her complaint to add class allegations, Safe-Guard removed the action to this court on October 9, 2015, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201453\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Not. Removal \u00b6 19.) On November 23, 2015, Safe-Guard filed a motion for partial dismissal, arguing that its alleged conduct falls outside the protections of the WVCCPA as a matter of law. (Mot.

Safe-Guard references West Virginia Code section 46A-1-105(a)(2), which provides that the WVCCPA \"does not apply to ... [t]he sale of insurance by an insurer, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\" (ECF # 13 at 11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Safe-Guard also contends that Hinkle's WVCCPA claims are preempted by West Virginia's insurance laws.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF # 29 at 4-8.) First, Hinkle argues that the unlicensed sale of insurance is covered by the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Second, Hinkle insists that the statute's general consumer protections apply to insurance sales. (ECF # 29 7-8.)

In particular, Hinkle alleges that Safe-Guard violated West Virginia Code section 46A-2-127, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which provides that \"[n]o debt collector shall use any fraudulent, deceptive or misleading representation or means to collect or attempt to collect claims or to obtain information concerning consumers.\" W.

Thus, reading the above definitions together, the inquiry becomes whether Safe-Guard engaged in \"debt collection\" when it sold GAP insurance to Hinkle, that is, whether Safe-Guard collected a \"claim\" from a \"consumer.\" Because a \"claim\" must be \"of a consumer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578923\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/194/770/#p777\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578923\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/194/770/#p777\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the inquiry collapses into the following issue: whether Safe-Guard's sale of GAP insurance involved or gave rise to a \"claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A \"claim\" is, in turn, essentially defined as an \"obligation\" to pay a \"debt\" \"arising out of\" a \"transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of those terms is statutorily defined. The Supreme Court of Appeals holds that \"[e]ach word of a statute should be given some effect and a statute must be construed in accordance with the import of its language. Undefined words and terms used in a legislative enactment will be given their common, ordinary and accepted meaning.\" Syl. Pt. 4,\n   <em>\n    Osborne v.

The sale was a point of sale or point of purchase exchange, meaning\n   Hinkle paid a one-time, upfront payment in exchange for the GAP insurance. No other payment was required. A simultaneous exchange of this character does not invoke an impression of debt collection in the normal sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nevertheless, Hinkle argues that a \"claim\" encompasses a point of sale exchange. Hinkle offers the following example to illustrate her position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Suppose, for argument's sake, a person makes a point of sale purchase at any every day retailer. After the sales person rings up the purchase, she \"solicit[s]\" a \"claim\" by telling the consumer what amount is \"due,\" and the consumer pays for the purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (ECF # 64 at 2.) Yet, in this illustration, no debt is created. If the consumer decides at the point of sale not to make the purchase and leaves the goods on the counter, no debt is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Hinkle nonetheless looks for support in the debt collection provisions' repeated used of the word \"any,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46A-2-122, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals \"that the word 'any,' when used in a statute, should be construed to mean, in a word, any.\" (ECF # 59 at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Instead, Safe-Guard insists that \"a natural reading of the statute would require [Hinkle] to owe a debt to Safe-Guard and be 'obligated' to pay it as a prerequisite to\" debt collection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Because there is no amount outstanding or owed after a point of sale exchange, Safe-Guard contends that no \"debt\" existed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   7-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   ECF # 13 at 13-14; ECF # 32 at 7; ECF # 61 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To begin, the court returns to the fundamental definition of \"claim\" under the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions: an \"obligation\" to pay a \"debt\" \"arising out of\" a \"transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46A-2-122(a), (b). In legal parlance, a \"debt\" - the term of most import here in parsing a debt collection statute - is a \"[l]iability on a claim; a specific sum of money due by agreement or otherwise.\" Debt,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). The ordinary meaning of \"debt\" is \"something owed; obligation,\" or \"a state of being under obligation to pay or repay someone or something in return for something\n   received; a state of owing.\" Debt,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   , https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/debt. These definitions indicate that the plain meaning of \"debt\" contemplates money due another as a result of a prior agreement or exchange. Thus, payment in a point of sale exchange, as is the case here, is not a \"debt\" or a \"claim\" inasmuch as payment is simply required to complete the exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The remaining three terms support that conclusion. \"Obligation\" is vaguely defined and generally means a duty to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ; Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   .

It may refer to anything that a person is bound to do or forbear from doing.\" Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   . \"Transaction\" and \"arise,\" however, provide more clarity. \"Transaction\" is defined as \"[t]he act or an instance of conducting business or other dealings; esp[ecially], the formation, performance, or discharge of a contract.\" Transaction,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Transaction,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   (meaning \"something transacted; especially an exchange or transfer of goods, services, or funds\").

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF # 64 at 2.) Only then is there a contract upon which the retailer could collect on a subsequent duty to pay, if any such duty exists. Under a point of sale contract, however, there is no additional duty to pay and, as a consequence, no \"claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Turning to the circumstances of the present case, it is a general tenet of contract law that \"[t]he offeror is the master of his offer.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 30 cmt. a (Am.

Here, both the Security Agreement and the Insurance Policy provide signature lines for the purchaser. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Partial Dismissal, Exs. A and B.) Above the signature line, the Security Agreement states, in pertinent part, that \"by signing below buyer agrees to the terms ... of this contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.) Similarly, the Insurance Policy states, in pertinent part, that \"I (customer), whose signature appears below, ... agree to all of [the Insurance Policy's] provisions, terms and conditions, and am requesting coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The contract was accepted and the sum of $495 was earmarked then for payment to Safe-Guard through financing when Hinkle (or Hinkle's then-spouse on her behalf) signed the Security Agreement and the Insurance Policy. Hinkle's agreement with Safe-Guard was, as she concedes, a point of sale exchange. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF # 59 at 1 (arguing \"that the [WVCCPA] applies to point of purchase debt collection\"); ECF # 64 at 4-5 (stating that \"no money actually changed hands at the point of sale between Plaintiff and Safe-Guard\").) Accordingly, because she had no duty to pay Safe-Guard money as a result of a prior purchase of GAP insurance, Safe-Guard's sale of GAP insurance is not a \"claim\" under the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Hinkle seeks support in case law parsing the WVCCPA and the federal FDCPA. Before turning to those cases, the court notes that none of the cases cited by Hinkle and Safe-Guard address the point of sale issue here, and the court's own thorough search did not yield any on-point opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is unsurprising with respect to the FDCPA because, as Hinkle points out, \"the FDCPA, unlike the [WVCCPA], does not apply to original creditors. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to imagine a scenario in which a point of sale purchase ... gives rise to a claim under the FDCPA.\" (ECF # 64 at 6.) As for West Virginia and the remaining jurisdictions with similar debt collection provisions, the point of sale issue has not been addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Hinkle argues that the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   rejecting\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   's deferral-of-payment requirement indicates that \"[o]nce a transaction gives rise to the obligation, timing of payment is irrelevant.\" (ECF # 59 at 3, 3 n.1.) In\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   , as noted above, the Third Circuit held that \"the plain meaning of section 1692a(5) indicates that a 'debt' is created whenever a consumer is obligated to pay money as a result of a transaction whose subject is primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/#p401\">\n    225 F.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Serian\n   </em>\n   , it is held that \"when a consumer purchases a motor vehicle from a dealership, and the dealership accepts the trade in of another motor vehicle as payment, or partial payment, of the purchase price of the vehicle being purchased, subsequent efforts by the dealership to collect from the consumer any amounts due the dealership by virtue of\n   the dealership's payment of the loan secured by the trade-in vehicle must comply with the [ WVCCPA].\" Syl.

West Virginia Code section 46A-6-104 makes unlawful \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" \"Trade\" and \"commerce\" are defined together to include \"services.\" W.

Instead, Hinkle simply restates her argument that, in view of the definitions produced immediately above, Safe-Guard's sale of insurance falls within the purview of article six because\n   \"services\" is defined by the WVCCPA to include \"insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF # 59 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court reiterates its prior decision that the sale of insurance is not encompassed within the WVCCPA's general consumer protections of article six. As noted in the court's prior order, article six's exclusions supplement, rather than supplant, the WVCCPA's generally-applicable exclusions in section 46A-1-105(a)(2). This is underscored by the subject matter of article six's exclusions, which merely shield news media from liability for innocently publishing \"false, misleading or deceptive\" advertisements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46A-6-105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As also noted in the court's prior order, the inclusion of insurance in the definition of \"services\" does not bring the sale of insurance within the general consumer protections. \"Services\" is ubiquitously used throughout the WVCCPA, and its use alone is not enough to overcome the statute's general exclusion of insurance sales. To hold otherwise would all but eviscerate the exclusion. Moreover, other provisions of the WVCCPA expressly provide for their applicability to the sale of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276743\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/320/#p325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46A-3-109 (prescribing rules related to insurance purchases when charges for credit life and health insurance are made in addition to finance charges);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276743\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/320/#p325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46A-3-109(a) (prescribing rules related to the purchase of collateral insurance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As in the previous order, the court also notes that the West Virginia Legislature, after enacting the WVCCPA, has twice added consumer protections to title 33 of the West Virginia Code, which regulates insurance transactions in the State. In 1997, the Legislature enacted the Insurance Sales Consumer Protection Act \"to regulate the business of insurance in West Virginia when engaged in by financial institutions and to protect the interests of consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276743\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/320/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33-11A-2. In 2001, the Legislature enacted the Unauthorized Insurance Act \"to subject certain persons and insurers to the jurisdiction of the commissioner and to the courts of this state in suits by or on behalf of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276743\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/320/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33-44-2. The Legislature also declared that its intent in passing the Unauthorized Insurance Act was,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"that [the Legislature] is concerned with the protection of residents of this state against unscrupulous acts by insurers not authorized to transact an insurance business in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276743\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/320/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although neither of these Acts altered the earlier-enacted WVCCPA, they suggest that the Legislature intended to fill a void of consumer protections relating to the sale of insurance - particularly the Unauthorized Insurance Act since it addresses the unlicensed sale of insurance in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because the court has dismissed Hinkle's debt collection and general consumer protection claims for the reasons stated herein, the court need not address Safe-Guard's preemption argument or Hinkle's contention that the WVCCPA allows for recovery for violations of West Virginia's insurance laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   V.

Code Ann. \u00a7 46A-1-103(3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In the court's view, the closest analogy to be drawn from the case law is the instance of a dishonored check. For example, an Illinois state appellate court, reading a statute that was similar at the time to the WVCCPA, \"conclude[d] that when a check is given in payment for goods or services and is dishonored, the relation of debtor-creditor is established between the drawer and the payee of the check.\"\n    <em>\n     Int'l Bureau of Fraud Control, Ltd. v. Clayton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2690791\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/188/703/\">\n     188 Ill.App.3d 703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Ill.%20Dec.%20920\">\n     135 Ill.Dec. 920\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=544%20N.E.2d%20416\">\n     544 N.E.2d 416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at 420 (1989). Thus, in\n    <em>\n     Clayton\n    </em>\n    , it would appear that a \"debt\" or \"claim\" did not exist when the check was used at the point of sale, but rather when the check was dishonored at a later time. The court is hesitant, however, to rely on that analogy here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    A California state court addressed a similar issue in\n    <em>\n     Gouskos v.

Hinkle nonetheless insists that the underlying facts involved WVCCPA \"claims\" similar to a point of sale exchange, thus ostensibly indicating the Supreme Court of Appeals' tacit acknowledgment that point of sale exchanges are \"claims\" under the WVCCPA. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF # 59 at 6.) The court disagrees. Simply stated, neither decision discusses the WVCCPA in any detail. Consequently,\n    <em>\n     Dunlap\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Zakaib\n    </em>\n    are not relevant here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
