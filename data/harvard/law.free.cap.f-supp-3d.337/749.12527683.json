Leinenweber, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After seven years of litigation and a month-long trial, a jury found in Plaintiff Michael LaPorta's favor on his claim that the City of Chicago had\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   policies that sustained serious flaws in its police force, namely: failing to investigate officers accused of misconduct; failing to discipline officers who deserved it; and failing to maintain an adequate Early Warning System to identify and correct problematic behavior. The jury further found that the last two of those policies constituted the moving force behind a January 2010 incident in which CPD Officer Patrick Kelly shot LaPorta in the head, causing severe and lasting injuries. For these injuries, the\n   jury awarded LaPorta $44.7 million in damages. Before the Court are the parties' post-trial motions.

Failure to Prove Constitutional Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City recycles its first JMOL argument from the summary judgment stage, contending once more that LaPorta's theory of liability cannot get off the ground given that under\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p201\">\n    489 U.S. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201-02,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p201\">\n    109 S.Ct. 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p201\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), local governments cannot be liable for failing to prevent due process violations effected by private actors. Simply enough, the City contends that Kelly acted only as a private citizen during the evening in question, and as such his coincidental profession plays no part in the liability analysis. But as the Court already described, this misses the mark by mischaracterizing LaPorta's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaPorta v.

Such a claim is not appropriately considered under\n   <em>\n    DeShaney\n   </em>\n   , and as such the City's objection predicated upon the same cannot defeat LaPorta's claim nor entitle the City to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obrycka v.

Ill. Feb 23, 2012) (St. Eve., J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence of Kelly's Reckless Indifference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City argues in the alternative that even if\n   <em>\n    DeShaney\n   </em>\n   does not apply, LaPorta failed to produce sufficient evidence that Kelly acted intentionally or with reckless indifference when he shot LaPorta. (Chicago also argues that the \"reckless indifference\" standard has no\n   place in the due process analysis; the Court dispatches this argument below at Part II.A.2.) First, LaPorta presented expert testimony undermining Kelly's version of events (Balash Tr. 1879:12-1880:11 (explaining that contrary to Kelly's statement that LaPorta picked up and cocked the gun, said model cannot be manually cocked in the manner Kelly described), 1887:6-21 (expressing disbelief at Kelly's story that his firearm had twice malfunctioned during Kelly's recruit school training) ), and concluding that the shooting was no suicide (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   1892:1-1912:13 (describing the evidence and concluding that Kelly shot LaPorta) ). The jury also heard evidence from Defendant's witnesses that undermined the case for this being an accidental shooting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brudenell Tr. 2689:18-21 (agreeing that the shooting did not occur as a result of someone dropping the gun); Wyant Tr. 2641:19-2642:3 (testifying that he had never heard of a Sig Sauer P226-the model of Kelly's firearm-misfiring).) Moreover, Kelly took the stand. On cross-examination, LaPorta's counsel asked whether Kelly removed the gun from its holster, held it in his hand, and then pulled the trigger and shot LaPorta in the head. Kelly responded by invoking the Fifth. As this is a civil case, the jury was permitted to take an adverse inference from Kelly's invocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hillmann v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055347\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/787/#p793\">\n    834 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (7th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also infra\n   </em>\n   at Part II.B.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beyond all this, the City objects that LaPorta never painted a clear enough picture of Kelly's alleged motive in carrying out this shooting. But LaPorta did not have to prove motive to prevail in this case, and the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial certainly forms a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that Kelly deliberately or with reckless indifference shot LaPorta in the head.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214902\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/698/#p707\">\n    377 F.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Maintain an EWS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LaPorta presented substantial evidence of the City's failure to maintain an Early Warning System. This evidence included the findings from an April 2016 report put out by the City-created Police Accountability Task Force (\"PATF\"), which noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No dedicated system exists to identify and address patterns or practices. While they are charged with investigating police misconduct, IPRA [the Independent Police Review Authority] and BIA [the Bureau of Internal Affairs] historically have not engaged in efforts to identify officers whose records suggest repeated instances of misconduct or bias. They also historically have not engaged in efforts to identify broader patterns or practices either of misconduct. The persistent failure of IPRA and BIA to examine pattern and practice evidence substantially contributes to the police accountability vacuum in Chicago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Tr. 2356:18-2357:3.) Alderman Moore, a member of the Chicago City Council, concurred with these findings. (Moore Tr. 887:23-888:15.) In the same vein, a January 2017 report issued by the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois observed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The lack of a functional early intervention system coupled with inadequate supervision has placed officers and members of the public at risk. These longstanding systemic deficiencies in CPD's early intervention systems have prevented CPD from taking two steps that are crucial to ensuring officer safety and wellness as well as ensuring policing that is effective and lawful. First, CPD does not adequately and accurately identify officers who are in need for this type of action and, second, CPD does not consistently or sufficiently address\n   officer behavior where CPD identifies negative patterns. Because of these failures, CPD officers are able to engage in problematic behavior with impunity which can and do escalate into serious misconduct. This has dramatic consequences for the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Tr. 2249:1-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Chicago takes issue with the PATF and DOJ reports, arguing that neither zeroes in on the proper time frame-that being the few years preceding the 2010 shooting, when perhaps some intervention could have changed Kelly's behavior and thus averted LaPorta's injury all together. This rejoinder is not as effective as Chicago hopes. First, as described in greater detail below, the PATF report reviewed CPD records dating back to 2007, and the DOJ report referred in sweeping terms to \"longstanding\" and \"systemic\" deficiencies in CPD policies. (\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   at Part II.B.3.) And second, LaPorta developed evidence beyond these reports that back up his contention that Chicago lacked an effective EWS during the pertinent years. Tisa Morris, the former chief administrator for the Office of Professional Standards, testified that during her tenure from 2004 to 2007, she was not aware of any system in place to identify and discipline repeat offenders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1163:18-20, 1176:25-1177:1, 1229:24-1230:9.) Lou Reiter, LaPorta's police-practices expert, backed up the ineffective-EWS conclusion as well, stating that during his 25 years working with CPD, he observed \"historic and systemic deficiencies ... in the areas of administrative investigations, or CR investigations, and not implementing an early warning system and of condoning or encouraging the code of silence.\" (Reiter Tr. 306:8-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Chicago also tries to rebut LaPorta's evidence by explaining that the City maintained two systems during the pertinent time frame: The Behavioral Intervention System and the Personal Concerns Program, which together comprised an EWS. But Reiter cast doubt on the efficacy of these systems, explaining that they were used very rarely. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Reiter Tr. 328:22-329:10 (testifying that because the odds of being put into BIS were \"negligible,\" BIS provided officers no deterrent for bad conduct).) Ultimately, this, as well as Chicago's other objections to the strength of LaPorta's case, go to the weight of the evidence presented. But weighing the evidence is a task for the jury, and one that it reasonably carried out. The Court will not second-guess their determination. That is not the Court's role.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schandelmeier-Bartels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096004\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/372/#p376\">\n    634 F.3d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Chicago's renewed JMOL Motion is denied in relevant part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Failure to Discipline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the second version of LaPorta's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, he charges that Chicago had a widespread practice of failing to discipline adequately those officers who committed misconduct. The jury was persuaded by this theory also. As above, the City claims the jury spoke in error, that LaPorta failed to adduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find in his favor on this theory. Once more, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The PATF report presented at trial painted a bleak picture of CPD's disciplinary practices. In many cases, the report found that officers are simply not disciplined for sustained complaints. (Tr. 2349:14-21.) That owes in part to an \"opaque, drawn-out, and unscrutinized disciplinary process\" that frequently enables officers \"to avoid meaningful consequences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2349:18-21.) The report also called that process \"haphazard,\" \"unpredictable,\" and \"arbitrary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2245:6-7, 2354:18-19.) Contrary to Chicago's objection described above, the report focused on the relevant time frame, examining data\n   from 2007 through 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2349:6-2360:17; Emanuel Statement Tr. 249:3-251:24.) Beyond this, LaPorta held out evidence of Kelly's disciplinary record as an exemplar. Kelly accumulated eighteen CRs in the five years prior to the shooting. But according to Reiter, Kelly was not properly disciplined for any of these complaints. (Reiter Tr. 318:2-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that the City had a practice of failing to discipline officers adequately. That is all LaPorta must now show to prevail against the City's renewed JMOL Motion. The Motion is denied in relevant part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Failure to Investigate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, LaPorta argued, and the jury agreed, that the City had a widespread practice of not only failing to discipline malfeasant officers, but also of failing to investigate misconduct in the first place. LaPorta's statistics expert testified that 46% of the complaints filed from 2004 to 2011 concluded with a finding of \"no affidavit\" and were not investigated. (Rothman Tr. 2199:7-21.) Chicago rebuts that this number is unfairly inflated: State law blocks investigation into such unsupported complaints, Chicago explains, so the City's nonfeasance results from legal proscription and not from some anti-investigatory policy. But 50 ILCS 725/6, the state law Chicago relies upon, clearly applies only in the absence of an on-point collective bargaining agreement between the City and the Fraternal Order of the Police. There is such an agreement here. (Reiter Tr. 387:12-19 (describing the collective bargaining agreement).) That agreement loosens the state law stranglehold on police-conduct investigations by permitting the chief administrators of IPRA and BIA to override the affidavit requirement where such override is deemed \"necessary and appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And according to Former CPD Commander Eugene Roy, CPD supervisors can recommend that investigations proceed even when the complaint is not supported by sufficient evidence. (Roy Tr. 955:7-10.) These workarounds permit Chicago to investigate no-affidavit complaints, but the City rarely does so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reiter Tr. 387:9-19 (reciting from PATF report that the IPRA/BIA override is rarely used and not to the extent it could and should be).) Indeed, the DOJ report explains that such overrides are not encouraged among IPRA investigators, and those investigators are not trained on how to obtain such overrides anyway. (Tr. 2246:8-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To any extent, the City's failures to investigate extend beyond its high rate of nonfeasance vis-\u00e0-vis those complaints unsupported by affidavit. As the DOJ report concluded, \"The City does not investigate the majority of cases it is required by law to investigate.... Those cases that are investigated suffer from serious investigative flaws that obstruct objective fact finding.\" (Tr. 2242:25-2243:5.) The report further stated that the City's investigative techniques are often biased, and the concluding reports are often drafted in a manner favorable to the officer by omitting conflicting or contrary evidence. (Tr. 2358:12-21.) The PATF report propounded similar findings. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2357:12-14 (\"Since its inception, IPRA has had the power to examine patterns of complaints when investigating police misconduct but has not exercised it.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The City fails to muster any other argument on this score that goes to the sufficiency of the evidence rather than to its weight. As such, a reasonable jury could have concluded, as did the jury here, that Chicago had a widespread policy or practice of failing to investigate officer misconduct. The City's renewed JMOL Motion is thus denied in relevant part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Deliberate Indifference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To place the next building block in LaPorta's case, he had to demonstrate that the City was deliberately indifferent to the harms that might befall those persons who come into contact with under-trained and under-disciplined officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Canton v.

Ill. Apr. 25, 2013) (applying same \"deliberate indifference\" standard to a failure-to-discipline theory). The jury found the City deliberately indifferent in two respects: first, as to the failure to maintain an adequate EWS, and second, as to the failure to discipline adequately. As elsewhere in its motion, the City contends that no jury could have reasonably reached these conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The PATF report opined that CPD generally lacks a culture of accountability, \"largely because no one in top leadership has taken ownership of the issue.\" (Tr. 2360:1-4.) It continued: \"[a]lthough so-called problem officers are either well-known to their supervisors and CPD's leadership or easily identified, few steps are being taken to proactively manage and redirect those officers' conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2360:1-17.)

Alderman Moore, who served as the City Council's 30(b)(6) designee, testified that police misconduct \"has been ongoing for a long time, probably as long as we've had a police department.... 180 years.\" (Moore Tr. 887:15-22.) The Alderman also agreed that IPRA and BIA have not historically engaged in efforts to identify broader patterns or practices either of misconduct or racially biased policing within CPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   888:3-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, the jury heard testimony that the City Council had been warned about the sore need to ameliorate CPD's deficient policies, including by implementing an effective EWS. In June 2007, the City Council held public hearings concerning the deficiencies of the Office of Professional Standards (\"OPS\"), the precursor to IPRA. (Moore Tr. 892:15-24.) According to Alderman Moore, the complaints voiced at those hearings contributed to the creation of IPRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   893:3-21.) One such complainant expressed his \"profound fear\" that IPRA would \"simply recreate and perpetuate another inadequate and ineffective system like [OPS] that we have suffered with since 1974.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   894:22-895:10.) Moore was present for that hearing; at trial, he told the jury: \"We knew there were problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Taken together, this testimony provides a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to allow a reasonable jury to find that the City knew it lacked an effective EWS and failed to discipline malfeasant officers adequately, and yet took no action to right these deficiencies. That carries LaPorta past the renewed JMOL Motion as far as the deliberate indifference requirement is concerned. FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Though the jury agreed LaPorta had proven three systemic failures-the failures to investigate, to discipline, and to maintain an EWS-the jury found that only the latter two of those failures caused Kelly to shoot LaPorta. (Verdict Form, Dkt. 446.) Chicago challenges those two causation findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As the Court earlier observed, \"[t]he critical question is whether the\n   City's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   policies ... were the 'moving force' behind Kelly's actions such that execution of the policies 'inflicts the injuries that the government as an entity is responsible [for] under \u00a7 1983.' \"\n   <em>\n    LaPorta v.

The jury concluded LaPorta met these requirements at trial, and the Court will not disturb that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To begin, LaPorta offered evidence demonstrating that the City's policies may generally encourage officers to feel immune from consequences. The PATF report noted that \"[w]hen case after high-profile case results in punishment that does not match the gravity of the misconduct, it sends a message that the police can act with impunity.... It also leaves those who break the rules emboldened to continue doing so.\" (Tr. 2355:6-14.) The DOJ report shared in this conclusion, opining that CPD's failure to identify officers in need of behavioral intervention enabled those officers \"to engage in problematic behavior with impunity which can and do[es] escalate into serious misconduct[, which] has dramatic consequences for the public ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2249:8-15.) Alderman Moore agreed with that logic. (Moore Tr. 877:19-23 (remarking that if an officer engaged in misconduct and was not held accountable, he \"would feel a little bit more of a freedom to engage in further misconduct\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Reiter Tr. 348:18-349:1 (concluding same).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Beyond this, LaPorta presented testimony that Kelly, specifically, was one such officer emboldened by the City's failure to discipline or correct his behavior via an effective EWS, and that this conditioning led Kelly to shoot LaPorta. The jury heard that Kelly was subject to eighteen complaints and yet was never disciplined or put into an EWS program. True, Kelly was twice referred to the BIS program, but Reiter explained that Kelly never actually attended the counseling those programs recommended for him. (Reiter Tr. 326:3-19.) Two of Kelly's eighteen complaints-one in September 2005 and the other in June 2006-concerned an alcohol-intoxicated Kelly battering personal associates during off-duty time. (O'Neill Tr. 3214:19-3224:25, 3247:2-17.) After the latter incident, an examining psychologist noted that Kelly \"may have problems related to alcohol and control\" and would benefit from intervention designed to teach him \"other ways of resolving conflicts with significant others in his life.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3255:12-3257:20.) According to the evidence at trial, the City never provided that intervention in any form, be it meaningful entry in an EWS program, discipline, or otherwise. Reiter explained that such repeated failures to investigate and discipline reinforces in officers a sense of impunity that extends to their off-duty behavior (Reiter Tr. 306:7-25), and that CPD's failures with respect to Kelly specifically contributed to his personal sense of impunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   325:21-326:2;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   346:5-347:3 (describing that one consequence of lacking an adequate EWS is that officers such as Kelly would be encouraged to act with impunity).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, this testimony suggested that Chicago's administrative failings were the moving force behind Kelly's actions. Keeping in mind the Court's obligation on a JMOL motion to construe the facts strictly in favor of the party that prevailed at trial, the Court refuses to overrule the jury's causation finding. A reasonable jury could have reached this conclusion; that is enough.

In rebuttal, LaPorta contends that Chicago waived this objection and in the alternative that the failure to provide the additional interrogatory does not rise to the level of prejudicial error requiring a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mgmt.

LaPorta contends that the City not only failed to object to the verdict form, but actually submitted this version of the verdict form to the Court, meaning that Chicago proposed the same verdict form to which it now objects. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3371:14-17 (statement from the Court that: \"I believe that [the verdict form] submitted by the defendant is clearer than the plaintiff's, so the Court will give the one submitted by the defendant.\").) LaPorta's characterization is not wholly accurate. True, Chicago submitted this verdict form; but the City did so in conformance with the Court's earlier and specific orders given to both parties in chambers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/12/2017 Status Hearing Tr. 6, Dkt. 521-2 (acknowledging that the Court essentially crafted the final verdict form).) As such, the Court will not take Defendant's submission of the ultimately-selected form as an unmitigated endorsement of that form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That being said, Chicago did not do its utmost to make its objection clear. After the Court selected the defense-submitted form and asked whether either party wanted to add anything on the record, counsel for the City remarked vaguely that \"the verdict form itself, we drafted that pursuant to the Court's order yesterday.\" (Tr. 3372:5-6.) The City somewhat clarified this objection later, explaining that \"we did try to come up with a different ... proposed verdict form in light of the Court's ruling that would have included specifically ... a question 4 ... a deliberate indifference finding specifically by the jury.\" (Tr. 3577:23-3578:5.) While this objection could have been more precisely stated, the Court finds this articulation particular enough to bring the nature of the alleged error into focus and thus avoid waiver under Rule 51.\n   <em>\n    Schobert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11401691\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/725/#p729\">\n    304 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Though Chicago did not waive the objection, the City cannot succeed on the objection's merits. To determine whether a verdict form was confusing, courts consider it in light of the instructions given.\n   <em>\n    Happel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920012\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/820/#p827\">\n    602 F.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The nub of this inquiry is whether \"the jury was misled in any way and whether it had [an] understanding of the issues and its duty to determine those issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920012\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/820/#p827\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Looking through this lens, the Court cannot agree that its instructions and verdict form confused the jury. The Court's deliberate-indifference instruction closely tracked the Seventh Circuit's pattern instruction and clearly stated that the City could not be held liable unless LaPorta proved by a preponderance of the evidence that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [t]he Chicago City Council knew that because one or more of the [alleged policies] existed and was allowed to continue, it was highly predictable that its off-duty officers would violate the bodily integrity of persons they came into contact with because there was a pattern of similar constitutional violations or it was highly predictable even without a pattern of similar constitutional violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Jury Instructions 18, Dkt. 444;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Seventh Circuit Civil Pattern Jury Instruction\n   7.25 (propounding substantially similar model instruction).) This language properly instructed the jury concerning the issues before it. The absence of the specific words \"deliberate inference,\" which are likewise notably absent from the Seventh Circuit's pattern instruction, does not confound the charge. And the absence of an additional interrogatory on the verdict form asking after this instruction does not create an error serious enough to mislead the jurors and work prejudice upon the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGeshick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515929\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/1229/#p1232\">\n    9 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the emphasis suggests, it is the second phrase with which Chicago takes issue.

Before advancing to the merits of this dispute, the Court notes that as above, LaPorta charges that Chicago waived this objection. The Court and both parties discussed this and the other proposed instructions at length in chambers and, as Chicago now recounts, it there objected to the reckless indifference instruction. However, the City failed to reiterate that objection with clarity on the record the following morning (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3356:1-3372:22) as required to avoid waiver under Rule 51.\n   <em>\n    Schobert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11401691\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/725/#p729\">\n    304 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (proposing an alternative instruction is not enough to overcome waiver when objection not clearly stated). Still, there is an exception to this formal-objection requirement: The objection may survive waiver if (1) the party's position was made clear to the court and (2) any further objection would have been unavailing and futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Kelly cannot both have acted feeling free of consequences\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   acted negligently; something more than negligence was required. Had LaPorta instead theorized that Kelly accidentally shot him as a result of the City's deliberate indifference with respect to its failures to train officers to handle their firearms safely, LaPorta would only need to prove Kelly shot LaPorta negligently. Chicago no doubt objects to this hypothetical on the basis that negligence cannot violate the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruehman v.

But in this case, the constitutionally-violative mental state is supplied by the deliberately-indifferent City, not by the officer who implements the harms the City ignores. Kelly's mental state is only spurred onto the stage by LaPorta's particular theory of why (or how) Kelly acted the way he did. With this in mind, the Court instructed the jury on a reckless indifference standard.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Jury Instructions 18, Dkt. 444,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Archie v.

In the context of this case, that instruction was not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the final twist to this argument, Chicago contends that even if it was not error to instruct the jury that the City could not be held liable unless Kelly acted with at least reckless indifference, the Court still erred by failing to define \"reckless indifference.\" The City complains that without that further clarification, the jury might have understood the City could be held liable so long as Kelly acted \"recklessly\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , like a \"loose cannon\" (Roy Tr. 957:1-959:10)-irrespective of Kelly's\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   in so acting. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Before addressing the merits of this argument, the Court notes that Chicago did not raise this objection at trial. Though, as laid out above, the Court is disinclined to label as forfeit those arguments extensively developed in chambers, the Court will not extend the same leniency to jury-instruction objections that Chicago never introduced until present. If Chicago found the deliberate indifference instruction to be opaque, the onus was on the City to say so before the Court delivered it to the jury. FED. R. CIV. P. 51(b)-(c).

From the Complaint onward, LaPorta's case always turned upon the idea that Kelly felt empowered to act with impunity-that he could engage in wrongdoing without facing the consequences. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 7th Am. Compl. \u00b6 77 (\"[Chicago's administrative failings] caused Patrick Kelly, and other officers similarly situated, to act with impunity and to feel and act as though their acts of misconduct would go unpunished and uninvestigated.\").) Plaintiff's counsel framed the case in that way from beginning,\n   (Pl.'s Opening Tr. 152:3-6 (\"Kelly [ ] repeatedly acted with impunity because he learned that misconduct, regardless of how severe or even criminal, it goes unpunished\"), 197:14-16 (\"[T]he City is liable because Patrick Kelly knew that he could mess around and get away with it\") ), to end, (Pl. Closing Tr. 3439:16-22 (\"[Kelly] was not disciplined for any of his acts of violence or domestic battery, even after the City had notice time after time of his propensity for this violent, reckless, bad behavior.... Officer Kelly was acting with impunity in a way in which he knew he was immune from consequences without fear of repercussion.\") ). The Court believes that within the context of this suit, the jury understood that Kelly's awareness of his own misconduct was the fulcrum upon which the merits turned. Chicago's suggestion that the \"reckless indifference\" instruction would somehow dupe the jury into ignoring this otherwise omnipresent theory of liability is not credible enough for the Court to agree the City suffered a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Medley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539472\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/1248/#p1260\">\n    913 F.2d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reciting plain error standard).

Spoliation and Probable Cause Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Chicago also asserts it suffered prejudice because the Court erroneously instructed the jury as to spoliation of three pieces of evidence: Kelly's phone and text messages; Kelly's service weapon, and a CPD-created video of the shooting scene. After describing those pieces of evidence, the Court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [T]he City of Chicago contends that it had no lawful basis to obtain Kelly's texts and no texts occurred after the 911 call; Kelly's service weapon was returned after all possible ISP testing was completed; and a video never existed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   You may assume that such evidence would have been unfavorable to the City of Chicago if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that: One, the City of Chicago intentionally failed to preserve the evidence or permitted the evidence to be destroyed; and two, the City of Chicago intentionally failed to preserve the evidence or permitted the evidence to be destroyed in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Jury Instructions 16, Dkt. 444.) Chicago does not object to the language of this instruction-and wisely so, given how closely the instruction tracks the Seventh Circuit's pattern instruction. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539472\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/1248/#p1260\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Seventh Cir.

One senior officer at the scene of the shooting testified that he \"wanted [the scene] worked up as if it were a homicide.\" (McNicholas Tr. 719:10-12.) Another said at the scene that Kelly should be considered a suspect in the shooting. (Doherty Tr. 2585:6-15.) Despite this clear acknowledgment of the need to investigate Kelly's involvement, Chicago and its officers failed to take the routine step of preserving that suspect's phone and messages-a failure made more suspect by the City's corresponding preservation of\n   <em>\n    LaPorta's\n   </em>\n   phone as part of CPD's investigation into the crime of attempt suicide. (Weber Tr. 1036:12-1037:20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As for the missing video: Chicago simply contends it never existed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kaput Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   7902-791:10; Barsch Tr. 2966:12-17 (both representing that no video was created to their knowledge).) But LaPorta produced CPD documents obtained in discovery that state the contrary. (CPD Case Supplementary Report, Trial Ex. PTX 126 at 7, Dkt. 508-11 (reciting among \"evidence\": \"O/A and C/U video of scene\").) The spoliation instruction identified the respective parties' positions and then properly permitted the jury to weigh the credibility of the conflicting evidence and determine whether an adverse inference was appropriate. This is exactly the mechanism anticipated by the Pattern Instructions, and it was not error to apply it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the gun. According to LaPorta's trial exhibits, CPD seized Kelly's firearm on January 13, 2010. But then, on June 7, 2013, more than two years after LaPorta filed this case in state court, CPD simply gave the gun back. (CPD Property Inventory Record, Trial Ex. PTX 98, Dkt. 508-3.) Chicago contends it had no duty to hold on to Kelly's firearm. This strains credulity. The gun was the operative piece of evidence in what had, by the time of CPD's surrender of the weapon, already been alleged to be an intentional shooting. These facts certainly suffice for the requisite showing to warrant the spoliation instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, LaPorta passed the bar for an instruction on all three pieces of evidence. And even if that were not the case, Chicago has failed to demonstrate that this error-if one existed-so confused the jury's understanding of the issues as to work serious prejudice upon the City.\n   <em>\n    McGeshick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515929\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/1229/#p1232\">\n    9 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Chicago adds to its spoliation objection a perfunctory claim that it suffered prejudice from the Court's refusal to instruct the jury on the meaning of probable cause. The City contends that without this instruction, the spoliation instruction could have improperly led the jury to conclude that the City had a duty to retain the three pieces of evidence discussed above. First, the Court is not persuaded by the jury-confusion argument: As already set forth, the spoliation instruction adequately explained what task the jury faced. Second, no part of the jury's verdict hinged upon probable cause determinations, so their understanding of this legal issue is oblique to their verdict in this case. The probable cause instruction was properly refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Patricia LaPorta Damages Instruction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The City next contends the Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that LaPorta's mother, Patricia, has no claim for damages in this case and that testimony concerning her pain and suffering should not be considered when reaching the damages verdict. LaPorta responds that the Court instructed the jury to determine damages based on harms sustained by LaPorta alone, so a further \"Patricia instruction\" was not necessary. The Court agrees. Not only was the jury charged with calculating only\n   <em>\n    LaPorta's\n   </em>\n   damages, the verdict form itemized the potentially compensable areas of injury, and none of those mentioned Patricia. This argument cannot justify the Court ordering a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that none of the above instructions, when taken either in isolation or all together, constitute prejudicial error warranting a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidentiary Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Chicago takes issue with several of the Court's evidentiary rulings throughout the trial and contends that even if not independently, these errors cumulatively amount to prejudice against the City and thus justify a new trial. A new trial may be ordered when an evidentiary error had a \"substantial influence\n   over the jury, and the result reached was inconsistent with substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Mgmt.

When a party seeking a new trial makes a cumulative-effect argument, that movant must show: \"(1) that multiple errors occurred at trial; and (2) those errors, in the context of the entire trial, were so severe as to have rendered [the] trial fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    Christmas v.

(Jury Instructions 15, Dkt. 444 (instructing that when a person asserts his Fifth Amendment rights, \"you are permitted to assume that his testimony would be unfavorable\n   <em>\n    to him\n   </em>\n   in any manner that you deem reasonable and supported by the evidence\" (emphasis added) ).) Second, even if this instruction permitted the jury to take an adverse inference against the City-which it did not-there would still be no error here.

The relevant interests were in lockstep. The Court agrees with LaPorta that in these circumstances, the adverse inference from Kelly's invocation could have been permitted against the City. Though, as stated above, the Court did not go this far; the instruction permitted an adverse inference only against Kelly, not Chicago. In this regard, the City has fallen short of carrying its heavy burden in justifying a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP Amoco Chem. Co. v.

Dr. Heilbronner testified that LaPorta's injuries undermined his capacity to recall reliably the events leading up the shooting. (Heilbronner Tr. 3037:1-3047:8.) But the doctor also testified that it is \"really difficult to say with any certainty exactly when [LaPorta's] memories are reliable and when they aren't\"; he also conceded that it was not impossible that LaPorta remembered the events leading up to the shooting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3046:1-3052:18.) The question, ultimately, is whether LaPorta's professed memories of the relevant events were reliable.

At trial, the Court found that the DOJ and PATF reports fell within the 803(8) exception and accordingly permitted Plaintiff's counsel to read portions of each into the record. For a number of reasons, Chicago contends that was prejudicial error, though notably the City does not contend that these reports lacked trustworthiness. The Court is not persuaded by any of Chicago's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, the City contends that the Court impermissibly allowed counsel to read into the record hearsay statements from the reports under the guise of 803(8). But the City points to zero instances of hearsay in its briefing-indeed, while the read-in portions of the reports recited some hearsay\n   <em>\n    sources\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 2240:1-2242:3 (DOJ report summarizing report writers having met with a range of lay and expert sources) ), those selections do not actually include the hearsay\n   <em>\n    statements\n   </em>\n   to which they allude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Chicago also contends the factual and legal issues represented in these reports lack a \"close fit\" to the issues present in LaPorta's suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351104\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/728/#p740\">\n    833 F.3d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This second objection largely centers on the reports' allegedly irrelevant temporal focus: Neither report focuses on those years leading up to the January 2010 shooting, Chicago claims, so they cannot substantiate LaPorta's claims concerning the City's policies predating that event. But the PATF report reviewed IPRA records dating back to 2007. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2350:1-7 (recounting data reviewed in PATF report); Emanuel Statement Tr. 250:7-18 (summarizing scope of PATF report).) Chicago's timeliness argument has more traction with the DOJ report, which professes to be based on data dating back to December 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2242 (describing report's review of police misconduct complaints during the five years preceding the DOJ investigation),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2238:12-22 (stating investigation began in December 2015).) However, the DOJ report findings do not limit themselves to these data, but rather express \"\n   <em>\n    longstanding, systemic\n   </em>\n   deficiencies\" in CPD policies. (Tr. 2249:1-7.) The Court thus again finds the report, which, much like the PATF report, consists of directly-relevant subject material, a close enough fit to the issues at bar in the case to fall within 803(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   And even if this ruling was made in error, the Court believes it was harmless. The portions of the DOJ report read into the record espouse substantially similar conclusions to those reached in the PATF report. The jury would have heard the PATF conclusions whether or not the DOJ report was admitted, so the addition of the cumulative, second report does not rise to the level of prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pessefall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527869\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/511/#p516\">\n    27 F.3d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516 (11th Cir. 1994) (finding no reasonable probability of prejudice stemming from jury's consideration of extrinsic, but cumulative, evidence);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This argument fails. The City created PATF for the express purpose of reviewing the system for accountability, oversight, and training in place for Chicago's police officers. The resulting findings, summarized in the PATF report, were\n   thus \"made by a public officer resulting from a legally authorized investigation,\" and the incidental inclusion in PATF of non-governmental personnel is \"beside the point.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

Expert Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Next, Chicago argued the Court committed prejudicial error in admitting certain expert testimony from two witnesses, Dr. Ziejewski, LaPorta's biomechanics expert, and David Balash, LaPorta's crime-scene forensics expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Three parts of Dr. Ziejewski's testimony offend the City: (1) Ziejewski's testimony that it was unlikely that LaPorta, who generally used his right hand to shoot guns while hunting, would have used his left hand to shoot himself; (2) Ziejewski's participation with LaPorta's counsel in an in-court demonstration exemplifying the doctor's opinion of details concerning the shooting; (3) Ziejewski's testimony concerning the gunshot's angle of trajectory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The first of these challenges zeroes in on eleven lines of Ziejewski's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Q. What's your second opinion - I'm sorry, third?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A. This would be unlikely for Mr. LaPorta with right-handed gun handling habit to use his left hand on January 12th, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Q. Did you review deposition testimony of his family?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q. And did that deposition testimony reveal that he had a habit or a tendency to use a hand when operating a gun or a rifle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q. Which was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. Right hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Ziejewski Tr. 626:5-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The City contends that this opinion went beyond the scope of the expert's testimony. But as the Court held in ruling on the motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , an expert on human body biomechanics such as Dr. Ziejewski can rely on statements by LaPorta's family for the basic fact that LaPorta is right-hand dominant. (Mot in Limine Tr. 17:7-19.) \"The soundness of the factual underpinnings of the expert's analysis and the correctness of the expert's conclusion based on that analysis are factual matters to be determined by the trier of fact[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

But as LaPorta points out, the demonstration simply consolidated physical evidence already described and relied upon by the doctor-all of which he discussed without objection from Chicago. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ziejewski Tr. 614:1-618:14 (testifying concerning LaPorta's body position, the blood evidence, tissue recovered at the scene, and gunshot residue).) The Court committed no error by permitting that demonstration to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, but in the same vein, the City contends that the doctor should not have been permitted to testify that the bullet traveled at an angle of somewhere between 35 and 45 degrees because this opinion, too, went undisclosed before trial. The doctor conceded on the stand that he had not previously testified to this angle; he also clarified that he derived that figure by measuring the path of the bony fragments depicted in LaPorta's CT scan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   633:5-633:23, 634:3-11.) If allowing this testimony constituted error, however,\n   it was not prejudicial. LaPorta also adduced testimony from his forensic science expert, David Balash, who provided substantially similar shooting-angle testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Balash Tr. 1900:18-1901:9.) Delayed disclosures are prejudicial when said delay impacts the receiving party's ability to prepare for trial.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Am. Tablewares, Inc. v. Mogi Trading Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11944100\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/1353/#p1363\">\n    100 F.3d 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1363 (7th Cir. 1996) (upholding pre-trial refusal to exclude tardily-disclosed evidence when party seeking exclusion could not demonstrate any prejudice);\n   <em>\n    LG Elecs. v. Whirlpool Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=08%20Cow.%20242\">\n    08 C 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%209506787\">\n    2010 WL 9506787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 7, 2010) (granting pretrial motion to exclude tardily-disclosed evidence because the delay prejudiced opponent's ability to prepare for trial). No such prejudice arose from LaPorta's late disclosure here. Because Balash's substantially similar opinion was timely disclosed, the City did not want for advance notice of this cross-examination topic. The danger of prejudice from an at-trial surprise was thus extinguished, as the disclosure of Dr. Ziejewski's opinion would have been cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As for David Balash, Chicago lodges two complaints, concerning: (1) Balash's testimony regarding the flaws in CPD's investigation of the LaPorta shooting; and (2) his comments that the prosecuting state's attorney had a faulty understanding of gunshot residue (\"GSR\") evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With the first challenge, the City focuses on Balash's critiques of a number of shortcomings in the CPD investigation, including the failure to collect and preserve evidence and the belief that because the CPD improperly labeled the shooting as a suicide, the investigation necessarily received shorter shrift in the department than it would have had it been labeled as a possible homicide. LaPorta introduced Balash as an expert in crime-scene forensics; during his 25 years as a police officer, Balash frequently processed crime scenes, meaning he had made a career of observing, collecting, and preserving evidence in investigations which included both suicides and homicides. (Balash Tr. 1857:19-1858:25, 1860:9-24.) Given this breadth of experience, Balash was certainly qualified to opine on the best practices for evidence collection and crime-scene processing, which is all Chicago objects to here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Chicago's objection to Balash's testimony concerning the prosecutor's understanding of GSR evidence similarly falls short. The City complains that Balash predicated this opinion on a misunderstanding of a form the prosecutor filled out in documenting her decision not to approve criminal charges against Kelly. Indeed, Balash conceded at trial that he did not review that prosecutor's deposition transcript, and so he lacked insight into her later-provided clarifications of her thinking at the time she filled out the contested form. (Balash Tr. 1993:5-8.) But this is prime grounds for cross-examination, not disqualification of an otherwise expert opinion. Ultimately, this is a battle of the proper weight to be afforded to Balash's testimony on this score, and it is within the jury's province to make such determinations. The Motion for New Trial is denied insofar as it objects to expert testimony presented by either Dr. Ziejewski or Mr. Balash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Miscellaneous Objections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Chicago levies two additional challenges to this Court's rulings which do not fit neatly under any of the above headings. The first of these is the City's belief that the Court should have bifurcated the trial: the refusal to do so amounted to an abuse of discretion, Chicago contends, as it allowed the jury to hear and be swayed by evidence of LaPorta's extensive damages even before the City had been found liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   But bifurcation is the exception and not the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Real v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"137881\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/195/618/#p620\">\n    195 F.R.D. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (collecting cases). And the decision to bifurcate rests soundly within the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Krocka v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11485151\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/507/#p516\">\n    203 F.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516 (7th Cir. 2000). In this case, the Court properly instructed the jury to perform its duty impartially and to put the issue of damages to the side unless and until it concluded Chicago was liable. (Tr. 3580:2-14, 3588:19-25.) As always, the Court presumes that \"jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions ... and strive to understand, make sense of, and follow the instruction given them.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Puckett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010926\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/589/#p599\">\n    405 F.3d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (7th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pickett v. Sheridan Health Care Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695077\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/434/#p446\">\n    610 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (7th Cir. 2010) (applying same presumption in a civil case). It cannot be that bifurcation is required every time a plaintiff's injuries are severe, and Chicago has not provided any authority suggesting as much. The bifurcation ruling is not grounds for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, Chicago contends it was error for the Court to allow LaPorta's counsel to read a letter, written by counsel in LaPorta's voice, to the jury in closing argument. In this letter \"from LaPorta\" to LaPorta's family, counsel demonstrated what counsel understood to be LaPorta's wishes and regrets after the shooting. (Tr. 3492:1-21.) Chicago argues the letter was designed only to stir the jury's passions, was not based on any evidence, and amounted to an improper and prejudicial request for sympathy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole v. Bertsch Vending Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343695\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/766/327/#p334\">\n    766 F.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (7th Cir. 1985) (stating, in case where attorney \"openly asked the jury to feel sympathetic towards his clients,\" that \"[r]equesting sympathy for a defendant is improper especially where such argument may have a prejudicial impact upon the result\") (citations omitted). First off, the Seventh Circuit has \"repeatedly explained that improper comments during closing argument rarely rise to the level of reversible error.\"\n   <em>\n    Soltys v.

City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584888\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/679/876/#p888\">\n    679 F.Supp.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (N.D. Ill. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Lincoln Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11575731\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/709/#p730\">\n    188 F.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (7th Cir. 1999) ). The letter at issue here, though creative, does not rise to that prejudicial level. It was not spun from whole cloth, but rather based on evidence concerning LaPorta's desire and inability to have a family (P.

In seeking to carry this hefty burden, Chicago largely repackages those arguments it raised in its renewed JMOL Motion. As before, those arguments find no purchase here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Chicago objects, first, to the jury's finding that the City failed to maintain an Early Warning System, or \"EWS.\" As before, the City contends that LaPorta's evidence focused on an irrelevant time frame; zeroed in too much on Kelly, particularly, and failed to speak to a citywide failure, generally; and demonstrated that even Reiter, LaPorta's own police-practices expert, believed the City's EWS to be adequate. The Court has already reviewed and found each of these arguments unpersuasive or simply inaccurate and sees no need to recycle that analysis. Through Reiter especially, LaPorta adduced evidence that Chicago had historic and system deficiencies in failing to implement an EWS; the jury's ultimate agreement with him is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Next, Chicago takes issue with the jury's finding that the City failed to discipline its officers when appropriate. Chicago argues that LaPorta only ever adduced evidence concerning the City's failures to discipline after\n   <em>\n    allegations\n   </em>\n   of misconduct were made, as opposed to any\n   <em>\n    findings\n   </em>\n   of misconduct. Such evidence, according to Chicago, fits only within LaPorta's failure-to-\n   <em>\n    investigate\n   </em>\n   theory, and has no place in the failure-to-\n   <em>\n    discipline\n   </em>\n   theory. There are two problems with that argument. First, it is too clever by half: Though these two theories are discrete, it is not true that the evidence in support of one cannot also support the other. If, for example, the City never investigated any officer accused of misconduct, that fact would support both theories: The City failed to investigate all allegations and, because of that systemic nonfeasance, never disciplined any deserving officer. Second, Chicago's argument simply misstates the evidence. As explained above, LaPorta indeed adduced evidence showcasing the City's \"opaque, drawn-out, and unscrutinized disciplinary process\" that frequently enabled officers \"to avoid meaningful consequences.\" (Tr. 2350;\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   at Part I.D.) On this basis, a rational jury could have reached the verdict returned in this case; no new trial is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LaPORTA'S BILL OF COSTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides that a prevailing party may obtain reimbursement for certain litigation costs at the conclusion of a lawsuit.

In what proves to be a recurring theme, however, LaPorta often falls short of his burden to show these costs with the minimal particularity required for the Court to determine whether they are reasonably necessary and thus compensable. LaPorta submits, principally, two filings in support of its bill of costs: a 13-page summary spreadsheet and 550 pages of check requests, receipts, and invoices. Those latter documents are not organized, as far as the Court can see, according to any particular scheme: Neither date nor subject matter governs them, and the summary spreadsheet does not provide any cross-references to them. This submission often further obscures an already-translucent costs analysis, as set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Costs for Experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   LaPorta seeks $590,725.04 in costs under this umbrella. Those costs comprise three subcategories: (1) expert witness fees; (2) \"attorney fees\" for potential-but ultimately never called upon-expert witness Gregory E. Kulis; and (3) costs associated with a focus group or \"mock jury\" preparation. The first two of these can be handled in one fell swoop.

LaPorta's submissions do not clarify how many days each of his experts spent toiling on his case, nor even how many experts LaPorta actually retained. For what it is worth, LaPorta contends in his reply that he retained twelve. (Bill of Costs Reply at 2, Dkt. 545.) In his submissions, however, the Court counts nineteen: Gregory E. Kulis and Associates, Ltd. (though listed under \"Attorney Fees\" in LaPorta's submissions, Chicago points out, and LaPorta does not contradict, that Kulis was not retained as counsel but rather as an expert in this case); Baron Epstein; David E.

Heilbronner; Vincent DiMaio; Vocational Economics, Inc.; and WD Forensic, Inc. (Exs. to Chicago's Bill of Costs Objections at 9-11, Dkt. 516.) To any extent, the Court presumes LaPorta knows best who he did and did not retain, no matter what his submissions say; in the absence of further detail, the Court awards LaPorta $40 in fees for 3 days for each of the 12 experts he says he retained in this matter.

In sum, that expert fee award amounts to $1,440.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As for LaPorta's mock trial(s)/focus group(s): Chicago contends that the sought-after costs within this subcategory total $35,338.27. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bill of Costs Objections at 5.) The Court reaches a different figure, calculating $60,570.25 by adding together\n   the five line items in LaPorta's bill of costs labeled as either \"mock trial\" or \"focus group.\" (Exs. to Chicago's Bill of Costs Objections at 12-14, Dkt. 517.)

That sheet presents four pertinent data for each entry: the date (of what, it is not clear, although the Court assumes these are invoice dates); the \"source name,\" meaning the payee; \"memo,\" meaning the subject of the transcript; and the total cost for that transcript. These entries omit, however, any helpful means of actually navigating the muddled batch of 550 pages of invoices, receipts, and check requests LaPorta submits in support of his bill of costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A to LaPorta's Bill of Costs, Dkts. 465-467\n   (receipts filed across three different docket entries).) If LaPorta's summary spreadsheet at least included pincite references to these documents for each expenditure, the Court could compare and review them. Absent this, the Court is left largely to guess which transcripts were reasonably necessary and thus compensable, and guesswork is not a proper method for fixing costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Notably, even after Chicago levied these objections, LaPorta made no effort in reply to clarify which receipts correspond to which transcripts, or to explain what portion of each of those opaque invoices represents non-recoverable word indexes. Given that failure, LaPorta has not met his burden to show the amount of his recoverable costs as far as these invoices are concerned. None of the costs reflected therein will be allowed. Eliminating those indecipherable invoices leaves behind twenty-seven invoices which, as Chicago points out, actually itemize their respective index costs. Of the $9,448.45 total those itemized invoices represent, $334.00 is for word indexes, $350.00 for electronic copies, $294.00 for processing and handling, and $145.20 for exhibits. After subtracting these non-recoverable expenses from the $9,448.45 (see collected cases, above), we are left with $8,325.25 and, because all of the prices-per-page reflected in these invoices come in below the limits set by the Judicial Conference,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 54.1(b) (permitting recovery of transcript costs only up to the Judicial Conference per-page limit);\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204882379\">\n    2017 WL 4882379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (summarizing limits), the Court will allow this remaining sum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

He largely allows those attorneys' affidavits to speak for themselves. Chicago, however, makes several attorney-specific arguments. Against this backdrop, the Court must determine what rates are reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Antonio Romanucci and Stephan Blandin\n   </em>\n   . Neither attorney provides specific rates they actually charged any past or present client. Rather, Romanucci suggests that he effectively charged $1000/hour in a set-fee matter. The Court finds more useful than this Chicago's identification of\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   , in which the court awarded attorney Jon Loevy a rate of $550 for his work on a multi-year civil rights case that involved\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the City and culminated in a month-long trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20253716\">\n    2018 WL 253716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   court took care to note that Mr. Loevy is \"one of the top (if not\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   top) plaintiff's attorneys for police misconduct suits in Chicago.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (emphasis in original). Based on this comparison and factoring in Romanucci's attested-to lengthy experience in civil-rights litigation, the Court sets his rate equal to Mr. Lovey's at $550 an hour. The Court sets Blandin's rate at $450 per hour, with the discount from Romanucci's rate reflecting Blandin's lesser experience with police misconduct litigation.

Chicago contends DeBoni should be compensated at a depressed rate because her work amounts to drafting letters and reviewing documents. But DeBoni's affidavit indicates that she was a managing attorney at the firm during this case and her work included communicating with opposing counsel and participating in case strategy sessions. These are not the tasks of a paralegal and should not be reduced to such.

Before that point, LaPorta pursued claims against the City for \"willful and wanton conduct,\" against Kelly for negligence, and against those bars LaPorta and Kelly visited prior to the shooting for dram shop violations. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   State Ct. Compl., Dkt. 1-1.) The City contends that the hours spent litigating these issues in state court were not reasonably related to LaPorta's ultimate success on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims and should be excluded from the lodestar calculation. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Though LaPorta did not take his initially-brought, state-law claims to trial, the inquiry for determining fees in light of partial success is still instructive. That inquiry asks whether the unsuccessful (or, here, the un-pursued) claims involve \"a common core of facts or [are] based on related legal theories.\"\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. Mulholland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520096\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/333/#p339\">\n    957 F.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (7th Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In a practical sense, this inquiry contemplates how much less time LaPorta's counsel might have expended had he brought the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim from the beginning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flanagan v.

Ill. 2009). Though LaPorta's pre-\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   suit involved claims grounded in different legal theories, most of them focused on a common core of facts, and counsels' development of these facts related directly to the ultimately-raised \u00a7 1983 action. These efforts included depositions of relevant fact witnesses, including LaPorta's father and Kelly, successful litigation over the production of Kelly's IPRA file, and investigations into the shooting and LaPorta's subsequent injuries. Counsel used the fruits of all of these efforts at trial on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims, and the Court will not cut out the hours billed in their production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilfand v.

Ill. Nov. 19, 2012) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Chicago's second objection carries more weight. \"When a fee petition is vague or inadequately documented, a district court may either strike the problematic entries or (in recognition of the impracticalities of requiring courts to do an item-by-item accounting) reduce the proposed fee by a reasonable percentage.\"\n   <em>\n    Harper v. City of Chi. Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11240965\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/593/#p605\">\n    223 F.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (7th Cir. 2000). The City contends that counsels' billing entries are plagued by vague and improper entries and, as a result, should be cut from the proposed 9,588.78 hours down to 5,862.20. Though the Court disagrees with the magnitude of the City's proposed reduction, some downward adjustment is proper. What follows is a consideration of the City's objections; when LaPorta meaningfully replied to these objections, the Court considered and noted them also. When subtractions are made to specific paralegals or law clerks, the Court factored those subtractions into the \"law clerk\" or \"paralegal\" categories, given that all members of each category bill at the same rate and there was no need to break this category down by individual biller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Antonio Romanucci\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The City objects to 646.13 of the requested 2021.55 hours for Mr. Romanucci. The first gripe is for 400 hours he billed from 2010-2017 for emailing. Chicago suggests, and LaPorta does not contest, that Romanucci arrived at this figure by searching his inbox for emails related to this case and multiplying the resulting 4,000 emails by 0.1 hours a piece. But many of the emails required zero of Romanucci's efforts and should not be awarded, including: notices of docket entries, notices that people within Romanucci's office accepted calendar invitations for meetings, and extraneous communications unrelated to the LaPorta case. The Court sees many meritorious emails in these records, however, and attorneys must be able to communicate with the opposition and their peers in litigating a case. The Court accordingly reduces these 400 email hours by 25%, allowing 300 of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Next, Chicago requests that the Court cut Romanucci's 128.5 hours billed in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , state-court case, for the same reasons discussed above. As above, the Court will allow those hours over Chicago's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Third, the Court agrees with Chicago that Romanucci cannot bill the 110.33 hours that are attended by only a blank time-entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Fourth, aside from the blank entries, Chicago objects to 18.9 hours as vague. The Court agrees; the entries Chicago identifies (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Preparation of Letterhead-Blank\" and \"all about msj today\") lack a description sufficient for the Court to judge their reasonableness. These 18.9 hours will not be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Fifth, Romanucci billed 100 hours for travel to depositions. \"The presumption ... should be that a reasonable attorney's fee includes reasonable travel time billed at the same hourly rate as the lawyer's normal working time.\"\n   <em>\n    Henry v. Webermeier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661694\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/188/#p194\">\n    738 F.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194 (7th Cir. 1984). However, some of Romanucci's entries seem to reflect more travel time than was warranted. In one, perhaps simply clumsy, entry, Romanucci bills 36 hours for one day's worth of combined travel, deposition, and preparation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 29A5, 1/24/17.) There are other entries in which Romanucci similarly failed to break out travel from deposition and prep time; those entries, even assuming 10 hours of prep time, still include upwards of 10 hours of travel for each. Romanucci does not clarify any of these in reply, so the Court reduces these 100 hours to 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Sixth, perhaps showcasing Chicago's attentiveness to Romanucci's records, the City objects to 0.65 hours comprising three entries for \"Preparation of Check Request.\" The Court agrees this is a ministerial task best left to an administrative assistant. The 0.65 hours will be subtracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Last, Romanucci billed 2.0 hours for preparing Mr. and Mrs. LaPorta for a television interview. These hours will be subtracted as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In all, the Court subtracts 281.88 from Romanucci's total, leaving a sum of 1,739.67 billable hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Stephan Blandin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Chicago objects to 228.3 of Blandin's 288.3 billed hours, largely on the basis that Blandin had relatively little speaking time during trial. But Blandin, a founding partner of his firm and an experienced litigator, billed for \"trial strategy support\" and \"witness trial prep,\" both legitimate uses of his time, even though neither requires an in-court speaking role. That time will be allowed. Chicago concedes that the remaining 60 hours of Blandin's time, representing preparation for and participation in actual trial proceedings, are reasonable. For those reasons, all 288.3 of Blandin's hours will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Gina DeBoni\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Chicago attempts to nibble at the margins once more by objecting to 0.7 hours of DeBoni's 7.40 total hours for time spent reviewing a letter regarding \"hand delivery of motions,\" for preparing a letterhead, and for reviewing her firm's retention agreement with LaPorta. Reviewing the letter and discussing the retention agreement with her client are billable tasks. The balance are administrative and are not. The Court strikes 0.15 hours, allowing DeBoni a total of 7.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Debra Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The 2,788.25 billable hours for Thomas present a sticking point for the parties; after Chicago levied its objections to her time, LaPorta expended eight pages of his thirty-five-page reply trying to knock those objections down. The Court has reviewed Thomas's underlying timesheets and agrees that her time must be substantially reduced. These hours consist of over 13,000 entries spanning 725 pages, so the Court necessarily discusses them here absent a granular level of detail. At least 12% of the entries are overly vague (including entries marked simply \"work on discovery matters\"), and another 8% are duplicative. In reply, LaPorta explains that Thomas was an integral part of his strategy team. But if her work was as substantive as LaPorta says, then these vague and duplicative billing entries needed to say as much. Those entries are what the client sees and form the basis for what the client pays. The Court doubts that many clients would stomach consistently vague entries attended by later, parol explanations. Chicago's other objection centers on Thomas's 72 billed hours for deposition prep, which the City contends to be superfluous given that Thomas attended only one deposition in this case. But there is no requirement that the attorneys who work on the preparation for a deposition need to actually attend. There are many tasks-writing deposition outlines prime among them-that may be completed and properly billed by an attorney other than the one who ultimately conducts the deposition. These 72 hours will not be stricken, but the Court will reduce Thomas's hours, given the above, by 20%, resulting in an allowed total of 2,230.6 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

They provide sufficient insight into his activities and, contrary to Chicago's assertions, his hours should not be docked for including internal firm conferences. Nor is Marasso's habit of block-billing prohibited (though the Court notes it is not ideal).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farfaras v.

Martin Gould\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Chicago objects to 309.85 of the requested 1,410.7 hours for Gould, but these objections are overstated: For the same reasons expressed already, the Court will not dock Gould for his time billed for intrafirm conferences or for reasonable travel time to depositions. However, Gould bills 175.3 hours all under the single description \"Emails Sent: 2014-2017,\" which provides the Court no insight into what Gould was communicating about, or with whom. Given Romanucci's seemingly inadvertent inclusion of irrelevant emails in his own email-time calculation, and the fact that he and Gould are attorneys at the same firm and thus are likely to share billing practices, some reduction is appropriate. As with Romanucci, the court reduces Gould's email time by 25%, resulting in 131.48 hours. The Court deducts 5% from the non-email billables for vague entries. Accounting for these subtractions, the Court allows Gould 1,305.11 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     9. Nicolette Ward\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Ward billed 661.45 hours in this case. 41.05 of those hours had originally been attended by blank entries; upon request from the City, Ward clarified that each of those entries should read \"Review of Email Correspondence.\" This suffers from the same deficiencies as Gould and Romanucci's email entries. The Court accordingly cuts those 41.05 hours by 25%. According to Chicago's detailed review, Ward's time also includes 118.4 hours of duplicative entries and 6.55 hours of administrative tasks (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"docketing\"). LaPorta does not dispute those characterizations. Though the Court has not crawled through every single entry as Chicago professes to have done, the Court's review of Ward's records confirms the general accuracy of the City's count. The Court thus subtracts 50 hours for duplicative entries, as well as the 6.55 hours for administrative tasks. The result is 594.64 billable hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     10. Law Clerk Bryce Hensley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Only one of Chicago's objections holds sway for this biller. On October 26, 2017, Hensley billed 9 hours for \"Trial/Closing.\" But there were no closings that day; instead, the jury deliberated in the morning and rendered their verdict in mid-afternoon. Absent any clarification from Hensley, the Court strikes 8 of those 9 hours on the understanding that Hensley came to court for the delivery of the verdict. His total allowed hours are 691.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     11.

Paralegal Karle Longnion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   To start, Longnion's billables will be reduced by 139.25 hours, which comprise non-compensable time for printing, scanning, preparing binders, and filing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado v.

Ill. 2006). LaPorta also seeks recompense for 116.5 hours for the undated and unspecified preparation and issuing of subpoenas and notices. Even over lengthy litigation like this one, it strains credulity that Longnion spent over 14 days in combined manhours cranking out subpoenas. Though she might have reasonably done so, the Court cannot say she did given the sparsity of her time entries. The Court cuts the 116.5 hours by half. Finally, Longnion block-billed 174.5 hours for \"preparing for and assisting at trial,\" again without specifying the dates or actual tasks she completed. The Court cuts these 174.5 hours by half as well. In sum, LaPorta may bill the City for 170.75 of Longnion's claimed 455.50 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     13. Paralegal Matt Dominguez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The City objects to one entry in which Dominguez claims to have worked 23 hours in one day on \"preparing and issuing trial subpoenas.\" Though the City is incredulous, it is of course possible that Dominguez worked these hours in one day. But because some specificity would have been helpful to the Court's inquiry of determining whether this is a reasonable fee, however, the Court will cut those 23 by 10%. Chicago also seeks to exclude 14.73 of Dominguez's hours submitted by LaPorta only after he sought to fix other deficient entries. These the Court will not exclude. The total allowance for Dominguez is 110.88 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     14. Carl Salvato\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Chicago's first objection to Salvato's time focuses again on those hours spent in pre-\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , state-court litigation. As described above, that litigation was related to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims ultimately pursued in this Court, so the state-court hours will not be stricken. Next, Chicago contends that Salvato's 212.8 hours for deposition prep and attendance should be stricken because Salvato did not participate in those depositions. But again, the fact that Salvato did not conduct these depositions does not mean he played no role in preparing co-counsel or the witness for the same. These hours will be left intact. The Court will strike 3 hours relating to a meeting with press and fundraisers which bears no direct connection to litigating LaPorta's claims. LaPorta is entitled to fees for 463.6 of Salvato's 466.6 billable hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     15.

If you want to stop and staunch the violation of constitutional rights and actually stop cases like this from coming\n   into a courtroom, you will then award full compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   (Tr. 3446:4-3448:13.) Chicago objected to these selections of counsel's closing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The City's argument really consists of two parts: First, that LaPorta's counsel should not have made these comments; and second, that as a result of counsel's closing sentiments or otherwise, the jury inflated their verdict to \"send a message\" to the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   The Court agrees with Chicago as far as the first part of this argument is concerned. Asking the jury to send a message, even within the context of \"fully compensat[ing] LaPorta, was not proper.\" \"[C]ompensatory damages,\" which is all LaPorta is entitled to in this case, \"are limited to actual losses and the argument that the jury should 'send a message' is a punitive damages argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

But it was not that snippet of argument alone that motivated the court to remit the damages award. Rather, the court found the improper argument likely influenced the jury based on the size of the compensatory award and \"the lack of specific, articulable injuries\" the plaintiff had demonstrated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203008095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither of those indications is present here. As the Court discusses at some length in the section below, LaPorta's damages award, while high, was not excessive. Further, LaPorta's injuries provide a stark contrast to\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   . LaPorta adduced evidence at trial making pellucid the extent of his severe and permanent injuries. Though the comments his attorney made in closing were not appropriate, the record and the verdict simply do not support the City's conclusion that the jury took those comments to heart and factored punitive damages into their compensatory award.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , P. LaPorta Tr. 1360:3-1371:7.) He has undergone nine surgeries (P. LaPorta Tr. 1357:18-20) and is afflicted with what his life-care planner described as an \"all-encompassing and devastating injury\" (Howland Tr. 2001:10-15). The shooting caused a traumatic brain injury, reducing LaPorta to a spastic triplegic. (Valika Tr. 1421:5-20; Howland Tr. 1997:12-17.) He is blind in one eye and deaf in one ear, and, though his condition has improved since the immediate aftermath of the shooting, he will suffer pain for the rest of his life. (P. LaPorta Tr. 1388:10-15.) Dr. Senno testified that LaPorta's life expectancy fell somewhere between 6 and 17 years. (Senno Tr. 2411:7-2412:22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Now, Chicago cites to a litany of comparisons for each of the three awards it challenges, though the Court is not convinced these cases demonstrate the contrast Chicago contends. The Court summarizes a selection of comparison cases below, having adjusted the verdict amounts in each to 2017 dollars-the year of LaPorta's judgment-to account for inflation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The City argues the pain and suffering award should be reduced from $15 million to $5.32 million. Verdicts on roughly comparable facts include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Christensen v. Sherman Hospital\n   </em>\n   (Ill. Cir.

C at 7-8.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Finally, the jury awarded LaPorta $4 million for his shortened life expectancy, though they did not specify by exactly how many years they believed the shooting had shortened LaPorta's life. Dr. Senno testified that he expected LaPorta to lose 6-17\n   years of life. (Senno Tr. 2411:7-2412:22.) Presuming the jury credited this evidence, their award reflects somewhere between $666,666 and $235,294 per year. Chicago contends this $4 million award should be trimmed to $1.6 million, citing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Skorek v. Edward-Elmhurst Healthcare\n   </em>\n   (Ill. Cir. Ct. 2017): Plaintiff awarded $7 million for 24-year loss of expected life, or roughly $292,000 per year. (Grp. Ex.

United States\n   </em>\n   , (N.D. Ill. 2010): Plaintiff awarded $505,850.00 for loss of three years, or about $169,000 per year. (Grp. Ex. D at 57.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Within each category of damages described above, LaPorta's verdicts are among the higher awards listed, but they are not out of bounds. His pain and suffering award is about 50% higher than most of the awards described and yet is dwarfed by the $40 million award in\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   . Chicago contends the\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's injuries were more severe than LaPorta's, but the Court is not so sure; to any extent, that plaintiff's injuries do not seem to be LaPorta's injuries thrice-over, which is what the award amount suggests. This type of\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   second-guessing is exactly the danger inherent to comparing verdicts; the exercise necessarily invites courts to step, often inappropriately, into the shoes of the jurors who already weighed the facts. This holds true for the Court's consideration of the loss of normal life award-LaPorta's award is in line with\n   <em>\n    Bun\n   </em>\n   , although that plaintiff was reduced to a vegetative state, a fate which LaPorta has evaded-and the loss of life expectancy award. The final award is particularly problematic for the Court to review given that the jury did not state with precision how many years they believed LaPorta has lost. If they believe he lost 17, then they awarded him $235,294 per year-within the range of these comparisons. If the jury believed instead that LaPorta has lost 6 years, their $666,666 per-year award is above the high end of these past verdicts. But without more guidance from the jury, the Court is left to guess after how they weighed the evidence. The Court should not and cannot take up this mantle. \" '[A]wards in other cases provide a reference point that assists the court in assessing reasonableness; they do not establish a range beyond which awards are necessarily excessive.' To require that a jury's damages award be no bigger than previous awards in similar cases would make every such award ripe for remittitur. There must be room for a jury's award to exceed the relevant range of cases when the facts warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331421\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/539/#p545\">\n    798 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Farfaras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881093\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/558/#p569\">\n    433 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   566 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   In short, as described throughout this opinion, the jury heard extensive testimony concerning LaPorta's severe and permanent injuries.
