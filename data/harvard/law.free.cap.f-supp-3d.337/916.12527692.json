Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City of Imperial Beach is a California General Law City and municipal corporation, duty organized and existing by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The San Diego Unified Port District is a public entity created by the San Diego Unified Port District Act, California Harbors &amp; Navigation Code, Appendix 1, \u00a7 1 et seq. The City of Chula Vista is a California Charter City and municipal corporation, duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California and the Charter of the City of Chula Vista.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The USIBWC is an agency and instrumentality of the United States government charged with addressing transboundary issues arising out of agreements between the United States and Mexico, including the Treaty of February 3, 1944, for the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande (\"1944 Treaty\"). Veolia is a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Massachusetts. Veolia contracts with USIBWC to operate and maintain the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (\"South Bay Plant\") and its associated facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The International Boundary and Water Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The International Boundary and Water Commission (\"Commission\") is a bi-national body comprised of USIBWC and the Comisi\u00f3n Internacional de L\u00edmites y Aguas (\"CILA\") in Mexico. Both sections of the Commission exercise the rights and obligations of their governments under the 1944 Treaty. Under the 1944 Treaty,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Neither Section [USIBWC or CILA] shall assume jurisdiction or control over works located within the limits of the country of the other without the express consent of the Government of the latter. The works constructed, acquired or used in fulfillment of the provisions of this Treaty and located wholly within the territorial limits of either country, although these works may be international in character, shall remain, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Section of the Commission in whose country the works may be situated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Doc. No. 16-1 (\"1944 Treaty\") Art. 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. South Bay Plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Decisions of the Commission are recorded in Minutes. In 1990, the Commission\n   entered into an agreement known as Minute 283 to address the border sanitation problem in San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California. (Doc. No. 16-2 (\"Minute 283\").) Among other things, Minute 283 led to the construction of the South Bay Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The South Bay Plant is located in the Tijuana River Valley in the City of San Diego, San Diego County, California. The South Bay Plant was designed to handle 25 million gallons per day, based on a 30-day average, \"to treat sewage generated in excess of the capacity\" of facilities in Mexico. (Minute 283 at 4.) USIBWC owns the South Bay Plant and Veolia operates it. The South Bay Plant and its associated facilities are subject to the terms of National Pollution and Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permit CA0108929 (the \"NPDES Permit\"). The NPDES Permit authorizes discharges of pollutants at the South Bay Ocean Outfall only, and only after such pollutants have gone through secondary treatment at the South Bay Plant. All other discharges are prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The primary influent to the South Bay Plant is sewage from Mexico. (Doc. No. 13 (\"FAC\") \u00b6 58.) While a CILA Diversion exists in Mexico to divert flows in the Mexican Tijuana River into the transboundary sewage system, it \"frequently malfunctions, allowing sewage to flow past the Diversion and across the U.S./Mexico Border.\" (FAC \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Canyon Collectors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Water that crosses the border into the United States from Mexico west of the flood control conveyance does so at six discernible locations: Yogurt Canyon, Goat Canyon, Smuggler's Gulch, Canyon Del Sol, Silva Drain, and Stewart's Drain. USIBWC owns and Veolia operates canyon collectors at all locations except for Yogurt Canyon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The canyon collectors are among the facilities that operate under and are subject to the South Bay Plant NPDES Permit. They are \"designed to capture and detain polluted wastewater the moment it crosses the U.S./Mexico Border into the United States.\" (FAC \u00b6 65.) Each concrete collector abuts the border and spans the opening of one of the drainage points. The canyon collectors collect and direct wastewater into a shallow detention basin. Wastewater in the detention basin is then directed to a screened drain inlet (\"collector inlet\") regulated by a valve. When open, the water in the detention basin is\n   accepted into a pipe system and conveyed to the South Bay Plant for treatment and eventual discharge at the South Bay Ocean Outfall. When closed, the water cannot drain into the treatment system, and instead overflows the detention basin and travels into the downstream drainages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the downstream waters that receive canyon collector overflow are either \"navigable\" in the traditional sense or are tributaries to the New Tijuana River or the Historical Tijuana River, and ultimately the Tijuana River Estuary and the Pacific Ocean. The pollutants and hazardous wastes \"from Mexican waters,\" (FAC \u00b6 75), \"substantially impact downstream water quality,\" (FAC \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Flood Control Conveyance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1978, USIBWC constructed a flood control conveyance designed to capture as much as 135,000 cubic feet of water per second from the Tijuana River as it crosses the border from Mexico into the United States. (FAC \u00b6 43.) The flood control conveyance is a discrete, concrete-lined conveyance with banked sides that begins at the United States border with Mexico. It directs water, sewage, and other wastes into an area of the Tijuana River Valley west of the historical course of the Tijuana River, in which the Tijuana River had not previously flowed. In doing so, Plaintiffs allege that USIBWC \"significantly upended the natural hydrology of the Tijuana River Valley.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the terminus of the flood control conveyance, its contents are released into a largely undeveloped area of the Tijuana River Valley. According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]hese discharges have carved a new river channel, the New Tijuana River, downstream of the USIBWC Flood Control Conveyance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) The New Tijuana River flows into the \"Historical Tijuana River\" approximately one mile downstream of the flood control conveyance's terminus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The flood control conveyance is not subject to the NPDES Permit, and Veolia is not involved in its operation. Plaintiffs allege that USIBWC routinely and frequently discharges a substantial portion, if not all, of the pollutants and solid and/or hazardous wastes that it captures from the Mexican portion of the Tijuana River and conveys through the flood control conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   USIBWC recently constructed a temporary earthen berm at the border between the United States and Mexico to reduce the volume of flow into the flood control conveyance from the Tijuana River in Mexico, redirecting those flows south into the CILA Diversion. However, Plaintiffs note that the berm is not designed to protect against high volume flows and may wash out with even the slightest amount of precipitation. (FAC \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 27, 2017, Plaintiffs notified Defendants of their intent to sue over Tijuana Valley pollution discharges, as required under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). On March 2, 2018, Plaintiffs initiated this action against Defendants. (Doc. No. 1.) The operative First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") alleges three causes of action: (1) against USIBWC, discharges of pollutants from the flood control conveyance without a NPDES permit in violation of the CWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1342 ; (2) against both Defendants, discharges of pollutants from the canyon collectors in violation of the CWA and the NPDES Permit; and (3) against both Defendants, contribution to an imminent and substantial endangerment in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). (Doc. No. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 12, 2018, USIBWC moved to dismiss the FAC for failure to state a claim. (Doc. No. 15.) That same day, Veolia moved to dismiss the FAC for failure to state a claim and for lack of standing. (Doc. No. 17.) The court permitted Plaintiffs to file a single opposition brief addressing both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Doc. No. 17-1 at 11.) In the FAC, Plaintiffs allege that Veolia has contracted to operate and maintain the South Bay Plant and its associated facilities. (FAC \u00b6 57.) Those facilities include the five canyon collectors. (FAC \u00b6 63.) When the collector inlets are closed, which is controlled by USIBWC and Veolia, or the volume of flow exceeds the detention basin's capacity, water in the detention basin cannot travel to the treatment system, and instead overflows into the downstream drainages. (FAC \u00b6 65.) According to Plaintiffs, Veolia\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   controls whether additional measures are implemented to contain high-volume flows in the canyon collectors, such as by placing sandbags to increase their detention capacity; whether overflow is halted, such as by cleaning debris from a collector inlet or turning off a pump or closing a valve; and whether canyon collector discharges are contained in a localized area and cleaned up. Veolia has failed to contain and clean up such discharges as required by the NPDES Permit, thereby causing the presence of pollutants and/or solid and hazardous wastes in the Tijuana River Valley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under the NPDES Permit, the \"Discharger\" is required to prepare and submit a Spill and Transboundary Wastewater Flow Prevention and Response Plan (\"Prevention/Response Plan\"). (Doc. No. 15-2 (\"NPDES Permit\") at 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Prevention/Response\n   Plan is required to incorporate procedures for containment of spills or transboundary wastewater flows, as well as procedures for cleaning up such spills and flows. (NPDES Permit at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although Veolia is not the source of the pollution, the NPDES Permit under which it operates does require Veolia to work to contain and clean up wastewater that comes into the canyon collectors from Mexico. Failure to do so, as Plaintiffs allege, contributes to the amount of wastewater that makes its way into the Tijuana River Valley and, eventually, the Pacific Ocean.

No. 17-1 at 12.) As a contract operator, Veolia has no duty to fund or build new or upgraded infrastructure. Furthermore, the necessary funds would require approval by Congress, an independent actor not before the court that exercises broad discretion regarding the appropriation of funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Veolia's argument conflates control over what flows into the\n   canyon collectors with control over what happens to the waters after they are collected and detained by the system. The FAC alleges that Veolia's failure to remove debris and contain or clean up wastewater overflow pursuant to the Prevention/Response Plan contributes to the amount of pollution in the Tijuana River Valley. (FAC \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Veolia's alleged failure to contain and clean up wastewater according to the Prevention/Response Plan constitutes a continuing violation of the NPDES Permit. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, although any relief the court would grant Plaintiffs with respect to their claims against Veolia would not end the flow of polluted water from Mexico into the United States, it would mitigate injury to Plaintiffs by reducing the quantity of wastewater that ends up in the Tijuana River Valley and Pacific Ocean. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have Article III standing to sue Veolia under the CWA and RCRA. Therefore, the court denies Veolia's motion to dismiss for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The New Tijuana River is not referenced in the notice of intent to sue letter (\"NOI\") nor the original complaint filed by Plaintiffs. However, Plaintiffs allege in the FAC that there is no natural or historical hydrological connection between the New Tijuana River and the Tijuana River. But for the flood control conveyance, the New Tijuana River would not exist. Because the court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party on a motion to dismiss, the court accepts the existence of the New Tijuana River as a separate water body at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, USIBWC argues that there is no meaningful distinction between the New Tijuana River and the Tijuana River. \"Because the Tijuana River both created, and is the sole source of, the 'New Tijuana River,' the waters of the former and the latter are in every sense the same.\" (Doc. No. 22 at 3.) While this argument is logical and somewhat compelling, the border complicates matters. Plaintiffs argue because the polluted water in the flood control conveyance comes from a body of water in Mexico, it introduces pollutants into the waters of the United States for the first time, thereby adding pollutants in violation of the CWA. The parties could not identify any case, and the court is aware of none, in which a court addressed a CWA claim in which polluted water enters the United States from another country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To deal with this issue, USIBWC argues the flood control conveyance itself is a water of the United States, and thus movement of water between it and the New Tijuana River is the flow of water between the same domestic waterway. This line of argument focuses solely on waters in the United States. USIBWC argues the flood control conveyance is a tributary of the\n   New Tijuana River, Historical Tijuana River, Tijuana River Estuary, and Pacific Ocean.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Headwaters, Inc. v.

(NPDES Permit at 4.) Transboundary flows are defined as \"[w]astewater and other flows that cross the international border from Mexico into the United States.\" (NPDES Permit at A-10.) The NPDES Permit does not address transboundary flows during wet weather events. For dry weather transboundary flows, the NPDES Permit recognizes different categories. A Facilities Spill Event is a \"\n   <em>\n    discharge\n   </em>\n   of treated or untreated wastewater or other material to the environment that occurs from the Discharger's Facilities, including ... the five canyon collector systems.\" (NPDES Permit at 15 (emphasis added).) A Flow Event Type A is a \"dry weather transboundary treated or untreated wastewater or other\n   <em>\n    flow\n   </em>\n   through a conveyance structure ... and not diverted into the canyon collector system for treatment at the\" South Bay Plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants argue the wastewater that flows past the canyon collectors when the\n   collector exceeds capacity is a Flow Event Type A. Because the permit's definition for a Flow Event Type A does not contain the word \"discharge,\" whereas a Facilities Spill Event does, Defendants argue it does not qualify as a discharge under the NPDES Permit. However, the permit states that its prohibition on discharges of waste to any location other than the South Bay Ocean Outfall \"applies to any dry weather\n   <em>\n    discharge\n   </em>\n   of waste\n   <em>\n    overflowing\n   </em>\n   the canyon collectors,\" which Plaintiffs argue includes Flow Events Type A. (NPDES Permit at F-36 (emphasis added).) Both Veolia and USIBWC argue that Plaintiffs' interpretation of the NPDES Permit at F-36 would swallow the distinction between a Facilities Spill Event and a Flow Event Type A. USIBWC would have the court read the phrase \"any dry weather discharge of waste overflowing the canyon collectors\" to mean a Facilities Spill Event only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At oral argument, the court directed the parties' attention to another section of the NPDES Permit that references Facilities Spill Events, Flow Events Type A, and discharges. Page 26 of the NPDES Permit contains a list of notification and reporting requirements. It states that \"Facilities Spill Events and Flow Events Types A and B ... shall be categorized for notification and reporting purposes\" into six different categories. (NPDES Permit at 26.) The description of each of those six categories uses the term \"discharge\" to describe the movement of water. Because this list is for both Facilities Spill Events and Flow Events Type A, it suggests that both events are discharges. The distinction between the two events then would depend on where the wastewater is located in the treatment system. A Facilities Spill Event includes wastewater that has been diverted into the canyon collector system, whereas a Flow Event Type A is \"not diverted into the canyon collector system for treatment.\" (NPDES Permit at 15.) Although USIBWC argues that the use of \"discharge\" in this section of the NPDES Permit is in a generic sense, there is no evidence within the permit that \"discharge\" is used generically in some sections but specifically in others. Consequently, it appears from the NPDES Permit that a Flow Event Type A can be a discharge that violates the terms of the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Based on the court's reading of the NPDES Permit, Plaintiffs adequately allege in the FAC that Defendants discharge water from a location other than the South Bay Ocean Outfall, thereby violating the terms of the NPDES Permit. Accordingly, the court denies Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' second cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Accordingly, the court will address contribution and causation together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mexico's Wastewater Collection and Treatment System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that USIBWC has violated the RCRA because it \"has contributed and continues to contribute to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and monitoring of the transnational wastewater collection and treatment system\n   <em>\n    that originates in Mexico\n   </em>\n   ... causing sewage and other solid and/or hazardous waste to enter the United States and discharge from the USIBWC Flood Control Conveyance.\" (FAC \u00b6 121 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   USIBWC argues that it cannot be held liable under the RCRA for the state of water treatment systems in Mexico because it is not actively involved in and does not have any degree of control over those systems. Under the 1944 Treaty, \"[n]either Section [USIBWC or CILA] shall assume jurisdiction or control over works located within the limits of the country of the other without the express consent of the Government of the latter.\" (1944 Treaty Art. 2.) Plaintiffs do not allege in the FAC that Mexico has granted USIBWC control over the treatment plant in Tijuana. Under Minute 283, the operation and maintenance of the treatment plant in Tijuana \"shall be charged to Mexico,\" not USIBWC. (Minute 283 at 5 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs did not contest or otherwise address this argument in their opposition brief or at oral argument. Therefore, the court grants USIBWC's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' third cause of action as it relates to any treatment systems in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Flood Control Conveyance, Canyon Collectors, and Other Infrastructure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"have systematically and routinely contributed to the past and/or present handling, storage, treatment, transport, and/or disposal of hazardous and/or solid wastes in the Tijuana River Valley ... through operating, maintaining, and/or controlling the USIBWC Flood Control Conveyance, canyon collectors, and other infrastructure.\" (FAC \u00b6 120.) Defendants argue that they do not contribute to the pollution within the meaning of the RCRA because the polluted waters originate in Mexico and flow into the United States by gravity, unaided by USIBWC or Veolia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Flood Control Conveyance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that USIBWC handles waste in the flood control conveyance by actively capturing polluted water from the Tijuana River in Mexico and transporting it approximately nine-tenths of a mile for disposal at the New Tijuana River. Additionally, USIBWC handles waste in the flood control conveyance by constructing berms from waste-laden sediment to temporarily block the entrance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 62.) Through the construction of the berms, Plaintiffs argue the USIBWC exerts some level of control over the amount of wastewater that flows into and out of the flood control conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   USIBWC asserts that Plaintiffs' argument falsely equates USIBWC's control over its infrastructure with control over waste that passes through that infrastructure. The flood control structure does not enable USIBWC to remove pollutants from the water that passes through it, and USIBWC does not exert any control over waste that enters the Tijuana River in Mexico and flows across the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   At best, USIBWC transports waste through the flood control conveyance. However, that transportation is passive in nature, merely permitting the waste from Mexico to flow through the system. The FAC does not allege that USIBWC is in any way the source of the wastewater that eventually travels into and through the flood control conveyance. Nor does the FAC alleged that USIBWC actively handles or treats any wastewater in the flood control conveyance. As a result, Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that USIBWC plays a \"more active role with a more direct connection to the waste\" that flows through the flood control conveyance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825694\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/846/#p851\">\n    654 F.3d at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Canyon Collectors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants argue that neither USIBWC nor Veolia exercise control over waste that flows through the canyon collectors but is not diverted to one of the drains for treatment at the South Bay Plant. The South Bay Plant has a capacity limited to 25 million gallons per day, and the NPDES Permit sets the effluent limit at the same. (NPDES Permit at 5.) Defendants actively transport, handle, and treat the water that enters the canyon collectors' drains and is pumped to the South Bay Plant. However, Defendants cannot actively control wastewater beyond the limitations of the current infrastructure. As with the flood control conveyance, the transportation between the border and the drainage points past the canyon collectors involves passive, not active, transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In a section of the opposition brief addressing standing, Plaintiffs themselves note the \"critical distinction between controlling what flows\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   the Canyon Collector systems (over which Veolia has no control), and what happens to the waters\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they are collected\n   <em>\n    and detained\n   </em>\n   by the system.\" (Doc. No. 20 at 32 (italics in original, underlined emphasis added).) Wastewater that is not detained by the canyon collectors, like the wastewater that is never detained in the flood control conveyance, would flow into the Tijuana River Valley and make its way to the Pacific Ocean regardless of Defendants' actions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zands v.

Determining whether USIBWC and Veolia have violated the terms of the NPDES Permit requires the court to examine the contents of the NPDES Permit. Defendants each attached a copy of the NPDES Permit to their respective motions to dismiss, and no party disputes its authenticity. Therefore, the court may consider the contents of the NPDES Permit without converting the motions into motions for summary judgment under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
