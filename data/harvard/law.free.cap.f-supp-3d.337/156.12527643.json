(ECF No. 22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from the amended complaint (ECF No. 9) and the exhibits attached to the parties' briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Brand and Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is \"the recognized leader\" in the industry of \"do-it-yourself\" kits for replenishing lost chemical refrigerant in vehicle air conditioners, a process called \"recharging.\" (ECF No. 9 \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff's products allow consumers to add refrigerant to their own vehicles, avoiding the need to take the car to be serviced by a professional mechanic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff sells its products at major hardware and automotive supply retail stores throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff also maintains three websites that provide consumers with instructions for using its kits and other information about its products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's brands of do-it-yourself refrigerant kits and refill products are sold under several trademarks, including \"HIGH MILEAGE,\" \"A/C PRO,\" \"ARCTIC FREEZE,\" \"SUB-ZERO,\" \"EZ CHILL,\" and \"BIG CHILL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") has issued Plaintiff two federal trademark registrations for the \"HIGH MILEAGE\" mark, one for the word mark HIGH MILEAGE for use in connection with \"refrigerant chemical preparations for use in connection with automobile air conditioners,\" and one for a stylized mark displaying the word HIGH in diagonal, upward sloping letters above the word MILEAGE, which is also displayed in diagonal, upward sloping letters in \"an odometer style format.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) The HIGH MILEAGE marks were registered in 2011 and 2012, respectively, but Plaintiff and its predecessor IDQ have sold refrigerant products under the marks since at least as early as 2004, using online, print, and in-store advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) The HIGH MILEAGE marks were originally registered to IDQ but were acquired by Plaintiff during its merger with IDQ in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff also uses certain trade dress on its \"A/C PRO\" and \"HIGH MILEAGE\" families of products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff's A/C PRO trade dress includes a black canister with a large black and white A/C PRO logo along the top of the front face of the canister with a black and white image of a man positioned behind the logo, a blue banner along the middle of the canister, and a set of icons and short phrases along the bottom of the canister summarizing the benefits of the product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Certain versions of Plaintiff's A/C PRO products also include a banner with an image of a clock across the top of the canister. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Others display the HIGH MILEAGE word mark across the front face of the canister. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also uses a HIGH MILEAGE trade dress for certain\n   products, which prominently displays the stylized HIGH MILEAGE mark in red and white on the front face of the canister. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff has sold do-it-yourself refrigerant products featuring its BIG CHILL and ARCTIC FREEZE marks since 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff's BIG CHILL product line features a \"prominent mountain design mark and trade dress,\" displaying a snow-covered mountain behind the BIG CHILL logo on the face of the product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's ARCTIC FREEZE products have featured a blue trade dress since 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) In 2014, Plaintiff commissioned the design of new ARCTIC FREEZE product labels and advertising materials featuring images of snow-covered mountains. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff began distributing ARCTIC FREEZE products with the redesigned label featuring the snow-covered mountain design mark in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2017, Plaintiff filed applications with the U.S. Copyright Office to register as creative works the labels featured on its A/C PRO and HIGH MILEAGE-branded products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties' Relationship and the Consulting Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2007, refrigerant product supplier E.F. Products, L.P. (\"EF\"), merged with Interdynamics, Inc. (\"Interdynamics\") to form IDQ, Plaintiff's corporate predecessor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) At that time, Defendant William Quest was employed as President of EF and Defendant Michael Quest served as Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer of EF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) EF used the HIGH MILEAGE marks before it merged with Interdynamics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) After the merger, the marks were transferred to IDQ, and then to Plaintiff after Plaintiff's merger with IDQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following the merger, Michael Quest remained employed by IDQ as Executive Vice President from 2007 to 2009, and then provided IDQ with consulting services in connection with the sales of refrigerant products from 2009 to 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Paragraph 42 of the amended complaint alleges that Michael Quest's work as a consultant for IDQ was governed by a consulting agreement (\"the Consulting Agreement\") executed on July 28, 2009. The Consulting Agreement provided that Michael Quest would not compete with IDQ until January 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) It also contained confidentiality provisions requiring him to keep confidential certain information learned during his employment with IDQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The confidentiality provision was to remain in effect indefinitely after the termination of the Consulting Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The complaint does not attach or, except in paragraph 42, refer to the Consulting Agreement, but Defendants have attached a copy to their motion to dismiss and compel arbitration. Article VII, Section 7.1 of the Consulting Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 7.1\n   <em>\n    Remedy\n   </em>\n   . Should Consultant engage in or perform, either directly or indirectly, any of the acts prohibited by Article IV or, in any other way, violate such Article, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled to full injunctive relief, to be issued by any competent court of equity, enjoining and restraining Consultant and each and every other person, firm, organization, association, or corporation concerned therein, from the continuance of such violative acts. The foregoing remedy shall not be deemed to limit or prevent the exercise by the Company of any or all further rights and remedies which may be available to the Company hereunder or at law or in equity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Article IV of the Consulting Agreement sets forth the non-compete and confidentiality obligations referred to in paragraph\n   42 of the complaint, as well as other obligations. Article VII, Section 7.2 of the Agreement sets forth the arbitration clause on which Defendants' motion relies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 7.2\n   <em>\n    Arbitration\n   </em>\n   . Subject to Section 7.1 of this Agreement, the only mechanism to settle any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled [sic] by binding arbitration in Garland, Texas, before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in the federal courts located in Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (ECF No. 23-2 at 7.) Article VII, Section 7.11 provides that it \"is binding on [Michael Quest] and [IDQ] and their successors and assigns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Brand and Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2014, William and Michael Quest allegedly co-founded the \"Avalanche\" division of Defendant TSI Products, Inc., which also produces automotive refrigerant products. (ECF No. 9 \u00b6 38.) Plaintiff alleges that in January 2015, TSI launched the family of \"Avalanche\" refrigerant products featuring a blue and white trade dress with a label design and snow-covered mountain design mark similar to those used by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Plaintiff alleges that TSI employed former employees of Plaintiff who \"may ... have had access to information and designs related to Plaintiff's 2014 ARCTIC FREEZE redesign project during their employment by Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Since 2015, Avalanche products have competed directly with Plaintiff's BIG CHILL and ARCTIC FREEZE products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants launched a new line of premium refrigerant products, the Avalanche Black Diamond products, in April 2016. These products allegedly compete directly with Plaintiff's A/C PRO line of premium products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Plaintiff alleges that one of these products uses a \"counterfeit imitation of Plaintiff's HIGH MILEAGE Marks,\" and replaced the blue and white color scheme used on Defendant's mid-tier refrigerant products with a dark grey or black label resembling Plaintiff's A/C Pro and High Mileage trade dress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) Plaintiff alleges that these products feature a stylized snow-covered mountain logo resembling Plaintiff's ARCTIC FREEZE mountain mark and compete directly with Plaintiff's ARCTIC FREEZE products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) The products also feature the words \"HIGH MILEAGE\" in upward-sloping diagonal lettering and the word \"MILEAGE\" in an \"odometer format.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Plaintiff alleges that TSI copied its trade dress and trademarks and used them on Avalanche products with the intent to trade on Plaintiff's recognition in the market and goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") provides that \"a written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants argue that the arbitration clause in the Consulting Agreement executed by Plaintiff's corporate predecessor and Michael Quest requires Plaintiff's claims to be resolved by arbitration. Defendants first argue that the parties intended for the arbitrator to determine whether this case must be arbitrated. In the alternative, Defendants argue that the arbitration clause is broad and that the allegations in the amended complaint touch matters governed by the Consulting Agreement, and therefore fall within the scope of the arbitration clause. Defendants also argue that TSI and William Quest are entitled to arbitration of Plaintiff's claims against them, despite not having signed the Consulting Agreement; as noted (footnote 3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), I do not reach this last argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

If certainty was required, the inquiry into who should decide arbitrability would be indistinguishable from the inquiry into arbitrability itself - both would turn on whether the dispute actually fell within the carve-out provision. In cases such as this one where the answer was not obvious, applying such a standard would require the litigants to embark with the court on a detailed analysis of the arbitration agreement and then, if the court finally concluded that it was for the arbitrator to decide arbitrability, travel the same road with the arbitrator. Such a drawn-out, duplicative process would run counter to the policy of economy embodied in the Federal Arbitration Act and the more general principle that the rules governing who decides should be simple and clear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez de Quijas v.

For these reasons, I take the Second Circuit's use of \"arguably\" in this context to call for a considerably less searching inquiry than a fulsome analysis of whether the parties' dispute-more specifically, the part of it by which the Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief-actually falls within the carve-out provision. Here, it \"arguably\" does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 7.1 provides that IDQ \"shall be entitled to full injunctive relief, to be issued by any competent court of equity\" in the event Michael Quest should \"engage in or perform, either directly or indirectly,\" any acts that violate Article IV of the Consulting Agreement. (ECF No. 23-2 at 7.) That Article contains Michael Quest's confidentiality, non-compete, and non-solicitation obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) The amended complaint asks the Court to permanently enjoin Defendants from, among other conduct, infringing Plaintiff's marks and unfairly competing with Plaintiff. (ECF No. 9 at 36-37.) If that alleged infringement or unfair competition involves acts that violate Article IV, then, under Section 7.1, Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief belongs in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The complaint does not suggest that Michael Quest violated the non-compete or non-solicitation obligations of Article IV,\n   but it does invoke the confidentiality obligation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Following the merger [between EF and Interdynamics], Michael Quest remained employed by IDQ [the Plaintiff's corporate predecessor] as Executive Vice President from 2007-2009 and continued to provide consulting services in connection with the sales of refrigerant products to IDQ from 2009-2011. Michael Quest's employment as a consultant for IDQ was governed by a consulting agreement executed on July 28, 2009 (\"Consulting Agreement\") which contained a non-compete clause with IDQ until January 1, 2014. This Consulting Agreement also subjected Michael Quest to ongoing confidentiality provisions regarding confidential information learned of during his employment at IDQ. The Consulting Agreement expressly states that this confidentiality provision remains in effect indefinitely after the termination of the Confidentiality Agreement, and is not tied in any way to the non-compete clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (ECF No. 9 \u00b6 42.) This is the only express reference to the Consulting Agreement in the entire 40-page complaint. Nonetheless, paragraph 56 hearkens back to this reference in alleging that \"Defendants' conduct supports a finding of willful infringement.... [B]y virtue of Michael Quest's role as a consultant for IDQ's refrigerant business, Michael Quest has actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's prior rights in its HIGH MILEAGE Marks and actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's sale\" of its products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46 (alleging Michael Quest's \"extensive knowledge of Plaintiff's trademarks, trade dress and products\" as one of the bases for the allegation that \"the resemblance between the marks and trade dress on Plaintiff's ARCTIC FREEZE products and the marks and trade dress used on Avalanche's products is not the result of mere coincidence\"). As I discuss in the next section, the complaint's express reference, in paragraph 42, to the confidentiality provisions of Article IV is not, in the end, necessary to support the allegation, in paragraph 56, that Michael Quest \"has actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's prior rights in its HIGH MILEAGE Marks and actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's sale\" of its branded products and, thus, not essential to the claim that he willfully infringed Plaintiff's intellectual property rights; nor is it necessary to support the allegation, in paragraph 46, that he had \"extensive knowledge of Plaintiff's trademarks, trade dress and products.\" Nonetheless, the allegation in paragraph 42 about Quest's confidentiality obligations steers the case close enough to a theory that his infringement has relied, in part, on his misuse of confidential information in violation of Article IV to bring Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief against infringement \"arguably\" within the carve-out for injunctions against acts violating Article IV. Further, given the purposes of the injunctive relief contemplated by Article IV, including the need to enable Plaintiff to prevent or put a prompt end to unauthorized disclosures of its proprietary information, there is reason to doubt that the parties intended that Plaintiff would first have to call upon an arbitrator, who would lack the power to afford such prompt equitable relief, to decide the arbitrability of disputes that arguably implicated the need for such relief. In any event, because the issue is at least debatable, I conclude that the Defendants have not borne their burden of showing that the parties clearly and unmistakably delegated the decision concerning arbitrability to the arbitrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I thus turn to the question\n   whether the parties' dispute actually falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The unfair competition, false advertising, and false patent marking claims are based on allegations that (1) Defendants \"are using counterfeit and infringing marks imitating the HIGH MILEAGE Marks and the ARCTIC FREEZE Mountain Mark in connection with the advertising and sale of refrigerant products in a manner that creates a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers, thereby inducing purchasers ... to believe\" products sold by Defendants are somehow connected to Plaintiff (ECF No. 9 \u00b6 82, 110); (2) Defendants have made false or misleading statements that Defendants' products \"provide '# 1 SUPER CHILL,' 'Maximum Cooling,\" and 'extend[ ] the life of [a customer's] system\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.); and (3) Defendants falsely marked their unpatented products with the phrase \"patent pending.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94, 111, 115, 126-29.)

These claims are thus not arbitrable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I reach the same conclusion as to the unjust enrichment claim. In Count Ten, Plaintiff alleges that by selling its competing products, Defendants have traded on the value and goodwill that Plaintiff generated in its HIGH MILEAGE Marks and the ARCTIC FREEZE Mountain Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-21.) Thus, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants diverted revenue to which Plaintiff is entitled and generated benefits at Plaintiff's expense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) The unjust enrichment claim does not depend on the Consulting Agreement either. Plaintiff could make such a claim regardless whether Michael Quest had had a relationship with Plaintiff or its predecessors. Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that it or its predecessors have been using some of the marks at issue, and thereby generating goodwill, since as early as 2005 - years before Michael Quest entered into the Consulting Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) The unjust enrichment claim is therefore also not arbitrable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Trademark, Trade Dress, and Copyright infringement and Counterfeiting Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff's Lanham Act and common law trademark, trade dress infringement and counterfeiting, as well as his Copyright Act claims (Counts One, Two, Four, Six, and Seven), present a closer call, because they include a claim of willfulness based, in part, on Michael Quest's prior consulting relationship with IDQ. (ECF No. 9 \u00b6\u00b6 42, 56). They also suggest that the infringement and counterfeiting resulted in part from Michael Quest's \"extensive knowledge\" of Plaintiff's products and intellectual property (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46), which he allegedly gained, in part, from his time as a consultant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The infringement and counterfeiting claims allege that Defendants \"copied Plaintiff's HIGH MILEAGE Marks\" and \"Plaintiff's ARCTIC FREEZE Mountain Mark\" and used them to market counterfeit and infringing products with a \"deliberate intent to cause confusion ... among prospective customers.\" (ECF No. 9 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 104.) Similarly, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have \"made unauthorized use of spurious marks\" that are \"substantially indistinguishable from Plaintiff's federally registered HIGH MILEAGE Marks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) With respect to trade dress and the labels that form the basis of the copyright claim, Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants have used in commerce trade dress that imitates\" Plaintiff's trade dress and \"imitate[d] the red diagonal lettering, the display of the word MILEAGE in an odometer format and the black background aspects of the A/C Pro Trade Dress and the High Mileage Trade Dress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88, 50.) Defendants' use of the marks and trade dress has allegedly created a likelihood of confusion and deception among actual and prospective consumers and has damaged Plaintiff's goodwill as a result, and Defendants' labels are \"substantially similar to one or more of Plaintiff's Creative Works.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 74, 88, 101, 105-06.) Plaintiff also alleges that\n   Defendants had actual knowledge of Plaintiff's rights in this intellectual property, and therefore that Defendants' conduct was willful and deliberate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71, 78, 90.) With respect to Michael Quest, Plaintiff bases the willfulness claim, in part, on the allegation that he gained \"actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's prior rights in its HIGH MILEAGE Marks and actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's sale\" of its branded products \"by virtue of [his] role as a consultant for IDQ's refrigerant business,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56), a role the complaint alleges was governed by the Consulting Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The allegation of Quest's \"extensive knowledge\" about Plaintiff's \"trademarks, trade dress and products\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46) does not specify where he gained that knowledge, but it is reasonable to read that allegation as also being based in part on Quest's position as a consultant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the end, however, I conclude that the allegation that Quest gained \"actual knowledge\" of Plaintiff's intellectual property rights and products through his work as a consultant and later allegedly willfully misused that knowledge to infringe Plaintiff's products does not implicate the rights or obligations of the parties to the Consulting Agreement or call upon the Court to construe it. True, that allegation includes a specific reference to the Consulting Agreement, which, according to the complaint, \"subjected Michael Quest to ongoing confidentiality provisions regarding confidential information learned of during his employment at IDQ,\" provisions that remain in effect indefinitely. (Id. \u00b6 42.) As noted above, that is a reference to Article IV of the Consulting Agreement, which includes a provision requiring Quest to maintain the confidentiality of \"Confidential Information,\" a term defined to include \"business and marketing plans, strategies, employee lists, ... know-how, confidential records, ... trade secrets, processes, policies and/or personnel, ... intellectual property, ... marketing information, sales techniques, business organization, and other proprietary and confidential information relating to [Plaintiff].\" (ECF No. 23-2 at 4.) Article IV requires him to maintain the confidentiality of all such information \"during the Term\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and at all times thereafter\" \"except to the extent that ... the information becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Consultant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Further, Michael Quest acknowledges in the Consulting Agreement that, \"as a result of [his] service with [Plaintiff], he will obtain, and that as a result of his prior employment with [Plaintiff] he has obtained, secret, proprietary and confidential information concerning\" Plaintiff's business. (ECF No. 23-2 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although the complaint references the confidentiality obligations in Article IV, neither the willfulness claim (ECF No. 9 \u00b6\u00b6 42, 56) nor the claim that the infringement resulted from Quest's \"extensive knowledge\" of Plaintiff's rights and products (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46) depends on these obligations. More specifically, neither claim turns on whether the information Michael Quest learned as a consultant about the Plaintiff's products and intellectual property rights was \"confidential\" within the\n   meaning of Article IV. To show willfulness, Plaintiff need show only that Michael Quest did, in fact, learn the information at some point before the infringement occurred and that he was aware of the infringing activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Island Software and Computer Service, Inc. v.

Plaintiff does not need to show that the information is \"confidential\" under Article IV or that Quest violated Article IV to establish these elements. It will be the fact that Michael Quest worked for Plaintiff -as an employee and later as a consultant - and not the content of the agreement governing their relationship that makes it more likely that he acquired knowledge of Plaintiff's products and intellectual property and, thus, acted willfully or actually copied Plaintiff's products or packaging. Even if Plaintiff marshals as evidence Quest's acknowledgement in the Consulting Agreement that \"he will obtain [and] ... has obtained, secret, proprietary and confidential information concerning the business of the Company\" (ECF No. 23-2 at 4), that would not require the Court to construe or apply the provisions of the agreement in order to resolve Plaintiff's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor would it implicate the parties' rights and obligations under the Consulting Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CardioNet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069187\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/165/#p175\">\n    751 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   175 n.9 (\"[T]he fact that the Complaint references the Agreements extensively is of no moment....

In Section III.A., I concluded that the defendants have not shown that the parties \"clearly and unmistakably\" delegated the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator because of the complaint's allegations that \"arguably\" suggest conduct violating Article IV of the Agreement and thus, to the extent the complaint seeks injunctive relief, arguably fall within the carve-out for court resolution. In Section III.B., I concluded that the adjudication of this case will not ultimately require an interpretation of Article IV and thus does not actually fall within the carve-out or any other part of the Agreement; and I reached this conclusion with \"positive assurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   I also conclude, however, that, this apparent tension is reconcilable based on the Second Circuit's teachings on the two issues involved. The resolution of the first issue - who decides - is driven here by three factors: (1) the parties' selection in the agreement of two different fora for different kinds of disputes, (2) the presence in the complaint of allegations that \"arguably\" make the injunctive part of the case the type of dispute the agreement commits to courts, and (3) the default rule that where the parties did not \"clearly and unmistakably\" delegate the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, it must remain with the court. The resolution of the second issue - whether part or all of the dispute is arbitrable - is driven by a different set of considerations set forth in Second\n   Circuit case law and discussed above. Ultimately, these considerations train on whether adjudicating each claim in the case will actually require the court to construe the agreement; here, the question is not what is \"arguable\" but whether any element of a claim will actually entail interpreting a provision of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, while it may seem counter-intuitive to hold that part of a dispute \"arguably\" implicates the carve-out provision in the agreement but that adjudicating the dispute will ultimately not call upon the court to interpret the agreement, I find that doing so in this case is consistent with both the governing law and the parties' intentions as expressed in the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' motion to compel arbitration (ECF No. 22) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In the alternative, Defendants have also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (ECF No. 24) and to transfer venue to the Northern District of Texas (ECF No. 26). I address those motions in separate rulings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Defendants style the motion to compel arbitration as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute, however, does not affect the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Here, Plaintiff's federal statutory claims clearly supply the Court with federal question jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Consol. Precision Prods. Corp. v. Gen. Elec.

I am unaware of any case-and the parties have cited none-in which a court found that two different decision makers, a court and an arbitrator, should decide the issue of arbitrability as to different parts of the same dispute; that would needlessly complicate the threshold inquiry into who decides. As long as some part of the dispute \"arguably\" falls within a carve-out reserved for court resolution, then the presumption of judicial determination of questions of arbitrability should apply with respect to the entire dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The complaint also alleges that Quest was an employee of IDQ from 2007 to 2009 (and before that, an employee of IDQ's corporate predecessor, by way of acquisition), and that he gained actual and constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's intellectual property in that way as well.
