BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit originated in the Eastern District of Missouri when NTD I, LLC (\"NTD\"), North Tower Development, LLC, and Paul Weismann (\"Weismann\") filed a complaint on August 1, 2016, asserting various claims against Alliant Asset Management Company, LLC, Alliant Capital, Ltd., Alliant Credit Facility, Ltd., Alliant Credit Facility ALP, LLC, Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd., and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC related to a limited partnership agreement between the parties [1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following this Court's dismissal of some of the claims, Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd. and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC (\"Counterclaim Plaintiffs\") asserted the following counterclaims in their Third Amended Counterclaims: (1) declaratory relief against NTD and Weismann stating they failed to cause Rental Achievement as required under the Limited Partnership Agreement; (2) breach of contract and injunctive relief against NTD and Weismann for withdrawing funds from the operating deficit reserve account and the replacement reserve account without approval of the Administrative Limited Partner;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) breach of contract and injunctive relief against NTD, Weismann, and WC Orange (\"WCO\") because WCO purchased the debts of the partnership without the consent of the Administrative Limited Partner and WCO is related to the General Partner; (4) breach of fiduciary duty and injunctive relief against NTD, Weismann, and WCO by allowing, participating in, and facilitating the purchase of the Partnership's debt by WCO; (5) breach of contract and declaratory relief against NTD and Weismann for failure to repair material deficiencies and/or non-conformities in the physical property of Water Tower Place; and (6) breach of contract and specific\n   performance against NTD and Paul Weismann for failure to pay for any development deficits which are incurred by the partnership prior to rental achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   NTD, Weismann, and WCO (\"Counterclaim Defendants\") filed the instant motion for summary judgment on May 8, 2018, seeking an order: (i) granting summary judgment against Defendants on Counts III and IV of the Amended Counterclaims; and (ii) granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper and just [105]. In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Counterclaim Plaintiffs are seeking a declaration Weismann and NTD breached fiduciary duties to the Limited Partners and are requesting injunctive relief prohibiting WCO from exercising its mortgage rights against Water Tower Place, and imposing a constructive trust upon that mortgage interest [104].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A. Uncontroverted Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Water Tower Place, L.P. (the \"Partnership\") is a Missouri limited liability partnership formed on January 9, 2006 [107 \u00b6 1; 125, p. 1 \u00b6 1]. NTD is a for-profit Missouri limited liability company formed as a partnership by and among its members on February 1, 2006 [107 \u00b6 2; 125, p. 2 \u00b6 2]. NTD was formed to be, and is the General Partner of the Partnership [107 \u00b6 3; 125, p. 2 \u00b6 3]. When NTD was formed, Weismann directly acquired and thereafter directly owned twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding NTD membership interest [107 \u00b6 4; 125, p. 2 \u00b6 4]. At the time of formation, four other natural persons, unrelated to Weismann by blood, marriage, or other familial relationship, separately and directly acquired and thereafter directly owned their respective NTD membership interests totaling the remaining eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding General Partner membership interest [107 \u00b6 5; 125, p. 2 \u00b6 5]. All profits and losses and all other tax attributes of NTD are allocated among the General Partner members on the basis of those members' respective percentage of interest in the General Partner [107 \u00b6 6; 125, p. 3 \u00b6 6]. Weismann testified he makes decisions for NTD [130 \u00b6 2; 125, p. 8 \u00b6 2, 4]. NTD's offices are in Weismann's offices in Connecticut [130 \u00b6 3; 125, p. 8 \u00b6 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Counterclaim Plaintiffs, Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd. and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC, also known as the Limited Partners, are the limited partners of the Partnership [107 \u00b6 7; 125, p. 3 \u00b6 7]. The General Partner and the Limited Partners are the parties to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated July 1, 2006 ( \"LPA\") [107 \u00b6 9; 125, p. 3 \u00b6 9]. The Limited Partners have never rescinded the LPA [107, \u00b6 10, 125, p.3, \u00b6 10]. The Partnership financed the acquisition\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and rehabilitation of the property by a 2006 issuance of tax-exempt Multifamily Housing Revenue Bonds identified in Schedule A of the LPA to create state and federal low income tax credits (the \"Bonds\") [107 \u00b6 11; 125, p. 3 \u00b6 11]. The Partnership Bond obligations are secured by, among other instruments, loan agreements and covenants (the \"Bond Loan Agreement\"), and mortgages granted by the Partnership to the Bond holder (the \"Bond Mortgage\") [107 \u00b6 12, 125, p. 4 \u00b6 12]. At the time of the issuance of the Bonds, U.S. Bank National Association (\"USB\") was the holder of the Bonds and the Bond Mortgage [107 \u00b6 13, 125, p. 4 \u00b6 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 8, 2010, Richard Deters, Jr., Executor of the Estate of Richard Deters, Sr., an original General Partner member, assigned the decedent's seven\n   percent (7%) NTD membership interest directly to Weismann [107 \u00b6 14; 125, p. 4 \u00b6 14]. On or about September 13, 2010, George Kruntchev, an original NTD member, assigned his thirty percent (30%) NTD membership interest directly to Weismann [107 \u00b6 15; 125, p. 4 \u00b6 15]. On and at all times after September 13, 2010, Weismann has directly owned fifty-seven percent (57%) of the NTD membership interests [107 \u00b6 16; 125, p. 4 \u00b6 16]. Before, on, and at all times after September 13, 2010, the other two remaining original NTD members, both of whom are natural persons unrelated to Weismann by blood, marriage, or other familial relationship, have owned thirty percent (30%) and thirteen percent (13%), respectively, of the NTD membership interests [107 \u00b6 17; 125, p. 5 \u00b6 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   WCO is a for-profit Delaware limited liability company (f/k/a/ WC Mapleton LLC) formed on January 19, 2016 [107 \u00b6 19; 125, p. 5 \u00b6 19]. At the time WCO was formed, PAW Associates Properties, LLC (\"Properties\"), a Delaware limited liability company, directly acquired and has thereafter directly owned one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding membership interest in WCO [107 \u00b6 21; 125, p. 6 \u00b6 21]. PAW Associates, LLC (\"Associates\"), a Delaware limited liability company, has at all times directly owned one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding membership interest in Properties [107 \u00b6 22; 125, p. 6 \u00b6 22]. Weismann and Sam Brill make the business decisions for Properties\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for WCO [130 \u00b6 10, 11; 125, p. 9 \u00b6 10, 11].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brill was formerly the Chief Investment Officer of Weismann Capital, and Weismann is the owner and chief executive [130 \u00b6 8, 9; 125, p. 8 \u00b6 8, p. 9 \u00b6 9].\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Weismann and Brill are based in Weismann's Connecticut office [130 \u00b6 11; 125 p. 9 \u00b6 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Paul A. Weismann Descendants' Trust (the \"Grantor Trust\"), a Delaware grantor trust created by Weismann's father, the late Dietrich Weismann, for the benefit of Weismann and his descendants, has at all times directly owned one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding membership interest in Associates [107 \u00b6 23; 125, p. 6 \u00b6 23]. Weismann and his wife are the co-trustees of the Grantor Trust [130 \u00b6 6; 125, p. 8 \u00b6 6]. The only beneficiaries of the Grantor Trust are Weismann and his three minor children [107 \u00b6 24; 125, p. 6 \u00b6 24].\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 28, 2016, WCO purchased from USB all of its right, title, and interest in\n   and to the Bonds and the Bond Mortgage, and all of the USB rights under the Bond Loan Agreement pursuant to a Purchase Agreement of the same date [107 \u00b6 25; 125, p. 7 \u00b6 25]. The WCO purchase of the Bonds, the Bond Mortgage, and the rights under the Bond loan Agreement is only one of the private real estate investments held by WCO [107 \u00b6 21; 125, p. 7 \u00b6 26]. Weismann does not, nor has he ever directly or indirectly owned any stock, membership, or other equity interest in either of the Limited Partners [107 \u00b6 27; 125, p. 7 \u00b6 29]. The General Partner, Properties, Associates, WCO, and Grantor Trust have not, nor have they ever directly or indirectly owned any stock, membership, or other equity interest in either of the Limited Partners [107 \u00b6\u00b6 27-32; 125, pp. 7-8 \u00b6\u00b6 27-32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2016, WCO purchased the Mortgage Note on the Partnership with a face price of $3.7 million for $2.1 million [130 \u00b6 12; 125, p. 9 \u00b6 12]. On April 27, 2018, WCO sent a notice of loan acceleration to the General Partner, the Partnership, and the Limited Partners [130 \u00b6 17; 125, p. 9 \u00b6 17]. On May 7, 2018, Limited Partners made a demand pursuant to Weismann's Guaranty Agreement and the terms of the LPA that Weismann pay the full amount of the accelerated loan [130 \u00b6 22; 125, p. 10 \u00b6 22]. Weisman rejected this demand [130 \u00b6 22; 125, p. 10 \u00b6 22]. Weismann viewed the relationship with Counterclaim Plaintiffs, in particular, as an \"adversarial relationship\" [130 \u00b6 21; 125, p. 10 \u00b6 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Acquisition of the Mortgage Bonds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Counterclaim Defendants assert the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of them on Count III of Counterclaim Plaintiffs' Third Amended Counterclaims. Count III includes the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Weismann guaranteed each and every obligation of the General Partner under the LPA and he is bound by the prohibition against acquiring indebtedness of the Partnership. WCO is an entity related to the General Partner and controlled by Weismann. To induce the bank to sell the debt to WCO, Weismann made certain representations and warranties on behalf of the General Partner and Partnership. The transaction was completed without the consent of the Administrative Limited\n   Partner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   NTD breached the LPA by participating in and authorizing WCO to purchase the debt. Weismann breached his obligations under the Guaranty by allowing the General Partner to participate in the transaction and authorizing WCO to purchase the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The uncontroverted facts state in June 2016, WCO purchased from USB the mortgage note\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   for Water Tower Place. WCO is 100% owned by Properties, which is 100% owned by Associates. The Paul A. Weismann Descendants' Trust owns 100% of Associates. Weismann and his wife are co-trustees of the trust and Weismann and his children are the beneficiaries. Weismann also owns 57% of the General Partner, NTD; the remaining shares of NTD are owned by two unidentified individuals, not related to Weismann. Because of Weismann's relationship to the various entities involved in the sale of the mortgage note, Counterclaim Plaintiffs assert the transaction violates the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 5.5B of the LPA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   B. No General Partner shall have any authority to do any of the following acts on behalf of the Partnership, except with the Consent of the Administrative Limited Partner and the approval, to the extent required, of any Credit Agency to any Lender:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (ii) Acquire, become personally liable on or in respect of, or guarantee, directly or indirectly (or allow any person related to any General Partner or Limited Partner, within the meaning of Section 752 of the Code, to acquire, become liable on or guaranty), all or any portion of a Mortgage Note or a Mortgage or, except as otherwise contemplated herein or in the Development Services Agreement, any other indebtedness of the Partnership....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This provision states the General Partner cannot acquire the mortgage note, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, according to the contract, NTD, the General Partner, is prohibited from purchasing the mortgage note. There is nothing to prevent Weismann, who is not the General Partner, from purchasing the note, either directly, or indirectly. Counterclaim Plaintiffs' argument conflates NTD and Weismann, which are separate legal entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Family Support Div. v.

Thus, Weismann, or WCO, is related to NTD if Weismann or WCO, or both, own eighty percent or more of NTD. The uncontroverted facts, filed by the parties, state Weismann owns only 57% of NTD. The remaining 43% is owned by two other individuals. WCO does not own, nor is it a member of NTD. Weismann and WCO are not related to NTD under the Code and Regulations of the IRS and the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Counterclaim Plaintiffs also argue NTD indirectly purchased the mortgage note through WCO. According to Counterclaim Plaintiffs, WCO is controlled by Weismann, who makes decisions for WCO, and NTD is controlled by Weismann. Further, Plaintiffs allege Weismann agreed to the sale of the debt on behalf of WCO and consented to the acquisition on behalf of NTD. However, this argument also fails. NTD, who is the general partner, does not own any interest in WCO, Associates, Properties, or the Trust. Therefore, NTD did not indirectly purchase the mortgage note, WCO purchased the mortgage note. WCO is not prohibited by the contract from purchasing the mortgage note because it is not the general partner. WCO, Weismann and NTD are separate legal entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Under these provisions of the LPA, NTD did not breach the LPA when WCO purchased the mortgage note. However, the Third Amended Counterclaims also allege Weismann personally breached the contract, because he guaranteed, through the Guaranty attachment to the LPA, each and every obligation of the General Partner under the LPA. It further alleges Weismann is bound by the prohibition against acquiring indebtedness of the partnership because he is responsible for the management and control of the General Partner. These allegations were never addressed by either party in the briefs on Count III for the Motion for Summary Judgment. It is briefly mentioned in Counterclaim Plaintiffs' response but is never addressed in Counterclaim Defendants' Motion or Reply. The Court cannot grant summary judgment on an issue not raised\n   or discussed by the parties.\n   <em>\n    Heisler v. Metro.

A fiduciary duty is created when one party is subservient to the other; things of value, which are the property of the subservient party, are possessed or managed by the dominant party; there is a surrender of independence by the subservient party to the dominant party; there is a manipulation of the actions of the subservient party by the dominant party; and there is a showing the subservient party places a trust and confidence in the dominant party.\n   <em>\n    Chmieleski v.

Even though the individual was not the general partner, but he owned all of the stock, the Eighth Circuit held the individual owed fiduciary duties to the limited partners personally because he represented he would personally manage the partnership properties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11321655\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/818/#p823\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These same circumstances are not present here. Weismann did not represent he would personally manage the partnership properties. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Koester\n   </em>\n   is not a basis for imposing fiduciary duties on Weismann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The second case is\n   <em>\n    Ebest v.

The circumstances are, again, different here. Weismann, as an individual, is not a general partner. Thus, he is not accountable to Counterclaim Plaintiffs as a trustee or fiduciary. There is no support in the law for Weismann being held responsible for fiduciary duties to Counterclaim Plaintiffs, separate and apart from his duty under a guaranty, which is not at issue here. Therefore, the Court will grant summary judgment on Count IV as to Weismann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For these same reasons, there is also no support in the record or the law for WCO to be held accountable for fiduciary duties owed to Counterclaim Plaintiffs. WCO is not a general partner, nor is it a party to the LPA. It has no ownership in NTD, so there is not a corporate veil to be pierced. The Court will also grant summary judgment on Count IV as to WCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Count IV against NTD is all that remains. NTD does not challenge whether it owes fiduciary duties to Counterclaim Plaintiffs. Instead, NTD asserts it did not breach any fiduciary duty by consenting to the purchase of the mortgage note by WCO. According to NTD, because the purchase of the mortgage note did not violate the LPA, it also did not breach any fiduciary duties. The Court determined,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , NTD's consent to the purchase did not violate the LPA, because WCO is not related to NTD. Thus, it must also conclude NTD did not breach a fiduciary duty for consenting to the purchase. Summary judgment on Count IV for NTD will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Counterclaim Plaintiffs also argue the partnership agreement itself states the harm is irreparable. In response, Counterclaim Defendants contend Counterclaim Plaintiffs face only economic damages and damages to business reputation or goodwill cannot form the basis of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Counterclaim Plaintiffs must establish the \"harm is certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    Novus Franchising, Inc. v.

Balance of Harms\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Next, the Court must consider the balance of harms if the preliminary injunction were to be granted. \"The balance of harms analysis examines the harm of granting or denying the injunction upon both the parties to the dispute and upon other interested parties, including the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Noodles Dev., LP v.

On Count III, Counterclaim Plaintiffs have one remaining avenue to succeed on the merits, their assertion Weismann owes the same obligations under the LPA as NTD because of the Guaranty Agreement Weismann signed. The remainder of the Counts in the Third Amended Counterclaims, Counts I, II, V, and VI, are still viable.

Dwyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523803\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/791/\">\n    294 F.Supp.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Counterclaim Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown they have a possibility of success on the merits in regards to whether rental achievement has been met and Weismann's obligations have been discharged. Rental Achievement in the LPA occurs when the following conditions have been fulfilled: \"(i) conversion; (ii) all governmental approvals necessary for Occupancy of all units in the Apartment Complex have been obtained; (iii) one hundred percent (100%) Occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units and ninety percent (90%) Occupancy of the Apartment Complex has occurred during each of three (3) consecutive months (but no earlier than the three (3) consecutive month immediately preceding Conversion), and which produces a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 for each of such three (2) consecutive months.\" The argument on rental achievement centers on whether the debt service coverage ratio was properly calculated. Counterclaim Plaintiffs assert NTD instructed the accountant to use the incorrect formula. Additionally, Counterclaim Plaintiffs argue Rental Achievement was not met because there was not 100% occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units. These arguments are plausible and may prove to be correct at trial. Therefore, Plaintiffs have established some likelihood of success on the merits of at least one claim in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   4. Public Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The final factor to consider in whether to grant a preliminary injunction is if the public interest would be served by the injunction. Counterclaim Plaintiffs argue the public interest would be harmed because a foreclosure would result in a loss of low-income housing in an area that desperately needs such housing. Counterclaim Defendants contend it has committed to continue to provide such housing as the market requires; thus, Counterclaim Plaintiffs argument is not an actual public interest concern. Provision of low-income housing is a public interest concern, especially in areas that have little affordable housing. There is no guarantee Counterclaim Defendants will continue to operate the housing complex as low-income. Therefore, the public interest is in favor of maintaining the status quo and preventing foreclosure of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The balance of factors in this matter weighs in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. Counterclaim Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits. Additionally, the irreparable harm to Counterclaim Plaintiffs outweighs any potential harm to Counterclaim Defendants. For these reasons, the Court will grant the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    C. Bond\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) states: \"The court may issue a preliminary\n   injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\" The amount of bond required lies within the discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Rathmann Group v.
