Crabtree, United States District Judge\n   This lawsuit brings the court a dispute that pits two important values in the American experience against one another: \"free exercise of religion and effective use by the state of its police powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Messiah Baptist Church v. Cty. of Jefferson, Colo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532691\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/859/820/#p823\">\n    859 F.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (10th Cir. 1988) (noting the \"particular protection\" accorded to religious freedom by our Constitution but also noting, \"The power of local governments to zone and control land is undoubtedly broad\"). Over the years, Congress and the Supreme Court have rearranged the balance that courts must strike when deciding cases involving these two values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The current disagreement involves a recurring situation, one that requires courts to find the proper balance between these two competing values. Specifically, the parties dispute whether a municipality's exercise of its zoning power infringed on a church's religious freedom. Plaintiffs-the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas and St. Rose Philippine Duchesne Catholic Church-asked the City of Mission Woods, Kansas for permission to convert a single-family house into a meeting house to serve the needs of a growing congregation. The City of Mission Woods-defendant here-refused and cited local zoning laws as its reason. Plaintiffs then filed this suit, arguing that defendant's zoning decision violates federal and state laws protecting religious exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties now have filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 39 (defendant's motion), 41 (plaintiffs' motion). The United States also has weighed in, filing an amicus brief, as allowed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Doc. 57. It opposes defendant's motion, at least in part. Having reviewed the filings, the court is prepared to decide the motions. The court denies plaintiffs' motion and grants defendant's motion in part and denies it in part. After setting forth the facts that govern these motions, the court explains its reasoning, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts recited in this section are uncontroverted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant and its Zoning Ordinances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant is a Kansas municipality located in Johnson County, Kansas. It borders Kansas City, Missouri, along the eastern border of Kansas. Its boundaries occupy 60 acres of land and 180 persons reside within the city. Eighty single-family houses, four commercial buildings, the St. Rose Church, Pembroke Hill School's athletic fields, and a parking lot owned by the University of Kansas Hospital Authority are situated on the property within the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The city has three different zoning districts that matter to this case. First, it has a \"Single Family Residential District.\" Properties in this district only can be used for single-family houses and certain \"public\" or \"semipublic\" uses. Approved \"public\" and \"semipublic\" uses include athletic fields, churches and synagogues, community centers, libraries, parks, police stations, schools, and swimming pools. Before anyone can initiate a public use of land within the Residential District, both the City Plan Commission and City Council must approve the public use. As a prerequisite to approving a public or semipublic use, these bodies must find that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The use does not materially damage or curtail the appropriate use of the neighboring property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. The use is compatible with the general character of the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3. The use does not jeopardize the public health, safety or welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4. The use does not violate the general spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance and is compatible with the long-range plan used as a guide for the development of the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. Adequate hard surfaced, all weather, dustless, off-street parking space is provided for the employees and patrons of the use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6. Any other ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, peripheral landscape screening and/or walls, and/or fences are provided at least six feet in height of sufficient depth to adequately screen the view of all proposed structures and parking facilities during the four seasons of the year from all abutting properties zoned for or developed with residential structures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   7. Structures and off-street parking areas, taken as a whole, do not occupy more than 60% of the building site, and at least 40% of the site is maintained as open, unobstructed green space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   8. Vehicular access to the use is provided only from a major thoroughfare or trafficway unless specifically waived by the City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   9. A landscape plan and construction details for walls and/or fences accompany the development plan and have been approved by the City Plan Commission and the City Architect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doc. 47-6 at 213 (Defendant City Code \u00a7 12-402(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant municipality has approved a public use in the Residential District just once, when Pembroke Hill School asked to use an empty lot as a soccer practice field. Pembroke Hill is a private, secular school with its main campus in Kansas City, Missouri-literally, just across the street that divides the defendant municipality and the State of Missouri. Before 1999, Pembroke Hill had owned land within defendant's city limits that it used as a parking lot and for athletic fields. In 1999, Pembroke Hill acquired an empty field. This field adjoined the school's existing athletic fields and parking lot. All this property sits near single-family houses located in the Residential District. One can access the school's parking lot, the original athletic field, and the empty lot acquired in 1999 only from State Line Road-a busy public thoroughfare that divides Kansas and Missouri. Pembroke Hill hoped to use the empty lot to host soccer practices, but the lot was located in defendant's Residential District. Because that use amounted to a public use, the school had to secure defendant's approval before it could use the empty lot for soccer practices. Pembroke Hill formally applied for approval of this public use, and defendant\n   conducted a series of public meetings to consider its request. During these meetings, several residents expressed concerns about the noise and light the field would generate. So, Pembroke Hill agreed to limit the lot/practice field's use to children between four and seven years old. The school also agreed to: (a) limit the hours the field could be used; (b) refrain from erecting lights or permanent goals on the field; and (c) avoid using loud speakers or whistles. Defendant then approved Pembroke Hill's request for a public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The second pertinent zoning district used by defendant is called the \"Planned Recreation District.\" Defendant allows properties in this district to be used as athletic fields for amateur athletes; tennis courts; trails for running, walking, or biking; permanent restrooms; and storage facilities that support any of these uses. Any landowner who plans to devote land to one of the uses approved for the Planned Recreation District must apply for approval from the City Plan Commission and City Council. And those bodies can approve such an application only if they conclude that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The use does not materially damage or curtail the appropriate use of neighboring property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. The use is compatible with the general character of the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. The use does not jeopardize the public health, safety and welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4. The use does not violate the general spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance and is compatible with the long-range plan used as a guide for the development of the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   5. Adequate hard surfaced, all weather, dustless off-street parking [space] is provided for the patrons of the use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n    at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Defendant City Code \u00a7 12-405(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant created the Planned Recreation District in 2006 when Pembroke Hill asked to rezone its land. Defendant approved Pembroke Hill's application, making all the school's property within defendant's municipal boundaries part of the Planned Recreation District. After defendant rezoned Pembroke Hill's land, Pembroke Hill asked defendant if it could place a soccer field and tennis courts on its property, near two houses on 51st Street-a cul-de-sac. As required by defendant's ordinance governing the Planned Recreation District, the City Plan Commission and City Council considered the school's application and held meetings so that citizens could voice support for or objections to the project. At these meetings, the owners of the homes next to the proposed tennis courts voiced concerns about their privacy. In response, Pembroke Hill agreed to plant privacy trees to shield the tennis courts from the homes. And Pembroke Hill agreed never to erect lights on or cover the tennis courts in response to concerns about light and noise emanating from the courts. After making these stipulations, defendant approved Pembroke Hill's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2012, Pembroke Hill asked defendant to allow it to expand its usage of its property in the Planned Recreation District. Specifically, the school sought to expand its existing soccer field to regulation size and construct a permanent restroom and storage facility on the property. Pembroke Hill agreed to limit the hours when it could use these fields and the permissible volume of noise emanating from them. Defendant intended to enforce these limitations by enforcing its existing noise ordinance. In October 2016-shortly after defendant approved Pembroke Hill's 2012 request-defendant\n   amended its noise ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At least one member of the City Plan Commission does not recall whether defendant amended the noise ordinance in response to Pembroke Hill's 2012 request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The last zoning district pertinent to this case is the \"Planned Office District.\" As the name implies, defendant permits property owners to devote property within this district to offices and parking lots for offices. One such property owner in the Planned Office District is the University of Kansas Hospital Authority. UKHA operates a clinic in Westwood-a bordering municipality. In 2006, UKHA purchased property across the street from its Westwood clinic. This newly purchased property is situated within defendant's city limits. In 2014, UKHA informed defendant that it was planning to build a parking lot on its property and applied for a permit to do so. According to a traffic study UKHA had procured, it would use the parking lot during normal business hours only. Also, drivers could access the proposed lot only from Rainbow Boulevard-a major public thoroughfare. When UKHA applied for this permit, defendant asked UKHA to change a few things about its plan. UKHA agreed. But UKHA also informed defendant that UKHA, as a state agency, need not secure any local permits to build on its property. After consulting with its lawyers, defendant decided not to challenge UKHA's position that it was exempt. Despite the exemption it claimed, UKHA met with defendant and some of its residents to address several issues they had raised about the proposed parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas-the \"KCK Archdiocese\" for short-is a Kansas non-profit corporation and one of the two plaintiffs in this case. The other, St. Rose Philippine Duchesne Catholic Church-\"St. Rose\"-is one of the KCK Archdiocese's chaplaincies. In 2011, plaintiffs bought property within defendant's city limits. The property included an older Lutheran church and plaintiffs renovated it. Two years later, they began holding church services in the recommissioned and renovated church. Currently, between 600 and 800 people attend Sunday Mass at the three masses plaintiffs offer there. Plaintiffs have various agreements with nearby properties to provide parking for its parishioners. Also, various groups meet at the church and hold events there. These groups-including prayer and Bible study groups-are important aspects of plaintiffs' religious practices. They meet in the church's basement, primarily on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The church's membership has grown since it first opened in 2013 by about 100 members. This growth has created some space constraints for the church. In particular, more groups want to meet on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays than the church has capacity to handle. Doc. 47-1 at 2 (Father Nolan Dep. at 41:14-19). And the noise generated by the groups meeting inside the church creates some distractions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (95:9-96:4). The groups meeting at the church reach the rated capacity for the rooms where they meet. Doc 47-2 at 4 (Father Fongemie Dep. at 36:21-23). Five or six times a year, plaintiffs have to cancel group meetings because they hold fundraisers, bake sales, festivals, and dinner events in the church basement. Doc. 40-3 at 6-7 (Father Fongemie Dep. at 40:20-41:19). But plaintiffs do not anticipate that their groups would meet more frequently if they had more space.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (38:24-39:5). Nor has any\n   group turned away someone who wanted to join because that group lacked the space to accommodate the potential member. Finally, plaintiffs know of no new groups who could not meet because plaintiffs couldn't find space for them to meet in the St. Rose Church.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (39:16-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs Buy the Meeting House\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2015, plaintiffs acquired a house at the corner of 51st Street and Rainbow Boulevard. Rainbow is a major public thoroughfare that adjoins the church property. 51st Street is a cul-de-sac. Plaintiffs wish to use the house it purchased on 51st Street as a meeting house. The house is situated in the Residential District and, formally, was used as a single-family home. All the other houses on 51st Street are single-family houses. Under defendant's fire code, the proposed meeting house can hold as many as 115 people inside the house and another 150 people outside. Plaintiffs plan to place the main entrance to the proposed meeting house on the side facing the St. Rose Church. A disability accessible entrance and parking space will be located on the side of the house facing 51st Street. The proposed use for this house is unique within defendant's city limits. Indeed, of the 80 single-family houses situated within defendant's city limits, none functions as a public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because plaintiffs intended to use the meeting house in a semipublic fashion, they filed an application in 2016, asking defendant to approve this semipublic use. The City Plan Commission and City Council held public meetings about plaintiffs' application. At these meetings, residents expressed concerns about the number of people the meeting house could hold and the hours when it might be used. In addition, residents worried that the meeting house would create additional traffic on the cul-de-sac. Defendant asked plaintiffs if they would consider limiting the hours people could use the meeting house and the number of meetings that could occur there. Defendant also asked plaintiffs if they would accept limits on the number of people who could attend meetings within the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs rejected these proposed limitations. They took the position that the normal noise ordinances ameliorated any concerns about excessive noise. And, typically, plaintiffs predicted 25 or fewer people would use the meeting house at one time. They thus asserted there was no need to impose occupant restrictions. Also, to minimize any traffic concerns, plaintiffs promised to encourage their members to refrain from parking on 51st Street-the cul-de-sac. Plaintiffs also discounted the idea that people would park on 51st Street because the meeting house's main entrance faced the church-not the cul-de-sac. Plaintiffs also produced a traffic study opining that traffic would increase minimally if plaintiffs used the structure as a meeting house. The company who produced the study cited by plaintiffs is the same company who performed the traffic study that UKHA had provided to defendant when it built its parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant discounted the traffic study. But defendant never produced a study of its own. Also, defendant was not convinced that enforcing the noise ordinance and plaintiffs' traffic-mitigation efforts would dispel residents' concerns sufficiently. Doc. 40-19 at 4-5. And because plaintiffs refused to consider any limitations defendant had proposed, defendant believed plaintiffs planned to use the meeting house at all hours of the night and to permit as many people to meet inside the structure as it could hold.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, defendant refused to allow plaintiffs to use the meeting house as a semipublic space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Claims Asserted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Complaint pleaded seven distinct causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 22-30. But the Pretrial Order narrowed the case, at least a little bit, omitting the Third Cause of Action. Doc. 37 at 12. The parties' summary judgment papers divide these remaining claims into two batches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the first batch of claims, both plaintiffs and defendant contend they deserve summary judgment. These cross-motions address the First and Second Causes of Action. On the first, the Complaint asserts that defendant imposed a substantial burden on plaintiffs' religious exercise by preventing them from using the proposed meeting house, thus violating the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"). The Second Cause of Action claims that defendant treated plaintiffs on less than equal terms than defendant treated Pembroke Hill and UKHA because it granted their permit applications while denying plaintiffs' application. Plaintiffs claim this conduct violated RLUIPA's equal terms provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the second batch of claims, only defendant has moved for summary judgment. It claims that the court should enter summary judgment against the claims asserted by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Causes of Action. The Fourth Cause of Action asserts that defendant violated RLUIPA by placing unreasonable limits on plaintiffs' religious exercise. The Fifth claim asserts that defendant deprived plaintiffs' right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth claim asserts that defendant violated plaintiffs' rights under \u00a7 7 of the Kansas Constitution's Bill of Rights. Plaintiffs claim defendant violated this provision, which protects plaintiffs' religious liberty, by denying their application to use the meeting house. And finally, the Seventh claim asserts that defendant violated the Kansas Preservation of Religious Freedom Act when it denied plaintiffs' application for a permit for the meeting house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that \"no genuine dispute [about] any material fact\" exists and that it \"is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In Part b, the court decides defendant's motion on that aspect of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiffs' Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion argues that no reasonable jury could find that defendant did not violate RLUIPA's substantial burden provision. Plaintiffs' motion does not persuade the court, at least not at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Specifically, the facts supported in the summary judgment record could permit a reasonable jury to find that plaintiffs don't need to expand to the meeting house. One of plaintiffs' priests testified that he does not expect new groups to form if they could use the meeting house. Doc. 40-3 at 6 (Father Fongemie Dep. 39:16-20). And no groups have complained they have had to turn away members because of space constraints. This evidence differentiates plaintiffs' claim from the one asserted in\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   . And while some evidence suggests that noise levels in the current meeting locations are a distraction, the summary judgment record also indicates that noise presents a problem mostly on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays-the days when most groups meet. In short, a reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs easily could rearrange schedules so that some of their groups meet on the weekdays. If this view of the evidence prevailed with the jury, it reasonably could conclude that the church could solve its noise problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that no reasonable jury could conclude that their religious activity is not substantially burdened because plaintiffs have a growing congregation and RLUIPA prevents governments from stunting a religious institution's growth.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , nothing suggests that another church-or even another secular organization-has used a single-family house as a public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court denies plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their substantial burden claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defendant's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Turning now to defendant's motion on the substantial burden claim, defendant makes two arguments. It contends that no reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs' religious exercise is substantially burdened. Defendant also argues that even if a reasonable jury could find a substantial burden, it could not find defendant failed the strict scrutiny standard. The court concludes otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, a reasonable jury could find that defendant has imposed a substantial burden on plaintiffs' religious exercise. The summary judgment record contains admissible evidence that plaintiffs cancel group meetings five to six times a year because they lack adequate space when the church hosts bake sales, fundraisers, and dinners. Also, the summary judgment record-when viewed in plaintiffs' favor-contains evidence that when multiple groups meet in the basement, the noise levels make it impossible for participants to conduct meaningful discussions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while a reasonable\n   jury also might find that one alternative available to plaintiffs-rescheduling some meetings for the weekdays-provides a reasonable solution to this problem, a reasonable jury might conclude differently. Specifically, plaintiffs have adduced admissible evidence that this putative solution is unreasonable because the members of some groups might have difficulty meeting on those alternative days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Likewise, a reasonable jury could find that defendant prevented plaintiffs from expanding their religious services. Notably, much like\n   <em>\n    Westchester\n   </em>\n   , defendant could have chosen to approve plaintiffs' application but attached certain conditions to its approval. But it didn't. While the summary judgment record contains evidence that defendant floated the idea of hour limitations and capacity restrictions, defendant never formulated any specific restrictions for plaintiffs to consider. So, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant's reference to conditions was disingenuous or unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westchester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949505\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/338/\">\n    504 F.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Of course, a conditional denial may represent a substantial burden if the condition itself is a burden on free exercise, the required modifications are economically unfeasible, or where a zoning board's stated willingness to consider a modified plan is disingenuous.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The court's conclusion about substantial burden doesn't end the analysis. Defendant also could deserve summary judgment if the summary judgment facts establish that defendant's decision represented the least restrictive means to satisfy a compelling governmental interest. The court thus continues its analysis, evaluating the strict scrutiny component of defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant argues that its decision served compelling interests because it maintained the aesthetics of the residential neighborhood, prevented traffic from clogging a residential cul-de-sac-51st Street-and reduced noise. Generally speaking, case law recognizes that a governmental entity's interest in controlling traffic and reducing noise are compelling interests under RLUIPA.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

For instance, the Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Westchester\n   </em>\n   that the zoning board had failed to establish a compelling interest despite asserting traffic concerns as its compelling interest.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949505\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/338/\">\n    504 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Critical to this holding, the court concluded that the defendant zoning board had failed to marshal any evidence supporting the concerns it articulated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949505\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Here, the summary judgment facts-viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs-show a similar situation. At meetings defendant held to discuss plaintiffs' proposal, multiple residents asserted that more cars would park on the cul-de-sac if plaintiffs used the meeting house as they proposed. But admissible evidence shows that plaintiffs assured defendant that they would prevent that from happening. Plaintiffs informed defendant they would require parishioners to park in the church's parking lot-located next to the meeting house-or at another parking venue available to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' assurances could permit a reasonable jury to find that defendant's fears about traffic on the 51st Street cul-de-sac were unsupported. And defendant based its fears about the meeting house's noise level on the assumption that plaintiffs would allow as many people into the meeting house as it could hold, and at all hours of the day. A reasonable jury could conclude that this assumption was unwarranted because admissible evidence showed that: (a) plaintiffs represented that not more than 25 people would use the meeting house at any given time; and (b) nothing suggested that plaintiffs would use the house at all hours of the night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   And even if the summary judgment facts showed defendant had established a compelling interest, a reasonable jury still could find for plaintiffs on this claim. The governing law also requires defendant to establish that its zoning decision represented the least restrictive means to serve its goals-here, reducing noise and traffic. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(1)(B). In their meetings with defendant, plaintiffs suggested defendant could address these noise and traffic concerns simply by enforcing its noise and parking ordinances. Cory Fisher-a member of defendant's City Plan Commission-testified that defendant did not believe this sufficed because, historically, the police have not responded to noise violations. Doc. 40-2 at 15 (Fisher Dep. 79:13-80:3). Defendant also produced evidence that it does not restrict parking on 51st Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   A reasonable jury could conclude that these explanations don't establish that alternatives were inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yellowbear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898094\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/48/#p59\">\n    741 F.3d at 62-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As part of its burden to show that its policy represents the least restrictive means available to further its putatively compelling interest, the government must of course 'refute alternative schemes' suggested by the plaintiff to achieve that same interest and show why they are inadequate.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As plaintiffs point out, a jury appropriately might find defendant could amend its parking ordinance to ban parking on 51st Street-or, at the very least, restrict parking to the 51st Street residents and their guests. And defendant could choose to require its police officers to begin enforcing the noise ordinance's restrictions. In short, a reasonable jury could find solutions would allow plaintiffs to use the meeting house while still protecting defendant's interest in minimizing noise and traffic issues on the cul-de-sac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, defendant has failed to carry its summary judgment burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Equal Terms (Second Cause of Action)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Both parties also move for summary judgment on the claim asserted by the Complaint's Second Cause of Action. In that claim, plaintiffs allege that defendant treated their land-use request on less than equal terms than defendant treated requests by two similarly situated secular entities-Pembroke Hill and UKHA. In general terms, RLUIPA forbids governments, when implementing a land use regulation, from treating religious institutions on less than equal terms than secular entities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1). To prove a claim under this provision, plaintiffs first must identify a similarly situated secular entity and then show that defendant treated the secular entity in a preferential fashion.\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain Christian Church v.

Comm'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703429\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1229/#p1236\">\n    613 F.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (10th Cir. 2010). Here, the parties all agree-for purposes of summary judgment-that: (1) defendant treated Pembroke Hill and UKHA more favorably because defendant approved their applications but denied plaintiffs' and; (2) those two entities are secular entities. So, the dispositive issue for the equal terms claim is whether Pembroke Hill and UKHA are similarly situated to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court addresses this aspect of the motion by, first, describing how courts evaluate whether two entities are similarly situated.

The Equal Terms Theories Asserted Here\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiffs in the current case base their equal terms claim on defendant's treatment of two secular institutions: the Pembroke Hill School and the University of Kansas Hospital Authority. Given the fact specific inquiry required by the equal terms analysis, the court discusses these two comparators, separately and in detail, in the next two subsections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Pembroke Hill School\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The first secular institution invoked by plaintiffs' equal terms claim is Pembroke Hill School-a secular, private school with some operations inside defendant's city limits. Plaintiffs specifically emphasize three times when Pembroke Hill asked defendant for a permit and defendant granted it: (i) in 1999, when Pembroke Hill asked to use a newly acquired field in the Residential District as a public use; (ii) in 2006, when Pembroke Hill asked to rezone its property in that district and build a tennis court on it; and (iii) in 2012, when Pembroke Hill asked to expand its use of those athletic fields. The court discusses each project, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    i. 1999\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that a reasonable jury could reach just one conclusion: that plaintiffs' application to use its house as a meeting house similarly situates it to Pembroke Hill's 1999 request. Plaintiffs note that both projects were governed by the same zoning ordinances and situated in the same zoning district. And, plaintiffs argue, both projects were designed to cause large groups of people to congregate in the evenings and weekends near residential properties. Defendant reaches the opposite conclusion. It asserts that no reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs and Pembroke Hill are similarly situated. Defendant notes that Pembroke Hill agreed to restrict usage of its field while plaintiffs refused to do so. Defendant also notes that one can access Pembroke Hill's fields only from State Line Road-not a cul-de-sac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Neither sides' argument can carry the day at summary judgment. Evidence in the summary judgment record would permit a reasonable jury to conclude the similarities in zoning laws and usage between the two projects made Pembroke Hill's 1999 project like plaintiffs' proposed project-just as the jury found in\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain\n   </em>\n   . But other record evidence will permit an equally reasonable jury to conclude that the projects are dissimilar. The school's fields cannot be accessed via a cul-de-sac, and they present no noise or hours of operations concerns. Those factors were important ones in defendant's decision to deny plaintiffs' permit.

Plaintiffs argue that their application is similarly situated to Pembroke Hill's 2006 request because the tennis courts and the meeting house are located near residential homes. And, they note, though the two tracts are located in different zoning districts-the tennis courts are in the Planned Recreation District and the meeting house is in the Residential District-the character of the districts is similar. In the Residential\n   District, defendant allows public uses such as swimming pools and parks. A reasonable jury could find, plaintiffs say, those uses are similar to the types of activities it allows in the Recreation District: amateur athletic fields, tennis courts, and running trails. Plaintiffs also emphasize that defendant used the same criteria to evaluate the two projects. Indeed, the same words define the standard used to evaluate projects in the Planned Recreation District and public uses in defendant's Residential District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In contrast, defendant argues that differences between the two projects could lead a reasonable jury to just one conclusion: Pembroke Hill's project and plaintiffs' use are not similarly situated. Defendant asserts that the tennis courts can't be used at night because they are not lighted-unlike the meeting house. Also, the only way to access the tennis courts is from State Line Road. Finally, defendant argues that even though the criteria used to evaluate planned uses in the Planned Recreation District and public uses in the Residential District employ the same language, the context in which the criteria are evaluated differs. Doc. 50 at 15-16. Indeed, one of the criteria for both districts requires defendant to conclude that the use \"is compatible with the general character\n   <em>\n    of the district\n   </em>\n   .\" Doc. 47-6 at 213, 240 (Defendant City Code \u00a7 12-402(b)(2), -405(b)(2) (emphasis added) ). What \"is compatible with the general character\" of the Planned Recreation District, defendant argues, is different than what \"is compatible with the general character\" of the Residential District because one should expect different types of noises and activity in each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Again, the similarities and differences between the two projects could permit a reasonable jury to side with either party. A reasonable jury could find the differences in character between the Residential and Planned Recreation Districts constitute \"minor differences\" that \"may not defeat a comparison under the equal terms provision ....\"\n   <em>\n    Chabad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265526\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/183/#p197\">\n    768 F.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And a reasonable jury easily could find that the similarities of the two projects-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that both involve projects that will cause large groups of people to congregate near residential homes-make them similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On the other hand, a reasonable jury could see the differences between the projects as too great to establish an equal terms violation. The school's inability to use the tennis courts at night and different access points might convince the jury that substantial differences exist because traffic on the residential street and noise at night were important considerations to defendant's decision to reject plaintiffs' project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chabad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265526\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/183/#p197\">\n    768 F.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, both parties have adduced enough evidence to survive summary judgment. The court denies their motions on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. 2012\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   This leaves the parties' arguments addressing the meeting house and Pembroke Hill's 2012 request to expand its soccer field and install permanent restrooms. This set of arguments is identical to the ones based on Pembroke Hill's 2006 project. Plaintiffs reiterate that the Planned Recreation District-where the soccer fields and restrooms are located-and Residential District have the same approval criteria and that both projects will create areas where large groups of people will congregate on evenings and weekends near residential housing. And defendant repeats its argument that the two zoning districts serve materially different purposes, Pembroke Hill's fields operate under hours and noise limitations, and the fields only can be accessed from State Line Road. As it did with the 2006 comparison, the court concludes\n   that these differences and similarities will not permit summary judgment for either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    b. UKHA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In contrast to the Pembroke Hill projects, UKHA is not similarly situated as a matter of law. In 2014, UKHA built a parking lot for its employees who work in a clinic across the street to use. Whether the court views the evidence in plaintiffs' or defendant's favor, UKHA is not a similarly situated entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   First, UKHA occupies a materially different zoning district-the Office District-than the one where plaintiffs wish to build. And this parking lot is used on workdays. Plaintiffs plan to use the meeting house in the evenings and on the weekends-when defendant's residents are at home. Also, the entrance to UKHA's parking lot is off of Rainbow Boulevard-a major thoroughfare-and not 51st Street, the residential cul-de-sac where the meeting house is situated. These two differences matter because defendant justified its adverse decision on plaintiffs' application by citing concerns about noise while families were home and traffic on a residential cul-de-sac.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chabad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265526\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/183/#p197\">\n    768 F.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting summary judgment against an equal terms claim because the identified differences between the secular project and the religious project were central to defendant's differing decisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Also, Kansas law does not require UKHA to secure a permit before engaging in a construction project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-7\">\n    Kan.

These differences-whether viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs or defendant-establish that UKHA and plaintiffs are not a similarly situated as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs persist, however, arguing that a reasonable jury only could conclude that UKHA is a similarly situated entity. They note that defendant discounted a traffic study they procured about the effect of the meeting house, even though defendant had accredited a similar study produced by the same firm and used by UKHA to establish the traffic effects of its parking lot. Doc. 42 at 18. But having the same consulting firm perform a traffic study is insufficient to nullify the organic factual differences between the two projects. The author of the traffic study was not central to defendant's decision. Instead, concerns about traffic and noise during evenings and on weekends along a residential cul-de-sac were the operative concerns. And Kansas law provides UKHA with immunity from securing local zoning permits. These differences-as a matter of law-entitle defendant to summary judgment against plaintiffs' reliance on UKHA as a similarly situated comparator. The court grants\n   summary judgment against the portion of the Second Cause of Action that relies on UKHA's project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Unreasonable Limits (Fourth Cause of Action)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendant-but not plaintiffs-moves for summary judgment against the claim asserted in the Complaint's Fourth Cause of Action.

The court is mindful that the summary judgment record contains evidence that defendant exaggerated the meeting house's proposed use.

The record contains evidence that defendant treated Pembroke Hill-a secular institution-more favorably than it treated plaintiffs. As explained above, a reasonable jury could find that Pembroke Hill and plaintiffs are similarly situated and that defendant treated the secular school more favorably.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Part IV.B.2.a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The summary judgment record also permits a finding that that the criteria which defendant uses to approve public uses in the Residential District are subjective-the fourth factor in\n   <em>\n    Grace United\n   </em>\n   . Defendant must make some subjective decisions, such as the proposed use \"is compatible with the general character of the [zoning] district,\" and \"does not jeopardize the public health, safety or welfare.\" Doc. 47-6 at 213 (Defendant City Code \u00a7 12-402(b)(2), (3) ).

In\n   <em>\n    Grace United\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit explained that while a church has no constitutional right to build its facilities in the most ideal location, operating in an overcrowded facility may constitute a burden on plaintiffs' religious activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3273798\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/643/#p660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3273798\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/643/#p660\">\n    at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So, a reasonable jury could find that this fifth factor also favors plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In contrast, the summary judgment record contains no evidence favoring plaintiffs on the first and second of\n   <em>\n    Grace United\n   </em>\n   's factors.

Nor do plaintiffs adduce evidence that defendant targets religious institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Because three of the five factors favor a finding that defendant enforced its facially neutral law discriminatorily, the court must apply the strict scrutiny analysis.
