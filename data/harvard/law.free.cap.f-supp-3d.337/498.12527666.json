Pa 2018). Plaintiff, a water extractor, alleges that Defendants have violated the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and Pennsylvania's unfair competition law by mislabeling their water as \"spring water.\" One of the Defendants extracts water and three of them bottle, sell, and label the extracted water as \"spring water.\" As a licensed extractor of spring water, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' labeling of their non-spring water as \"spring water\" has damaged his business because the labels are designed to entice purchasers to buy Defendants' products under the false belief that their \"spring water\" is at least equal, if not superior, to Plaintiff's true spring water. Plaintiff brings this case as a putative class action for \"[a]ll persons in the United States who, within the applicable statute of limitations preceding the filing of this action through class certification, extract and/or bottle spring water for sale in the United States,\" as well as a Pennsylvania subclass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have filed Motions to Dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons below, Defendants' motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts come from the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff is Stanley Frompovicz, who operates a spring water extraction business as Far Away Springs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants are James Land,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who is also engaged in the business of extracting and marketing water, and three water bottlers and distributors who purchase Land's water, namely Niagara Bottling Co., LLC (\"Niagara\"), Ice River Springs Water Co. Inc. (\"Ice River\"), and Crossroads Beverage Group (\"Crossroads\") (collectively \"Bottler Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The gist of Plaintiff's claim is that Defendant Land fraudulently markets and sells \"well water\" as the more desirable \"spring water\" to the Bottler Defendants, who turn around and knowingly sell the spuriously labeled water to consumers, thereby diminishing Plaintiff's market to sell legitimate spring water to bottlers and consumers alike. The marketing and labeling is misleading, according to the Complaint, for four reasons. First, Defendant Land's water \"does not satisfy the FDA's definition of 'spring water.' \" Second, Defendant\n   Land's facility is permitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) as a \"well water\" site, and not a \"spring water\" site. Third, water extracted from Land's facility \"has been extracted, handled, or treated with equipment or techniques that are inconsistent with a 'spring water' classification criteria.\" Last, water from Land's facility \"has tested as containing more particulates or trace elements than are otherwise permissible or recommended under industry standards for 'spring water.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges he suffered commercial harm as a result of the misleading marketing and labeling. Defendants Niagara and Ice River sourced spring water from Plaintiff before switching to Defendant Land's water in 2009 and 2013 respectively, resulting in lost sales for Plaintiff. And in 2014, Defendant Crossroads considered purchasing Plaintiff's spring water before choosing to source from Defendant Land instead. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff \"also bottled his own spring water and directly sold it to customers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, the Complaint also alleges that Defendants Land and Niagara falsely disparaged Plaintiff's products, thus further harming his commercial interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed an initial Complaint in January of 2018. Defendants filed Motions to Dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants advance two separate arguments in their Motions to Dismiss. First, Defendants argue Plaintiff lacks a \"right to sue\" under the Lanham Act and, because the Pennsylvania common law cause of action for unfair competition is \"virtually the same\" as the Lanham Act, the Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    Flynn v.

Plaintiff alleges he suffered both loss of sales and reputational harm from Defendants' violation of 1225(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the allegations that Plaintiff's spring water sales were depressed as a result of Defendants' misleading labels come within the \"zone of interests\" protected by the Lanham Act. The specific allegations in the Amended Complaint are: \"Businesses such as Plaintiff's have spent significant time, money, and resources to identify, develop, and maintain spring water sites;\" \"Defendants' marketing and sale of their deceptively marketed 'spring water' is damaging to the reputation, goodwill, and business of Plaintiff...;\" \"Defendants' wrongful conduct has resulted in increased sales of their own [spring water], hindering sales of Plaintiff's [spring water];\" and \"Plaintiff...is in the spring water business.\" Accepting those facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that the Bottler Defendants would have purchased more spring water from Plaintiff had Defendant Land's labels indicated that his water was other than spring water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Industria de Alimentos Zenu S.A.S. v.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   Court did not provide a precise test for the proximate cause analysis, it explained \"[t]he question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court further elaborated that a Lanham Act plaintiff \"ordinarily must show economic or reputational injury\n   <em>\n    flowing directly\n   </em>\n   from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Here, the proximate cause analysis differs between Defendant Land, who is Plaintiff's direct competitor in the spring water business, and the Bottler Defendants, who are Plaintiff's consumers, so each will be taken each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    a. Defendant Land\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court previously determined that Plaintiff's alleged economic and reputational injuries flow directly from Defendant Land's violation of the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    Frompovicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525514\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/603/\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the Amended Complaint or the parties' briefings changes that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because Plaintiff and Defendant Land are direct competitors, Plaintiff's loss of sales flows directly from, and is thus proximately caused by, Defendant Land's violation of the statute. The \"classic Lanham Act false-advertising claim\" is one in which \"one competitor directly injures another by making false statements about his own goods or the competitor's goods and thus inducing customers to switch.\"\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/#p129\">\n    572 U.S. at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff is in the business of extracting and selling spring water to bottlers; Defendant Land is in the exact same business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended\n   Complaint alleges that the Bottler Defendants ceased sourcing water from Plaintiff because Land \"fraudulently and deceptively markets and sells the raw water extracted at Pine Valley Farms Springs as 'spring water' \" to bottlers. Defendant Land's deceptive marketing plausibly diminished Plaintiff's sales of spring water to those very same bottlers. Plaintiff has therefore alleged a viable theory of proximate harm as to loss of sales from Defendant Land's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff has also made out a viable theory of proximate harm with regards to his reputational injuries. The\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   Court explained: \"a defendant who seeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to or about the plaintiff or his product may be said to have proximately caused the plaintiff's harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/#p129\">\n    572 U.S. at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff alleges Defendant Land made knowingly false statements about Plaintiff's business that resulted in reputational harm.

Thus, every bottle of falsely-labeled water that a wholesaler, retailer, or consumer purchased from Niagara, Ice River, and Crossroads was a bottle that did not contain Plaintiff's or other class members' true spring water, directly resulting in lost sales or profits for Plaintiff or other class members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Bottler Defendants contend that this allegation is mere speculation because Plaintiff has \"pled no facts that demonstrate that\" Bottler Defendants \"would have\n   <em>\n    necessarily purchased\n   </em>\n   water\n   <em>\n    from him\n   </em>\n   in lieu of another spring.\" To the contrary, at least as to Defendants Niagara and Ice River, the Amended Complaint contains allegations to suggest that, if not for decision to violate the statute, the Bottler Defendants would have continued to purchase spring water from Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to Defendant Niagara, the Amended Complaint alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Niagara purchased spring water from Plaintiff for years, but in 2009 cancelled its contract with Plaintiff and started purchasing well water from Land.

Again, the pre-existing commercial relationship renders it plausible that Defendant Ice River would have continued to purchase spring water from Plaintiff if not for the plan to sell mislabeled water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The story is different as to Defendant Crossroads. Unlike Defendants Niagara and Ice River, Plaintiff does not allege a pre-existing commercial relationship with Defendant Crossroads.

Whereas the pre-existing commercial relationship between Plaintiff and the other Bottler Defendants renders it plausible that the bottlers would have continued to purchase Plaintiff's water if not for the scheme to deceive consumers, here, no such conclusion can be drawn.
