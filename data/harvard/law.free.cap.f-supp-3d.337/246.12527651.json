Defendant alternatively requests that, if the motion to quash/vacate is denied s/he be permitted to proceed anonymously in the litigation. (Dkt. 12-2 at 15-16). Also pending before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time to file and effectuate service on Defendant. (Dkt. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Defendant's motion to quash/vacate, grants in part and denies in part Defendant's request to proceed anonymously, and grants Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following alleged facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for the purposes of the pending motions. Plaintiff is an adult film company that operates subscription-based websites where paying viewers can watch its Works. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13). Plaintiff also licenses its Works to broadcasters and sells them as DVDs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). However, its Works are also often illegally downloaded by people using a BitTorrent file network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 23). BitTorrent is a system designed to quickly distribute large files such as movies over the internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Users of BitTorrent connect to the computers of other BitTorrent users to simultaneously upload and download pieces of a file to and from other users. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The user first obtains a torrent file that contains instructions for identifying the internet addresses of other BitTorrent users with the file, as well as for downloading the movie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). After the user downloads pieces of the file from the other BitTorrent users, the file gets automatically reassembled into its original form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff used an investigator to discover IP addresses where its Works were downloaded using BitTorrent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-27), and then used geolocation technology to determine the general regional location of the IP addresses (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). One of these IP addresses was allegedly Defendant's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-27). On May 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit against Defendant (Dkt. 1), but was unable to serve the Complaint because while Defendant's alleged IP address and general location are known, her/his name and physical address are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff moved\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   for leave to serve a third-party subpoena on Defendant's ISP so that Plaintiff could learn the name and address of Defendant and properly serve her/him. (Dkt. 4). On August 28, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for leave to serve a third-party subpoena pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(d)(1) and 45. (Dkt. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After receiving notice of the subpoena from her/his ISP (Dkt. 12-1 at 4-5), on October 9, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the Court's Protective Order (Dkt. 12), and a request to proceed anonymously in the litigation if the motion is denied (Dkt. 12-2 at 15-16). Plaintiff submitted its reply on October 30, 2018 (Dkt. 14), and also filed a motion for an extension of time to file and effectuate service on Defendant. (Dkt. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Quash/Vacate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Quash Subpoena\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 45 provides that a court \"must quash or modify a subpoena that\n   ... requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies\" or that \"subjects a person to undue burden.\" Fed.

Defendant's reliance upon this decision is misplaced.

The report recommended that the court grant the plaintiff permission to serve a third-party subpoena on the ISP, but then instruct the ISP to submit the defendant's name and address directly to the court\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and under seal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262017\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/296/80/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262017\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/296/80/#p90\">\n    at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court would then hold a status conference with the defendant present and provide the sealed information to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262017\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/296/80/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court does not find such procedures necessary in the instant matter, at least based on the present record before the Court. First, even the heightened measures instituted by the\n   <em>\n    Patrick Collins\n   </em>\n   court would not completely maintain Defendant's anonymity from Plaintiff-the information necessary for service would eventually be disclosed during a status conference. Additionally, as previously discussed,\n   there is no evidence that Plaintiff has, as of the date of this Decision and Order, engaged in the abusive litigation tactics used by the\n   <em>\n    Patrick Collins\n   </em>\n   plaintiff. To the contrary, Plaintiff has repeatedly indicated that it respects Defendant's privacy concerns. (Dkt. 5 at 12-13 (encouraging the Court to establish procedural safeguards that will protect Defendant's privacy interest); Dkt. 14 at 14 (agreeing that Defendant should be allowed to remain pseudonymous throughout the instant litigation) ). Unless and until there is some sign that Plaintiff may misuse Defendant's personal information, the Court finds the measures utilized by the\n   <em>\n    Patrick Collins\n   </em>\n   court to not be necessary here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Disclosure of the identifying information to Plaintiff's counsel is a necessary prerequisite to the litigation being advanced-this was part of the Court's reasoning for allowing the subpoena. Those goals cannot be accomplished by only allowing disclosure to the Court. However, Plaintiff has stated that it would not be opposed to allowing Defendant to proceed in this litigation pseudonymously as \"John Doe\" instead of using Defendant's initials in the public filings as is authorized by the Protective Order. (Dkt. 10 at 7). The Court agrees that this will provide additional protections under the circumstances of this case, and therefore the Protective Order is amended so that Defendant must now be referred to only as \"John Doe subscriber assigned IP address 69.204.6.161\" in any public filings, not by the initials of her/his first and last name, until further order of the Court. All other protections previously set forth in the Court's Protective Order, including that any information disclosed pursuant to the subpoena may only be used for purposes of the litigation and must be kept confidential (Dkt. 10 at 7), remain in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motion for Extension of Time\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff has moved for the Court to grant an extension of the time to serve its Complaint. (Dkt. 11). Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), a plaintiff has 90 days from the date the complaint is filed to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint. \"[I]f the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262017\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/296/80/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff seeks an extension of time because Plaintiff was granted leave in the Court's Protective Order to serve a third-party subpoena on Defendant's ISP to obtain Defendant's identifying information. (Dkt. 11 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6). The ISP has not yet responded due to the pending status of the instant motion to quash, which rendered Plaintiff unable to comply with the current service deadline. \"Plaintiff's inability to identify [Defendant] constitutes 'good cause' under Rule 4(m) for the requested extension.\"\n   <em>\n    Rotten Records, Inc. v. Doe\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-6650-FPG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209460666\">\n    2016 WL 9460666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2016). Therefore, pending Plaintiff's receipt of Defendant's identifying information from the ISP, Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time is granted, and Plaintiff must effectuate service on or before January 9, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Quash (Dkt. 12) is denied. Defendant's request to proceed anonymously in the litigation (Dkt. 12-2 at 15-16) is denied in part and granted in part, and the Protective Order (Dkt. 10) is amended so that Plaintiff is no longer authorized to use the initials of Defendant's first and last name in public filings. Defendant must now, in any public filing, only be referred to as \"John Doe subscriber assigned IP address 69.204.6.161.\" Plaintiff's Motion for Extension of Time (Dkt. 11) is granted,\n   and Plaintiff must effectuate service on or before January 9, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Some Second Circuit courts have been persuaded by such assertions when deciding whether to grant the plaintiff leave to serve a third-party subpoena, but in those cases, the plaintiff had also engaged in improper litigation strategies by using the defendant's personal information as leverage for settlement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Patrick Collins, Inc. v.
