For the following reasons, the motion by Javerbaum Wurgaft is GRANTED to the extent of affixing a charging lien in an amount to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, which was filed on May 8, 2017, Plaintiff David A. Joffe (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Joffe\"), a former litigation associate at the law firm King &amp; Spalding LLP (\"King &amp; Spalding\"), contends that he was fired by King &amp; Spalding for reporting ethical concerns regarding King &amp; Spalding's representation of the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corporation. (Compl., ECF No. 1; Opinion &amp; Order on Mot. for Summ. J. (\"SJ Opinion &amp; Order\"), ECF No. 74, at 1.) The law firm Javerbaum Wurgaft was counsel of record for Joffe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 8, 2018, King &amp; Spalding's motion for summary judgment was denied. (SJ Opinion &amp; Order at 24.) On June 27, 2018, Javerbaum Wurgaft first advised District Judge Caproni that it would seek to withdraw as counsel for Joffe, and requested a stay of the case. (6/27/18 Letter, ECF No. 75.) On June 28, 2018, Judge Caproni declined to stay the case pending counsel's motion to withdraw, but stated that she would consider a stay or extension of the parties' deadlines if counsel were permitted to withdraw. (6/28/18 Endorsement, ECF No. 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 13, 2018, Javerbaum Wurgaft filed its motion to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff. As part of its motion, the firm sought to affix retaining and charging liens against Plaintiff. (Notice of Mot., ECF 79.) Javerbaum Wurgaft filed in support of its motion a Declaration of Andrew M. Moskowitz (ECF No. 80), and a memorandum of law (ECF No. 81).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 24, 2018, Joffe filed his response to the motion to withdraw (ECF No. 84), and on August 6, 2018, Javerbaum Wurgaft filed a reply memorandum (ECF No. 86) and reply declaration. (ECF No. 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 11, 2018, District Judge Caproni granted the motion by Javerbaum Wurgaft to withdraw, and granted a stay of expert discovery until October 8, 2018, for Plaintiff to retain new counsel. (9/11/18 Order, ECF No. 90.) Judge Caproni found there to be \"satisfactory reasons\" for Javerbaum Wurgaft to withdraw as counsel for Jaffe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Judge Caproni referred to me \"the question of whether Plaintiff's counsel had 'good cause' to withdraw and is entitled to a charging lien, and if so, in what amount.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

(9/20/18 Endorsement, ECF No. 106.) On September 28, 2018, Joffe filed a five-page sur-reply memorandum (ECF No. 110), as well as a declaration. (ECF No. 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a closed hearing on October 1, 2018, at which Joffe and Andrew Moskowitz (\"Moskowitz\"), an attorney who is Of Counsel at Javerbaum Wurgaft, provided argument, as well as testimony. At the outset of the hearing, the Court placed both Joffe and Moskowitz under oath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Facts Regarding Attorney-Client Relationship\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In order to preserve the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship, this Opinion and Order will not address details of the relationship between Joffe and Javerbaum Wurgaft. Suffice it to say, the record evidence reflects, and Joffe admits, that he directed unprofessional and inappropriate remarks at Moskowitz. In addition, in the lead-up to the decision by Javerbaum Wurgaft to seek to withdraw as counsel for Joffe, the evidence reflects several hostile emails sent by Joffe to Moskowitz, including threats made by Joffe to himself retain other counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under New York law, an attorney who is discharged is statutorily entitled to a charging lien on any monetary recoveries obtained by the former client in the case in which the attorney rendered legal services. The relevant statute provides in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   From the commencement of an action, special or other proceeding in any court ..., the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his or her client's cause of action, claim or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, determination, decision, award, settlement, judgment or final order in his or her client's favor, and the proceeds thereof in whatever hands they may come; and the lien cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment, final order or determination. The court upon the petition of the client or attorney may determine and enforce the lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Judiciary%20Law%20%C2%A7%20475\">\n    N.Y.
