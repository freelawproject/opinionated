Dr. Chang testified that no once-daily doxycycline formulations existed before he developed one while working at Shire. (Chang Tr. at 686)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   175. In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , the Court found \"CollaGenex had no meaningful idea what composition might achieve a once-daily doxycycline product without antibiotic effect or if it was even possible to do so because CollaGenex lacked formulation expertise.\" (DTX-201 at 20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   176. In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that \"[i]t was unexpected that a therapeutic, controlled-release, once-daily dosage form which provided steady state plasma concentrations of doxycycline of a minimum of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml and a maximum of 1.0 \u00b5g/ml could be achieved.\" (DTX-201 at 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   177. While prosecuting the Chang patents, the applicant told the PTO that as of 2003, \"the art did not provide guidance for a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     single\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   immediate release pharmaceutical dosage form that would deliver 25 mg to 40 mg doxycycline and still achieve subantimicrobial effect.\" (PTX-17 at 285) (emphasis in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   178.

(DTX-241 \u00b6 94) (emphasis in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   180. Dr. Rudnic further stated that \"a skilled artisan would have to engage in excessive trial-and-error experimentation ... to determine, which, if any, of the numerous hypothetical formulations within the broad scope of the Ashley references might actually work to meet the goals of the Chang '740 patent inventors - a once-daily doxycycline formulation that ... would effectively treat inflammatory conditions like rosacea while remaining below blood levels linked to antibacterial side effects.\" (DTX-241 \u00b6 128)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   181.

(PTX-129)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   182. In that submission, Amneal stated that the claims of the Ashley patents, including the claims reciting administration \"once a day\" and by \"sustained release,\" are enabled. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-129 \u00b6\u00b6 102, 124) Amneal stated that the Ashley patents expressly disclose \"once-daily\" and \"sustained release\" administration of 40 mg doxycycline that achieves the desired blood levels of the invention; the Periostat\u00ae Label and Periostat\u00ae Approval Package would provide a POSA with substantial information, including that 40 mg IR doxycycline administered once-daily would achieve a maximum steady-state blood level of 0.834 \u00b5g/ml; and the Ashley patents incorporate by reference the Ashley '854 application, which describes formulation approaches for achieving \"once-daily\" dosing and \"sustained release\" with low dose doxycycline. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-129 \u00b6\u00b6 156, 159, 160, 121-22, 180, 191, 234-35, 536, 542-43)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   183.

(DTX-206 at 23)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   184. When shown the figure, Mr. Ashley testified his \"understanding of [the\n   drawing] would be that these are just hypothetical, wholly hypothetical, profiles of release.\" (Ashley Tr. at 657) Mr. Ashley added he \"really ha[d] no understanding of what [the controlled release agents described in the Ashley '854 application] would mean.\" (Ashley Tr. at 655)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   185. Mr. Ashley also testified that \"there's really no guidance, meaningful guidance, in [the Ashley, 854 application], and I had no idea at the time how one might achieve\" a controlled release formulation. (Ashley Tr. at 654-55)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   186. During the Chang IPRs, Dr. Rudnic stated that the Ashley '932 publication\"does not present a single example of an actual formulation that was developed or even contemplated by Mr. Ashley.\" (DTX-241 \u00b6 95)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   187. Mr. Ashley is not a formulator and viewed his invention as being \"the notion of a flat or relatively flat release profile or relatively flat pharmaco-serum profile.\" (Ashley Tr. at 654-55)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As explained below, the Court concludes Galderma is not precluded from alleging infringement of the Chang patents under the doctrine of equivalents. Furthermore, Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amneal's ANDA product infringes all of the asserted claims of the Chang patents under the doctrine of equivalents, other than claim 1 of the Chang '532 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(PTX-013.0028-32, .380-81) The new claims recited compositions \"comprising\" 30 mg IR and 10 mg DR portions of doxycycline. (PTX-013.381) The Examiner issued a Non-Final Rejection of the claims as obvious in view of prior art that disclosed once-daily compositions comprising \"at least two portions,\" including IR and DR. (PTX-013.435) The applicant amended the claims, changing \"comprising\" to \"consisting essentially of.\" (PTX-013.447) The Examiner then issued a Final Rejection of the claims. (PTX-013.458-61) In response, the patentee amended the claims to change \"consisting essentially of\" to \"consisting of\" 30 mg IR and 10 mg DR portions.

(PTX-013.553-55)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   While Amneal contends this amendment means the patentee surrendered embodiments with SR or other non-DR portions, the Court disagrees. As the Court noted in its claim construction opinion, \"[t]here is no argument or discussion accompanying the amendment that provides additional insight\" into the applicant's reasons for making the amendment that would support finding the applicant had disclaimed compositions with an IR portion and multiple types of DR portions. (PTX-378.0013) Therefore, the Court agrees with Galderma that the record does not demonstrate a clear disavowal of subject matter. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 265 at 9) (contending applicant amended claims in order to \"exclude a\n   high antibacterial dosage amount from the scope of the claims\") Thus, the Court is not persuaded that the \"consisting of\" amendment was made for the purposes of patentability such that it compels a conclusion of prosecution history estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Dr. Rudnic's statements do not meet that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   During the Chang IPRs, Dr. Rudnic opined that the DR portion claimed in Chang results in \"no substantial release of doxycycline in the acidic stomach environment.\" (DTX-241 \u00b6 176) This, Amneal argues, should preclude Galderma from asserting doctrine of equivalents infringement for DR portions that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   release a substantial amount of doxycycline in the stomach environment. (D.I. 246 at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   But, again, Amneal has failed to show a clear disavowal of claim scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordis Corp. v.

As the Court previously found - like the PTAB had before it - while Dr. Rudnic distinguished the secondary loading portion of Sheth from the DR portion claimed in Chang, his statements did not clearly limit the scope of the claims to DR portions having no substantial release of doxycycline below pH 4.5.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at 7; D.I. 246 at 7, 12) Under both tests, the Court finds that Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amneal's ANDA product infringes the asserted claims of the Chang patents, except for the asserted claim of the Chang '532 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Galderma contends that the [redacted], in combination with the [redacted], is insubstantially different from the 10 mg DR portion claimed in Chang. Galderma focuses on whether Amneal's [redacted] is a DR portion within the meaning the Court has given to \"delayed release\" - that is, \"release of a drug at a time other than immediately following oral administration.\" (D.I. 130) In Galderma's view, Amneal \"intentionally engineered\" its [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-82-84; Sealed Tr. A at A-7 (opening statement) ) The [redacted] and [redacted] combine, Galderma argues, to act as \"barriers\" [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-82-84) That combined insulating effect and resulting \"delay,\" Galderma contends, means the [redacted] does not release until at a time \"other than immediately following oral administration,\" making it a DR portion within the Court's construction of that term. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-81) It follows, Galderma argues, that Amneal's product contains [redacted] that is insubstantially different from the 10 mg DR portion claimed in Chang. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-81-88)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   Amneal sees its product very differently. In Amneal's view, its [redacted] is not [redacted], but rather is [redacted] that is quite distinct from the DR portion claimed in Chang. To highlight the difference between [redacted], Amneal relies on the IPR testimony of Galderma's expert, Dr. Rudnic. During the Chang IPRs, Dr. Rudnic distinguished the DR portion claimed in Chang, which Dr. Rudnic argued \"delayed [the] release ... [of]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the drug contained in that portion,\" from the secondary loading portion disclosed in Sheth, which Dr. Rudnic argued was surrounded by a blended pH-sensitive and water-soluble polymer that \"immediately\" formed pores, allowing drug to dissolve out \"in a slow, sustained release fashion beginning promptly after administration.\" (DTX-241 \u00b6\u00b6 172, 175, 181) (emphasis in original) According to Dr. Rudnic in the IPRs, the time it took the blended polymer of Sheth to form pores and begin releasing drug was not a \"delay.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-271 at 13) The PTAB agreed, finding that Sheth did not contain a DR portion within the meaning of the Chang patents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0232 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00437460-461) Amneal also emphasizes that \"immediate release\" does not require instantaneous release, but instead depends on whether the drug is available for wetting, dissolution, and release right after oral administration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-113-14) (agreeing \"[t]ime is irrelevant\" to whether portion is IR) Here, [redacted] It follows, Amneal argues - and, in Amneal's view, Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Rudnic, agrees - that Amneal's [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-186, B-196)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Under the function-way-result test, Galderma contends that the function of Amneal's [redacted], in combination with the [redacted], is to delay release of [redacted] until a time other than immediately following oral administration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-85) The way it does so is [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-85, B-92-93) The result, according to Galderma, is [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-70-72)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Amneal, however, views the purpose of its [redacted] to be [redacted], but not to [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-186) Amneal also rejects the notion that its [redacted] and [redacted] have an insulating effect [redacted], arguing instead that its [redacted] works to [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-193) To that end, Amneal argues that neither [redacted] nor [redacted] delays release of a drug. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-184-85; Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-79-80) Because neither component alone delays the release of [redacted], Amneal argues, [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-185) Finally, Amneal argues that its ANDA product results in [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-170-72)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Each side makes persuasive arguments in its favor and highlights shortcomings in the other's theories. Galderma has shown that [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-82-84) Further, as Plaintiffs persuasively argue, nothing in the Court's construction of \"delayed release\" requires that the delay be caused by an enteric coating or other \"technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 130)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For its part, Amneal points to strong evidence that neither its [redacted] nor its [redacted], on its own, cause a delay in the release of drug. Relatedly, Amneal has shown that accepting Galderma's theory risks implying that every IR formulation can be considered to have a DR portion, since the innermost molecule of drug in any IR formulation will not release until some significant time - here, for doxycycline, 30 minutes or more - after oral administration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 964-65)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   To prevail at trial, a party is not required to make a showing wholly unblemished by flaws, inconsistencies, and doubts. Instead, the Court, when sitting as factfinder, is called upon to make a determination based on the evidence presented, applying the appropriate burden of proof, even when there is strong evidence on both sides of the dispute. Doing so here, the Court concludes that Galderma has proven infringement by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Nothing in the Court's construction of \"delayed release\" limits the way in which that delay is created. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 130) Thus, it does not matter whether the delay is caused by an enteric coating or some other barrier, so long as release does not occur until \"a time other than immediately following oral administration.\" (D.I. 130) It is undisputed that Amneal's ANDA product is manufactured [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FF \u00b6 85) Because of that [redacted] Amneal's [redacted], meaning that release [redacted] is delayed until sometime well after \"immediately following oral administration.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-153) The Court agrees with Galderma that [redacted] means that Amneal's [redacted] is not available for release until a time other than immediately following oral administration, satisfying the Court's construction of \"delayed release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   Amneal's arguments to the contrary are, ultimately, unavailing. While Amneal's argument that, under Galderma's theory, an otherwise purely IR formulation could be considered to have a DR portion (that is,\n   the innermost molecules of the IR portion) is clever, it does not justify judgment for Amneal. Simply put, Amneal's hypothetical product is not before the Court. Here, [redacted], Amneal's ANDA product contains [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FF \u00b6 85) [redacted] In this way, the combination of [redacted] that by itself would not \"delay\" release of [redacted] with [redacted] that also by itself would not \"delay\" release of [redacted] results in \"delaying\" the release of [redacted]. In this way, while it may seem an odd conclusion, Galderma has effectively proven that zero ( [redacted] ) plus zero ( [redacted] ) equals something greater than zero ( [redacted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   Amneal's appeal to Sheth similarly lacks merit. [redacted] Sheth's secondary loading portion did not have another drug portion layered on top of it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-91-92; Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-219-20) Thus, the film coating of Sheth was immediately exposed to gastric fluid and, hence, formed pores through which the drug could release promptly following oral administration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-91-92; Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-219-20) Here, [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   Additionally, even accepting that Amneal's [redacted] is [redacted], the Court agrees with Galderma that [redacted] are not mutually exclusive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 181; Elder Tr. at 281-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 380 at 86-87) Nothing in the Court's construction requires that there be no or substantially no release of drug for a period of time (such as the plateau in release exhibited in Oracea \u00ae's dissolution data). Thus, the fact that Amneal's [redacted] does not mean it cannot also be [redacted].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Thus, while the Court agrees with Amneal that neither its [redacted] nor its [redacted] could, standing alone, be said to delay release [redacted], the Court is persuaded that, when viewing Amneal's product as a whole, [redacted] combine to delay the process of wetting, dissolution, and release of [redacted] until a time other than immediately following oral administration. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amneal's [redacted], in combination with its [redacted], is insubstantially different from the 10 mg DR portion claimed in Chang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   The Court's conclusion is the same under the function-way-result test. First, the Court agrees with Galderma that the purpose of Amneal's [redacted], in combination with [redacted], is to delay release of [redacted] until a time other than immediately following oral administration. While Amneal argues that the function of [redacted] is to [redacted], the Court, for the reasons discussed above, does not consider [redacted] to be mutually exclusive under the construction of delayed release in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   The Court further agrees with Galderma that Amneal's ANDA product delays release in the same way that the DR portion claimed in Chang does. As discussed above, the Court's construction of \"delayed release\" is agnostic as to how the delay is accomplished, be it by an [redacted]. Hence, the fact that the delay here is caused by [redacted] is immaterial. During claim construction, the Court rejected Amneal's attempt to require that the delay be due to an enteric coating, finding no support for such a limitation in the specification or claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 129 at 10) While Amneal makes a strong argument that neither its [redacted], when viewed in isolation, delays release, the Court, for the reasons discussed above, must consider how Amneal's ANDA product functions as a whole. When doing so, the Court agrees with Galderma that Amneal's [redacted] combined with the [redacted] function [redacted] and, thus, delay [redacted] from\n   releasing until a time other than immediately following oral administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   Finally, the Court agrees with Galderma that Amneal's [redacted], in combination with the [redacted], achieves the same result as the 10 mg DR portion claimed in Chang. While Amneal showed that its product's dissolution profile is [redacted], what is important to the claims is that Amneal's ANDA product releases [redacted] at a time other than immediately after oral administration. That result can be achieved in more than one way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Again, Amneal's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Amneal contends that \"there is no basis to assume\" that [redacted]. (Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-191-92) To that end, Dr. Elder opined that [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-192) There is no evidence beyond Dr. Elder's speculation to support such a conclusion. Dr. Rudnic credibly testified about [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-62-63, B-65, B-88) Such [redacted] results in the [redacted], as is reflected in Amneal's dissolution data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-88-89) Dr. Elder offered no study or other citation to substantiate his opinion, and Amneal did not perform any testing to prove [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-215) Further, Amneal's ANDA describes quality controls for making [redacted] that support a finding that Amneal's [redacted], and, hence, [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-331 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00010553-556) Moreover, as Dr. Rudnic persuasively explained, a POSA would understand that [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-66-67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276688\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/858/#p869\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at B-63-64 (\"Amneal did a fabulous job [with its product] .... [redacted] ); Elder Tr. at B-215 (acknowledging he can point to no data supporting view that [redacted] ) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Amneal's [redacted], in combination with its [redacted], performs the same function in the same way to achieve the same result as the 10 mg DR portion claimed in Chang. Therefore, again, Amneal's ANDA product satisfies the \"delayed release\" limitation of the Chang patents under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Amneal's ANDA Product Does Not Infringe the Chang '532 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Galderma alleges that Amneal's ANDA product infringes claim 1 of the Chang '532 patent. Claim 1 has an additional limitation missing from the asserted claims of the other Chang patents: the \"the DR portion is in the form of pellets\" and is \"coated with at least one enteric polymer.\" (PTX-003 at 12:2-5) The Chang '532 patent defines \"enteric materials\" as \"polymers that are substantially insoluble in the acidic environment of the stomach, but are predominately soluble in intestinal fluids at specific pHs.\" (PTX-003 at 7:15-18) The [redacted] and [redacted] of Amneal's ANDA product are [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-331 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00010319-320, -469, -551; Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-97) But the parties dispute whether Amneal's ANDA product contains a DR portion \"coated with at least one enteric polymer\" or an equivalent thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Galderma contends that the [redacted] of Amneal's ANDA product, in combination with its [redacted], is insubstantially different from a 10 mg DR portion coated with an enteric polymer. Galderma notes that [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-98) As to the [redacted], Galderma contends that the combined effect of the [redacted] delay release until a time other than immediately following oral administration and, therefore, are insubstantially different from an enteric coated DR portion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-98) Under the function-way-result test, Galderma argues that the [redacted] function\n   to [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-99) The way it does so, Galderma contends, is by delaying release of the drug until a time other than immediately following oral administration, [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-99) The result, according to Galderma, [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-99-100)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Amneal counters that its [redacted] is very different from a DR portion coated with an enteric polymer. Amneal points to the Chang '532 patent itself, which teaches that enteric coatings prevent release of drug in the stomach. [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-003 at 7:47-49; Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-204; Rudnic Sealed Tr. B at B-167) Moreover, Amneal observes, [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-003 at 7:47-53; Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-201-02) Under the function-way-result test, Amneal contends that its product does not infringe because its [redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-204)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   The Court agrees with Amneal. No persuasive evidence has been presented that a POSA would view any part of Amneal's product - [redacted] - as interchangeable with or otherwise insubstantially different from an enteric polymer. Galderma has not demonstrated that enteric polymers, which prevent release in the stomach, would be considered interchangeable with [redacted]. Nor has Galderma offered evidence proving that Amneal's ANDA works in the same way as an enteric polymer to delay release. Instead, Amneal has shown that [redacted] (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Sealed Tr. B at B-201-04)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   Therefore, Galderma has failed to prove that Amneal's ANDA product infringes claim 1 of the Chang '532 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Infringement of the Ashley Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   Galderma contends that Amneal's ANDA product infringes claim 30 of the Ashley '267 patent and claims 14, 15, 23, 24, and 26 of the Ashley '572 patent (the \"asserted claims of the Ashley I patents\"), as well as claims 3, 4, 5, 15, and 16 of the Ashley '506 patent and claims 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Ashley '946 patent (the \"asserted claims of the Ashley II patents\"), \"at least\" under the doctrine of equivalents. Amneal responds that Galderma is collaterally estopped from asserting the Ashley I patents and, anyway, Amneal's ANDA product does not infringe any of the asserted claims of the Ashley patents, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees with Amneal that Galderma is collaterally estopped from asserting the Ashley I patents. With respect to the Ashley II patents, Galderma has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Amneal's ANDA product infringes the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Galderma Is Collaterally Estopped from Asserting the Ashley I Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   Each of the asserted claims of the Ashley I patents requires administration of a \"sub-antibacterial amount\" of doxycycline or an amount that causes \"substantially no antibiotic activity\" (the \"sub-antibiotic\" limitations). (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-001 at 34:46-48; PTX-002 at 32:25-27) Amneal contends that Galderma is collaterally estopped from asserting the Ashley I patents based on the Court's finding in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   that 40 mg doxycycline administered once-daily does not meet the \"sub-antibacterial amount\" limitation of the Ashley I patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175867\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/296/\">\n    809 F.Supp.2d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Galderma disagrees, arguing that the instant case does not present the \"identical\" issue as\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   . In Galderma's view, the issue of doctrine of equivalents infringement was never litigated in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   and should be considered separate from literal infringement for purposes of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   A party asserting collateral estoppel must prove: (1) the previous determination was necessary to the decision, (2) the identical issue was previously litigated, (3) the issue was actually decided on the merits and the decision was final and valid, and (4) the party being precluded from re-litigating the issue was adequately represented in the previous action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v.

Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Three of the four elements are not in dispute. Galderma does not argue that the Court's previous finding of non-infringement of the Ashley I patents was not necessary to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , which Galderma concedes was final and valid. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at 19-20) Nor does Galderma argue that it was not adequately represented in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , where it was represented by the same counsel as it is in the present case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at 19-20) The parties' disagreement is over whether Galderma's doctrine of equivalents infringement theory presents the \"identical issue\" that was previously litigated and decided on the merits in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   . The Court concludes that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , the Court decided that a 40 mg once-daily administration of doxycycline\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   significantly inhibit the growth of microorganisms and, therefore, fails to meet the sub-antibacterial limitation of the Ashley I patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175867\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/296/\">\n    809 F.Supp.2d at 317-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Amneal's ANDA product undisputedly involves once-daily administration of 40 mg doxycycline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-100 at Amneal-Doxy2016-0043868; Edwards Tr. at B-48) Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Amneal I\n   </em>\n   - where the Court held Galderma was collaterally estopped from asserting the Ashley I patents against Amneal - \"in order to prevail against Amneal on its claim for infringement of the Ashley patents, Galderma would have to prevail on the 'identical issue' it previously litigated - and lost - in the Mylan Action.\"\n   <em>\n    Amneal I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324592\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/921/278/\">\n    921 F.Supp.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Galderma is not permitted to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   Galderma's response is that, for purposes of collateral estoppel, the \"issue\" of doctrine of equivalents infringement, which Galderma did not raise at trial in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , is a separate \"issue\" from literal infringement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at 19-20) The Court disagrees. Doctrine of equivalents infringement is one theory of infringement, not a distinct issue itself.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dana v. E.S. Originals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102353\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/1320/#p1324\">\n    342 F.3d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1324 (Fed.

This is consistent with the view that invalidity, too, is a single issue for purposes of collateral estoppel, regardless of how many different theories are presented as a basis for invalidating a patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evonik Degussa GmbH v.

Having decided to pursue only one theory of infringement in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , Galderma is bound by the consequences of that choice - namely, that collateral estoppel bars litigants from raising separate arguments in support of the same issue in a later case, where the other prerequisites for application of collateral estoppel are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   The fact that the Court clarified its construction of the sub-antibiotic limitation does not change this conclusion. As Galderma represented to the Court numerous\n   times in seeking the clarified construction, the Court's clarified construction of the sub-antibacterial limitation does not change the scope of the claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 85 at 32 (\"[W]e're not seeking a new construction.\"), 33, 35 (\"We're not seeking to modify [the construction from\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ] in any way.\") ) Thus, the clarified construction does not provide a basis for Galderma to avoid the estoppel effects of the Court's finding of non-infringement of the Ashley I patents in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molinaro v.

The Court decided the issue of infringement in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   following a trial at which Galderma had a full and fair opportunity to present any evidence of infringement it wished.

(\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-010 at 32:55-56) The Court construed this term to mean an amount that \"results in no reduction of skin microflora vis-\u00e0-vis a placebo control during a six-month treatment, with microbiological sampling at baseline and month six.\" (PTX-378 at 0006) While Galderma has not proven Amneal's ANDA product literally meets this limitation, Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amneal's ANDA product infringes the asserted claims of the Ashley II patents under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Galderma has not proven Amneal's ANDA product literally infringes the Ashley II patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Galderma urges the Court to find Amneal's ANDA product, a once-daily 40 mg dosage of doxycycline, literally meets the skin microflora limitation based on the\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   study and Amneal's Label. Amneal counters that these are insufficient bases to establish literal infringement, particularly\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , which sampled only the sebaceous skin of the forehead. The Court agrees with Amneal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   does not prove that Amneal's ANDA product literally meets the skin microflora limitation. Nothing in the Court's construction of the skin microflora limitation limits the claim to the bacteria found on a particular part of the body. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 124) (agreeing claims are not limited to bacteria found on face) Hence, it applies to microflora across the entire human body. At least hundreds of millions of bacterial cells exist all over normal skin, and there is great diversity in the types of bacteria found on the skin, even in areas close to one another. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhanel Tr. at 222) Accordingly, it may be impossible to prove that absolutely no microflora in any part of the body is inhibited by administration of 40 mg doxycycline once-daily. It is enough here, however, to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , which reports on one area of the body (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 121; Zhanel Tr. at 168), is insufficient to prove \"no reduction of skin microflora vis-\u00e0-vis a placebo\" in all parts of the body and, thus, does not prove literal infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Amneal's Label also does not prove literal infringement. Amneal's Label states: \"\n   <em>\n    In vivo\n   </em>\n   microbiological studies utilizing a similar drug exposure for up to 18 months demonstrated no detectable long-term effects on bacterial flora of the ... skin ....\" (PTX-100 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00434890) As Amneal notes, this statement does not address the effects of Amneal's ANDA product on skin microflora in the immediate, short-term, or medium-term (i.e., from baseline to six-months). Accordingly, the Label simply does not address all time frames, including the relevant time frame (0-6 months), for determining whether there has been a reduction in skin microflora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   This conclusion holds despite the Court's previous statement that administration of Oracea \u00ae and Mylan's ANDA product, both 40 mg daily dosages of doxycycline, \"results in no reduction of skin microflora during a six-month treatment.\" (DTX-201 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 77) In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , the Court was not asked either to construe or analyze the skin microflora limitation - a fact Galderma makes a point of noting (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at\n   11) (\"Importantly, the Ashley II patents were not at issue in the prior\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Amneal I\n   </em>\n   Actions ....\") - and, of course, was not tasked with deciding whether Amneal's ANDA product meets the skin microflora limitation. Having now had the benefit of trial and argument addressing the skin microflora limitation, the Court concludes, based on the record before it and under the Court's construction of the skin microflora limitation, that Galderma has not proven that administration of Amneal's ANDA product would literally meet the skin microflora limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Amneal infringes the Ashley II patents under the doctrine of equivalents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   While Galderma's evidence was not sufficient to prove Amneal's ANDA product literally infringes, Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amneal's ANDA product infringes the asserted claims of the Ashley II patents under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   The Court agrees with Galderma that the results of the\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   study demonstrate that Amneal's ANDA product will be administered in an amount that results in essentially no reduction in skin microflora over a six-month period. As Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Zhanel explained,\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   (the results of which were reported in the Ashley patents as Example 38) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that sampled the skin microflora of patients with moderate acne before and after a six-month treatment of 40 mg doxycycline daily. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-288 at GLD0083629; Zhanel Tr. at 165)\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   found that, as compared to the placebo, 40 mg doxycycline daily had no effect on the skin microflora, caused no change in the composition of the normal skin flora, and did not result in the emergence of doxycycline-resistant organisms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-288 at GLD0083631-632; Zhanel Tr. at 165-66; Webster Tr. at 78-80) More specifically,\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   showed that 40 mg of doxycycline daily results in no statistically significant change in the total microbial colony counts for each species sampled, including\n   <em>\n    P. acnes\n   </em>\n   ; no increase in the number of bacteria resistant to 4 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline ; and no increase in MIC values for isolates resistant to 4 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-288 at GLD008361-362; Zhanel Tr. at 165-67) These findings prove that administration of 20 mg twice-daily doxycycline (or 40 mg once-daily) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 80) results in, at most, a negligible reduction of skin microflora during a six-month treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   Amneal's Label confirms this conclusion. As discussed above, Amneal's Label states: \"\n   <em>\n    In vivo\n   </em>\n   microbiological studies utilizing a similar drug exposure for up to 18 months demonstrated no detectable long-term effects on bacterial flora of the ... skin ....\" (PTX-100 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00434890) This excerpt (as it relates to skin) was approved by the FDA for inclusion in Oracea \u00ae's Label based on the results of the\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   study. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 71-72; Zhanel Tr. at 157) Thus, the FDA has accepted the finding that a once-daily 40 mg dose of doxycycline is equivalent to the 20 mg twice-daily administration tested in\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 80) Amneal's Label contains the same statement as Galderma's, showing that Amneal's ANDA product will be administered in an amount that results in no detectable longterm effects on skin microflora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   Amneal's arguments to the contrary fail to persuade the Court. Amneal contends that microbiological sampling of at least three or four representative areas of the body would be necessary to prove infringement. However, as the Court previously found,\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   is the strongest intrinsic\n   evidence of what the patentee intended to convey with the skin microflora limitation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 129 at 6) Testimony at trial also confirmed that, as of 2000-2001, a POSA would have considered swabbing the glabella, the methodology employed in\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , to be the standard method for studying the effect of doxycycline on skin microflora. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhanel Tr. at 168 (explaining why sebaceous facial skin is ideal for testing bacteria associated with acne); Webster Tr. at 80-82 (explaining logic behind sampling forehead, where\n   <em>\n    P. acnes\n   </em>\n   lives, because\n   <em>\n    P. acnes\n   </em>\n   \"is the bug to which the inflammation in acne is directed\") ) As Drs. Kreiswirth and Meltzer conceded - and as is supported by common sense - sampling the entire skin surface for skin microflora would be impractical and cost-prohibitive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kreiswirth Tr. at 546 (\"I mean, sampling all areas of your skin, first of all, would be expensive and probably not necessary to sample all areas of your skin\"); Meltzer Tr. at 620 (\"It's impractical, I agree with you, to assay the entire skin surface.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Moreover, Amneal's experts could not agree on how many locations would need to be sampled or the types of sampling methods that would be required to prove infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Kreiswirth Tr. at 548 (stating that sampling three, four, or five regions of skin is required)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Meltzer Tr. at 615-21 (suggesting that samples from even 20 regions of body would not be sufficient to prove infringement) ) Nor could Dr. Kreiswirth point to any study available as of 2001 that utilized the procedures he proposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kreiswirth Tr. at 549) Amneal likewise did not present any studying contradicting the findings of\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   or calling into question the methodology\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   used. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edwards Tr. at B-57-58 (conceding she was unaware of any study contradicting\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   's findings); Kreiswirth Tr. at 536 (agreeing\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   is only study to have addressed question of effects of 40 mg doxycycline daily on skin);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 121 (\"Nothing has come out to contradict [Skidmore]. It stands.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   Amneal's various hypotheticals about bacteria that may be inhibited at less than 4 \u00b5g/ml, but that would not appear in the results of\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , do not contradict the Court's conclusion as to doctrine of equivalents infringement. As Dr. Zhanel testified, 4 \u00b5g/ml is the clinical breakpoint for determining resistance to doxycycline, and, while Dr. Zhanel testified that it would not be\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     impossible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to test for resistence less than 4 \u00b5g/ml, the Court is persuaded that any reduction in microflora that would go undetected by\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   would be\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhanel Tr. at 167, 174-75, 270-72) (explaining resistence testing procedures used in\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   and that organisms are not resistant to doxycycline if MIC is less than 4 \u00b5g/ml)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   Thus, based on the record in this case, the Court concludes that Galderma has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the administration of Amneal's ANDA product meets the skin microflora limitation under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Galderma Has Proven Amneal Indirectly Infringes the Ashley II Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   Galderma has also proven that Amneal's efforts to persuade doctors and patients to use Amneal's ANDA product in a manner consistent with Amneal's Label make Amneal liable for indirectly infringing the asserted claims of the Ashley II patents, by both inducing and contributing to direct infringement by third parties. \"To prove induced infringement, the patentee must show direct infringement, and that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent\n   to encourage another's infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Toshiba Corp. v.

While Galderma is correct that the Ashley patents are generally directed to low doses of doxycycline for the treatment of acne rosacea, the patentee also specifically claimed SR and once-daily formulations - a fact that differentiates this case from those on which Galderma relies. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Invitrogen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1553979\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1052/#p1070\">\n    429 F.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the asserted claims \"describe[d] genetically engineered [reverse transcription]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     without regard for the method used\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to mutate the genes\" (emphasis added). Because the claims were unrestricted as to the method of mutation, the Court held that the patent need only enable one mode of achieving the claimed mutation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1553979\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1052/#p1070\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1553979\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1052/#p1070\">\n    at 1070-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating defendant's arguments \"might have force had [plaintiff] limited its claims to [a particular method of mutation]\"). Here, however, the Ashley patents specifically claim methods of administration by once-daily and SR dosages. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-001 at 9:5-7, 9:21-23) Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Invitrogen\n   </em>\n   , the enablement requirement is not met by enabling one mode of making and using the claimed invention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having claimed multiple, particular methods of administration, the patentee was required to enable them. Accordingly, the full scope of the Ashley patents includes \"once a day\" and \"sustained release\" doxycycline formulations, and, thus, the Ashley patents must enable those particular formulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Ashley patents enable SR and once-daily formulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   Regardless, the Ashley patents do enable \"once a day\" and \"sustained release\" formulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   Amneal contends that every\n   <em>\n    Wands\n   </em>\n   factor suggests that the specification would not have allowed a POSA to practice SR or once-daily formulations of doxycycline without undue experimentation. Amneal's expert, Dr. Elder, testified that there were no once a day or SR 40 mg formulations of doxycycline in the prior art, doxycycline's absorption window was unknown as of 2000-2001, the specification provided no additional guidance beyond the prior art, drug absorption is unpredictable, and significant trial and error would have been required to achieve once a day formulations, as evidenced by Faulding's failure to formulate a once a day doxycycline product. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Tr. at 345-47)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Amneal also places particular emphasis on Dr. Rudnic's testimony in the Chang IPRs. During the Chang IPRs, Dr. Rudnic opined that the Ashley specification \"does not disclose or teach\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   actual formulation\n   that at once-daily dosage will give steady state blood levels\" within the required therapeutic window; a \"skilled artisan would have to engage in excessive trial-and-error experimentation ... to determine, which, if any, of the numerous hypothetical formulations within the broad scope of the Ashley references might actually work\" to achieve \"a once-daily doxycycline formulation that ... would effectively treat inflammatory conditions like rosacea while remaining below blood levels linked to antibacterial side effects;\" and the Ashley specification, in combination with the Ashley '854 application, articulated no more than \"a mere\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     wish\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for a low-dose once-daily doxycycline formulation, without any guidance on how to obtain one.\" (DTX-241 \u00b6\u00b6 94, 128)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Galderma counters by pointing to Amneal's admissions in its portion of the proposed final pretrial order filed in\n   <em>\n    Amneal I\n   </em>\n   , which unequivocally state that the Ashley patents were enabled and described. As to once-daily formulations, Dr. Rudnic testified that the Ashley specification's description of target blood levels, as well as the availability of the Periostat\u00ae Label and Approval Package - which disclosed \"substantial\" single dose and steady state pharmacokinetic data for 20 mg twice-daily doxycycline - would provide a POSA with very useful information for formulating a once-daily dosage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 772-74) Indeed, Dr. Rudnic testified that once a POSA had that information, additional pharmacokinetic testing to formulate a once-daily formulation \"would be routine.\" (Rudnic Tr. at 774) Galderma also points to two Whelton papers, which described where the absorption of doxycycline occurs, as providing a POSA with valuable information for formulating a once-daily dosage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 780-81)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   As to SR formulations, Galderma contends that the information in the Ashley '854 application, which is incorporated by reference in the Ashley patents, would have provided a POSA with sufficient information about gastroretentive dosages to enable SR formulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 782-84) Galderma also argues that gastroretentive formulations were well-known in the art as of 2000-2001. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 785-86) Galderma also takes issue with Amneal's use of Dr. Rudnic's IPR testimony, contending that Dr. Rudnic was focused only on whether the specific 30 mg IR/10 mg DR once-daily composition claimed in Chang was obvious. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 244 at 32)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   The Court sides with Galderma. The Ashley patents cite Periostat\u00ae, a 20 mg twice daily dosage of doxycycline, as an \"especially preferred embodiment\" of the claimed invention. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-008 at 5:59-63) Periostat\u00ae was commercially available at the time the Ashley patents were filed, so a POSA would have had access to the Periostat\u00ae Label and Approval Package. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-008 at 5:59-63) The Court agrees with Galderma that these materials would have given a POSA substantial information about the pharmacokinetic properties of Periostat\u00ae, including its Cmax, Tmax, and half-life, in various modes of administration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-519 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00023434; PTX-518 at Amneal-Doxy2016-00290255, -281, -320, -334-348; Rudnic Tr. at 773) Additionally, Example 38 would have provided a POSA with valuable clinical and efficacy data for a twice-daily 20 mg dosage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 795) This information would have provided a POSA attempting to formulate a once-daily formulation with a good starting point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   In addition, a POSA would have had the information disclosed in the Ashley '854 application. The Ashley patents incorporate by reference the Ashley '854 application, which provides information about administering tetracycline compounds by\n   sustained release. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-008 at 9:11-19; Rudnic Tr. at 782) Specifically, the Ashley '854 application identifies as a \"preferred embodiment\" a controlled release composition that becomes entrapped in the upper portion of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., a gastroretentive formula). (DTX-206 at 16:9-14) The '854 application goes on to explain that \"[s]uch compositions are typically manufactured by utilizing controlled-release agents of a larger particle size, as is known in the art.\" (DTX-206 at 16:11-14) Galderma proved at trial that, as of 2000-2001, there were 19 patents covering gastroretentive technologies that would have been available to a POSA attempting to formulate an SR formulation, including patents or patent applications that specifically mention the use of doxycycline in gastroretentive formulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 784-87, 790-92; PTX-125; PTX-126; PTX-197; PTX-198; PTX-199; PTX-200; PTX-201; PTX-202; PTX-203; PTX-204; PTX-205; PTX-206; PTX-207; PTX-208; PTX-209; PTX-210; PTX-211; PTX-212; PTX-215) Moreover, Galderma demonstrated that, while the exact absorption window of doxycycline was unknown as of 2000-2001, a POSA would have known that absorption of doxycycline occurs primarily in the upper GI tract, and not in the colon or lower portion of the GI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 780-81; PTX-284) This knowledge would have allowed a POSA to practice the claimed invention, including once-daily and SR formulations, without undue experimentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   Dr. Rudnic's IPR testimony, while undoubtedly helpful to Amneal's case, does not carry Amneal's heavy burden, particularly in light of the information Galderma proved would have been available to a POSA in the 2000-2001 time frame. In assessing whether there is clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, the Court must also take account of Amneal's own prior statements in\n   <em>\n    Amneal I\n   </em>\n   , to the effect that each of the allowed claims of the Ashley patents is enabled and disclosed once-daily and sustained release compositions of 40 mg doxycycline. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , PTX-129 \u00b6 102 (\"Each of the allowed claims of the [Ashley] '572 patent is supported by an enabling disclosure in the [Ashley] '572 patent specification.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180 (\"The [Ashley] '572 patent ... disclose[s] administering doxycycline once-a-day to achieve steady state serum concentrations between 0.1 \u00b5g/ml to 0.8 \u00b5g/ml, more preferably between 0.4 and 0.7 \u00b5g/ml.\") ) While these pretrial statements are not binding \"admissions\" in the sense that Amneal is foreclosed from contesting the issue, they nonetheless must be factored into the Court's evaluation of how a POSA would view the Ashley patents, and here they help persuade the Court that the Ashley patent claims have not been proven invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Amneal has not met its burden to prove lack of enablement by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Written Description\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   Amneal also asserts that the Ashley patents are invalid for lack of written description. \"[W]ritten description and enablement often rise and fall together.\"\n   <em>\n    Ariad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221514\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1336/#p1344\">\n    598 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   As discussed above, Mr. Ashley recognized enough about the particulars of his invention to include in the patents Example 38, which reports clinical and efficacy data for a 20 mg twice-daily (40 mg daily) dosage of doxycycline; a citation to Periostat\u00ae as an especially preferred embodiment of the claimed invention; and the '854 patent application, which was incorporated by reference into the asserted Ashley patents and provides additional information about gastroretentive formulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rudnic Tr. at 769-70, 782-83) This is sufficient to demonstrate Mr. Ashley was in possession of the claimed invention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   The fact that Mr. Ashley, who was not a formulator, would not himself have known how to make the claimed invention is inapposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 952) Thus, as Amneal concedes, the Court would have to reverse course to find the relevant claims invalid as anticipated.

Consequently, Dr. Feldman's account of his use of Periostat\u00ae is insufficient to invalidate the relevant claims of the Ashley patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Additionally, Amneal has not proven Dr. Feldman's patient's treatment was public. Amneal asks the Court to revisit its previous conclusion that the use was not public, contending that Dr. Feldman was under no obligation to keep the treatment of his patient secret. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 951-52) However, Dr. Feldman was obligated to keep his patient's name and treatment confidential.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feldman Tr. at 422-23) Nor is there evidence that Dr. Feldman used this experience as a basis to publish, patent, or attempt to commercialize a treatment for rosacea.

Dr. Feldman's and His Patient's Use of Periostat\u00ae Did Not Make the Claimed Invention Obvious\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   Amneal asserts that, in the event the claims are found to be enabled, Dr. Feldman's use of Periostat\u00ae invalidates the remaining claims of the Ashley patents as obvious. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elder Tr. at 347-48) (offering obviousness opinion in alternative) In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the argument that Dr. Feldman's use, in combination with three prior art references, rendered the Ashley I patents obvious, having found Periostat\u00ae not to be an embodiment of the Ashley I patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175867\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/296/\">\n    809 F.Supp.2d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Amneal has failed to persuade the Court to change its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that a POSA would have been motivated to practice the claimed invention based on either Dr. Feldman's or his patient's use of Periostat\u00ae. To the contrary, Galderma demonstrated that the conventional wisdom in 2000-2001 was that \"large doses\" of antibiotics were needed to treat acne and rosacea. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster Tr. at 48; Feldman Tr. at 420 (acknowledging that use of doxycycline\"was not a typical treatment [for rosacea ] as of 2000\") ) Amneal did not explain how a POSA would have learned of Dr. Feldman's or his patient's use, or that a POSA would have had any reasonable expectation of success in using 40 mg doxycycline daily (or in an SR formulation) to treat the papules and pustules of rosacea. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feldman Tr. at 407 (stating he only expected patient's rosacea to improve because of his personal experience with Periostat\u00ae), 427-28 (stating he had never disclosed, made public, attempted to sell, attempted to patent, or written about use of Periostat\u00ae), 431-33 (discussing confidentiality obligations and limitations on access to patients' records, which were kept in locked storage locker), 436-37 (stating he did not discuss either use with anyone prior to litigation) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   Thus, Amneal has not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that claims 3, 4, 5, and 16 of the Ashley '506 patent; claims 14, 15, and 16 of the Ashley '946 patent; and all of the asserted claims of the Ashley '572 patent are obvious in light of Dr. Feldman's or his patient's prior use of Periostat\u00ae.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Ashley I Asserted Claims Are Not Indefinite\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   Finally, Amneal argues that the asserted claims of the Ashley I patents are invalid as indefinite because of the sub-antibacterial amount limitations. According to Amneal, a POSA would not be reasonably certain about the minimum amount of inhibition allowed by the claims' requirement that doxycycline be administered in an amount that \"from a clinical point of view, does not inhibit a significant amount\n   of microorganisms, e.g., bacteria even though a few of the more sensitive bacterial cells may be inhibited.\" (PTX-378 at 0008) Galderma counters that a POSA would understand that \"a few\" in the Court's construction allows for inhibition that is not \"significant.\" The Court agrees with Galderma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   The Ashley patents provide sufficient guidance to allow a POSA to understand the boundaries of the sub-antibacterial term. While Amneal contends that \"a few\" is not \"readily quantifiable,\" Amneal's expert, Dr. Kreiswirth, testified that a POSA would understand \"that 'a few' resides somewhere between\" zero and significant inhibition. (Kreiswirth Tr. at 567) These boundaries were ones Dr. Kreiswirth \"fe[lt] comfortable\" testifying that the Ashley patents establish. (Kreiswirth Tr. at 567) Dr. Zhanel offered consistent testimony, stating that at least \"statistically significant\" reductions in bacteria fall outside the scope of the claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhanel Tr. at 739-40) While not an exact figure, the Court concludes that this understanding, in combination with the Ashley '572 patent's recitation of 40 mg doxycycline daily as an \"especially preferred embodiment\" of the claimed invention, shows that the Ashley I patents provide a POSA with reasonable certainty about the scope of the claimed invention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PTX-002 at 6:9-11, 19-23) Thus, Amneal has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims of the Ashley I patents are indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   Galderma has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Amneal infringes claim 1 of the Chang '740 patent ; claims 1 and 3 of the Chang '405 patent ; claims 1 and 2 of the Chang '364 patent ; claims 3, 4, 5, 15, and 16 of the Ashley '506 patent; and claims 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Ashley '946 patent.
