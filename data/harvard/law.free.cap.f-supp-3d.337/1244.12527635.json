Doc. 37 at 4. The Whitakers contend that the accident was caused by the driver of that vehicle and that Laura and her child suffered personal injuries as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of the accident, the 2012 Nissan Rogue was insured with Cincinnati Insurance, Laura's insurer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6. Nor were Laura and her child named insureds under the Travelers policy; rather, the Travelers policy was issued to J. Greg and Linda Whitaker, the parents in-laws and grandparents of Laura and her child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 34-2 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Travelers policy provides \"insureds\" uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $250,000 for each person and $500,000 for each accident, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the policy. Doc. 1-2 at 2. The policy defines \"insured,\" in pertinent part, as \"You or any 'resident relative,' \" with \"you\" referring to the named insureds listed on the declarations page.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Resident relative\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child. Your unmarried dependent children, wards, and foster children while temporarily away from home will be considered residents if they intend to resume residing in your household.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the accident, Laura, her husband, Jeffrey, and their sixteen-month-old daughter, were living in a cabin on property located at 11431 Miami Valley Road in Fort Valley, Georgia. Docs. 34-2 \u00b6 19; 37 at 8. The cabin and the property on which it was located were owned by Greg and Linda. Doc. 34-2 \u00b6 20. Greg and Linda also owned on that property another house, which the parties call the \"main house,\" in which Greg and Linda lived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. While the cabin was located on the same property and shared the same address as the main mouse, the two were separate buildings and received separate utility bills, which were in Greg and Linda's name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Laura, Jeffrey, and their daughter moved into the cabin in May 2016, after they had sold their previous house in Leslie, Georgia, and after Laura and Jeffrey had concluded their jobs as teachers for the school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 30. The Whitakers neither signed a lease nor paid rent to live in the cabin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 35. They also did not intend to live in the cabin permanently.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Instead, their plan was to stay in the cabin while their new house was under construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. During their stay, Laura and Jeffrey supported themselves and claimed their child as a dependent on their 2016 tax return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. For example, Laura and Jeffrey reimbursed Linda for paying the utility bills for the cabin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Laura and Jeffrey also paid for a separate internet provider from the main house, with the bill going directly to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Though the two families would occasionally eat meals together either at the main house or the cabin, Laura and Jeffrey primarily bought their own groceries and cooked their own meals in the cabin, which had its own kitchen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43-44. When Laura and Jeffrey were having meals with just their child, they would eat at the cabin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. In sum, at the time of the accident, Laura, Jeffrey, and their child \"had an independent family arrangement in the Cabin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although maintaining an independent family arrangement in the cabin, their daughter stayed with her grandparents, particularly Linda, a retired dentist, at the main house \"most everyday\" before the accident. Docs. 35-1 at 20:9-11; 35-3 at 11:2-7; 37-3 \u00b6 8. According to Laura, it was \"convenient\" to have her in-laws nearby to watch her child. Doc. 35-1 at 27:4-6. But because the child was so young, she \"only stayed overnight a few times.\" Doc. 37-3 \u00b6 7. At the main house, the grandparents had for the child a nursery, a bedroom, a playroom with toys, clothes, and baby food.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Following the accident, there was a period of time where the child had to physically heal from her accident-related injuries; however, once she was able, the child resumed staying, and currently stays, with her grandparents during \"most everyday\" at their home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The Whitakers eventually moved into their new house in Fort Valley in November 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 10, 2017, the Whitakers and their lawyer sent a letter to Travelers, demanding that Travelers pay its $250,000 limit of uninsured motorist coverage under the Travelers policy to resolve claims for injuries sustained by the child as a result of the August 20, 2016 accident. Doc. 34-2 \u00b6 14. Specifically, the letter detailed that the child incurred special damages of $402,661.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. On February 22, 2017, Travelers filed this declaratory judgment action to determine its obligation, if any, to provide uninsured motorist coverage for the child's injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Travelers argues that the Whitakers are not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under the grandparents' Travelers policy because, at the time of the accident, they resided in a separate household from the named insureds. Doc. 34-1 at 10. In response, the Whitakers first point out that their claim against Travelers \"is only for the injuries and damages sustained by the minor child.\" Doc. 37 at 3. The Whitakers then argue that summary judgment should not be granted because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the child had more than one residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. This \"dual residency\" argument pertaining only to the child was raised for the first time in response to Travelers's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is significant because the Whitakers initially argued something different. Specifically, in their motion to amend their answer (Doc. 31), the Whitakers argued: \"[t]he compound consists of a main house\n   occupied by Grandparents/insureds, and also a separate cabin, in which the Whitakers were living. Despite living in two separate structures upon the compound, all were a single domestic establishment under the singular management of Grandparents/insureds, and therefore a single household.\" Doc. 31-5 at 12. Thus, the Whitakers' initial theory, which they have now abandoned, was that they, \"as part of the single domestic establishment of Grandparents/insureds,\" were resident relatives covered by the Travelers policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court now considers the Whitakers' sole argument: whether their daughter was an insured under the Travelers policy based on having dual residency under Georgia law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Travelers policy provides, in pertinent part, that an insured includes \"any resident relative\" of the named insureds. Doc. 1-2 at 15. The policy defines \"resident relative\" as \"a person related to [the named insureds] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [the named insureds'] household.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Given the plain language of this definition, it is clear, and the parties do not dispute, that the child is related to the named insureds \"by blood, marriage or adoption.\" The only question, therefore, is whether the child was a resident of her grandparents' household at the time of the accident. Docs. 37 at 3-4; 38 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Georgia, questions of domicile and residence are \"mixed questions of law and fact that are ordinarily for a [fact finder] to determine.\"\n   <em>\n    Geiger v.

If maintaining living accommodations in an insured's home is in and of itself sufficient to establish where someone lives, there would be no need to consider issues such as whether separate households have been established and maintained, whether family members intend to discontinue membership in the household, and whether they have taken steps to remove themselves from the household.\"). Though the child may have been sixteen-months-old at the time of the accident and stayed during \"most everyday\" at her grandparents' house where she had a nursery, a bedroom and a separate playroom with toys, clothes, and baby food, these facts alone do not create a fact issue with regard to whether the child resided in her grandparents' home. In their affidavits, Laura and Linda state that the child \"only stayed overnight a few times\" at her grandparents' house. They do not state that the child\n   <em>\n    lived\n   </em>\n   with her grandparents. There is simply no evidence that the child did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the Whitakers' stay at the time of the accident reveal no intent for the child to reside with her grandparents. It is undisputed that the Whitakers only planned on staying in the cabin temporarily until their new house was built. And neither the child's parents nor grandparents give any reason as to why the child would live with her grandparents. If the Whitakers had offered some basis for\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the child was maintaining dual residency, perhaps the facts they now provide would be sufficient to create a fact issue. For example, if a child resided with her grandparents because her parents were having financial trouble, that could suggest dual residency. But that is not the case here, because the child's parents supported themselves and claimed their child as a dependent on their 2016 tax return while living in the cabin. Thus, though the crux of this issue of residency is factual, the undisputed facts clearly show that the child lived with her parents and that her parents had a typical, transient, and \"convenient\" babysitting arrangement with the grandparents-the retired grandmother would care for the child during most of the day while the parents were at work or otherwise needed someone to watch her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While noting there are no Georgia cases addressing this precise issue of whether a minor child is a resident relative of her grandparents' household for purposes of insurance coverage, the Whitakers \"suggest that\n   <em>\n    Couch on Insurance\n   </em>\n   , treatise can provide guidance with respect to the current issue.\" Doc. 37 at 12, 13. In particular, they cite a section of the treatise which provides that, when determining a child's status as a resident of his or her parents' household, one factor to consider is whether there is a \"continuing connection between the child and the parent,\" such that there is \"evidence of continuity of existence or intended continuity of existence at the parent's home.\" STEVEN PLITT ET AL. , COUCH ON INSURANCE \u00a7 128:8 (3rd ed. 2018) (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having reviewed the treatise and the cases referenced therein, the Court reaches the same conclusion. Actually, the Court's conclusion is further supported. As an initial matter, the Court notes that all of the cases that the Whitakers cite from the treatise involve dual residency issues of whether the child resided with parents or step-parents.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

While the child may have developed a \"continuing connection\" with her grandparents in the sense that the grandparents would frequently take care of her at their house, that is no different than any other child forming such connection with grandparents or frequent babysitters. The point is, the intent was for the child to stay at her grandparents' house in a babysitting arrangement, not permanently. Therefore, even construing the evidence in the Whitakers' favor as the non-movant, there is no genuine dispute of material facts that the child was not a resident of her grandparents' household at the time of the accident. Accordingly, the child is not entitled to the uninsured motorist benefits of her grandparents' insurance policy, and Travelers is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
