The Sollbergers' daughter, Kelsey Sollberger, was home alone at the time. After knocking on the door and ringing the doorbell, Kelsey opened the door. The defendant and Blackwell asked her about purchasing a vehicle on the property, and she informed them\n   that it was not for sale. After Sollberger closed the door, she heard noises outside as the defendant and Blackwell stole a welding machine from the property before leaving. The welding machine belonged to Jerry Domecq and was being used by his son, Robert Brown, whom the Sollbergers had hired to add an elevator to their home. Demecq [sic] had purchased the welding machine for seven hundred fifty dollars. On the same date, the defendant and Blackwell took tools from a tool shed owned by Lester Nunez, Jr., located on Laurent Road in Slidell, Louisiana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The next morning, on or about April 17, Michelle Parker and her two sons were at their residence in Slidell when the defendant and Blackwell arrived and began ringing the doorbell, knocking on the door, and banging on the front windows of the home. Parker contacted her husband, Travis Parker, and the police. The defendant and Blackwell stole a generator from the back yard of the home before leaving the property. Mr. Parker had purchased the generator for approximately seven hundred fifty to eight hundred dollars. The victims were recovering and rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina at the time of the offenses. The victims' property was recovered and returned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II.

Excessive Sentence\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Matthews first claims that his enhanced sentence on Count 1, i.e. a term of life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, was excessive. After that claim was first denied by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal on direct review, the Louisiana Supreme Court treated Matthews' related writ application challenging the Court of Appeal's judgment as one seeking collateral review and denied relief based on the state's procedural rules which prohibit challenges to sentencing issues in post-conviction proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   When he thereafter asserted the claims for a second time in his subsequent state post-conviction application, the Louisiana Supreme Court then denied relief on a different procedural basis, holding that Matthews' post-conviction application was untimely filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Matthews' excessive sentence claim was expressly denied by the Louisiana Supreme Court on procedural grounds on both occasions it was presented to that court, this Court reviews the merits of the claim\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   unconstrained by the deferential standards of review of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solis v.

Because the standard for granting such claims under federal law is so daunting, such claims rarely succeed. In light of that reality, opinions addressing such claims are often\n   rather perfunctory. However, because Matthews' sentence is so strikingly harsh given his offenses, the Court must engage in a more thorough analysis in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A logical starting point in any discussion of excessive sentence claims is\n   <em>\n    Rummel v. Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    445 U.S. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). In 1973, William James Rummel was charged with obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses-a felony which, by itself, was punishable by a sentence of not less than two nor more than 10 years. However, Rummel was a recidivist, previously having been convicted in 1964 of fraudulent use of a credit card to obtain $80 worth of goods or services and in 1969 of passing a forged check in the amount of $28.36. As such, he was sentenced to an enhanced term of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question before the United States Supreme Court was whether Rummel's sentence was so excessive as to violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In considering that issue, the Supreme Court noted that it had \"on occasion stated that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime,\" but the Court also noted that \"[o]utside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences have been exceedingly rare.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    445 U.S. at 271-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With respect to Rummel's sentence, the Court then noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [W]e need not decide whether Texas could impose a life sentence upon Rummel merely for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses. Had Rummel only committed that crime, under the law enacted by the Texas Legislature he could have been imprisoned for no more than 10 years. In fact, at the time that he obtained the $120.75 by false pretenses, he already had committed and had been imprisoned for two other felonies, crimes that Texas and other States felt were serious enough to warrant significant terms of imprisonment even in the absence of prior offenses. Thus the interest of the State of Texas here is not simply that of making criminal the unlawful acquisition of another person's property; it is in addition the interest, expressed in all recidivist statutes, in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by its criminal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    . at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777320\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/263/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of that fact, the Supreme Court concluded that Rummel's mandatory habitual offender sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Three years later, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Solem v. Helm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    463 U.S. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). In\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   , Jerry Helm was convicted of uttering a \"no account\" check for $100. Because he was a habitual offender with six prior felony convictions (three for third-degree burglary, one for obtaining money under false pretenses, one for grand larceny, and one for third-offense driving while intoxicated), he was sentenced as a recidivist to an enhanced term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In considering that sentence, the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [W]e hold as a matter of principle that a criminal sentence\n   <em>\n    must be proportionate\n   </em>\n   to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted. Reviewing courts, of course, should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for\n   crimes, as well as to the discretion that trial courts possess in sentencing convicted criminals. But no penalty is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   constitutional.... [A] single day in prison may be unconstitutional in some circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    463 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The Court then explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [A] court's proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment should be guided by objective criteria, including (i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    . at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to the first criterion, the Supreme Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Helm's crime was one of the most passive felonies a person could commit. It involved neither violence nor threat of violence to any person. The $100 face value of Helm's \"no account\" check was not trivial, but neither was it a large amount. One hundred dollars was less than half the amount South Dakota required for a felonious theft. It is easy to see why such a crime is viewed by society as among the less serious offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Helm, of course, was not charged simply with uttering a \"no account\" check, but also with being an habitual offender. And a State is justified in punishing a recidivist more severely than it punishes a first offender.\n   <em>\n    Helm's status, however, cannot be considered in the abstract. His prior offenses, although classified as felonies, were all relatively minor. All were nonviolent and none was a crime against a person.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, there was no minimum amount in either the burglary or the false pretenses statutes, and the minimum amount covered by the grand larceny statute was fairly small.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Helm's present sentence is life imprisonment\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   possibility of parole. Barring executive clemency, Helm will spend the rest of his life in the state penitentiary.\n   <em>\n    This sentence is far more severe than the life sentence we considered in\n    <em>\n     Rummel v. Estelle\n    </em>\n    . Rummel was likely to have been eligible for parole within 12 years of his initial confinement, a fact on which the Court relied heavily.\n   </em>\n   Helm's sentence is the most severe punishment that the State could have imposed on any criminal for any crime. Only capital punishment, a penalty not authorized in South Dakota when Helm was sentenced, exceeds it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    . at 296-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added; footnotes and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the second criterion (i.e. the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction), the Supreme Court then reviewed South Dakota law and noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [T]here were a handful of crimes that were necessarily punished by life imprisonment: murder, and, on a second or third offense, treason, first degree manslaughter, first degree arson, and kidnapping. There was a larger group for which life imprisonment was authorized in the discretion of the sentencing judge, including: treason, first degree manslaughter, first degree arson, and kidnapping; attempted murder, placing an explosive device on an aircraft, and first degree rape on a second or third offense; and any felony after three prior offenses. Finally, there was a large group of very serious offenses for which life imprisonment was not authorized, including a third offense of heroin dealing or aggravated assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Criminals committing any of these offenses ordinarily would be thought more deserving of punishment than one uttering a \"no account\" check-even when the bad-check writer had already committed six minor felonies. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that any habitual offender other than Helm has ever been given the maximum sentence on the basis of comparable crimes. It is more likely that the possibility of life imprisonment under [the statute pursuant to which Helm was sentenced] generally is reserved for criminals such as fourth-time heroin dealers, while habitual bad-check writers receive more lenient treatment. In any event, Helm has been treated in the same manner as, or more severely than, criminals who have committed far more serious crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    . at 298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lastly, with respect to the third criterion (i.e. the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions), the Supreme Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court of Appeals found that \"Helm could have received a life sentence without parole for his offense in only one other state, Nevada,\" and we have no reason to doubt this finding. At the very least, therefore, it is clear that Helm could not have received such a severe sentence in 48 of the 50 States. But even under Nevada law, a life sentence without possibility of parole is merely authorized in these circumstances. See Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 207.010(2) (1981). We are not advised that any defendant such as Helm, whose prior offenses were so minor, actually has received the maximum penalty in Nevada.

Estelle\n   </em>\n   , for the possibility of parole in that case is matched by the possibility of executive clemency here. The State reasons that the Governor could commute Helm's sentence to a term of years. We conclude, however, that the South Dakota commutation system is fundamentally different from the parole system that was before us in\n   <em>\n    Rummel\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   As a matter of law, parole and commutation are different concepts, despite some surface similarities. Parole is a regular part of the rehabilitative process. Assuming good behavior, it is the normal expectation in the vast majority of cases. The law generally specifies when a prisoner will be eligible to be considered for parole, and details the standards and procedures applicable at that time. Thus it is possible to predict, at least to some extent, when parole might be granted. Commutation, on the other hand, is an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   exercise of executive clemency.

At the Court's direction, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing this prong of this analysis, and they are in agreement in their conclusions.

Matthews noted in his supplemental brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   In Louisiana, a life sentence is the second-most severe penalty authorized under law after execution by lethal injection. It has been reserved for only the most serious offenses, five (5) in fact: First-Degree Murder, Second-Degree Murder, First-Degree Rape, Aggravated Kidnapping, and Aggravated Kidnapping of a Child. Other serious or violent offenses, such as Armed Robbery, Manslaughter, Aggravated Arson, or Human Trafficking all include less-severe terms of years. Even Louisiana recidivist criminal statutes penalizing repeat offenses such as Driving Under the Influence, Domestic Abuse Battery, Simple Possession of Marijuana, and Prostitution do not elevate term-offenses to mandatory life sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The respondent conceded that this summary of Louisiana law was correct, while additionally observing that \"treason-a mandatory death penalty offense, R.S. 14:113 -should probably be added to the list.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Of course, many more offenders are eligible for life sentences under Louisiana's habitual offender law. Again, the parties were in agreement as to what Louisiana law provides on that point; however, the respondent's summary is perhaps the more succinct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Louisiana's habitual offender law provides for life-without-parole sentences on a \"three strikes\" basis. At the time of the commission of the offense, the following categories of offenses counted as \"strikes\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (1) a crime of violence under R.S. 14:2(13) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (2) a sex offense as defined in R.S. 15:540 et seq. when the victim is under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the offense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (3) a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law punishable by imprisonment for 10 years or more; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (4) any other crimes punishable by imprisonment for 12 years or more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b) ; (A)(4)(b) (providing for life-without-parole sentence if the present conviction and two prior convictions were for \"any combination of\" the above-listed crimes). In 2017, the Louisiana legislature amended that statute such that the offenses listed in (3) and (4) above no longer count as \"strikes.\" See Acts 2017, No. 282.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Therefore, at the time Matthews was sentenced, Louisiana law punished a wide swath of fourth offenders identically, regardless of the nature of their criminal histories. Accordingly, a fourth offender with a history of nonviolent property\n   crimes, such as Matthews, was treated no differently than a fourth offender with a history of violent crimes and/or serious sex offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the impropriety of equating such disparate offenders was so apparent that the state has now abandoned that practice. In fact, as Matthews noted and the respondent did not dispute,\n   <strong>\n    an individual with Matthews' criminal history would not even be eligible for a life sentence as a habitual offender under current Louisiana law\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The egregiousness of Matthews' sentence is even more apparent on the third prong of the analysis where the Court must engage in an interjurisdictional comparison. As noted, Matthews' underlying crime was simple burglary, and, because he was adjudicated as a fourth offender based on his prior simple burglary convictions from 2005, he was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Matthews' counsel conducted an extensive review of the sentencing statutes of the other states of the union and provided a comprehensive chart showing the sentences criminal defendants with the same history as Matthews would have faced in those states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on his findings, he concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Petitioner was sentenced to life in prison on February 12, 2010 after being adjudicated a fourth-time felony offender. Had Petitioner been convicted of the same offense, with the same prior convictions, in Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, or Virginia-all states with maximum enhanced sentences of eight (8) years or less-his prison sentence would be complete by now. Had he been convicted in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota, Texas-states with maximum enhanced sentences of 10 years-he would be home before the next presidential election. In Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin Petitioner's enhanced sentence could range from 12 to 100 years but would still be restricted to a determinate term of years at the court's discretion. In California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming he would have received no enhancement at all. Only in Idaho, Hawaii, Michigan, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and Washington would Petitioner have been subjected to a life sentence. And, since 2017, only in Washington would Petitioner's sentence be mandated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Petitioner's sentence is practically unique in American jurisprudence: A non-violent offender with no prior violent felonies and significant mitigating factors whose life sentence was mandated. Only in the Pelican State and the Evergreen State was such an enhanced sentencing possible and, to its credit,\n   Louisiana has now banned the practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The respondent did not dispute those findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The undersigned therefore finds that an interjurisdictional comparative analysis likewise supports a conclusion that Matthews' sentence is unconstitutionally excessive. It must be noted that this conclusion neither calls into question the general constitutionality of Louisiana's habitual offender law nor impugns the state's decision to employ a harsher recidivist sentencing structure than those employed by the vast majority of its sister states. Rather, it is simply a recognition that even among the minority of states that vigorously punish recidivism, a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for a young, drug-addicted, nonviolent, sporadic burglar who had never been sentenced to a single day in prison for his prior offenses is such an anomaly as to be unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Where a court's comparative analysis at the second and third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   analysis validates the court's initial finding of gross disproportionality at the first prong, then \"the sentence is cruel and unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At trial, the state called Blackwell as a witness. During Blackwell's testimony, he was asked about various crimes he had committed, including the crimes with which Matthews was also charged in this proceeding. Blackwell testified that he had no memory of another person, including Matthews, being involved in the commission of those crimes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   testimony which even Matthews concedes \"the State had not anticipated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Faced with that unanticipated testimony inconsistent with Blackwell's prior statement, the prosecutor then asked Blackwell whether he had ever told the police that Matthews was involved in the crimes. Blackwell responded, \"I don't even really remember much what I told the police.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor then played the recorded statement Blackwell had previously given to the police in which he identified Matthews as a co-perpetrator of the crimes charged in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Matthews now argues that his counsel should have objected to the introduction of the recording. His argument is convoluted; however, he seems to be contending that the recording was inadmissible hearsay evidence. If that is indeed his argument, it has no merit because the evidence did not in fact constitute hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Louisiana law provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A statement is\n   <em>\n    not hearsay\n   </em>\n   if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (1) The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (a) In a criminal case,\n   <em>\n    inconsistent\n   </em>\n   with his testimony, provided that\n   <em>\n    the proponent has first fairly directed the witness' attention to the statement and the witness has been given the opportunity to admit the fact\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    where there exists any additional evidence to corroborate the matter asserted by the prior inconsistent statement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   La.

Where, as in this case, an objection challenges the revelation of potentially adverse information, the objectionable information is already known to the jury by the time the objection is made and the objection might only exacerbate the problem by further focusing the jury's attention on the information. Additionally, there is always a danger that jurors will be annoyed by repeated defense objections concerning seemingly trivial matters-or, worse, if they view the objections as an attempt by the defense to keep information hidden from them. With such concerns in mind, counsel can appropriately choose to forgo an objection, especially where, as here, (1) the prosecutor is not misstating the evidence or implicating other specific rights of the accused, such as the right to remain silent, and (2) the jury instructions will ultimately address the potential problem presented by the information (which, as noted below, did in fact happen this case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In any event, even if counsel's failure to object is deemed to constitute deficient performance, Matthews still must show that he was in fact prejudiced in order to be entitled to relief. Here, he cannot make that showing. While a juror might naturally be inclined to be sympathetic toward a victim who sustained losses in Hurricane Katrina, the jury was specifically instructed to put such feelings aside. The trial judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is now my duty to instruct you on the law that applies to your deliberations. It is your duty to follow these instructions in reaching your verdict. Although you are the sole judges of the law and the facts on the question of guilt or innocence, you have the duty to accept and apply the law as given by the Court. You must decide the facts from the testimony and other evidence and apply the law to those facts in reaching your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    As jurors, you are not to be influenced by mere sympathy, passion, prejudice, bias, or public opinion.\n   </em>\n   You are expected to reach a just verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Courts have repeatedly noted that jurors are presumed to follow their instructions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Failure to Effectively Advocate for a Downward Departure at Sentencing\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As already discussed at length herein, Matthews received an enhanced sentence as a fourth offender. He does not dispute that he was in fact a fourth offender subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Louisiana habitual offender statute in effect at that time. However, he correctly notes that, under Louisiana law, a trial judge \"has the option, indeed the duty, to reduce [a mandatory] sentence\" if he or she finds that the mandatory sentence \"makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment or that the sentence amounted to nothing more than the purposeful imposition of pain and suffering and is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Matthews therefore argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to effectively advocate for a downward departure under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, he argues: \"[C]ounsel sat mute. He did not present mitigating witnesses, testimony, or allocution; he did not even question that State's expert witness at sentencing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in his reply to the state's response in this matter, Matthews clarified that he was not actually faulting his counsel for failing to present additional evidence but rather for failing to effectively argue for a departure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Matthews' representation that counsel \"sat mute\" is false. The record reflects that counsel did in fact request a downward departure. After citing appropriate state jurisprudence, he argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Considering the, that this was all crimes involving property, burglarizations of property.

Also\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   and I didn't get the complete site [sic] on that, 930 So. 2d. And I would also like to move the Court to reconsider sentence on Count One, and also Count Two, as being unconstitutionally excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Moreover, the record further reflects that the sentencing judge fully considered Matthews' circumstances and found that they simply did not warrant a downward departure under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal thereafter agreed, affirming the enhanced sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In light of the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that the state courts did in fact consider the circumstances Matthews has faulted counsel for failing to explicitly bring to their attention-and they found that those circumstances did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   warrant a downward departure under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, even if counsel could be considered to have performed deficiently in this\n   respect, Matthews cannot show that he was prejudiced. In light of the state courts' emphatic rejection of the argument that a downward departure was warranted under\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   , there is simply no reasonable probability that Matthews would have received a lesser sentence even if his counsel had advocated more strenuously for a downward departure. Accordingly, this claim should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     2.

Wainwright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p182\">\n    477 U.S. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p182\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205694\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/168/#p182\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). None of these factors supports Matthews' proposed prosecutorial misconduct claim. The prosecutor's questions and comments about Hurricane Katrina in no way manipulated the evidence, misstated the evidence, or implicated another specific constitutional right. Further, the jurors were specifically instructed that they were to make their decision based on the evidence and not to be influenced by sympathy, passion or prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, most importantly, the verdict was supported by overwhelming evidence, including eyewitness identification. Therefore, there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the questions and statements about Hurricane Katrina, even if improper, rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. Accordingly, even if a claim of prosecutorial misconduct had been asserted on appeal, it would have been meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As to the remaining claims Matthews suggests appellate counsel could have asserted, he does nothing but merely list the claims without explanation, legal support, or references to the record. A petitioner obviously fails to meet his burden of proof where, as here, he offers nothing other than his conclusory contention that the proposed claims were stronger than the claim actually asserted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Redd\n   </em>\n   , 619 Fed. App'x 333, 337 (5th Cir. 2015) (\"Redd's conclusory contentions that the proposed sentencing claims were stronger than the appellate\n   issues presented by [counsel] and that such claims would likely have succeeded if raised are insufficient to support a constitutional claims [sic] of ineffective assistance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   For all of these reasons, Matthews has utterly failed to meet his burden to prove that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the proposed claims were \"clearly stronger\" than the claim asserted by appellate counsel or that there is a reasonable probability that the appellate court would have vacated or reversed the trial court judgment if only the proposed claims had been asserted. Accordingly, Matthews' claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     C. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Lastly, Matthews argues that the prosecution engaged in misconduct by introducing Blackwell's recorded statement and making references to Hurricane Katrina. For the reasons already fully explained herein, the prosecutor's introduction of the recorded statement was proper and his references to Hurricane Katrina, even if improper, were not so egregious as to violate Matthews' right to due process. Therefore, this prosecutorial misconduct claim is meritless and should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     RECOMMENDATION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   It is therefore\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Patrick Matthews' federal application for habeas corpus relief be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Matthews' excessive sentence claim be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and that it be\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that he be released from confinement unless the state court resentences him to a constitutional sentence in accordance with this opinion within one hundred twenty (120) days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Matthews' federal application be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   A party's failure to file written objections to the proposed findings, conclusions, and recommendation in a magistrate judge's report and recommendation within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy shall bar that party, except upon grounds of plain error, from attacking on appeal the unobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the district court, provided that the party has been served with notice that such consequences will result from a failure to object.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglass v.

Nothing in the record reflects any criminal activity occurring from 2006 through 2008. This short spate of 2005 burglaries, committed when Matthews was 17 and 18 years old, thus formed the sole predicate offenses which resulted in Matthews being sentenced as a habitual offender to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole with respect to the two instant convictions for simple burglary, offenses which were committed in a two-day period in 2009 when he was 21 years old. In light of these facts, it is difficult to describe Matthews as a true \"serial\" or \"chronic\" offender. Rather, it would be more accurate to describe him as an episodic offender, with one episode in 2005 and another in 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Similarly, one scholar has opined:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n    At least in jurisdictions without generous early release provisions, life sentences are practically akin to \"death-in-prison sentences\" or necessarily beget \"death by incarceration.\" A \"life term\" is a cultural artifact, signifying the recipient's penal servitude until the end of his natural life. In other words, the State is thereby proactively and physically condemning the individual to die within prison walls. One author posits a life sentence is merely \"a semantically disguised sentence of death.\" For the foregoing reasons, the availability of a life sentence has been referred to as the \"new death penalty\" or the \"other death penalty.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n    Alternatively, commentators have contended that life sentences can be\n    <em>\n     more\n    </em>\n    punitive than capital punishment, while receiving far fewer substantive and procedural protections.

In cases involving the second classification of Eighth Amendment challenges-applying categorical restrictions on the death penalty or LWOP [life without parole]-the Supreme Court \"has looked beyond our Nation's borders for support for its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual.... Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting the global consensus against the sentencing practice in question.\"\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     560 U.S. at 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 2011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is unclear whether in the first classification of Eighth Amendment challenges-such as the as-applied challenge before us today-courts should also look to foreign law. I therefore note that foreign law further supports the proposition that [the defendant's] sentence is out of proportion to his crime, for \"LWOP ... scarcely exists elsewhere in the world. Yet today, the number of defendants sentenced to LWOP by American courts approaches 50,000.... In fact, what separates the American criminal justice system from the rest of the world, and brands it as distinctively harsh, is the number of inmates dispatched to prison for the duration of their lives, without offering a legal mechanism for freedom.\" Indeed, Germany, France, and Italy have declared LWOP to be unconstitutional, and other European countries apply it only very rarely.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 32-33 (footnotes omitted).
