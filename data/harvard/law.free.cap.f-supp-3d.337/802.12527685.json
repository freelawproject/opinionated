Blue Book Services provides credit and marketing information to members of the produce industry by gathering and updating financial and marketing data. PSOF \u00b6 1. Subscribers to Blue Book's database can access the full catalogue of information by logging in online and paying an annual fee.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16, 23, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   One such subscriber was Amerihua Produce, Inc., a New York importer specializing in garlic and ginger distribution. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6. In June 2008, Amerihua's CEO, Baozhu Wu,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, signed a contract with Blue Book and paid an annual membership fee so that he (and Amerihua) could access the Blue Book database.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.

PSOF \u00b6 12. But Wu contends he never saw nor agreed to the updated Terms, Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After becoming a member, Wu gave out his unique User ID to his three employees, who accessed the database as well. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 15-17. Amerihua continued using the Blue Book database nearly every day,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, and presumably remained a Blue Book member for the ensuing years before the breach's discovery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 26. On July 28, 2016, Blue Book discovered its proprietary data had been publicly posted to two websites, FreshTerminal.com and Co-produce.com.\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After contacting Fresh Terminal's proprietor, Mario Zhuo, and sending a cease-and-desist letter, the\n   offending websites were taken down around October 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To determine the source of the data breach, Blue Book audited its internal systems using a tool that tracks every page visited by licensed Blue Book users. PSOF \u00b6 20. The tool tracks the data viewed, the date and time it was retrieved, and the internet connection that accessed it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Blue Book learned that Amerihua's unique user ID, assigned to Wu, accessed 63,054 pages of Blue Book's database on November 26, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The access rate was nearly 200 pages per minute-a speed impossible for a human user to read.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. And during its review, Blue Book discovered that the data posted publicly on the Fresh Terminal and Co-produce websites was identical to the entire database of information downloaded using Amerihua's credentials on that date in November.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25. After this revelation, in around August 2016, Blue Book accused Amerihua of being behind the breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Amerihua denied all knowledge and said that it did not download the database at all. Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the full-database download in November 2014, Zhuo, Fresh Terminal's proprietor, reached out to Wu about a proposal to launch the website. PSOF \u00b6 30. Wu discussed forming a business relationship with Zhuo centered around the general business concept of Fresh Terminal. Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6 31. Specifically, Zhuo proposed that Amerihua would invest $800,000 in exchange for a 20% share in the business; Zhuo and Wu did not end up agreeing, however, on any investment terms. PSOF \u00b6 41-42. Between September 2014 and the summer of 2015, Wu had around 10-12 communications with Fresh Terminal, and Zhuo visited Amerihua's offices four to five times. Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. Later, in its marketing materials, Fresh Terminal would compare itself to Blue Book, PSOF \u00b6 32, and its business plan identified Wu as an \"Advisor\" and \"Co-founder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. A testimonial attributed to Wu (along with his photo) also appeared on the Fresh Terminal website that discussed the ease and cost-effectiveness of using Fresh Terminal. PSOF \u00b6 38-39. Amerihua, for its part, contends that it never authorized Fresh Terminal to use Wu's password or access Blue Book with its credentials, but does not know if its password was stolen. DSOF \u00b6 43; Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties now cross-move for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim (the sole claim in the case). Blue Book contends that the available evidence proves that Amerihua perpetrated the breach and shared Blue Book's database without authorization, while Amerihua argues that it did not perform or facilitate the data distribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. Summ. J.; Pl. Resp. and Mot. Summ. J. But a reasonable jury could see it either way, so neither side wins summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties move for summary judgment on myriad grounds. Amerihua asserts that: (1) no reasonable jury could find that it breached its contract with Blue Book; (2) even if Amerihua breached the contract, Blue Book suffered no damages; and (3) anyway, the contract was invalid and parts of it were unconscionable. R. 56, Def. Br. at 4-5. Amerihua also seeks to bar Blue Book's damages expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. In parrying Amerihua's summary judgment motion, Blue Book also moves for summary judgment, contending that a jury must find that Amerihua breached the contract, and that Blue Book is entitled to attorney's fees.

Amerihua argues that Blue Book's breach claim must fail on its face, because the agreement was not a valid and enforceable contract. Def. Br. at 4. A contract will not be enforceable if its formation or terms are unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins. Co. v. N. Bldg.

The Court agrees: it is a simple matter of contract interpretation (and common sense) that a non-prevailing party would not be entitled to fees, and the absence of \"prevailing party\" language is not a telltale sign of unconscionability.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Getting into the heart of the matter, both parties counter-move for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. Blue Book asks for summary judgment on several alleged breaches (and if it wins, then also on attorneys' fees), whereas Amerihua denies liability on any breach and asks for summary judgment as well. As described above, but worth repeating, Blue Book must present evidence of an enforceable contract, substantial performance on its part, breach by Amerihua, and damages.\n   <em>\n    Lindy Lu,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=368%20Ill.%20Dec.%20701\">\n    368 Ill.Dec. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20N.E.2d%201171\">\n    984 N.E.2d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the first two elements, the contract is a valid and enforceable one (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.1.), and there is no viable argument on the table that Blue Book did not perform its part in providing the contracted services and keeping its information secure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That leaves breach\n   and damages. On the element of breach, Blue Book argues that Amerihua breached the contract by (1) failing to keep Blue Book's data confidential and (2) exceeding the number of authorized licenses by internally disclosing its password.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

DSOF \u00b6 8. The parties do not dispute that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 8. But the parties vehemently disagree on what this obligation entails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 9. Amerihua contends that the provision only bans\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   distribution of Blue Book's data, DSOF \u00b6 9, while Blue Book argues that the agreement required Amerihua to use its \"best efforts to prevent\" unauthorized disclosure. Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 9. Both sides want summary judgment on this point-but neither has earned it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is true that summary judgment, for one side or the other, is sometimes appropriate when deciding questions of contract interpretation, because that type of interpretation involves a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

In the run-of-the-mill case, the Court gives effect to the parties' intentions by applying the plain meaning of the contract's language in light of the contract as a whole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20N.E.3d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Blue Book sweepingly asserts that the ban against distributing Blue Book's information means that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   distribution that is traced back to Amerihua's login credentials constitutes a breach, even if Amerihua did not do the distributing. Pl. Resp. at 8. That makes no sense. The pertinent Membership Agreement provision says that \"\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   may not loan or show or in any way share or distribute such ratings, reports, information, or data to third-parties\" (emphasis added). There is no strict liability provision in the Agreement. So if Amerihua did not actually do the distributing, then it matters not that its login credentials were used by someone else to do the distributing. That would not be a breach of the contract's ban on distribution. And Blue Book asked Wu point-blank whether he shared his credentials with anyone outside the company-or at the very least Fresh Terminal. Wu says no. DSOF \u00b6 43 (\"Amerihua never authorized such use by Fresh Terminal, as testified to by Wu, who made clear that he had\n   neither given, nor authorized, the use of Amerihua's Blue Book password by any third party, including Fresh Terminal.\"); DSOF Exh. D, Wu Dep. 64:20-66:20; DSOF Exh. N, Phone Log. At the summary judgment stage, this denial of a fact that is clearly within Wu's personal knowledge must be credited.

R. Civ. P. 56(e) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To support its motion, Blue Book points to another provision of the Terms of Use. Amerihua agreed to \"use best efforts to prevent, any unauthorized use, copying, or disclosure\" of Blue Book information. Terms of Use at 1; Def. Br. at 4; R. 68, Def. Reply and Resp. to Mot. Summ. J. at 7-8. But \"best efforts\" is not defined in the contract. Terms of Use; Membership Agreement;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 66. Neither side offers an interpretation. More importantly, Blue Book did not present any evidence that Amerihua failed to take best efforts, relying only on the fact that the information was downloaded using Amerihua's login credentials. R. 71, Pl. Reply at 16. Sure, a jury could rely on that as a piece of circumstantial evidence that Amerihua dropped the ball, but it is nowhere near enough evidence that a jury would be\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to find that Amerihua failed to take best efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the flip side, it is passing strange that Amerihua thinks that the record evidence requires summary judgment in its favor. Blue Book has presented plenty of circumstantial evidence suggesting that Amerihua shared its password with Zhuo and Fresh Terminal: Blue Book's internal audit shows Amerihua's ID accessed the whole database on November 26, 2014, PSOF \u00b6 21; the publicly available version on Fresh Terminal was identical to Blue Book's database as of that download, PSOF \u00b6 23; and Amerihua's president, Wu, had myriad contacts and a potential business relationship brewing with the proprietor of Fresh Terminal, PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 29-39. A jury could very, very easily find that the circumstantial evidence proves that Wu provided either the login credentials or the downloaded information to Fresh Terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Multiple User Licenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Independent of the distribution of information, Blue Book accuses Amerihua of breaching another provision of the contract. Pl. Resp. at 12. Under the Terms of Use, Blue Book members may use the database with the \"number of users limited to the number of user licenses designated\" by the membership agreement. Terms of Use \u00a7 2(b). Those \"passwords\" and \"access codes\" are \"not to be shared with any other person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514159\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/356/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c). For Amerihua, Wu had the only user license when it was a Blue Book member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Erickson Dec. Exh. 2; DSOF Exh. C, Membership Agreement; PSOF \u00b6 19. But he concedes that he gave his password to at least three of his employees, allowing them to access the Blue Book database without unique user licenses-even though he knew he was not supposed to do that under the contract. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 16-18; Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6 18 (disputing that limitation only applied to third-parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Despite Wu's concession, Amerihua argues that the Terms of Use actually authorizes all employees of a \"single legal entity\"-like Amerihua-to use one license issued to the entity. Def. Reply and Resp. to Mot. Summ. J. at 17. It is true that the Terms of Use can be an agreement with \"a single legal entity,\" which is the phrase used in the first sentence of the Terms. But the pertinent-and more specific-license provision expressly restricts the number of\n   <em>\n    users\n   </em>\n   to the number of\n   <em>\n    user licenses\n   </em>\n   : \"Blue Book Members may use the Web Site with the number of users\n   limited to the number of user licenses....\" Terms of Use \u00a7 2(b). So the contract clearly contemplated that even a single legal entity may require more user licenses if it wanted more than one user. Wu had only one user license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Erickson Dec. Exh. 2; DSOF Exh. C, Membership Agreement; PSOF \u00b6 19. He breached the restriction on the number of users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Amerihua also contends that, even if there was a breach of the user-limit provision, there are no damages arising from this breach. But Wu already admitted that the other employees used the site on an almost-daily basis, so a jury could reasonably find that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   damages arose from the breach. To be sure, the damages might be extremely limited (such as the cost of the additional user licenses), but it is not necessarily zero. This is a jury question (though the parties would be foolhardy to expend fees and effort in taking that issue all the way to trial).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. \"Use\" of Blue Book Database\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In yet another form of its sweeping strict-liability argument, Blue Book argues Amerihua must indemnify Blue Book for all of the damages caused by the data distribution. The indemnification provision in the Terms of Use says that Amerihua shall cover all of Blue Book's damages \"arising out of or in connection with [Amerihua's] use of the Products and Services....\" Terms of Use \u00a7 5. Blue Book contends that because Amerihua's credentials were used to download the same version of the database that later appeared on FreshTerminal.com, the damages arose out of Amerihua's \"use\" of the system. This argument runs into the same evidentiary problem as discussed earlier: Blue Book asserts that Wu had a direct hand in turning over the database information to FreshTerminal.com. Wu denies it. So the indemnification provision is not a sure winner for Blue Book. Just because Amerihua's credentials may have been used for the download does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mean that Amerihua is responsible for the ensuing damages. The indemnification provision is triggered by damages arising out of \"your\" use of Blue Book's products and services, Terms of Use \u00a7 5, so this provision too is not strict liability based on the use of Amerihua's credentials by someone else. The strict-liability theory of indemnification is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The other indemnification argument that Blue Book advances is that Amerihua, having breached the restriction on the number of users, must now pay\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the attorney's fees incurred by Blue Book in this case. Pl. Resp. and Mot. Summ. J. at 13. To be sure, there is generally nothing wrong with contractual fee-shifting provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. Wetzel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8499141\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/98/243/\">\n    98 Ill.App.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Ill.%20Dec.%20366\">\n    53 Ill.Dec. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=423%20N.E.2d%201170\">\n    423 N.E.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (1981). Here, the Terms of Use's indemnification provision says that Amerihua will indemnify Blue Book \"against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses\n   (including without limit attorneys' fees and costs) ....\" Terms of Use \u00a7 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But the indemnification provision requires fee-shifting only for those fees \"arising out of ... your breach of this Agreement.\" Terms of Use at 3. So Blue Book is only entitled to those fees\n   <em>\n    arising out of the breach\n   </em>\n   in question. So far, that is just the breach of the limit on the number of users, which is a sliver of this case and would not justify anywhere near all of the fees incurred. Indeed, prevailing parties are only entitled to \"reasonable attorney fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Erlenbush v.

At some point, [plaintiff's] opponents must take responsibility for their own trial strategy.\"). And the damages arising out of the users limitation (as discussed earlier) have yet to be determined; the final dollar amount will inform what fees were reasonably expended in pursuing that particular theory of breach. So, at an appropriate time, the Court will order the parties to undergo the Local Rule 54.3 process, which almost surely will result in deciding the fees on the briefs rather than sending it to a jury. For now, then, Blue Book's motion for summary judgment in a sum-certain for its attorneys' fees is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Def. Br. at 15. White used an \"income approach\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   to calculate the damage allegedly done to Blue Book's value based on the unauthorized download and disclosure of its confidential database. White Report (sealed) at 3. He then used a \"market observations approach\" to determine the value effect on similar data breaches suffered by other companies to corroborate his valuation impact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11240924\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/585/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The income approach entails determining the present value of a business by discounting its future cash flows based on the costs of capital and underlying future risks entailed in continuing the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Amerihua specifically targets White's use of a \"company-specific risk premium,\" Def. Br. at 16, which White used to determine Blue Book's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (the discount rate) calculation both before and after the unauthorized download of data. White Report (sealed) at 21. So the company-specific risk premium (call it CSRP for short) purports to account for the difference in the pre- and post-unauthorized download discount rate calculations measuring Blue Book's worth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Put another way, it is meant to account for the incremental risks associated with Blue Book after the supposed breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Amerihua contends that White's method is not reliable because the CSRP calculation relies on, in Amerihua's view, some subjective factors. Def. Br. at 16-17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   White relied on six factors: operating history, barriers to entry, legal risk from a breach, product risk, brand name recognition,\n   and cost of debt. White Report (sealed) at 23-24. Based on those factors, he concluded that the CSRP increase is between 1.25% and 2.5%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From there, White gets to a damages valuation by using the discount rate number to discount the cash flows for the income method, and the difference between the pre- and post-breach potential violations results in a damages range of $790,000 to $1,475,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To be sure, on the surface, Amerihua's concern with the subjectivity of the approach is well-taken. White does not specifically detail how the factors end up in the percentage range of 1.25-2.5%. There is no mathematical formula that another expert could plug data into to test the result (or generate a different one based on different data). But that is precisely the point: there is no simple (or even complex) equation that applies to all scenarios for valuing a company. At some point, expertise has to be applied, and that expertise is based on training and experience rather than invocation of a formula. And other courts have approved of this valuation method and allowed experts to rely on company-specific risk premiums in their calculations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    La Playita Cicero, Inc. v. Town of Cicero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201151066\">\n    2017 WL 1151066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D.

The method is also highlighted in textbooks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Report (sealed) at 24. It must also be said that Amerihua's argument for excluding White on this basis are under-developed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also worth pointing out that Amerihua's own expert testified that CSRP \"may have some validity.\" Heiser Dec. Exh. 7, Smith Dep. 115:16-116:24. In light of all this, although a jury could reject the valuation method's reliability, the method is reliable enough for the jury to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With regard to the data underlying the opinion, the data itself is sufficiently reliable. For his income approach, White used Blue Book's projections for the end of 2016 and the full year 2017-with those 2017 projections being prepared at roughly the same time that the breach was discovered, so it provides a basis for what Blue Book thought its value would be absent the data disclosure. White Report (sealed) at 4. This is significant, for example, because a 10-year projected valuation for 2017 from, say, 2007 would necessarily have less relevance\n   than the one performed in 2016. White was able to compare this data against the valuations of other companies suffering data breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. In arriving at the valuation, he also analyzed financial projections prepared by Blue Book, interviewed its management to discuss the company's operation, analyzed publicly available data from Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and read deposition excerpts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The data used in the analysis survives Rule 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Lastly, Amerihua criticizes White for arriving at a range of damages rather than a precise number. But Amerihua offers no precedent saying that damages ranges are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. at 13; Pl. Resp. and Mot. Summ. J. at 23. As discussed earlier, there is no one grand mathematical equation that generates a precise damages number in these situations. Indeed, it might even be more suspicious if an expert purported to be able to pin down an exact damages figure for a data breach. The motion to exclude White's report is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, Blue Book wins summary judgment on only two grounds. First, liability for Amerihua's breach of the user-number restriction; the limited damages on that breach still must be decided at trial (if the parties push it that far). Second, the so-called affirmative defenses are dismissed. Amerihua wins summary judgment only against Blue Book's strict-liability theory. All other aspects of the summary judgment motions are denied, including the motion to bar White's expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties shall start settlement negotiations within seven days of the issuance of this Opinion. Blue Book shall make a renewed settlement demand, followed by a response from Amerihua no later than seven business days later.

Amerihua did not contend the appended Terms of Use were ineffective, but rather that Wu did not see them. PSOF Exh. H, Wu Dep. 182:20-183:5;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DSOF \u00b6 18. It is not procedurally unconscionable-if Amerihua did not want to accept the terms, it did not need to become a Blue Book member.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Amerihua also argues that the 2014 Terms of Use do not apply and should not govern in this case, because it signed its Membership Agreement in 2008 and Wu testified that he never saw the updated 2014 Terms of Use. DSOF \u00b6 18. But Amerihua does not fill out this argument with any further detail or evidence other than the naked assertion that Amerihua's owner did not see the applicable terms. And there is ample evidence that Amerihua accepted the Terms of Use, even if Wu says he never personally saw them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 60, Erickson Dec. Exh. 3, Terms of Use Acceptance Confirmation. Amerihua does not dispute that it accepted the updated Terms of Use when using Blue Book's database in June 2014.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20N.E.2d%20403\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; Erickson Dec. \u00b6 8. Amerihua does not argue that the contract does not encompass these updates, nor does it even produce the Terms of Use in effect in 2008. By failing to flesh out this argument, Amerihua has waived it, and the 2014 Terms of Use will be considered part of the contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23, an unpublished case may not be cited as precedent by any party except in limited circumstances that do not apply here.

Br. at 11. But Amerihua does not colorably claim that the data breach occurred on Blue Book's end-say, for example, as a result of some hacking of Blue Book's systems, or that Blue Book's information was so insignificant as to not deserve the protection garnered by its own contract.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20N.E.2d%20403\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.

Amerihua signed a contract agreeing not to \"share or distribute\" specified information, without a condition that there be an independent finding as to its proprietary nature. DSOF \u00b6 8. In support, Amerihua only cites to one case regarding the breach of an explicit confidentiality agreement-in a restrictive-covenant case-which does not apply here. Def. Br. at 11 (citing\n    <em>\n     Tax Track Sys. Corp. v.

And Amerihua does not present evidence that Blue Book's system was compromised-and in fact, never sought to discover any information on that point-so that argument is foreclosed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. Resp. PSOF \u00b6 48; R. 63, Heiser Dec. \u00b6 8. In any event, Amerihua does not allege that it was unable to access Blue Book's database, or that it did not get a service that Blue Book promised. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15;\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    DSOF. Thus, there is no material dispute that Blue Book fulfilled its end of the bargain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Amerihua argues that this theory of liability was absent from the Complaint.
