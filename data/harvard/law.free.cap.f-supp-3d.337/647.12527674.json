Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The plaintiffs, a business corporation and its president, allege in this case that defendant Teresa B. Barringer was a long-time company employee in charge of the company's finances and a fiduciary of the company's retirement plan. It is claimed that she engaged in a fraudulent scheme to embezzle money from the company and pay portions of it into her own retirement account, as well as to embezzle money from the retirement accounts of other plan beneficiaries, including the president, Roy Carlus Riley. The plaintiffs' action and the jurisdiction of this court are based on sections 409 and 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1132(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Barringer has filed a Counterclaim, which the plaintiffs have moved to dismiss, along with Barringer's demands for punitive damages and attorneys' fees. For the reasons that follow, I will grant the plaintiffs' motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Counterclaim alleges the following facts, which I must accept as true for the purpose of deciding the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Riley is the president and sole shareholder of plaintiff J and R Manufacturing, Inc. (\"J &amp; R\"). In the first cause of action asserted in the her Counterclaim, Barringer alleges that Riley authorized Barringer to execute negotiable instruments and other documents on Riley's behalf and in Riley's name during the course of Barringer's employment with J &amp; R. Due to J &amp; R's financial difficulties, Riley directed Barringer to make loans to J &amp; R out of Riley and Barringer's personal funds. At the time Riley directed Barringer to make the loans to J &amp; R, he did not intend that J &amp; R would repay Barringer. With Riley's knowledge and permission, Barringer withdrew a total of $581,880.85 from her retirement account and her personal funds and deposited it in J &amp; R's bank account. J &amp; R has not repaid that money to Barringer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For her second cause of action, Barringer alleges that during her last two years of employment with J &amp; R, J &amp; R failed to contribute to the employee retirement plan on her behalf, and from on or about September 1, 2016, to October 28, 2016, J &amp; R and Riley failed to pay Barringer's wages, resulting in a loss to Barringer of $29,686.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, for her third cause of action, Barringer contends that during her employment at J &amp; R, she brought to her workplace and kept there the following items of her personal property: a Sam's MasterCard, four manila envelopes containing documents, calendars, personal mail with tax documents, personal crates of files, two Lowe's gift cards and one Amazon gift card, a flashlight new in the package, a box of quota information, a crate, and personal files, all of which have been converted by J &amp; R and Barringer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Barringer's first cause of action, she asserts state law\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claims of breach of express\n   or implied contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud against both J &amp; R and Riley. In her second cause of action, she asserts Virginia state law claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment against both J &amp; R and Riley. In her third cause of action, Barringer asserts state law claims of conversion, breach of express or implied contract, and unjust enrichment against both J &amp; R and Riley. Barringer contends that the court has supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) because they so relate to the claims alleged in the Complaint that they form part of the same case or controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J &amp; R and Riley have moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) all of the Counterclaim except the cause of action against J &amp; R regarding its failure to pay Barringer's wages. The Motion to Dismiss has been fully briefed and is now ripe for decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over a state cause of action if both the state and federal claims at issue \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\"\n   <em>\n    UMWA v.

These causes of action require consideration of facts already at issue under the plaintiffs' claims that Barringer embezzled funds from J &amp; R and that she unlawfully accessed retirement funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, I decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Barringer's third cause of action. The employer-employee relationship is the sole link between this cause of action and the federal claims in this case.

Barringer has not alleged facts sufficient for the court to infer that the separate personalities of J &amp; R and Riley no longer exist or that J &amp; R is Riley's alter ego. The allegations do not suggest that Riley personally guaranteed the alleged loan that Barringer made to J &amp; R. They also do not suggest that Riley personally benefitted from the funds by using them for himself. Rather, the allegations indicate that Barringer expected J &amp; R, rather than Riley, to repay the loan, and she deposited the funds into J &amp; R's bank account. Further, Barringer's allegation that Riley made loans to J &amp; R from his personal funds does not amount to a commingling of personal and corporate assets. There is no evidence that Riley treated J &amp; R's funds as his own. In addition, Barringer's remaining causes of action only mention Riley's name; they do not allege any additional facts that would allow the court to infer that Riley should be held personally liable for the alleged wrongs.

The plaintiffs argue that this cause of action is deficient because it does not state whether the loans were memorialized in writing or whether they were the result of an oral agreement, the terms of any oral agreement, or the dates and amounts of each loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under Virginia law, a plaintiff claiming breach of an express contract must establish (1) a legally enforceable obligation of a defendant to a plaintiff, (2) the defendant's violation or breach of that obligation, and (3) injury or damage to the plaintiff caused by the breach.\n   <em>\n    Ulloa v.

In particular, Barringer has not alleged facts or circumstances showing that J &amp; R, through Riley, offered to repay the money.

Barringer's transfer of funds to J &amp; R was a valuable\n   service that conferred a benefit on J &amp; R. Further, Barringer alleges that J &amp; R, through Riley, knew of and requested the funds. Barringer also alleges that J &amp; R accepted the funds and has not repaid her for them. In light of their employment relationship, rather than a friendly or familial relationship, and the size of the sum of money, Barringer has alleged facts sufficient to infer that J &amp; R should have been notified that Barringer expected to be repaid.

Barringer argues that the Counterclaim seeks \"funds that are justly due and owing\" due to J &amp; R's failure to contribute to the plan. Answer 13, ECF No. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of the requirements set out above, Barringer's second cause of action regarding J &amp; R's failure to contribute to the employee retirement plan does not allege facts sufficient to state a breach of contract claim. In particular, it does not contain facts sufficient for the court to infer proof of damages. Barringer's reference to \"funds that are justly due and owing\" does not set forth the amount of damages with reasonable certainty. The second cause of action also fails to allege facts sufficient for the court to infer that J &amp; R was unjustly enriched. It does not state facts suggesting that Barringer conferred any services or benefits on J &amp; R. Accordingly, I will grant the Motion to Dismiss as to Barringer's second cause of action against J &amp; R alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment regarding J &amp; R's failure to contribute to the employee retirement plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lastly, the plaintiffs move to dismiss Barringer's demands for punitive damages and attorneys' fees, arguing that she has not alleged any facts to support demands for either form of relief. Barringer seeks both punitive damages and attorneys' fees in connection with her claims regarding the funds she deposited in J &amp; R's bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[W]here the act or omission complained of is free from fraud, malice,\n   oppression, or other special motives of aggravation, damages by way of punishment cannot be awarded, and compensatory damages only are permissible ....\"\n   <em>\n    PGI, Inc. v.
