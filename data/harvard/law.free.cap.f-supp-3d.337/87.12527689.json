(Docket No. 10 at 15). It has terminals in Springfield, Missouri, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Pittston, Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In Massachusetts, New Prime has employed between 45 and 60 drivers who have driven between 7,821,068 and 9,606,194 miles within the forum in the last five years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This business has generated between $1,467,732,381.40 and $1,908,780,325.30 in revenue annually over that period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Importantly, these figures represent only a small portion of New Prime's business nationally, accounting for less than one percent of its drivers and revenue and just over one percent of the total miles driven by company drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff decedent Jose Moura, Jr. (\"Mr. Moura\") and his family lived in Shrewsbury Massachusetts. Over an eight-month period in 2016, Mr. Moura completed an\n   initial driver training program at New England Tractor Trailer Training School (\"NETTTS\"), a Massachusetts company, to obtain his Commercial Driver's License. (Turner Decl. \u00b6 4). New Prime first contacted Mr. Moura about potential employment opportunities by sending a recruiter to the NETTTS Rhode Island campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Further, while Mr. Moura was in Massachusetts, he received U.S. Mail, emails, and phone calls from New Prime describing employment and training opportunities with the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. New Prime also sent Mr. Moura a contract to begin its driver training program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. When Mr. Moura accepted this offer, New Prime sent a document confirming the training contract and purchased a bus ticket for Mr. Moura to travel from his Massachusetts home to Pennsylvania in order to begin training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon his arrival in Pennsylvania, Mr. Moura presented New Prime with his Massachusetts Commercial Driver's License.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. He was then assigned to work with Defendant John Paul Cannon (\"Mr. Cannon\") as his training driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Over the next several months, Mr. Moura drove within Massachusetts on behalf of New Prime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In early December, Mr. Moura gained the necessary 40,000 training miles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Mr. Moura completed his training at or near New Prime's Salt Lake City, Utah terminal, (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 21), thus, when he reached New Prime's Salt Lake City, Utah hub, he was no longer a trainee. (Turner Decl. \u00b6 17). Further, because he had not yet signed an agreement, he was not employed by New Prime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Moura and Mr. Cannon left Salt Lake City for New Prime's headquarters in Missouri. (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 22). On December 14, while traveling through Oklahoma, Mr. Cannon struck another tractor-trailer at a high rate of speed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Mr. Cannon was killed in the accident. Mr. Moura was critically injured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25-26. On December 20, Mr. Moura was placed on a medical flight to Boston for further treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. He died in transport due to extubation and complications from his injuries.

Gen. Laws ch. 223A, \u00a7 3. Massachusetts courts have held that the long-arm statute \"asserts jurisdiction over the person to the constitutional limit only when some basis for jurisdiction enumerated in the statute has been established.\"\n   <em>\n    Good Hope Indus., Inc. v.

Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Massachusetts Long Arm Statute provides, in relevant part: \"A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's transacting any business in this commonwealth.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, \u00a7 3. Thus, New Prime must have transacted business in the Commonwealth and the Plaintiffs' claims must have arisen from that transaction of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The requirement that a defendant transact business in the Commonwealth \"has been construed broadly.\"\n   <em>\n    Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819056\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/763/#p767\">\n    416 Mass. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n    625 N.E.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (citations omitted). \"Although an isolated (and minor) transaction with a Massachusetts resident may be insufficient, generally the purposeful and successful solicitation of business from residents of the Commonwealth, by a defendant or its agent, will suffice to satisfy this requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   New Prime has satisfied this jurisdictional precondition. For instance, New Prime has received permission for 275 large tractor trailers to be present on roads in Massachusetts to deliver alcohol. (Docket No. 17 at 5). These trucks have driven 42,726,148 miles on Massachusetts roads and generated $63,114,195.99 in revenue in the last five years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As part of that business, New Prime hires and trains new drivers. New Prime has employed 45-60 drivers in Massachusetts over the last five years. (Docket No. 10 at 15). Through its recruitment efforts, New Prime attempted to make Mr. Moura another one of these drivers. Mr. Moura was contacted repeatedly by New Prime in the Commonwealth by snail-mail, email, and phone calls.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, Mr. Moura was sent, and accepted a contact to begin its driver training program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. After Mr. Moura accepted the offer, New Prime purchased a bus ticket so that he could travel to Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Mr. Moura then drove throughout the Commonwealth while completing his training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Hiring and training drivers, of course, is an essential element of New Prime's business in the Commonwealth and part of its overall transaction of business in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, the Plaintiffs' claims have arisen from the New Prime's transaction of business in the Commonwealth. In\n   accordance with the broad construction of the long-arm statute, the court in\n   <em>\n    Tatro\n   </em>\n   asserted jurisdiction when a Massachusetts resident was injured at a California hotel and interpreted the \"arising from\" requirement to require only \"but for\" causation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819056\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/763/#p767\">\n    416 Mass. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n    625 N.E.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"terms such as 'arising from' ... should be interpreted as creating a 'but for' test. This test permits jurisdiction in a case [where the transaction of business is] the first step in a train of events that results in the personal injury.\"). New Prime argues that this requirement has not been met, but New Prime defines its transaction of business narrowly. Importantly, New Prime does not include its contacting and training drivers as part of its transaction of business in the Commonwealth. I find, however, that contacting, contracting with, and training Mr. Moura was part of New Prime's transaction of business in the Commonwealth. Further, it is clear that but for this transaction, Plaintiff would not have been harmed. Indeed, it was the first step in the train of events that led to his death. Therefore, I find that asserting jurisdiction is proper under the Massachusetts long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    2. Constitutional Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that exercising jurisdiction does not violate the Massachusetts long-arm statute, they must now demonstrate that it does not offend the Due Process Clause. \"The exercise of personal jurisdiction may, consistent with due process, be either specific or case-linked or general or all-purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Cossart v.

The concept of proximate cause is critically important in the tort context because it defines the scope of a defendant's liability. In contrast, the first prong of the jurisdictional tripartite test is not as rigid: it is, relatively speaking, ... a flexible, relaxed standard. We see no reason why, in the context of a relationship between a contractual or business association and a subsequent tort, the absence of proximate cause per se should always render the exercise of specific jurisdiction unconstitutional.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    When a foreign corporation directly targets residents in an ongoing effort to further a business relationship, and achieves its purpose, it may not necessarily be unreasonable to subject that corporation to forum jurisdiction when the efforts lead to a tortious result.

If the resident is harmed while engaged in activities integral to the relationship the corporation sought to establish, we think the nexus between the contacts and the cause of action is sufficiently strong to survive the due process inquiry at least at the relatedness stage.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    This concept represents a small overlay of \"but for\" on \"proximate cause.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334619\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/708/#p715\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334619\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/708/#p715\">\n     at 715-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In this case, if this Court does not assert jurisdiction there could be consolidation issues following a state court filing in Massachusetts for Medical Malpractice with the possibility of piecemeal litigation in different forums. (Docket No. 17 at 19). Thus, the most efficient resolution of this litigation is likely in the Commonwealth.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <em>\n     (5) Pertinent Policy Arguments\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The final factor \"implicates the interests of the affected governments in substantive social policies.\"\n    <em>\n     Pritzker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415269\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/53/#p64\">\n     42 F.3d at 64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Commonwealth has an interest in preventing corporations from reaching into the forum and then exposing them to subsequent harm.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nowak\n    </em>\n    , 94 3d at 719 (\"Massachusetts has an interest in protecting its citizens from out-of-state providers of goods and services as well as affording its citizens a convenient forum in which to bring their claim.\"). While other forums may have an interest in this litigation, none would appear to be as weighty as Massachusetts's interest in protecting its citizens from harm from foreign corporations. Accordingly, this factor also tips in favor of asserting jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In addition to satisfying the requirements of relatedness and purposeful availment, the \"gestalt factors\" also favor this Court asserting jurisdiction over New Prime.

Therefore, New Prime's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (Docket No. 9) is\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       denied\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-64\">\n     In the breach of contract context, the First Circuit held in\n     <em>\n      Cossart\n     </em>\n     that the defendant had purposefully availed itself of Massachusetts based on three factors: \"the defendant's in-forum solicitation of the plaintiff's services, the defendant's anticipation of the plaintiff's in-forum services, and the plaintiff's actual performance of extensive in-forum services.\"\n     <em>\n      Copia Communications\n     </em>\n     , 812 F.3d at 6 (citing\n     <em>\n      Cossart,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p20\">\n      804 F.3d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     21 ). As to the first two factors, the court noted that the defendant \"recruited [the plaintiff] at his home in Massachusetts. The resulting employment contract ... contemplated that [the plaintiff] would continue to work from Massachusetts on [the defendant's] behalf and that the company would facilitate that work by providing the requisite office equipment.\"\n     <em>\n      Cossart\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p20\">\n      804 F.3d at 21\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The same is true here. Defendant recruited Mr. Moura to drive for New Prime at his home in Massachusetts. Further, after completing his training contract, both parties presumably anticipated that Mr. Moura would drive for Defendant New Prime in the Commonwealth. In addition, Defendant facilitated that work by providing the requisite training for Mr. Moura. As to the third factor, the court in\n     <em>\n      Cossart\n     </em>\n     noted that the plaintiff \"did significant work for [the defendants] in Massachusetts-as the defendants clearly foresaw he would.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p20\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p20\">\n      at 22\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Again, the same is true here. Mr. Moura performed on his training contract with New Prime, completing 40,000 miles of driving and much of it throughout the Commonwealth-as New Prime foresaw he would. Thus, while this is not a breach contract claim, Mr. Moura has also demonstrated the same jurisdictional prerequisites for purposeful availment that the First Circuit has mandated in contract cases.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
