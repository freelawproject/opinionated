PETERSON, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Patricia Murphy is suing defendant Stupar, Schuster &amp; Bartell, SC for bringing a debt collection lawsuit against her on a debt that was not legally enforceable, in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Stupar has moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 22, contending that the FDCPA did not bar the collections suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court will deny Stupar's motion for summary judgment for essentially the same reasons that the court denied Stupar's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 5. In short, binding precedent allows debtors to sue lawyers under the FDCPA for bringing debt collection lawsuits that are based on an unenforceable debt. Even if the court were to construe the FDCPA as including an implicit \"good faith\" exception to liability, Stupar would not be entitled to such a defense because the law was clear at the time that Stupar filed the collections lawsuit that Murphy's debt was not enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issues that Stupar raised in its motion are legal and neither side has identified any factual disputes regarding liability, raising the question whether a trial is needed on any issues other than damages. The court will direct Stupar to show cause why summary judgment should not be granted in Murphy's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2007, plaintiff Patricia Murphy and her partner, Patricia Gaffney, received a secured loan from Associated Bank, N.A. In 2009, Murphy filed a petition for bankruptcy, listing Associated as one of her creditors. During the proceedings, Murphy's lawyer filed a document called a reaffirmation agreement, which stated that Murphy agreed to repay her debt to Associated. (The document includes an electronic signature in Murphy's name, but she denies that she authorized her lawyer to file the document.) Murphy received an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Murphy and Gaffney stopped making payments on the loan, Associated sued them both in state court through its counsel, defendant Stupar, Schuster &amp; Bartell, SC. Associated and Stupar alleged that Murphy \"reaffirmed the debt with [Associated] by completing a Reaffirmation Agreement\" and was \"entitled\" to collect more than $40,000 from Murphy. Dkt. 25-6, \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 10. Murphy contended that she was not liable for the debt because the reaffirmation agreement was not enforceable. Specifically, Murphy said that the agreement was missing information required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Associated, again through Stupar, sought to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings to determine the enforceability of the\n   reaffirmation agreement. After holding a hearing, the bankruptcy court denied the motion but did not provide a written explanation. The parties also continued litigating Associated's debt collection claim against Murphy and Gaffney. The state court ruled in favor of Associated as to its claim against Gaffney, but dismissed the claim against Murphy on the ground that the reaffirmation agreement was invalid and Murphy's debt to Associated had been discharged. Associated and Stupar did not appeal either decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Overview of the claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Murphy is bringing her claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, which states that \"[a] debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\" The statute lists 16 nonexhaustive examples of prohibited conduct, including \"[t]he false representation of ... the character, amount, or legal status of any debt.\" \u00a7 1692e(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The primary question raised in Stupar's motion for summary judgment is whether Stupar violated the FDCPA by maintaining a debt collection action against Murphy in state court. Murphy's view is that Stupar's state court complaint was a false representation about the legal status of her debt because the complaint falsely implied that Associated has a legal right to collect a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Randolph v. IMBS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247115,9245405\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/726/\">\n    368 F.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"A demand for immediate payment ... after the debt's discharge ... is 'false' in the sense that it asserts that money is due, although, because of the ... discharge injunction (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), it is not.\"). Stupar does not deny at this point that the reaffirmation agreement is invalid and that Murphy's debt to Associated was therefore discharged. But Stupar's view is that Murphy is attempting to hold it liable for simply bringing an unsuccessful lawsuit. This is essentially the same debate that the parties had in the context of Stupar's motion to dismiss, so it makes sense to review the court's reasoning for denying that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary of the order on the motion to dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the outset, the court acknowledged that Stupar's position had some force in the abstract. Dkt. 18, at 4. There is an instinctive appeal to the view that a debt collector should not be held liable under the FDCPA simply because it loses a debt collection lawsuit. But the court denied the motion to dismiss for the simple reason that case law from both Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit already established several principles that supported Murphy's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 \u00a7 1692e applies to a lawyer's conduct that occurs in the context of litigation,\n   <em>\n    Heintz v.

Dkt. 18, at 5-6. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Asset Acceptance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1079\">\n    736 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1079 (7th Cir. 2013), the court held that filing a time-barred debt collection action is itself a violation of \u00a7 1692e because such a suit falsely implies that the debt collector has legal recourse to collect the debt. The parties in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   (which was a class action) debated which statute of limitations applied to the underlying debt collection suits and the defendant contended that at least some of those suits were timely.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1079\">\n    736 F.3d at 1081-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But rather than concluding that the debate precluded the lawsuit altogether, the court resolved the debate in favor of the plaintiffs and allowed the case to proceed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1079\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725968\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1076/#p1079\">\n    at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties debated whether the defendant qualified as a subrogee under state law. Again, the court resolved the debate in favor of the plaintiff, concluding that \" Section 1692e applies even when a false representation was unintentional\" and that the defendant had violated \u00a7 1692e by giving \"a false impression as to the legal status [the defendant] enjoyed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174984\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/469/#p471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174984\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/469/#p471\">\n    at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Heng v.

After reviewing the relevant laws and regulations, the court concluded that the defendant had not misstated the law, so the court ruled in favor of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Heng\n   </em>\n   is less informative than\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gearing\n   </em>\n   , but the case is still noteworthy because the court assumed that a legally disputed debt can be the basis of a claim under the FDCPA if the defendant's interpretation of the law is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After reviewing these cases, this court concluded that they supported two related points: (1) courts may determine in the context of an FDCPA action whether a debt collection complaint is \"false\" on the ground that the debt at issue is legally defective; and (2) a defendant cannot avoid liability under \u00a7 1692e simply because the validity of the debt is not clearly established before the plaintiff files her FDCPA claim. Dkt. 18, at 5-6. Although the law did not appear to support a \"good faith\" defense for legal errors, the court concluded that Stupar did not show that it would be entitled to such a defense even if one existed. Stupar did not articulate any arguments in support of a conclusion that the reaffirmation agreement was enforceable despite the absence of required information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.

Instead, Stupar cites cases from other circuits and raises some new arguments. Although Stupar addresses some of the relevant case law in its reply brief, it does not explain why it failed to do so in its opening brief. Regardless, the court concludes that Stupar has failed to show that it is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Circuit law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Stupar distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the court discussed misrepresentations included in a complaint; the court did not hold that \"a lawsuit itself\" can be the basis of a claim under \u00a7 1692e. Dkt. 32, at 6-7. But regardless of the scope of\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   , the court held in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   that filing a debt collection lawsuit could qualify as a false representation if the lawsuit falsely implies that a debt is legally enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suesz v.

The court of appeals did not suggest in either case that the identity of the defendant was relevant and Stupar does not cite any cases in which the court of appeals has suggested that the FDCPA should apply differently to attorneys. Accordingly, the court adheres to its conclusion that Seventh Circuit law supports Murphy's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Dkt. 32, at 8. Stupar relies on\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   for two propositions: (1) the FDCPA may require a court to recognize an \"additional, implicit exception\" to the law in the context of claims\n   against an attorney; and (2) an unsuccessful lawsuit cannot be the basis of a claim under the FDCPA. Stupar also relies on\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that applying the FDCPA to attorneys in the context of this case would be absurd. But neither\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   supports Stupar's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court held in\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   that lawyers litigating a debt collection lawsuit can be \"debt collectors\" within the meaning of the FDCPA. In the first passage that Stupar cites-about an \"implicit exception\" to FDCPA liability for lawyers-the Court was discussing \u00a7 1692c(c), which prohibits a debt collector from communicating with a consumer who notifies the debt collector that he or she wishes the debt collector to cease further communication.\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339823\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/291/\">\n    514 U.S. at 296-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section \u00a7 1692(c) has exceptions to the general rule for communications that \"notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke\" or \"intends to invoke\" a \"specified remedy\" (of a kind \"ordinarily invoked by [the] debt collector or creditor\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) and (3). In rejecting a conclusion that \u00a7 1692c(c) would prohibit lawyers from communicating with debtors in the context of a lawsuit, the Court stated that \"[c]ourts can read the[ ] exceptions, plausibly, to imply that they authorize the actual invocation of the remedy that the collector 'intends to invoke.' \"\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339823\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/291/\">\n    514 U.S. at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The above discussion stands for the unremarkable proposition that courts should give ambiguous provisions the most reasonable construction. The Court did not suggest that a federal court has discretion to simply insert exceptions for lawyers into the FDCPA whenever that court believes it would be wise to do so. In fact, the Court stated just the opposite in\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   : \"arguments that the Act strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For Stupar's second proposition-that an unsuccessful collections lawsuit cannot be the basis of a claim under the FDCPA-Stupar quotes the following statement: \"we do not see how the fact that a lawsuit turns out to be unsuccessful could, by itself, make the bringing of it an 'action that cannot legally be taken.' \"\n   <em>\n    Heintz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339823\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/291/\">\n    514 U.S. at 295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statement comes from a larger discussion in which the Court was responding to an argument made by the lower court about \u00a7 1692e(5), which prohibits a \"debt collector\" from making any \"threat to take action that cannot legally be taken.\" According to the lower court, if a lawyer could qualify as a debt collector, \u00a7 1692e(5)\"would make liable any litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim against a debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339823\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/291/\">\n    514 U.S. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court rejected this view, noting that a debt collector could avoid liability under \u00a7 1692k(c) if his violation was the result of a bona fide error, so, even if the lower court's reading of \u00a7 1692e(5) were correct, the Court \"would not find the result so absurd as to warrant implying an exemption for litigating lawyers.\"\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339823\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/291/\">\n    514 U.S. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And then the Court made the observation on which Stupar relies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 295-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118996,1339823\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1489/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In any event, the assumption would seem unnecessary, for we do not see how the fact that a lawsuit turns out ultimately to be unsuccessful could, by itself, make the bringing of it an 'action that cannot legally be taken.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The quoted statement from\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   does not require a ruling in Stupar's favor for several reasons. First, the statement was about a provision not at issue in this case, so the statement could not override circuit\n   law applying \u00a7 1692e(2). Second, the Court did not identify any specific examples in which it would be inappropriate to hold a debt collector liable. In fact, the Court stated that the lower court's expansive reading of \u00a7 1692e(5) would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be absurd. So it would not be reasonable to read the statement as prohibiting FDCPA claims based on legal mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Third, in\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   , the Court limited the reach of the quoted statement when the Court held that \u00a7 1692k(c) did not apply to legal mistakes about the scope of the FDCPA, even if the mistake was a reasonable one. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   relied on the same statement from\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   , but the Court said that the statement was not controlling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   We had no occasion in\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   to address the overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our discussion of \u00a7 1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run lawsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful because of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error. Lawyers can, of course, invoke \u00a7 1692k(c) for violations resulting from qualifying factual errors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, the holding of\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   was limited to legal errors about the FDCPA. But Stupar offers no reason why the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   should not apply equally to other kinds of legal errors. In any event, this court held long ago that \u00a7 1692k(c) does not apply to legal errors of any sort.\n   <em>\n    Hartman v. Meridian Fin.

Wis. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Stupar relies on a statement in\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   that the FDCPA \"should not be assumed to compel absurd results when applied to debt collecting attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court rejected a view that it is absurd to hold attorneys liable for legal mistakes, stating that \"[i]t is far from obvious why immunizing debt collectors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of the law would be consistent with the statute's broadly worded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this case, Stupar does not explain why it would be absurd to make lawyers and non-lawyers equally liable for false statements about the legal status of a debt. If anything, it is lawyers rather than non-lawyers who should be held to a higher standard to accurately state the law. The court sees nothing in\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   that supports a dismissal of Murphy's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Case law from other circuits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its opening brief, Stupar relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen v.

But neither case is instructive because both cases involved\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   disputes about the validity of the debt.\n   <em>\n    Miljkovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274794\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/1291/\">\n    791 F.3d at 1306-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reply brief in debt collection lawsuit was not false because, \"at the time the sworn reply was filed, the facts underlying Appellant's right to an exemption were in dispute\");\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049018\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/814/\">\n    674 F.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (debt collector did not make false representation about the validity of a debt when various pieces\n   of evidence supported the debt collector's position). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Miljkovic\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hemmingsen\n   </em>\n   are simply extensions of\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court distinguished legal and factual mistakes. In fact, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has made the same distinction: it held in an earlier case that legal mistakes are not a defense to liability under the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    Picht v.

Although this court cited\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   in the order denying Stupar's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 18, at 6. Stupar does not try to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   or contend that it was wrongly decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Good faith defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even if this court were to agree with Stupar that lawyers cannot be held liable under the FDCPA for all legal mistakes about the validity of a debt, Stupar does not identify a standard that should apply. Stupar cites no authority that would support a view that a lawyer's legal mistakes can never qualify as a violation. And such a view would be inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Heintz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, Stupar suggested that a lawyer should not be held liable if he or she acted in \"good faith.\" Dkt. 17, at 3. Stupar does not expressly advocate for that standard in its motion for summary judgment, but it uses similar language. For example, in its opening brief, it says that a \"factually and legally-supported lawsuit to collect a debt does not become a 'false representation' as to the legal status of a debt simply because the suit is unsuccessful.\" Dkt. 24, at 2. And in its reply brief, it says that \" section 1692e does not prohibit debt-collector attorneys from making colorable legal arguments in an effort to collect a debt on behalf of their clients, even if those arguments eventually are rejected by the court.\" Dkt. 32, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Some district courts have adopted a \"good faith\" standard similar to that suggested by Stupar.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Juarez v.

But missing from these decisions is a citation to any language in the FDCPA that justifies the \"good faith\" standard, any reasoning regarding where the good faith standard comes from, or even any case law besides other district court opinions.

In that brief, Stupar did not cite any authority in support of its position and it \"concede[d] that Part D is not fully completed.\" Dkt. 25-8, at 9. Although Stupar said that other parts of the reaffirmation agreement included the missing information and that Part D was signed, Stupar did not develop an argument as to why that mattered. So even if \u00a7 1692e included a good faith defense, Stupar would not be entitled to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Section \u00a7 1692(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Stupar relies on \u00a7 1692g(b) and the court of appeals's discussion of that provision in\n   <em>\n    Walton v. EOS CCA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516261\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1024/\">\n    885 F.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018). Under \u00a7 1692g(b), when a consumer notifies the debt collector that the consumer is disputing a debt notice, the debt collector must cease collection of the debt until \"the debt collector obtains verification of the debt,\" among other things. The court held that a debt collector satisfies its obligation to \"verif[y]\" the debt by \"verify[ing] that its letters to the consumer accurately convey the information\n   received from the creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516261\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1024/\">\n    885 F.3d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The debt collector does not have to verify the validity of the underlying debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Stupar acknowledges that the interpretation of \u00a7 1692g has no direct bearing on \u00a7 1692e, but it says that the two provisions are related:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   It would make little sense for the FDCPA to shield a debt collector from liability under 1692g for confirming that a creditor believed that the debt sought to be collected was valid, only to impose liability on the debt collector for suing to collect the debt if, after litigation, it is shown that the creditor's belief as to the validity of the debt was mistaken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dkt. 24, at 12. This arguments rests on a misunderstanding of the differences between \u00a7 1692g and \u00a7 1692e. As explained by the court of appeals, \u00a7 1692b(g) \"serves as a check on the debt-collection agency,\" not the creditor or the underlying debt.\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516261\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1024/\">\n    885 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Its purpose is to \"arm[ ] [the consumer] with the information she need[s] to sufficiently dispute the payment obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516261\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1024/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In other words, when a debt collector verifies a debt under \u00a7 1692g, it is not vouching for the accuracy of the\n   <em>\n    creditor's\n   </em>\n   representations. But if the debt collector takes the step of filing a lawsuit-and makes its own representations of fact and law-it can be held liable under \u00a7 1692e for any false representations it makes. Section 1692g does not provide immunity to a debt collector for failing to review the law that renders its debt unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Stupar contends that Murphy's claim is barred by the doctrines of equitable estoppel and judicial estoppel. But Stupar relies on Wisconsin law to support an equitable estoppel defense. A defense under state law cannot defeat a federal claim.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306021\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/277/#p284\">\n    444 U.S. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284, n. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306021\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/277/#p284\">\n    100 S.Ct. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306021\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/277/#p284\">\n    62 L.Ed.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). And Stupar cites no authority for the view that federal law would recognize a defense of equitable estoppel under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As for judicial estoppel, that doctrine \"prevents a party from prevailing on an argument in an earlier matter and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in a subsequent matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells v. Coker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537078\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/756/#p760\">\n    707 F.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (7th Cir. 2013). Federal courts consider three factors when determining whether a party is judicially estopped from raising an argument: (1) whether the party's positions in the two cases are clearly inconsistent; (2) whether the party successfully persuaded a court to accept its earlier position; and (3) whether the party would derive an unfair advantage if not judicially estopped.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537078\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/756/#p760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Stupar ignores this standard. It does not identify any argument that Murphy raised in an earlier case that is clearly inconsistent with her claim in this case. Instead, Stupar alleges that Murphy \"was allowed to avoid a foreclosure of Associated Banks' security interest by executing the Reaffirmation Agreement,\" so \"[s]he may not claim now that the agreement was invalid.\" Dkt. 24, at 13. Stupar cites no evidence to support its allegation that the reaffirmation agreement prevented a foreclosure. Regardless, because Stupar does not identify any inconsistent arguments, it cannot prevail on a judicial estoppel defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The bottom line is that Stupar has failed to provide any justification for its state court lawsuit. The court sees no difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , in which the court of appeals held that a lawsuit filed after the statute of limitations expires is a violation of \u00a7 1692e. Both cases involve complaints that falsely imply that the debt collector has a legally enforceable right. And both cases involve legal errors rather than factual disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   If anything, this case is stronger than\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   because the parties in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   actually debated whether the underlying debt collection suits were untimely. In this case, Stupar does not try to defend the position it took in the debt collection lawsuit and, even if it had, a review of the relevant statute makes clear that the reaffirmation agreement is not enforceable. It may be that Stupar was unaware of the requirements in \u00a7 524 when it filed the lawsuit, but that is not relevant under \u00a7 1692e.\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9127536,9125195\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/991/\">\n    330 F.3d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]nder \u00a7 1692e ignorance is no excuse.\");\n   <em>\n    Gearing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174984\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/469/#p471\">\n    233 F.3d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (debt collector held liable under \u00a7 1692e because \"insufficient time was spent studying the nuances of subrogation law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   So it's clear that Stupar is not entitled to summary judgment. The question remains whether the court should grant summary judgment to Murphy as to liability. Murphy did not move for summary judgment, but the issues Stupar raised are questions of law that the court has resolved in Murphy's favor. Because neither side has identified any disputed facts that a jury would need to resolve to determine liability, it is not clear whether a trial on liability is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A court may grant summary judgment to a party on the court's own motion so long as the opposing party has notice and an opportunity to show that summary judgment is not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. DHL Exp. Inc. (USA)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091087\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/522/#p529\">\n    633 F.3d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (7th Cir. 2011). Accordingly, the court will direct Stupar to show cause why summary judgment should not be granted to Murphy as to liability so that the trial is limited to the issue of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   1. The motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Stupar, Schuster &amp; Bartell, SC, Dkt. 22, is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   2. Stupar may have until September 4, 2018, to show cause why summary judgment should not be granted to plaintiff Patricia Murphy as to liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Stupar also mentions in passing its constitutional right to have access to the courts. But Stupar does not develop an argument in support of a view that applying the FDCPA in this context would violate that right, so the argument is forfeited. Stupar also argues against a hypothetical claim that Murphy's partner, Patricia Gaffney, might have brought if the state court had dismissed Associated's claim against her. Dkt. 24, at 9-10 and Dkt. 32, at 4. Because Gaffney did not bring such a claim, the court need not consider it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
