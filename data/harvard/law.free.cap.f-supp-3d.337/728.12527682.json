SARGUS, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude General Causation Opinions (ECF No. 2822), the Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude Specific Causation Opinions (ECF No. 2824), and Defendant's Motion to Exclude Specific Causation Opinions (ECF No. 2823). For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   all three of these Motion in accordance with this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The litigation between the parties in this multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") began in 2001 in a class action in West Virginia state court captioned\n   <em>\n    Leach v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-C-698 (Wood County W. Va. Cir. Ct.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case\"). The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case ended in November 2004 when the parties entered into a class-wide settlement (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\"). (\"S.A.\"; ECF No. 820-8.) In the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, the parties fashioned a unique procedure to determine whether the approximately 80,000\n   members of the class (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class\") would be permitted to file actions against Defendant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company's (\"DuPont\") based on any of the human diseases they believed had been caused by their exposure to ammonium perfluorooctanoate (\"C-8\" or \"PFOA\") discharged from DuPont's Washington Works plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The procedure required DuPont and the plaintiffs to jointly select three completely independent, mutually-agreeable, appropriately credentialed epidemiologists (\"Science Panel\") to study whether there is a connection between C-8 and human disease among the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class. (S.A. at \u00a7\u00a7 12.2.1, 12.2.2.) If the Science Panel found that it was \"more likely than not that there is a link between exposure to C-8 and a particular Human Disease among Class Members,\" the Panel issued a Probable Link Finding for that specific disease and DuPont waived its right to challenge whether \"it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing\" the Linked Disease,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   general causation. (S.A. \u00a7 3.3.) Alternatively, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement provides that if the Science Panel delivered a No Probable Link Finding, the individual members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class are forever barred from bringing personal injury or wrongful death claims against DuPont based upon their allegations that C-8 caused their disease. (S.A. \u00a7 12.2.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Science Panel engaged in its work for seven years and in 2011 and 2012 it issued Probable Link Findings for six human diseases (\"Linked Diseases\") and No Probable Link Findings for over forty human diseases. The members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class whose claims are based on one or more of the Linked Diseases began to file cases in West Virginia and Ohio. Of the over 80,000 members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class, approximately 3,500 filed cases in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. Those actions are centralized in this MDL,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties selected certain members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class on whose cases they would conduct more extensive discovery (\"Discovery Pool Plaintiffs\"). The bellwether trials are selected from the Discovery Pool Plaintiffs. Carla Marie Bartlett's case has been chosen as the first bellwether trial and John Wolfs case will be tried second (\"Trial Plaintiffs\"). Mrs. Bartlett alleges that she suffered from the Linked Disease kidneycancer and Mr. Wolf claims that he suffers from the Linked Disease ulcerative colitis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The issues currently before the Court are directly tied to the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement and this Court's discussion of that Agreement in certain Dispositive Motion Orders (\"DMO(s)\"). On December 17, 2014, this Court issued DMO 1 (ECF No. 1679), in which it denied DuPont's Counter-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding Application of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement (\"DuPont's First Motion Regarding Causation\") (ECF No. 1032), and granted in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment related to the same issue (ECF No. 820). In DMO 1, the Court considered\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members' burden in proving their cases-in-chief related to class membership and certain aspects of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2015, after DMO 1 issued, the parties filed their expert reports. (ECF Nos. 2807, 2811, 3441.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 6, 2015, DuPont filed a Motion for Clarification Regarding DMO 1 (\"Motion for Clarification\") (ECF No. 2814), in which it incorporated its Overview Brief on Causation Issues (\"Overview on Causation\") (ECF No. 2813). After DuPont's Motion for Clarification was fully briefed\n   (ECF Nos. 3201, 3563), this Court issued DMO 1-A, in which it granted DuPont's request to clarify DMO 1 and denied DuPont's request to adopt its version of the causation issue considered in that decision. (ECF No. 3972.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Parties' Evidentiary Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 6, 2015, the Trial Plaintiffs filed their Motion to Partially Exclude General Causation Opinions and their Motion to Partially Exclude Specific Causation Opinions. (ECF Nos. 2822, 2824.) On May 6, 2015, DuPont filed its joint Memorandum in Opposition to both of these Motions (ECF No. 3203), and on May 20, 2015, the Trial Plaintiffs filed their Reply Briefs in Support of their Motions (ECF Nos. 3554, 3555.) The Trial Plaintiffs' Motions are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Also on April 6, 2015, DuPont filed its Motion to Exclude Specific Causation Opinions (ECF No. 2823), and on May 6, 2015, the Trial Plaintiffs filed their Memorandum in Opposition to this Motion (ECF No. 2199). The Trial Plaintiffs Filed their Reply in support of their Motion on May 20, 2015. (ECF No. 2823.) DuPont's Motion is also ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their evidentiary motions, the Trial Plaintiffs move to partially exclude the opinions and testimony of certain defense expert witnesses relating to what the Trial Plaintiffs contend is defined under the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement as general causation. The Trial Plaintiffs and DuPont move to partially or fully exclude what both parties agree are opinions directed toward specific causation. The parties contend that certain portions of these experts' opinions fail to meet the requirements for admissibility under the Federal Rules of Evidence and\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Specifically, the Trial Plaintiffs maintain that the entire opinion of Douglas L. Weed, M.D, M.P.H., Ph.D. (\"Weed Report\"; ECF No. 2807, Ex. I) should be excluded and that portions of the following three experts' opinions should be excluded: Robert W. Rickard, Ph.D., D.A.B.T. (\"Rickard Report\"; ECF No. 2807, Ex. D), Samuel M. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D. (\"Cohen Report\"; ECF No. 2807, Ex. A), and, Stephen B. Hanauer, M.D., FACG, FAGA, (\"Hanauer Report\"; ECF No. 2807, Ex. C). DuPont asserts that the entire opinions of the following three experts are inadmissible: Robert Bahnson, M.D. (\"Bahnson Report\"; ECF No. 2811, Ex. C), and Vitaly Margulis, M.D., F.A.C.S. (\"Margulis Report\"; ECF No. 2811, Ex. D), and Robert Gross, M.D. (\"Gross Report\"; ECF No. 2811, Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their Motion to Exclude General Causation Opinions, the Trial Plaintiffs contend that DuPont's experts' opinions are not relevant to the facts in issue in their cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   an expert opinion is not admissible unless it is relevant to the facts at issue in the case. In\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of Evidence, in particular Rule 702 and 104(a), govern the admission of expert witness testimony and require that the trial judge \"ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Rule 702\"requires that the evidence or testimony 'assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence,' \" expert testimony \"which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and ergo, nonhelpful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 590-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In other words, there must be a 'fit' between the proposed testimony and the question(s) presented by the case at bar.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The burden is on party proffering the expert report to demonstrate by a preponderance of proof that the opinions of their experts are admissible.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

The Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude General Causation Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties' briefing on the Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude General Causation Opinions is directed at DuPont's experts' opinions on (1) C-8's capability of causing their Linked Diseases, and (2) what studies were available to DuPont's when it made decisions to release C-8 into the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class' drinking water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. C-8's Capability of Causing Mrs. Bartlett's and Mr. Wolf's Linked Diseases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs direct their Motion to Exclude General Causation Opinions at DuPont's experts' opinions that Mrs. Bartlett's and Mr. Wolf's dose of and/or exposure to C-8 is\n   <em>\n    incapable\n   </em>\n   of causing their Linked Diseases. The Trial Plaintiffs contend that these opinions are not relevant because they are directed at what the parties defined as general causation in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement and it is undisputed that DuPont agreed not to contest general causation. Therefore, the Trial Plaintiffs conclude, any opinions related to general causation are excludable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and the Federal Rules of Evidence because they cannot assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine\n   <em>\n    any fact in issue.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DuPont responds that its experts are not opining on general causation, but rather the opinions are directed at specific causation. In the specific causation inquiry, DuPont continues, it is necessary for the experts to scrutinize the Probable Link reports to determine whether the Trial Plaintiffs' dose of and/or exposure to C-8 is\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of causing their Linked Disease. DuPont argues that the Trial Plaintiffs \"are mischaracterizing the Science Panel's findings\" because the \"Science Panel\n   <em>\n    did not find\n   </em>\n   that all\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members had an equal, materially increased risk of developing a Probable Link Disease.\" (DuPont's Mem. in Opp. at 6) (emphasis added). After all, DuPont maintains, the \"Science Panel never made a scientific determination of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Consequently, DuPont concludes, in spite of the issuance of a Probable Link Finding, there are certain members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class, including Mrs. Bartlett and Mr. Wolf, for whom the Science Panel did not find that it was more likely than not that there is a link between their exposure to C-8 and their Linked Disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By way of example, DuPont's experts' opine that the Trial Plaintiffs fit into a low dose quartile of some of the objective criteria and/or protocols the Science Panel utilized in its work, and in those groups there was no statistically significant evidence of a link between exposure to C-8 and kidney cancer or ulcerative colitis. In other words, as this Court recognized in DMO 1, DuPont's position is that the Probable Link Findings may not apply to a particular member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class, such as Mrs. Bartlett and Mr. Wolf, who were in the lowest exposure groups. (DMO 1 at 8.) DuPont's arguments are not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   DuPont continues to rely upon its position set forth in its briefing on its First Motion Regarding Causation, Overview on Causation, and Motion for Clarification. A\n   reiteration of DuPont's main point related to general causation is that its\n   <em>\n    \"only\n   </em>\n   concession as it relates to the Bartlett and Wolf trials is that it will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   claim that C-8 is incapable of causing either kidney cancer or ulcerative colitis,\" but it retains the ability to claim that Mrs. Bartlett's and Mr. Wolf's dose of and/or exposure to C-8 is incapable of causing kidney cancer or ulcerative colitis. (DuPont's Overview of Causation at 3.) In DMO 1 and DMO 1-A, this Court explained in detail why DuPont's position is untenable under the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. Without restating the entirety of those decisions here, the Court reiterates a few relevant points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The analysis of causation in the cases that make up this MDL is not the one commonly utilized in toxic tort case law. The causation inquiry is dictated by the unique procedure established in the contractual agreement between the parties that they set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement the Science Panel is directed to determine which, if any, human diseases were linked to the actual C-8 exposure of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class. (S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 12.2.1, 12.2.2.) The Science Panel engaged in its work by following specific instructions on how to choose the objective criteria and protocols it would utilize in its studies of each particular human disease. (S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1.49, 12.2.3(a), 12.2.3(b).) If the Science Panel's evaluations led it to conclude it is more likely than not that there is a link between the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class' exposure to C-8 and any human disease, it issued a \"Probable Link Finding\" for that particular disease. (S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1.50, 12.2.3(b)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DuPont's framing of its experts' inquiry as one into what the Science Panel did and did not find (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"the Science Panel\n   <em>\n    did not find\n   </em>\n   that all\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members had an equal, materially increased risk of developing a Probable Link Disease\") is prohibited by the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. The Court addressed this topic in DMO 1, which was issued before DuPont's experts issued their reports. (DMO 1 at 9-10) (concluding that \"DuPont cannot now prevent a class member from the benefit of such a finding by pointing out the 'limitations' in the objective criteria and/or protocols the Science Panel utilized to make its conclusions or by extrapolating from the Science Panel's analysis what the Panel 'did not find' in its Probable Link Finding\"). As pointed out in DMO 1-A, DuPont confuses the Probable Link\n   <em>\n    reports\n   </em>\n   with the Probable Link\n   <em>\n    Findings.\n   </em>\n   (DMO 1-A) (\"DuPont's mistake is focusing on the Science Panel's\n   <em>\n    reports/evaluations\n   </em>\n   instead of its\n   <em>\n    Findings,\n   </em>\n   .\"). The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement unambiguously requires application to all members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class the Probable Link\n   <em>\n    Findings,\n   </em>\n   which the parties defined as the\n   <em>\n    conclusion\n   </em>\n   reached by the Science Panel. (S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1.50, 12.2.3(b)(1) ) (defining a Probable Link\n   <em>\n    Finding\n   </em>\n   as the Science Panel's \"conclu[sion] that there is a Probable Link between C-8 exposure and Human Disease(s)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Likewise, DuPont's attempt to frame the issue as whether or not the Science Panel made a \"scientific determination\" is of no consequence. In the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, the parties directed the Science Panel's work and dictated how the results would be applied to the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members' claims. It matters not whether, in DuPont's view, the Probable Link Findings and/or No Probable Link Findings are appropriately classified as scientific determinations. The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement unambiguously dictates the effect of the Findings: If the Science Panel found that it was \"more likely than not that there is a link between exposure to C-8 and a particular Human\n   Disease among Class Members,\" the Panel issued a Probable Link Finding for that specific disease and DuPont waived its right to challenge whether \"it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing\" the Linked Disease,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   general causation. (S.A. \u00a7 3.3) If, however, the Science Panel issued a No Probable Link Finding for a particular human disease found among members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class, those members' personal injury and wrongful death claims against DuPont are forever barred. Thus, it is of no moment whether the Findings are, or are not, properly referred to as what DuPont defines as scientific determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Again, as the Court explained in DMO 1 and DMO 1-A, the plaintiffs are not required to prove that their dose of and/or exposure to C-8 is\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of causing their Linked Diseases. If the plaintiffs prove that they are a member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class and that they have or had a Linked Disease, the Probable Link Finding applies to them. Application of the Probable Link Finding establishes that it is more likely than not that there is a link between that class member's exposure to C-8 and his or her Linked Disease, and DuPont is prohibited from challenging whether it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing that Linked Disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   What this means in the evidentiary context is that the Probable Link Findings are valid and reliable evidence, admissible to establish that it is more likely than not that there is a link between each member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class' exposure to and/or dose of C-8 and his or her Linked Disease. Indeed, DuPont confirms that it \"is not contesting the 'validity and reliability' of the Science Panel's Probable Link reports.\" (DuPont's Mem. in Opp. at 3.) Consequently, all of DuPont's experts' opinions that support a challenge to what the parties have defined as general causation are not relevant because there is no \"connection between the [opinion] being offered and [any] disputed factual issues\" that are before the Court.\n   <em>\n    Pride v. BIC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196639\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/566/#p578\">\n    218 F.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). DuPont has conceded general causation as that term is defined in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court will provide examples of statements made within the expert reports that are directed at what the parties have defined as general causation. The parties do not, and the Court will not endeavor to, go line-by-line through the reports. Instead, the Court divides the content of the expert opinions regarding general causation into two groups: (a) Opinions assessing links between C-8 and the Linked Diseases, and (b) Opinions about what the Science Panel's studies did not show. Within each group, the Court provides examples of opinions that fail to meet the requirements for admissibility under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Opinions Assessing Links Between C-8 and the Linked Diseases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The expert reports at issue reflect DuPont's challenge to general causation on two levels. First, some experts opine that the epidemiological data is insufficient to show that C-8 is capable of causing either of the Trial Plaintiffs' Linked Diseases, and second, that the toxicological data is insufficient to show that C-8 is capable of causing either of the Trial Plaintiffs' Linked Diseases. The Court notes that, throughout the experts' opinions, they refer to their analysis as relating to specific causation, when in actuality the analysis is directed at what the parties defined in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement as general causation. The following opinions are excluded themselves and are examples of the types of opinions that will not be admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The following opinions of Dr. Rickard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   With respect to specific causation, there is no [toxicology] study that supports PFOA being able to cause kidney cancer at the exposure level claimed by Mrs. Bartlett. Similarly, with respect to specific causation, there is no [toxicology] study that supports PFOA being able to cause ulcerative colitis at the exposure level claimed by Mr. Wolf. There is no established mechanism of action by which PFOA could cause kidney cancer at the exposure level claimed by Mrs. Bartlett, or cause ulcerative colitis at the exposure level claimed by Mr. Wolf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Rickard Report at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The following opinions of Dr. Cohen:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   No [toxicology] studies support the claim that any cancer tumor could be caused at the low dose of PFOA claimed by Ms. Bartlett. Likewise, in all of the epidemiology studies, including the Science Panel studies, a possible relationship between PFOA and kidney cancer was only observed at much higher exposures than Mrs. Bartlett likely experienced. The exposure that Mrs. Bartlett claims was not associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Cohen Report at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Cohen's opinion that \"[a]lthough several chemicals have been associated with the development of renal cell tumors in animal models ..., none have been shown to be associated with an increase in renal cell carcinomas in humans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Weed's opinion that \"the risk of kidney cancer for individuals such as Ms. Bartlett, with minimal exposure to C-8, are indistinguishable from a chance finding ....\" (Weed Report at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Opinions on What the Science Panels Studies Did Not Show\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As addressed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   and explained in detail in DMO 1 and DMO 1-A, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement prohibits scrutiny of the protocols utilized by the Science Panel to reach its Probable Link Findings for the purpose of determining what the Science Panel found and did not find or to point out the alleged limitations of the Findings. As DuPont admits, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement provides for application of the Probable Link Finding to every member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class who shows that he or she has or had a Linked Disease. However, DuPont continues to confuse the Probable Link\n   <em>\n    Finding\n   </em>\n   with the Probable Link\n   <em>\n    report.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court finds inadmissible DuPont's experts' analysis of the Science Panel reports in which they opine on such things as the \"risk quartiles' in either the lagged or the non-lagged groups [that] contained a Confidence Interval that ... [is] not statistically significant,\" an expert's \"not[ing of] the fact that the Science Panel did not control for such confounders as obesity and hypertension in the cancer studies, and family history and antibiotic use in the ulcerative colitis studies,\" and what certain experts view as a discussion of \"the limitations that the Science Panel members themselves had mentioned in their own reports.\" (DuPont's Mem. in Opp. at 26-27.) \"DuPont's position precludes certain\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members from receiving the benefit of the Probable Link Findings based upon an independent analysis of what the Science Panel studies allegedly found and did not find.\" (DMO 1-A at 9). The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement prohibits this result in the same manner as it prohibits members of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class from challenging whether the No Probable Link Findings apply specifically to their non-linked disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, the following opinions fail to meet the requirements established under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and the Federal Rules of Evidence and are also examples of the types\n   of opinions that will not be admissible for this same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The following opinion of Dr. Weed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In making their Probable Link determinations, the Science Panel looked at potential associations in epidemiological studies. As part of their assessments, the Science Panel looked at whether risk ratios for the study population increased with increasing estimated exposure. No threshold was established by the Science Panel of what level of exposure or dose of PFOA was required to increase the risk of any disease. There is no statement or even any suggestion in the probable link reports that there is increased risk for every class member, regardless of how low an individual's exposure or dose was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Weed Report at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Rickard's opinion that \"[t]he Science Panel did not determine a threshold exposure or dose at which PFOA would cause kidney cancer or ulcerative colitis. The Science Panel also did not find that disease could ... be caused at the lowest doses needed to establish class membership,\" (Rickard Report at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. DuPont's Corporate Decisions Regarding the Release of C-8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   DuPont argues that \"totally independent\" of causation issues, \"exposure and dose are highly relevant to liability issues and the trier of fact's assessment of DuPont's knowledge and the reasonableness of DuPont's conduct over the relevant decades.\" (DuPont's Mem. in Opp. at 2.) The Trial Plaintiffs, however, \"do not dispute that 'DuPont's knowledge and the reasonableness of DuPont's conduct over the relevant decades' is relevant to one or more of Plaintiffs' claims in these cases.\" (Trial Pls.' Reply at 8.) What the Trial Plaintiffs dispute is DuPont's ability to \"open a pathway to present all of its opinions and arguments contesting general causation to the jury by arguing it is all somehow relevant to 'foreseeability' of harm (and thus 'liability'), and therefore not barred by the\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id,\n   </em>\n   at 9. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Liability, unlike general causation, is a relevant area of inquiry. DuPont, however, cannot make an end-run around the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement by re-labeling its (excluded) evidence that contests general causation as evidence that contests liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude Specific Causation Opinions and DuPont's Motion to Exclude Specific Causation Opinions are directed at the reliability of the opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Dr. Bahnson further explained, based on his professional opinion, why the studies relating to obesity and kidney cancer lack credibility, which include but are not limited to the following limitations of the studies: (1) contamination from registries for people who are entered as kidney cancer and do not have renal cell cancer, which renders conclusions about renal cell cancer in these studies suspect, if not entirely invalid; (2) detection bias relating to the advent of cross sectional imaging, which allows kidney tumors to be discovered more often than there were in the past; (3) publication bias wherein positive associations,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   conclusions identifying a positive relationship, are more often published than those that do not identify a positive relationship; and (4) sample size. (Bahnson Expert Dep. at 47.) Dr. Bahnson clarified that these issues help to explain why the literature demonstrates an association between obesity and kidney cancer, but not a causal connection. On the other hand, Dr. Bahnson testified that it is his opinion that the epidemiological literature concerning the relationship between C-8 and kidney cancer, including the Probable Link Report, supports the conclusion that C-8 causes kidney cancer.

As an example, DuPont provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Mrs. Bartlett's experts deny that that there is a well established causation relationship between obesity and kidney cancer because they have not seen the word \"causation\" in any of the published studies they have reviewed on obesity, and have not seen a publication stating that the Bradford Hill criteria are satisfied.

After ruling in each of these potential risk factors as a potential cause of Mrs. Bartlett's kidney cancer, Dr. Margulis was able to rule out, and provide a reasonable basis for exclusion of, each risk factor referenced above, except obesity, on the basis of his review of Mrs. Bartlett's medical records, his own physical examination of Mrs. Bartlett, which included taking a medical and familial history from her, a review of her father's death certificate, and his training and experience as a urologic surgical oncologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As to obesity, Dr. Margulis stated that it \"is generally not considered a major risk factor for [kidney cancer ], and thus [he is] able to rule it out as the predominant cause of Ms. Bartlett's [kidney cancer ].\" (Margulis Report at 7.)

The Trial Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that Dr. Margulis' expert opinion is admissible in all other regards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Dr. Gross\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Dr. Gross is the Director of Gastroenterology and the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Southern California Hospital and is a member of the Medical Executive Committee. He is board-certified in gastroenterology and internal medicine and has over forty years of experience in gastroenterology. Other than the arguments the Court dealt with above, as indicated in footnotes one and two, DuPont contends that Dr. Gross' expert opinion is unreliable because he (a) utilized a differential diagnosis, which is not a reliable methodology where the majority of causes of a disease are unknown, and that he (b) wholly failed to account for the more likely possibility that Mr. Wolf's ulcerative colitis is idiopathic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Differential Diagnosis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   DuPont contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   As the Sixth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Tamraz,\n   </em>\n   where the cause of a condition is idiopathic in the\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of cases, it is \"impossible to ignore and difficult to rule out.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tamraz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781398\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/665/#p674\">\n    620 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding differential etiology opinion of bellwether plaintiff's specific causation expert was unreliable at trial because idiopathic causation accounted for \"the vast majority\" of cases of plaintiff's claimed disease).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   (DuPont's Mot. at 32.) Thus, DuPont concludes that even if Dr. Gross' differential diagnosis was properly conducted, it cannot be reliable. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Tamraz,\n   </em>\n   the Sixth Circuit rejected expert's differential diagnosis because \"his efforts to 'rule in' manganese exposure as a possible cause of the individual's disease, or to 'rule out' other possible causes turned on speculation, not a valid methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    Tamraz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781398\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/665/#p674\">\n    620 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, the expert in\n   <em>\n    Tamraz\n   </em>\n   failed to cite to any non-speculative evidence for his conclusion that manganese causes Parkinson's Disease, and the expert conceded that \"he knew of no studies finding a link between manganese and Parkinson's Disease and that studies that have looked at that ... have not found a very strong correlation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781398\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/665/#p674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781398\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/665/#p674\">\n    at 670, 674-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the expert in\n   <em>\n    Tamraz\n   </em>\n   who could not point to any scientific study supporting his conclusion, Dr. Gross is able to point to the Probable Link Report and the report by Dr. David Macintosh in support of his conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Idiopathic Origin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   DuPont argues that \"Dr. Gross fails to explain how he reliably 'ruled out' the more likely probability that [Mr.] Wolf's ulcerative colitis was idiopathic in origin, given the overwhelming body of scientific literature that identifies ulcerative colitis as a predominantly idiopathic disease-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of cases are due to idiopathic causes.\" (DuPont's Mot. at 33.) DuPont continues, asserting that \"the only two pieces of scientific literature that Dr. Gross cited in his report confirm that\n   <em>\n    ulcerative colitis is primarily an idiopathic disease.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781398\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/665/#p674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Feurstein,\n   <em>\n    et al.,\n   </em>\n   Ulcerative Colitis : Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Management, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Volume 89, Issue 11, pp. 1553-63 (Nov. 2014) (\"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic\n   <em>\n    idiopathic\n   </em>\n   inflammatory bowel disease.\") (emphasis supplied); Osterman, Mark T.,\n   <em>\n    et al.,\n   </em>\n   Ulcerative Colitis, Sleisinger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, 9th ed., pp 1975-81 (\"The etiology of UC is currently unknown but is likely multifactorial.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs respond that Dr. Gross in no way ignored the idiopathic issue. They point out:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Dr. Gross acknowledged the idiopathic issue within the body of his expert report, stating that \"[t]he etiology of ulcerative colitis is controversial, although recent research is helping to unravel potential causes and associations.\" (Gross Report at 3.) Dr. Gross further stated in his expert report that \"[t]he etiology of ulcerative colitis is frequently said to be \"idiopathic ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) As such, Dr. Gross clearly acknowledged and \"ruled in\" the idiopathic issue in conducting his differential diagnosis to arrive at his causation opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Dr. Gross also sufficiently explained how he reliably \"ruled out\" the possibility that Mr. Wolf's ulcerative colitis was idiopathic in origin. Within his expert report, Dr. Gross stated that, although the etiology of ulcerative colitis is frequently said to be idiopathic, \"it is now recognized that environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Dr. Gross further underscored that the \"C8 Science Panel has determined that there is a probable link between exposure to C8 and ulcerative\n   colitis among class members,\" and that Mr. Wolf is a\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class Member based on his review and reliance on the expert report of Dr. David Macintosh. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In terms of the strength of the evidence, Dr. Gross testified that the Probable Link Report, which he reviewed and relied upon in conducting his differential diagnosis and forming his opinions, shows a strong causal relationship between C8 exposure and the development of ulcerative colitis among\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class Members, such as Mr. Wolf (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that Mr. Wolf's ulcerative colitis was not idiopathic in origin). 23 (Gross Dep. at 268:25-269:4.) In light of this empirical evidence, Dr. Gross made it abundantly clear during his deposition that he \"ruled out\" the idiopathic nature of Mr. Wolf's ulcerative colitis....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (Pls.' Mem. in Opp. at 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   DuPont takes issue with Dr. Gross' conclusion that the Probable Link reports show that there is a causal connection between C-8 and ulcerative colitis. DuPont's contention is yet another attempt to prevent application of the Probable Link Findings to a member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class and discredit the findings of the Science Panel. There is no basis for exclusion of Dr. Gross' report. DuPont will have the opportunity to cross examine Dr. Gross and to point out any perceived weaknesses of his analysis to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Conclusion - Dr. Gross\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Trial Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that Dr. Gross' expert report is admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court, in accordance with this Opinion and Order,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude General Causation Opinions\") (ECF No. 2822), the Trial Plaintiffs' Motion to Partially Exclude Specific Causation Opinions\") (ECF No. 2824), and Defendant E.
