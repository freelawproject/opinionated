ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether East Texas's Challenge to the CBSA Assignment Is Waived\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Secretary raises a threshold issue, arguing that East Texas \"has waived the opportunity to challenge [his] assignment of Henderson County to the Tyler [ ] CBSA\" because it \"did not submit any comment raising any question as to whether the proposed assignment was correct or indicating that it had any concerns regarding the proposed assignment,\" even though it \"had the opportunity to raise [its concerns] during the notice-and-comment period following publication of the ... [2014] [P]roposed [R]ule.\" Def.'s Mem. at 12. Therefore, according to the Secretary, \"[b]ecause [East Texas] failed to present its challenge to the agency for its initial consideration during the rulemaking process, [it] has forfeited its 'opportunity to challenge' the agency's rulemaking on the basis that the designation of Henderson County to the Tyler [ ] CBSA is incorrect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Two members of this Court have rejected identical waiver arguments made by the Secretary, holding that where plaintiffs timely challenge the application of a regulation through the Board's review process, their failure to raise their challenges through comments to the proposed regulation during the rulemaking process does not constitute a waiver. In\n   <em>\n    Banner Health v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   , Judge Kollar-Kotelly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Medicare Act allows judicial review of legal issues pertaining to regulations pursuant to the scheme described above: by filing timely appeals of payment determinations with the PRRB and seeking judicial review on legal issues outside the scope of the PRRB's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (a)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1). [The p]laintiffs have done so here. Indeed, [the Secretary] does not contest the timeliness of [the p]laintiffs' challenges to the payment determinations from the relevant fiscal years. Nor does [the Secretary] contend that a challenge to those payment determination[s] cannot be the appropriate vehicle for challenging the regulations on which those payment determinations depend. However, [the Secretary] argues, nonetheless, that various\n   <em>\n    arguments\n   </em>\n   by [the p]laintiffs are barred because they were never placed before the agency during the various rulemaking proceedings subject to challenge in this action. In support of this proposition, [the Secretary] cite[s] to various cases that stand for the proposition that arguments must be raised before an agency before they can be raised in court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nuclear Energy Inst., Inc. v.

The Court finds that it is unclear from CMS's summary of the OMB standards whether CMS believed the central county commuting\n   data was relevant to determining whether a rural county\n   <em>\n    qualified\n   </em>\n   as a Lugar county, determining to which CBSA a Lugar county should be\n   <em>\n    assigned\n   </em>\n   , or both. This lack of clarity does not support the Secretary's position in this case that he \"consistently explained [his] approach and interpretation of the Lugar Statute,\" Def.'s Reply at 13, as requiring that central county data be considered for both qualification and assignment purposes. In other words, CMS stated in the 1988 Final Rule that \"a hospital located in a rural county that qualifies under this provision would be deemed to be located\n   <em>\n    in the MSA\n   </em>\n   to which the greatest number of workers in the rural county commute,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C476\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added), but did not state that central counties are relevant to the\n   <em>\n    assignment\n   </em>\n   of Lugar counties to their corresponding urban areas.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that East Texas did not waive its challenge to the CBSA assignment under the Lugar Statute for fiscal year 2015 by failing to submit a comment to the Secretary's 2014 Proposed Rule. The Court also concludes that the Secretary did not adequately explain his assignment of Henderson County to the Tyler CBSA or his interpretation and application of the Lugar Statute and implementing regulation requiring an examination of the commuting data to central counties when assigning qualified Lugar counties to CBSAs, and thus, he violated the standards set forth in the APA. Finally, the Court concludes that the proper remedy for this violation is to remand this case to the Secretary so that he may provide a meaningful explanation and an opportunity for the public to comment on how qualified Lugar counties are assigned to CBSAs under the Lugar Statute and implementing regulation. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part without prejudice East Texas's motion for summary judgment, deny without prejudice the Secretary's cross-motion for summary judgment, and remand this case to the Secretary for further action consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 18th day of October, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified and the Joint Appendix (\"JA\"), the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiff East Texas Medical Center-Athens (\"Pl.'s Mem.\"); (2) the Defendant's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Mem.\"); (3) Plaintiff East Texas Medical Center-Athens'[s] Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s Reply\"); (4) the Defendant's Reply in Support of His Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Reply\"); (5) Plaintiff East Texas Medical Center-Athens's Response to Court's Request for Further Briefing (\"Pl.'s Resp.\"); and (6) the Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Court's August 1, 2018 Order (\"Def.'s Resp.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Specifically, the CMS regulation defines an urban area either as an MSA \"or a Metropolitan division (in the case where a[n] [MSA] is divided into Metropolitan Divisions), as defined by [OMB].\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.64\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(ii)(A).
