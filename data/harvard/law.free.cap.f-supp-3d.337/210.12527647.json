R. CIV. P.\" or \"Rule\") 12(c), seeking to dismiss the Complaint under the so-called \"first-filed\" rule. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Defendants' motion, and consolidates this action with\n   <em>\n    Arciello et al v. County of Nassau et al\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-3974.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The Court finds application of the first-filed rule appropriate. The earlier-filed\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    collective action relates to the same conduct and involves a putative class that encompasses the Plaintiffs in this case. However, as explained more fully below, dismissal is not the appropriate disposition. The Court therefore will consolidate this case with\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The first-filed rule is a \"well-settled legal doctrine, instructing that 'where there are two [or more] competing lawsuits, the first suit should have priority, absent the showing of balance of convenience or special circumstances giving priority to the second.' \"\n    <em>\n     Wyler-Wittenberg. v.

As to Whether the First-Filed Rule Is Limited to Cases in \"Different Courts\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Plaintiffs assert that the first-filed doctrine cannot apply, because both this action and the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    action are currently pending in the Eastern District of New York (before the Court and Judge Locke). Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue the first-filed rule only applies when the parties file competing lawsuits in \"different courts,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , different judicial districts. According to the Plaintiffs, the first-filed rule is designed\n    to protect the initial plaintiff's choice of forum, therefore, it cannot apply to cases filed within the same District Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    While this argument has some intuitive appeal, it ignores the other rationales for the doctrine, namely, the \"conserve[ation] of judicial resources and promoting the efficient and comprehensive disposition of cases.\"\n    <em>\n     Castillo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837514\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/960/401/#p404\">\n     960 F.Supp.2d at 404\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Allowing two lawsuits touching on the same issue, and with substantially related parties, to proceed along separate tracks, even where both are in front of the same court, cannot promote those ends. Unsurprisingly then, courts have thus applied the first-filed rule to cases present before the same court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Greenaway v. Apple-Metro\n    </em>\n    , Inc., No. 13-cv-2818,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012216603\">\n     2013 WL 12216603\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2013) ;\n    <em>\n     Naula v.

Mar. 23, 2010). The Plaintiffs cite no cases to the contrary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Therefore, the Court finds the Plaintiffs' opposition to the application of the first-filed rule on this ground to be unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     2. As to Whether the Parties Are Identical or Substantially the Same\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The Plaintiffs further argue that this case and\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    are not \"competing lawsuits\" because there is no overlap between the parties. In support of this argument, the Plaintiffs rely on the fact that none of them opted-in to the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    collective action; that they are not seeking to represent any additional individuals other than those who have already opted in; and that the Plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    are not seeking to represent the Plaintiffs here. The Court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    As a starting point, the Plaintiffs are incorrect that \"[t]he first filed rule applies only where the parties and claims between the first filed suit and the second-filed suit are identical.\" ECF 36 at 6. \"[A]pplication of the rule does not require\n    <em>\n     identical\n    </em>\n    parties in the cases, but merely requires 'substantial overlap.' \"\n    <em>\n     Wyler-Wittenberg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286747\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/899/235/#p243\">\n     899 F.Supp.2d at 244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Spotless Enterprises Inc. v.

Here, the Plaintiffs, as employees of the County who allege they were not paid on their scheduled payday for work performed in excess of the applicable overtime thresholds, fall within the putative class in\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    . Their claims therefore are substantially similar to, if not the same as, the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The Court encountered nearly identical circumstances in\n    <em>\n     Wyler-Wittenberg v. MetLife Home Loans, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , and found application of the first-filed rule appropriate. The Court explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    Here, there is some degree of overlap that exists between the parties, claims, and the relief sought in each of the collective and class actions against MetLife. With regard to parties, MetLife is the same defendant-employer in each of the actions, but the seventy-five plaintiffs who opted-in as parties to the instant action are not the same plaintiffs as those in\n    <em>\n     Cerami\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Swisher\n    </em>\n    . However, in the assessment of whether the \"first-filed\" rule is applicable, the Second Circuit plainly does not require the first-filed action and the subsequent action to consist of identical parties. Moreover, the Court recognizes vast similarities among the individual plaintiffs in each of the putative collective and class actions against MetLife. Each plaintiff was either a loan officer or employee with similar job titles who worked at MetLife during the relevant time period.... Thus, considering the similar positions held by the plaintiffs in each of\n    these matters and the opt-in nature of a collective class, the Court concludes that plaintiffs in this action are similar enough to those in\n    <em>\n     Cerami\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Swisher\n    </em>\n    to warrant application of the \"first-filed\" rule.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286747\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/899/235/#p243\">\n     899 F.Supp.2d at 244-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The Plaintiffs cannot escape the first-filed rule simply because they chose not to opt into the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    collective action.

As to the Disposition of the Case\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Although the circumstances warrant application of the first-filed rule, the question remains whether the rule militates dismissal of this action in favor of the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    action. The Plaintiffs urge the Court not to dismiss their claims due to the prejudice dismissal would enact. They argue that the statute of limitations runs on each employee's claim until his individual Consent Form is filed with the court, meaning that dismissing the action and forcing those who opted in to join the\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    action would cause those workers to lose nearly a year and a half of their claims under the statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Defendants do not contest this point.

Although the Court duly notes the cases cited by the Defendant dismissing overlapping FLSA claims pursuant to the first-filed rule, the Court believes that the circumstances warrant consolidation of this action with\n    <em>\n     Arciello\n    </em>\n    , rather than dismissal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Courts avoid mechanical application of the first-filed rule, because \"[t]he complex problems that can arise from multiple federal filings do not lend themselves to a rigid test, but require instead that the district court consider the equities of the situation when exercising its discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Curtis v.

Further, Rule 42(a) permits a district court to consolidate \"actions involving a common question of law or fact.\" Courts may exercise their discretion to consolidate cases when supported by considerations of convenience, judicial economy, and equity.\n    <em>\n     Consorti v.
