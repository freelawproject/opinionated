(Verified Compl. \u00b6 24.) The Stallworth Property is comprised of three tracts of land totaling about 131 acres. (Declaration of Robert J. Cooper (\"Cooper Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.) The construction and operation of the Stallworth Station will impact a limited number of those acres, with around thirty acres needed for construction that reduces to around seven acres for operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) On January 29, 2018, FERC granted Mountain Valley permission to proceed with construction of the Stallworth Station. (Comm'rs Resp. Ex. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Stallworth Property is currently designated a \"R-R Rural-Residential\" zone under the Fayette County Unified Development Code (the \"UDC\" or the \"Fayette Zoning Code\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UDC \u00a7 2001.4; (Verified Compl. \u00b6 55).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To situate the Stallworth Station there in compliance with the Fayette Zoning Code, the Stallworth Property must be re-zoned a \"H-1 Heavy Industrial\" zone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UDC \u00a7 4002; (Verified Compl. \u00b6 56). Then, before beginning construction, Mountain Valley must obtain an \"improvement location permit,\" UDC \u00a7 1006, Part II, and a state building permit,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20FERC%20P%2061%2C197\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5001. (Verified Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) On August 2, 2017, Mountain Valley applied to re-zone the Stallworth Property. (Verified Compl. \u00b6 57.) The Commissioners ultimately denied that request on November 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) Robert J. Cooper, \"the Senior Vice President of Engineering and Construction at Mountain Valley,\" declares that Mountain Valley will suffer irreparable economic and non-economic harms resulting from delayed construction, such as lost revenue, modifications to Mountain Valley's construction schedule, and a diminished reputation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cooper Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mountain Valley initiated this action the same day the Commissioners denied its re-zoning application, invoking the court's federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Verified Compl. \u00b6 9.) Mountain Valley requests declaratory judgment that the NGA preempts the Fayette Zoning Code insofar as it applies to the property deemed by FERC to be necessary in the siting, construction, and operation of the Stallworth Station.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Commissioners argue at the outset that Mountain Valley's motion for summary judgment \"should be denied as premature because FERC is considering rehearing requests, and because there are multiple legal challenges to the FERC Certificate, any of which may invalidate the Certificate.\" (Comm'rs Resp. 6; Comm'rs Sur-reply 2-3.) On the contrary, this court recently recognized in Mountain Valley's related condemnation action that \"a FERC order remains in effect unless FERC or a court of appeals issues a stay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(c), and no such stay has been issued here.\"\n   <em>\n    Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v.

Thus, the Commissioners' initial arguments are without merit, and the court turns to Mountain Valley's requests for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Declaratory Judgment-Actual Controversy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commissioners contend that there is no \"actual controversy\" from which the court may enter a declaratory judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'rs Resp. 10-11.) The Declaratory Judgment Act requires, among other things, that an \"actual controversy\" exist prior to the entry of declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Mountain Valley's certificate, issued by FERC, authorizes the construction of the Stallworth Station on the Stallworth Property. Mountain Valley has also applied to re-zone the Stallworth Property to the appropriate designation that allows for the targeted construction and use. The Commissioners denied that application. Mountain Valley now challenges the constitutionality of the Fayette Zoning Code on preemption grounds insofar as it applies to the Stallworth Station.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'rs Sur-reply 3-4.) The Commissioners look for support in Mountain Valley's precedent shipping agreements, which the Commissioners insist show that Mountain Valley contemplated trouble receiving all necessary permits, including zoning permits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4-6.) Whether Mountain Valley's harms are self-inflicted is immaterial here. In short, Mountain Valley has a certificate from FERC authorizing the construction of the Stallworth Station, and the Commissioners denied Mountain Valley's application to re-zone the Stallworth Property to the proper designation. Moreover, the Fayette Zoning Code allows for the imposition of civil penalties and the prosecution of a criminal action for zoning violations. As noted, those facts create an actual controversy, and the court may therefore consider Mountain Valley's request for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.

They contend that Congress's 2005 amendment to the portion of the NGA addressing \"LNG terminals\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   negates the Act's well-settled preemptive nature. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'rs Resp. 13.) The 2005 amendment granted FERC \"exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG terminal.\" Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58, \u00a7 311,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%20594\">\n    119 Stat. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685-86 (2005). The definition of an \"LNG terminal\" expressly excludes facilities that must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 7 of the NGA, such as the Stallworth Station.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%20594\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Congress did not similarly grant FERC \"exclusive authority\" over pipelines and compressor stations, the Commissioners suggest that Congress intended to withhold from FERC preemptive authority over pipelines and compressor stations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'rs Resp. 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There are two most prominent reasons why the Commissioners' argument is unavailing. First, the 2005 amendments to the NGA addressed the specific and limited field of LNG terminals, which, as earlier defined, are \"onshore or in State waters\" facilities used in the importing and exporting of liquid natural gas. \u00a7 311, 119 Stat. at 685-86. Those amendments did not, however, alter the sections from which FERC receives its preemptive power over\n   the field of transporting and selling natural gas in interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (amending sections 1, 2, and 3 of the NGA) with\n   <em>\n    Iowa Utils. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215299\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/817/#p821\">\n    377 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that section 7 of the NGA \"specifically provides that the FERC will oversee the construction and maintenance of natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity\"). It follows that FERC's field-preemptive authority under section 7 was also unaltered. And second, Congress's grant of \"exclusive authority\" is an express preemption clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AES Sparrows Point LNG, LLC v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567231\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/120/#p125\">\n    527 F.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125-26 (4th Cir. 2008). So it does not matter that FERC lacks such \"exclusive authority\" over interstate pipelines and compressor stations-FERC never had it, but retains the benefit of field preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Commissioners also point out that Mountain Valley has not alleged that the Fayette Zoning Code has \"prohibit[ed] or unreasonably delay[ed] construction of the Stallworth Station.\" (Comm'rs Resp. 14.) This argument invokes the certificate's instruction that certificate holders should attempt to cooperate with state and local permitting authorities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certificate \u00b6 309. Coined the \"rule of reason,\" FERC directs certificate holders to engage in \"bona fide attempts to comply with state and local requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20FERC%20P%2061%2C048\">\n    154 FERC P 61,048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35 (Jan. 28, 2016). Importantly, however, FERC believes that the NGA preempts local zoning ordinances,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20FERC%20P%2061%2C048\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20FERC%20P%2061%2C048\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the rule of reason is secondary to FERC's mandate that \"[a]ny state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized [in a certificate] must be consistent with the conditions of th[e] certificate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certificate \u00b6 309. Thus, the rule of reason is only tangentially related to the field preemption inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lastly, the Commissioners assert that Mountain Valley has not stated why it needs to rezone all its property rather than only the acreage necessary to build the compressor station, (Comm'rs Resp. 15), and that the certificate does not explicitly reflect that FERC considered local zoning regulations in approving Mountain Valley's project, (Comm'r Sur-reply 10). These arguments are irrelevant to the question of whether the NGA and FERC preempt the Fayette Zoning Code insofar as it applies to the Stallworth Station. Furthermore, Mountain Valley does not seek a declaration mandating the Commissioners to re-zone the entire Stallworth Property. Mountain Valley instead seeks a declaration applicable only to the Stallworth Station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, the Fayette Zoning Code is preempted insofar as it applies to Mountain Valley's FERC-approved activities in connection with the Stallworth Station because it attempts to regulate in a field occupied by the NGA and FERC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Algonquin LNG v.

But the Fayette Zoning Code's attempt to regulate within the field occupied by the NGA and FERC ran doubly awry of the Supremacy Clause when the Commissioners denied Mountain Valley's re-zoning application, at least to the extent the application sought to re-zone the property necessary for the Stallworth Station. The denial interfered with the comprehensive and careful consideration of FERC in siting the Stallworth Station and deeming that site in furtherance of the public convenience and necessity.

Thus, they suggest that compliance with both the certificate and the Fayette Zoning Code is not impossible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16-18.) For example, the Commissioners note that Mountain Valley could have appealed the decision to deny its re-zoning application since there is no outright ban on re-zoning a parcel from R-R Rural Residential to H-1 Heavy Industrial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Impossibility of compliance with both federal and local regulation is not, however, the only measure of conflict preemption. As explained above, the Commissioners' denial of Mountain Valley's re-zoning application pursuant to the Fayette Zoning Code impedes Congress's objectives in enacting the NGA and charging FERC with its implementation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Commissioners also invoke FERC's rule of reason described above, suggesting that pursuit of approval of the re-zoning application is within reason since FERC granted Mountain Valley three years to place the project into service; alternatively, the Commissioners insist that there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the Fayette Zoning Code unreasonably delays construction of the Stallworth Station. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'rs Resp. 18.) Additionally, the Commissioners insist that the Stallworth Property \"is merely [Mountain Valley's] preferred location,\" noting that Mountain Valley considered alternate locations for its compressor station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Again, the rule of reason is more suggestion than mandate, and it is nevertheless only tangentially related to preemption. Furthermore, the three-year deadline is merely the outer limit on placing the project into service, while economic and pragmatic planning considerations compel completion as soon as practicable and any unnecessary impediments will be at Mountain Valley's unrecoverable expense. And whether Mountain Valley chose the Stallworth Property as a matter of preference is beside the point: FERC concluded that the public convenience and necessity requires construction there rather than any possible alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, the Fayette Zoning Code is preempted insofar as it applies to Mountain Valley's FERC-approved activities in connection with the Stallworth Station because it conflicts with congressional purposes and objectives outlined in the NGA and by FERC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   C. Permanent Injunction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The scope of Mountain Valley's requested injunctive relief informs the permanent injunction analysis.

Here, the injunctive relief sought is commensurate with the court's declaratory judgment: Mountain Valley seeks to enjoin the Commissioners from enforcing the Fayette Zoning Code against it insofar as the Fayette Zoning Code applies to its FERC-approved activities in connection with Stallworth Station. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Compl. WHEREFORE Clause Pt. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Importantly, Mountain Valley does not request an injunction directing the Commissioners to re-zone the entire Stallworth Property to H-1 Heavy Industrial, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mountain Valley Reply 19), which would be more than necessary to build the Stallworth Station, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cooper Decl. \u00b6 7). It also bears re-emphasis that Mountain Valley's activities, including those associated with the Stallworth Station, are circumscribed by FERC's regulation and oversight. So, enjoining the Commissioners from enforcing the Fayette Zoning Code against the Stallworth Station would not give Mountain Valley carte blanche to do whatever it wants: Mountain Valley can do only what FERC authorizes, just like the\n   Fayette Zoning Code is preempted by only what FERC authorizes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With the requested injunction's scope in mind, the court finds that a commensurate injunction naturally flows from a declaration that an enforced local law is preempted by federal law. In practical effect, Mountain Valley's requested injunction will simply enjoin the Commissioners from enforcing a law to the extent that they are already not allowed to enforce pursuant to the declaratory judgment entered herein. Some courts have awarded injunctive relief as an incident to declaratory judgment in similar circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley View Health Care, Inc. v.
