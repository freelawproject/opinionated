Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff meets the insured status requirements of the Act through December 31, 2018. (Dkt. 8 at 18). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since May 30, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of type II diabetes mellitus (with peripheral neuropathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ) and lumbosacral degenerative disc disease (with low back pain). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). The ALJ further found that Plaintiffs medically determinable impairments of gastroesophageal reflux disorder, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and status post gunshot wound were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Plaintiff's representations that he suffers from knee arthritis, alcohol dependence, and cannabis dependence, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04, 2.02, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00-6.00, 8.00, 11.00, and 12.00 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   can occasionally climb stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

Accordingly, the ALJ failed to give any valid reason for rejecting the opinions of NP Bilsback and Dr. Khaneja.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The ALJ also failed to properly assess Dr. Toor's opinion. On March 26, 2014, Dr. Toor examined Plaintiff and issued a medical source statement regarding Plaintiff's functional limitations. (Dkt. 8 at 313-16). Dr. Toor noted that Plaintiff \"appeared to be in moderate pain,\" and that his gait was \"abnormal, unsteady, with a tendency to lose balance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 314). Dr. Toor further noted that Plaintiff \"declined to walk on heels and toes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although Plaintiff used no assistive devices, did not need help changing for the exam, and was able to rise from the chair without difficulty, he had difficulty getting on and off the exam table. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Toor's physical exam of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system revealed\n   some limitations, including lumbar spine flexion of 20 degrees, extension 0 degrees, and lateral flexion and lateral rotation 30 degrees, bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 315). Straight leg raise tests were positive, both sitting and supine, bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Toor also noted that for Plaintiff's knees, movement, flexion and extension were at 145 degrees, with tenderness in both knees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A neurologic examination revealed tingling and numbness in the lower part of the legs and feet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's extremities, including his knees, and his lower legs and feet, were tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on this information, Dr. Toor rated Plaintiff's prognosis as \"fair,\" and opined that \"[Plaintiff] has moderate to severe limitations in standing, walking, squatting, bending, and lifting. Pain interferes with his balance. He has moderate limitations to sitting a long time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 316). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to the opinion of Dr. Toor, because it was \"vague\" and did not provide a \"function-by-function analysis of [Plaintiff's] work related restrictions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The ALJ also referred to the assessed RFC for light work, as well as limitations relating to climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching and crawling, and limitations in Plaintiff's ability to work in hazardous environments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Notably, in assigning \"little weight\" to Dr. Toor's opinion, the ALJ did not point to any conflicting opinion evidence, or conflicting objective medical evidence, in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

The Court therefore agrees with Plaintiff that the ALJ erred in his assessment of the medical opinions of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that because the ALJ rejected all the medical opinions of record, the ALJ failed to rely on opinion evidence from an acceptable medical source and determined Plaintiff's RFC based on his own lay interpretation of the medical record. (Dkt. 11-1 at 18). The Commissioner argues in response that although an ALJ considers opinions from medical sources, the final responsibility for determining the RFC lies with the ALJ, who makes the determination based on all of the medical and other evidence in the record.

At the outset, the Court notes that the ALJ did not have the opportunity to review certain treatment records from 2014 and 2015 prior to issuing his decision. Plaintiff points specifically to a September 2014 record from Priscilla Martin, M.D. (Dkt. 11-1 at 21). Dr. Martin began following Plaintiff's case in April 2014. (Dkt. 8 at 430). At a visit in September 2014, Dr. Martin found that Plaintiff's condition had worsened due to his increased difficulties walking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 452 (Plaintiff noted to be \"with continued lower extremity diabetic neuropathy. Notes numbness and burning of lower extremities bilaterally and swelling.... Is with increased difficulty ambulating secondary to deformation of foot and neuropathy but is without decreased strength. Currently walks with cane and is more unsteady than on previous evaluations\") ). Dr. Martin's treatment notes are particularly significant, as they conflict with Plaintiff's ability to perform light work. The Court is cognizant that an ALJ need not \"reconcile explicitly every conflicting shred of medical testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Galiotti v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527025\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/266/66/#p67\">\n    266 F.

Here, however, the ALJ did not have the opportunity to view records containing medical evidence favorable to Plaintiff and thereafter make an informed decision as to whether these records would alter the assessed RFC. The Court therefore determines that the record was not complete at the time the ALJ assessed Plaintiff's RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant points to several pieces of medical evidence she contends allowed the ALJ to assess Plaintiff's RFC, including treatment notes from NP Bilsback, Plaintiff's activity level, noncompliance with treatment, and search for work in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14-1 at 18-28). What Defendant does not point to is evidence with bearing on Plaintiff's functional capacity. Rather, the ALJ discussed at several points in the written determination how Plaintiff's reported activities of daily living were inconsistent with the medical opinion evidence in the record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 21, 23, 24).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 14) is denied. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    When referencing the page number(s) of docket citations in this Decision and Order, the Court will cite to the CM/ECF-generated page numbers that appear in the upper righthand corner of each document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Before issuing her more recent November 2015 opinion statement, NP Bilsback completed an opinion statement for the Monroe County Department of Human Services in September 2014. (Dkt. 8 at 384-87). The 2014 form is mostly blank, but does indicate that Plaintiff is able to work for up to 40 hours per week and does not have any limitations.

However, the ALJ did not explain why he rejected Plaintiff's testimony regarding his need to take breaks, nor did he explain what other evidence in the record contradicted Plaintiff's claim that he needed to take breaks.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
