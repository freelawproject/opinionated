These answers and findings practically cover all the points involved, and for that reason we do not feel that the case requires-extended discussion. The court is satisfied that to a considerable degree there was a studied effort on the part of Vicente Portuondo to imitate the markings, labels and general method of dressing his goods that had been pursued by Juan F. Portuondo and thereby to profit on the magic that had already been given to the name of Portuondo by his brother. When the business of Vicente Portuondo went into bankruptcy the defendants in this case purchased the labels and other markings which had been used by Vicente, and their use was continued in a like manner by these defendants. In addition to this the defendants organized the defendant corporation under the name of \u201c The Vicente' Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company,\u201d and advertised their goods as the original \u201c Portuondo \u201d cigar, using an imi* tation of the business signature.of \u201cJuan F. Portuondo.\u201d This course of dealing was such as to constitute that which is known in the law as unfair trade competition coupled with an infringement of a business name and in some instances infringement of trade-marks, to such an extent as to entitle the plaintiffs to relief. But the question is as to the measure of the relief that should be given. The plaintiffs and their predecessor, with full knowledge of everything that was going on, have seen fit to rest on their oars and to do nothing to protect their rights for a period \u00f3f about sixteen years. During this period the business of Vicente Portuondo grew and thrived, and subsequently declined and went into bankruptcy. The' tangible assets were bought from the receiver in bankruptcy and turned over to the corporation defendant in this case, which corporation also acquired, through an\u2019agreement, executed by the said Vicente Portuondo, the right to use the name of Vicente Portuondo, for which right they are'now paying the widow of Vicente Portuondo a yearly allowance of $2,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">The name of Vicente Portuondo was the lawful and proper name of that individual; and after the individual Vicente <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Portuondo has been allowed the free use of his name for business purposes without any practical protest during this long and continued period-of years, should a court of equity step in and use the strong hand of a chancellor to stop even a fair and proper use of the name by Yicente Portuondo if alive or by the defendant corporation under the agreement executed by him now that he is dead? That is the question. In this connection it has been strongly argued by the defendants that the plaintiffs have been guilty of such gross laches in asserting their alleged legal rights that they are not entitled to any relief in equity; and many cases are cited to sustain this position. On the other hand, the plaintiffs cite authorities to the effect that long continued acquiescence, or failure to act, in cases of infringement of trade-marks and of unfair trade competition, although amounting to unreasonable delay or inexcusable laches, will not bar the right to an injunction to stop the unfair and fraudulent conduct complained of, but will only act as a bar to the right to an accounting of profits: McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245; approved in Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">No Pennsylvania authorities, one way or the other, directly on this point have been presented, but the case of Go wans v. Ahlbor'n, 4 ICulp, 31, decided by Judge Rice when in the common pleas, follows the rule contended for by the plaintiffs. As this rule laid down by the supreme court of the United States has been followed by such an eminent Pennsylvania jurist as Judge Rice, and, further, as the rule appears to be supported by reason, we consider it controlling in the case at bar. However, as has been well said by the present chief justice of the supreme court of the United States, in Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514 : \u201cIt is in the exercise of discretionary jurisdiction that the doctrine of reasonable diligence is applied, and those who seek equity must do it. A court might hesitate as to the measure of relief where the use by others for a long period under assumed permission of the owner had largely enhanced the reputation of a particular brand.\u201d \u2022 So in a case like the present, where a brother'who is a cigarmaker leaves the employ of his elder brother, who' is likewise a cigarmaker, to start in the cigar manufacturing business for himself under his own name, and is' allowed to continue the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that nafne without practical protest for a period of upwards of sixteen years, and where toward the end of this long period after business reverses an arrangement is made to continue the use of his name in the cigar manufacturing business for his own benefit, and after his death for the benefit of his estate by a payment of an annuity to his wife, and where, on the faith of this arrangement, large sums of money are paid out and invested by innocent third parties in order to thus continue the use of the name, even though it may appear that in the conduct of this business the younger brother had been guilty of certain distinct acts of unfair infringement of the elder brother\u2019s trade rights which had been continued by his successor under a belief of right \u2014 in a case like this a court may well hesitate as to the measure of relief, and the relief to be given may very properly be measured in accordance with the circumstances, taking into consideration the long delay and the effect thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">Of course, it can be argued that the use of the name of Vicente Portuondo by the defendant corporation, and the use of the labels and other markings by that corporation, are a new use against which the plaintiff corporation has proceeded promptly enough, and as a strict legal proposition such a contention might be maintained ; but, on the other hand, it could as well be maintained that the use of the labels, name, etc., by the plaintiff corporation, dating from the time they acquired their rights from Juan F. Portuondo, would constitute a new use. But the eyes of a chancellor will see that in both in-, stances the facts really constitute the continuation of a prior use rather than the beginning of a new one. In considering the measure of relief to be given, it must be borne in mind that a certain business value was added to the name of Vicente Portuondo during this sixteen years by perfectly fair means and business enterprise, as well as by the unfair means complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">We cannot say, under these circumstances, that it is plain that Vicente Portuondo had no right in the use of his name ; we can say, however, under our findings of fact in this case, that it is perfectly plain .that he had been guilty of abuses in the use of the name by his acts of unfair trade conduct. These acts stand out plainly in themselves. They speak for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>themselves. They have been written down, and are therefore plain, and can be stopped in the future. Although a chancelor will not be keen to sort the good from the evil for the benefit of a sinner, yet the court may, in measuring its relief, do so for the benefit of third parties whose rights are to be directly affected, where the plaintiff has been guilty of such gross laches as in this case. After this long lapse of years, where the rights of others have intervened, we are not inclined to grant an injunction that will act to restrain a fair and proper use of the name \u201cVicente Portuondo\u201d by the defendants in the conduct of their business, so long as no unfair or fraudulent trade use is made thereof. In other words, we do not feel called upon, under the circumstances of this case, to drive the defendants out of business and entirely cut off the annuity of the widow of Vicente Portuondo, which happens to be her sole and only support. However, Vicente Portuondo would not have had the right during his lifetime to use his own name in the cigar business in such a manner as to deceive the public into the belief that his business and the business of his brother were one and the same, or to have attracted custom to himself on the belief that his product was the same product as that of his brother, nor to have made any other tricky, dishonest and fraudulent use of his own name calculated to decoy the purchasing public under a misapprehension as to the real facts; nor would he have been allowed to use the name Portuondo, standing alone as against his brother, Juan F. Portuondo, after that brother had built up a particular and general reputation for a brand of cigars known as the Portuondo cigars, and such a use of the name would have been restrained against Vicente Portuondo if alive, and will now be restrained against others claiming under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">The use of the signature of Vicente Portuondo, which is an imitation of the Juan F. Portuondo signature, and the use of the labels, which are an imitation of the Juan F. Portuondo labels, as found by the court in its findings of facts' in this case, will be restrained; and, further, defendants will be restrained from the use of the signs, circulars and affidavit complained of by the plaintiffs which have been, and are now, being used in an unfair manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The exhibit \u201c F \u201d in plaintiffs\u2019 bill has elements of unfair trade competition about it which must be discontinued by the defendants, but we will not restrain the use of the picture of the head and shoulders of Yicente Portuondo. In this connection we will say that although plantation scenes were to a degree, and no doubt still are, in common use upon the labels in the cigar trade, still, the predominant features in the plantation scene used by the plaintiff are the negro with a hoe, occupying a particular pose, the overseer with an extended arm and the particular low house in the rear of the scene, and the general color effect. These features immediately attract the eye, and whether the overseer is put on horseback or on foot, or the negro with this particular pose is put on one side or the other of the \u00f3v\u00e9rseer, makes but little difference. The plantation label of the defendants in several respects is plainly an imitation of this plantation label of the plaintiffs and its use must be discontinued as it now is, or in any other form, using these particular features.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">It has been urged that many of the features on the cigar box of the plaintiffs, such as the word \u201c Chico,\u201d the oval mark on the top, the red and yellow paper around the edges, are markings common to many cigar boxes in general use, and, therefore, no complaint should be made of their use by the defendants in this case. While this is true, it is also true that when we find these marks of similarity between the two boxes together, with the other imitations of labels, imitation of particular wordings and the plain imitations of the signature of Juan F. Portuondo \u2014 all these things taken together justify the finding of unfair trade conduct on the part of the defendants. Of course, the defendants have the right to use the word \u201c Chico,\u201d but in doing so it is not necessary for them to use exactly the same type as the plaintiffs have used, nor to place\u2019 it on\u2019 their boxes in exactly the same position relatively to the name of the manufacturer as the plaintiffs happen to do. We would say that the'defendants also have the right to use an oval mark, but in doing so care should be taken not to have it so\u2019 much like the oval mark of the plaintiffs that the one would be readily taken for the other. The yellow'and red edgings are stock trimmings in general use, but taken with the other imitations of plaintiffs\u2019 boxes; their use by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>fendants, although possibly without any particular unfair intent, appears suspicious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\">The name of the' defendant corporation, \u201c The Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company,\u201d is plainly and unquestionably an infringement on the business name of the plaintiff corporation and will be restrained as such. It was not necessary for the defendants to have taken exactly the same words and the same arrangement of words so far as at all possible under the circumstances, in order to have found a name for their corporation ; but this they have done, as plainly appears by arranging the name of the defendant corporation under that of the plaintiff 'corporation, thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The Juan F. Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">\u201c The Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company.\u201d Such a similarity in names is in prejudice of the plaintiffs\u2019 right and will be enjoined \u00bfs an infringement on the business name of the plaintiff corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The plaintiffs are entitled to relief to the extent indicated in this opinion and in the findings in this case, and to that extent only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">The chief point of similarity between the markings of the boxes of the defendants and those of the plaintiffs are present and are most noticeable in certain of the \u201c Chico \u201d size boxes, where the coloring of the labels is the same with the exception of the caution notice which on the plaintiffs\u2019 box is printed in red, while on the box of the defendants it is printed in blue. However, the whole dressing and general appearance of these two boxes is so similar that an ordinarily careful person using due caution would be likely to be misled into buying one cigar for the other. With certain exceptions as particularly pointed out in the findings of fact, the new box of the defendants with the picture of Yicente Portuondo thereon has but few unfair markings or trimmings, but it is not shown in the testimony how extensively this new box is being used or to what extent the old box has been abandoned. The adoption of this new box, although to a degree a meritorious act on the part of the defendants, cannot be viewed without seeing therein \u00e1 show of appreciation on their part of the fact that they bad been guilty of certain features of imitation in their old boxes which were to be replaced by these new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ones, and, again, the placing of the word <em>\u201c </em>Registered \u201d on the plantation label of the defendants, when, in point of fact the label was not duly registered, looks suspiciously as though the defendants themselves appreciated the fact that they had no real right to register that particular label, as in its essential features it was an imitation of the duly registered plantation label of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">We have not overlooked the testimony as to the words \u201c Five cent straight \u201d marked on the inside ends of plaintiffs\u2019 Chico box, and the like marking on the defendants\u2019 box (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 33), nor have we overlooked the use of the brown bands around the cigars of the defendants which are like those used by the plaintiffs. But we have not been able to find any testimony to justify a finding that the plaintiffs or their predecessors adopted or used those markings prior to their use by the defendants or their predecessors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">In reaching our conclusions in this case the letters put in evidence at page 25 of the notes have not been considered. These letters were offered together in three files containing a large number of miscellaneous written orders, for the purpose of showing that the goods of the plaintiffs were therein referred to as \u201c Portuondo \u201d cigars, so that the inference might be drawn therefrom that the plaintiffs\u2019 cigars were popularly and generally known by that name. The fact sought to be thus established is relevant and the character of proof offered is competent, but the documents relied upon as proof in this instance were neither properly identified, nor was their history sufficiently shown, to justify the admission thereof as evidence in the case. The court further states that of all the depositions, offered at pages 6-9, and again at pages 128-131 of the notes, only the deposition of Yicente Portuondo has been considered. That particular deposition is competent as a declaration against interest, but the other depositions are not competent evidence at all in the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">The several features of unfairness which have been pointed out, the infringement on the plantation trade-mark, and the imitation signature must all be abandoned by the defendant corporation, and the name of that corporation must be changed so as not to infringe on the title of the plaintiff corporation. With these changes there is not any reason why both concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>should not live and indulge in fair and honorable business competition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">And now, July 3, 1907, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">That the Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company, Charles EL Kors, Louis Weinberg, Theodore EL Goodwin and Nathan Schwab, the defendants, and each of them, and their and each of their servants, agents, salesmen and all persons in privity with them or any of them, be and they are hereby perpetually enjoined as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">1.

We shall consider first that of the defendants in the proceeding below. Separate reference to each of the seventy-seven assignments of error would be impracticable. Fortunately the case does not require it. More than three-fourths of them relate to the findings of fact by the court, and the complaint with respect to each is, that it is not supported by the evidence. Following closely the line indicated by each assignment we have very carefully examined the evidence in the case. From the specific findings, seventy-one in number, the learned court reached the general conclusion that there was on the part of Vicente Portuondo a studied effort to imitate the markings, labels and general method of dressing his goods, that had been pursued by Juan F. Portuondo, with a view to profit on the magic that had already been given to the name of Portuondo by his brother; and that his course of dealing was such as constituted what is known in law as unfair trade competition, coupled with an infringement of the business name, and in some instances infringement of trade-marks to such extent as to entitle the plaintiff to relief. This general finding can be understood and applied only as certain facts connected with the history of the case are made known. Juan F. Portuondo engaged in the manufacture of cigars in the city of Philadelphia as early as 1869. In 1885 in order that his product might be distinguished from that of other cigar manufacturers, he adopted certain labels which being duly registered became his peculiar trade-marks, and these he used upon the goods made in his establishment. The cigars manufactured by him came to be known to the trade throughout the United States as La Flor de Portuondo, after one of the adopted trade-marks, or Portuondo cigars, and are so generally referred to by the purchasing public. In January, 1893, the Juan F. Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company, plaintiff having been incorporated, Juan F. Portuondo assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>it the manufacturing business conducted by him, together with all the rights therein, including trade-marks, copyright labels and everything else connected therewith. Up to the time of his death in 1906 Juan F. Portuondo was president of this company, and owned a very large majority of stock interest therein. The company has continued uninterruptedly to the present in the business for which it was organized. Yicente Portuondo, a brother of Juan F. Portuondo, had been employed by the latter in his factory up to 1900, when, quitting his employment there, he engaged in the cigar business with a partner under the trade name of Yicente Portuondo. Four years later, in 1904, Yicente Portuondo filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and, having been adjudged a bankrupt, his property passed to the trustee. Within three days thereafter, by agreement in writing, he sold to the individual appellants for the use of the Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company the other appellant, a corporation to be formed later, and which was duly incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, April 28, 1904, the right to use the name Yicente Portuondo in the title of the proposed corporation. In May, 1904, defendant corporation purchased from the receiver in bankruptcy the entire stock and fixtures, including the labels and stationery of the business of Yicente Portuondo. The bill filed in the case charged an improper and illegal use by defendants of labels on their manufactured goods which infringed upon trade-marks of the plaintiffs, an improper use of the name Portuondo, and a general course of unfair trade on their part towards the plaintiff, resulting in great loss to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It may be conceded that some of the specific facts found by the court are fairly disputable; but none are without support in the evidence, certainly none which might be regarded as material. The findings with respect to those disputable are not open to review, except as manifest error is shown, and that is not the case with respect to any of them. Were these to be passed by without consideration, there would be still enough facts in the case clearly established to sustain the final conclusion of the court as above stated. The trade-marks, labels and indices employed by Yicente Portuondo speak for themselves. They were not a servile and exact reproduction of those used by Juan F. Portuondo, of whom the plaintiffs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the successors in right, but they bear such resemblance that it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that they were designed from them, with not too much variation to prevent them from being accredited by the unobservant and unwary as the proper marks and labels of Juan F. Portuondo, intended to identify the goods of his own special manufacture, and with just enough variation to distinguish one from the other when comparison was made between them. Except as both were exposed to one at the same time, so that opportunity for comparison was afforded, either could readily be taken for the other. This was not accidental, could not have been, but was evidently the result of careful and studied effort. It is wholly immaterial in this connection that the labels and marks used by the defendants were the same that had been devised and used by Vicente Portuondo. The fact that he had not been enjoined from using them conferred no right upon appellants to use them. They were- as much infringement under his use as under theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">That the course of dealing pursued by Vicente Portuondo and the defendant company, in the manufacture and sale of their goods, was unfair trade competition, coupled with infringement of business name and trade-marks, is made equally evident. This finding is not dependent upon any fact open to question. The appropriation of name, the use of simulated labels, marks and designs, would in themselves be sufficient to warrant this finding; but it has far more to rest upon. The advertisements and circulars addressed to the trade by the defendants, in which claims are made calculated to create the belief that the cigars manufactured by the defendant company are the original, if not the only, Portuondo cigars, furnish convincing proof that however excellent in quality defendants\u2019 manufactured product was, for their general acceptance in the market defendants depended far more upon the Portuondo association than upon the excellence of the goods. Value was given the name Portuondo in association with cigars, and the trade-marks and labels adopted by Juan F. Portuondo were used to distinguish cigars of his manufacture from others in the general market. The general rule is that anything done by a rival in the same business by imitation or otherwise, designed or calculated to mislead the public in the belief that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>buying the product offered by him for sale, they were buying the product of another\u2019s manufacture, would be in fraud on that other\u2019s rights, and would afford just ground for equitable interference. That is the case here. \"With respect to the measure of relief afforded the plaintiff by the restraining decree of the court, the defendants in the bill have no ground for complaint. It deprives them of nothing that they are entitled to; it simply protects the plaintiff company in the exclusive enjoyment of what it has shown itself to lawfully own.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The exceptions in this appeal, No. 397, January Term, 1907, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We come now to consider the appeal of the plaintiff company. Here the complaint is that the decree comes short of giving the plaintiff the full measure of protection to which it is fairly and justly entitled under the evidence. The bill asked that defendants \u201c be restrained from using on cigars, or in relation thereto, or in connection therewith, or in the advertisement or sale thereof, the words Yicente Portuondo or Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company, or any colorable imitation thereof, either alone or in connection with other words or phrases.\u201d The decree while enjoining defendants from using any of the distinctive trade-marks of the plaintiff, or devices colorably simulating them, restrains with respect to the use of the name \u201c Portuondo\u201d no further than to require that when used, it shall be immediately preceded by the name \u201c Yicente,\u201d in the same size and style of letters as the word \u201c Portuondo.\u201d It is quite evident from the opinion filed by the learned judge who sat as chancellor, that but for supposed equitable considerations having regard to the delay on the part of the plaintiff to assert its claim to the exclusive use of the name, and the amount expended by the defendants in establishing their business under the corporate name of the Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company, the full measure of protection asked by the plaintiff would have been afforded. While defendants claim a legal right to use the name Portuondo under and by virtue of their agreement with Yicente Portuondo, the court bases its denial of the relief asked for by plaintiff on no such grounds, but upon purely equitable considerations. Since the appeal in all such cases is to the discretionary jurisdiction of the chancellor, such considerations as these have their proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>place in the inquiry; but the question must always be as to the weight to be allowed these under the facts of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The findings show an exclusive original right to the use of the name, in connection with the manufacture of cigars, in Juan F. Portuondo; a legal transfer of that right to the plaintiff company ; and continued prejudicial infringement of such right by the defendants. The 32d finding is as follows: \u201c The name adopted for this defendant corporation, to wit: The Yicente Portuondo Cigar Manufacturing Company, is so similar to the title of the plaintiff corporation, that it is likely to and has deceived the public, and thereby created a confusion between the goods of the plaintiff and of the defendants, and has thereby enabled the defendants to profit by the good reputation of the plaintiff and its predecessors, and at the expense of the plaintiff in the cigar trade. The combination of words used in this name constitutes an infringement upon the business name of the plaintiff corporation.\u201d A very careful review of all the evidence in the case has satisfied us of the correctness of the findings of the learned judge. <em>We </em>have been aided much in our investigation of the case by the orderly and logical manner observed in stating these and the clearness and conciseness with which they are expressed. Accepting the facts as found, we are to inquire only into these considerations which influenced the court to deny the plaintiff the full measure of relief, which upon the facts as we have stated them above, it would seem to be entitled to. These considerations are of a purely equitable nature. They are, first, laches on the part of the plaintiff in asserting its right to the exclusive use of the name Portuondo in its business; and, second, the loss that would result to the defendants in view of the large expenditure made relying upon their right to the use of the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">That the plaintiff here is chargeable with laches, is an inference derived by the chancellor from certain facts which admit of no dispute. Yicente Portuondo in the conduct of his separate business, until bankruptcy overtook him in 1904, persistently made use of the name Portuondo in a way that was clearly an infringement of the rights of Juan F. Portuondo. This was well known to the Tatter, who made no attempt by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>legal proceeding to restrain such, continued use by Yicente. It does not appear that the defendant company has to any considerable degree, if at all, enlarged upon the use of the name; but it does clearly appear, that it has continued to do all that Yicente did in this regard. Were this a proceeding by Juan F. Portuondo to restrain Yicente from using the name a chancellor might be justified in calling upon the former for some excusing explanation of his inactivity in asserting his exclusive right during all this time. We do not say that a failure in this regard would necessarily defeat his right to the protection asked, but it would certainly be a circumstance to be considered in adjusting the equities of the parties. Suppose, however, it did so result, the refusal of the court to interfere could not be construed into a recognition of any right on the part of Yicente to the use of the name. Any discussion of this case must start with the accepted fact that th\u00e9 original, exclusive right, was in Juan F. Portuondo. This right in him was property, as much entitled to protection as any other species of property. He and he alone could invest another with any right in connection therewith. He might by indifference and inactivity forfeit his right to claim the protection of the law against someone\u2019s invasion* and this incidentally would result in an unearned advantage to the invader, but it would invest the latter with no right in the property itself. While the latter would be secured against legal interference with his use of another\u2019s property, he would have no right in the property itself which he could sell or assign to another, or which he could assert against another attempting to make common use of it with himself. His exemption from legal interference would be purely incidental to the owner\u2019s forfeiture of right, and would be personal to himself. The mere fact that the right to protection against all other infringers would remain with the original owner, and no such right against anyone in the world could be claimed by the infringer, shows in a most conclusive way that no right of property could have been acquired by the latter. So that even though Juan F. Portuondo must have failed in any attempt to restrain Yicente from using the name in connection with his business, that fact, accepting it as a fact, establishes no right in Yicente to the thing itself. When he went into bankruptcy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>and later when he attempted to sell to the defendant company the privilege of using the name in its business, the sole and exclusive ownership of the property was in those who had acquired it from and through Juan F. Portuondo, without other qualification than that the right to exclusive enjoyment of the thing as against Vicente might not be enforcible at law, because of laches on the part of the former owner. The defendants are here claiming not an immunity from interference, but a right to property derived through purchase from Vicente Portuondo. As we have tried to show, the latter had no property right in the business name, and, therefore, could convey none. By what principle of law or equity could anyone succeed to his immunity from interference by the lawful owner ? His was no right, and, therefore, was not anything that \u2022 could be transferred. It results, we think necessarily, that the defendant company is in no better position to claim advantage from plaintiff\u2019s laches with respect to Vicente, than any other infringer would be. It will not be contended that the indulgence shown his brother in this regard interfered with Juan F. Portuondo\u2019s right to protection against other infringers; and yet if one could have succeeded to the immunity allowed Vieente, because of an assignment from him, why not a dozen, or for that matter a hundred or more, to the utter destruction of all value in the plaintiff\u2019s rights ? We allow the tacking of an adverse possession of the land by an occupant without right, to the subsequent possession of a purchaser, to form a bar by the statute of limitation ; and this may have suggested the application of like method here by analogy; but we are not dealing with the statute of limitations, but with an exemption from legal disturbances which, no matter how long enjoyed, could never ripen into a legal right or title. For the reasons stated we are of opinion that however guilty of laches Juan F. Portuondo may have been in allowing his brother Vicente to continue undisturbed in the use of the business name Portuondo, such laches can avail the defendants nothing, and ought not to be considered in connection with their present claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The other question while not one of estoppel, is closely akin to it, since it is allowed a determining effect in measuring the relief the plaintiff is entitled to, by the application of like principles. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The defendant corporation in its attempt to acquire a right to the use of the name Portuondo, and in various ways enlarging its manufacturing facilities and expanding its trade, has expended large sums of money. These expenditures have been made' in the honest belief that their right to employ the name Portuondo was absolute, and by its use of the name the business of the company has increased to a profitable degree. A denial of this right at this time would most probably result in loss to the company, hardly, however, to the extent apprehended by the lear\u00f1ed judge, of driving it out of business. But these facts alone can create no equity in the defendants. They can avail to this end only as it is shown that the plaintiff was guilty of such negligence, in failing to assert its adverse title to the exclusive use of the name, as to lead the defendants into a mistaken belief, and that in making their expenditure defendants acted upon such mistaken belief to their prejudice. Open, affirmative encouragement on the part of the plaintiff is not pretended; encouragement by silence is what is relied upon. But what was there in the situation that imposed' on the plaintiff any duty to speak out. It was an established corporation, doing an extensive business, employing the name of Portuondo, not only in its corporate title, but on the several brands of its manufactured product. All this must have been known to the defendants who were proposing to establish a like business in the same city, through a corporation to be chartered in a foreign state, under a corporate title which would give marked prominence to the name Portuondo. Plainly here was duty resting on the defendants to make inquiry as to their rights with respect to a name thus publicly and widely employed by another. \u00a5e find no corresponding duty resting on plaintiff to give warning to the defendant, for the sufficient reason, if for no other, that it does not appear, certainly there is no finding to that effect, that plaintiff had any knowledge of the contract between defendants and Yicente Portuondo until after it had been formally executed, or any knowledge of defendants\u2019 purpose to purchase the stock of Yicente, or to establish a rival. corporation with title liable to be confused with its own. Not only was there no duty on plaintiff to speak out any more distinctly than it was doing through the fact of its incorporation, but no opportunity was afforded it. Besides, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>is very evident that this silence on the part of the plaintiff was not at all considered by the defendants, and in no wise induced their action. Having discussed these equitable considerations which influenced the court to deny the plaintiff the full measure of relief it asked, and having concluded that too much weight was given them, we might rest the case here; but it presents a feature which seems to have been overlooked, and which, because to our mind it outweighs every consideration of the prejudice that would result to defendant from a restraining decree, calls for some reference. Briefly, it is this,\u2014 the use by the defendant company of the name Portuondo is consistent with no honest purpose that we can discover. Defendants rest their right to the use of it on their contract with Vicente, now deceased. That contract did not introduce him as a party in the proposed business enterprise, nor did it pretend to do more than give to the defendants the right to use the ndme Portuondo in the corporate title. It gave to the defendants no trade secret, nothing that would require or enable them to manufacture for the market a product corresponding in peculiar quality to the cigar made by Vicente Portuondo, and which had given that cigar its special value, and made for it a distinct market. To what end did the defendants desire the name <em>% </em>What that peculiar quality in the Vicente Portuondo cigar was, we of course do not know; but that it characterized and distinguished this cigar from others is manifest from the extent of the public demand for it. The name stood as a pledge for this particular quality so long as Vicente was engaged in the manufacture, and equally a pledge that the cigars bearing his name were of his own manufacture. Neither in the contract, nor in any part of all this voluminous testimony, is there even a suggestion that defendants could produce cigars with this distinguishing quality. And yet they are to-day engaged in marketing a product of their own which the public is given to understand are Portuondo cigars. If the cigars manufactured by them have any claim to be called Portuondo cigars, other than because they are made by a corporation under a corporate name which includes the word Portuondo, we have failed to discover it. The facts are pregnant with suspicion that the purpose in acquiring the name, was to mislead and deceive the public into the belief that the cigars made by the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>were made, if not under the supervision of Yicente Portuondo, at least after a formula adopted and used by him, and to which the company had succeeded. In this connection it is to be borne in mind that the doctrine of estoppel is only applied to promote justice and fair dealing; never to aid a fraudulent purpose.' Before defendants would be entitled to any benefit whatever of this doctrine to save them from loss, they would at least have to acquit themselves of the suspicion of fraudulent purpose which their transactions naturally excite. Apart from the circumstance here considered, our conclusions as to the equities 6f the case would be the same. We have referred to it only as a matter calling for at least equal consideration with those relied upon by the court. In our judgment it makes largely against the defendants in any attempt to balance the equities between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">For the reasons stated in the opinion the appeal of the defendants to No. 397, January Term, 1907, is dismissed at the cost of appellants.
