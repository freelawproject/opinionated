He saw the engine backing a train of freight cars slowly over the crossing from east to west. He ran on the east side of the public road and reached the railroad track as the engine was passing. He placed his right foot on the step, caught the hand hold, and as he placed his left foot to the floor, he was struck by the defendant\u2019s car from which he had alighted. He at no time stepped on the track of the defendant company. There was ample evidence of the negligence of the motorman in allowing his car to collide with the engine. <em>Held, </em>that as the plaintiff did not step on defendant\u2019s track, but was carried there while on the engine, and as he had safely passed the pueril of getting on a moving engine, there was no causal connection between his negligence in getting on the moving engine and his injury, and the case was for the jury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-9\"><em>Negligence </em>\u2014 Damages\u2014Length <em>of life </em>\u2014 Charge <em>of court.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-10\">Where in a negligence case the jury is distinctly told that they could allow only the present worth of plaintiff\u2019s earning power \u201cfrom the time he reached twenty-one years for and during the remainder of his probable natural life,\u201d a judgment for the plaintiff will not be reversed because the court referred in a cautionary way, in view of argument ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>vaneed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to the jury taking \u201cinto consideration the probability of the young man living to the allotted time of three score years and ten.\u201d</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b615-3\">Argued Oct. 14, 1908.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A70g\">Appeal, Nos. 130 and 131, Oct.

Now this is a fact for you to determine. You will look at the young man\u2019s testimony. He said that he didn\u2019t look for the car as he ran down to board this engine, that he did not know where it was, except that he left it and came down along the track to board the locomotive.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-8\">[As we said to you before, when you come to consider the compensation for loss of earning power, there are many contingencies that naturally enter into the determination of this question.

Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The plaintiff was employed as an inspector of air brakes at the yard of the Pennsylvania Company at Conway, on the line of the defendant's street railway. He lived with his parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>near the line of the Ohio River Junction Railroad, whose track crossed that of the defendant at grade at Crow\u2019s Run. This railroad is seven miles in length and is used mainly to transfer freight cars to and from factories to the tracks of another road. It has no passenger cars, stations or regular stopping places, but its trains are stopped or slowed to enable passengers to get on or off at any point on the road. Passengers ride in the cab of the engine or on the tender, and get on and off at a step at the back of the engine. The plaintiff in going to and returning from his work used both roads, changing from one to the other at Crow\u2019s Run.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">On the evening when he was injured, he came from Conway to Crow\u2019s Run on the defendant\u2019s car and got off at the rear platform after the car had stopped at a waiting room 200 feet from the crossing. He saw an engine backing a train of freight cars slowly over the crossing from east to west. He ran on the east side of the public road and reached the railroad track as the engine was passing. He placed his right foot on the step, caught the hand hold, and as he placed his left foot on the floor of the cab or was in the act of raising it to the floor, he was struck by the defendant\u2019s car from which he had alighted. He at no time stepped on the track of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">There was ample evidence of the negligence of the motorman in allowing his car to collide with the engine. The question to be considered is whether the case should have been withdrawn from the jury on the ground of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. On the facts, the turning point of the case in the plaintiff\u2019s favor is that he did not step on the defendant\u2019s track. He was carried there while on the engine. He had safely passed the peril of getting on a moving engine and his negligence in that regard was not the cause of his injury, although a circumstance that made it possible. But against such a possibility he was under no duty to guard because he had no reason to apprehend danger from the defendant\u2019s car when on the engine. There was no causal connection between his negligence and his injury. The case is governed by the principles stated in Boulfrois v. Traction Co., 210 Pa. 263, and Besecker v. Railroad Co., 220 Pa. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>A part of the charge relating to the compensation for the loss of earning power is assigned for error. The learned judge in calling the attention of the jury to matters to be taken into consideration in arriving at a conclusion on the amount of compensation spoke of the probability of the plaintiff\u2019s improving, of his being able to perform other kinds of work, and of his \u201cliving out the allotted time of three score years and ten.\u201d The general instruction on the subject was accurate and thorough, and the jury were distinctly told that they could allow only the present worth of earning power \u201c from the time he reached twenty-one years for and during the remainder of his probable natural life.\u201d The language quoted was no doubt suggested by the argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that seventy years was the proper period to fix. There was not, as in Dooner v. Canal Co., 164 Pa. 17, the statement of a rule not founded on evidence to be followed by the jury, but rather a caution, in view of the argument advanced, to consider the probabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
