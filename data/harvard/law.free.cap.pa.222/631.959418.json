Before Taylor, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-13\">At the trial when Osman McCarty, a witness for the plaintiff, was on the stand, he was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-14\">\u201cQ. Mr. McCarty, where do you live? A. I live in Millsboro. Q. And do you know the Hamory property? A. Yes, sir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Q. Are you in business in Millsboro, Mr. McCarty? A. Yes, sir. Q. How long have you known the Hamory property? A. I have known it ever since I have been in Millsboro, about twenty years. Q. Mr. McCarty, have you such a knowledge of the value of real estate- in that neighborhood that would enable you to express an opinion as to the fair market value of the Hamory property in the fall of 1905, before the railroad went through there? A. I think so. Q. What was its value?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXa\">Mr. Irwin: I want here to ask the witness a few questions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ax9\">Preliminary cross-examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-4\">Mr. Irwin: \u201cQ. Mr. McCarty, have you made up your estimate of what that property was worth just before the railroad was located by estimating what it would bring if it had been laid out in building lots and all the lots had been sold at what you think lots were worth there? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\">The defendant objects to the witness expressing his opinion as to the market value of the property immediately before the location of the railroad, for the reason that he has stated that that opinion was formed by estimating the number of- lots in the Hamory land, and what it would bring if all the lots were sold at what the witness regards as a fair value of the lots, which is not the proper way to estimate the market value of the Hamory property as a whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-6\">The Court: Well, we had better have this question settled now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-7\">Mr. Birch: I will ask the witness one question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-8\">\u201cQ. What is the most available purpose that that lot is fit for? A. For building purposes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-9\">The Court: Where they ask a witness if he is able to express an opinion as to the fair market value of the property as a whole, where he says he knows it, it is no matter by what method he makes up that estimate, if it is based on the market value in his judgment; the weight of his opinion will be for the jury. The objection is overruled and the offer admitted and a bill sealed for the defendant.

What in your opinion, Mr. McCarty, was the fair market value of that property immediately before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>railroad took it? A. About $25,000. Q. Hav\u00e9 you seen the railroad, how it affects it through there? A. Yes, sir; I see what \u2014 Q. What effect does it have on the property? A. Well, I would think it would depreciate the value of the property nearly the one-half.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $8,400.

The witness having answered in the affirmative, objection was made that he was not qualified to express an opinion, because his method of estimating the market value of the whole tract was improper and not in accordance with the rule of law governing such cases. The court admitted the testimony and this ruling is the basis of the only assignment of error. While it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>proper to take into consideration the use to which the land is best adapted, it is improper to determine the value of the whole tract by computing the number of lots it could be divided into, what each lot was worth, and the value of the whole tract estimated on this basis. This is not a proper method of arriving at the value of the whole tract as has been repeatedly ruled by this court: Penna. Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company v. Cleary, 125 Pa. 442; Gorgas v. Railroad Company, 215 Pa. 501. Nor was this error corrected by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury. Where evidence has been improperly admitted which tends to prejudice the minds of the jurors, the error is not cured by an instruction in the charge to disregard it or to withdraw it from their consideration: Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v. Barnes, 31 Pa. 193; Penna. Railroad Co. v. Butler, 57 Pa. 335; Huntingdon, etc., Railroad &amp; Coal Co. v. Decker, 82 Pa. 119; Erie, etc., Railroad Co. v. Smith, 125 Pa. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Assignment of error sustained and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
