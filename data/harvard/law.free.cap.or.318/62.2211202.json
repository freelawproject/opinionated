On statewide measures, the Attorney General must prepare the ballot title before signatures on initiative petitions may be collected. ORS 250.065 and 250.067. Persons who have voiced objections to the Secretary of State and remain dissatisfied with a ballot title certified by the Attorney General may seek a different ballot title from the Supreme Court if the ballot title certified by the Attorney General does not substantially comply with ORS 250.035 and 250.039.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 250.085(2). Petitioners separately filed petitions in this court concerning a proposed initiative, asserting that the ballot title certified by the Attorney General does not comply with ORS 250.035.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cases were consolidated for argument and opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">ORS 250.035(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cThe ballot title of any measure to be initiated or referred shall consist of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201c (a) A caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201c(b) A question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\u201c(c) A concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In order to decide whether the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title meets the requirements of ORS 250.035, it is necessary to examine the proposed initiative. The proposed initiative reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>\u201cTHE MINORITY STATUS AND CHILD PROTECTION ACT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201cAN ACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201cBe It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cThe Constitution of the State of Oregon is amended by creating a new section to be added to and made a part of Article 1. The new section shall be known as \u2018The Minority Status and Child Protection Act II\u2019 and will read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201cSection 41: THE SUBJECT, CHIEF PURPOSE AND MAJOR EFFECT OF THIS MEASURE IS TO PROHIBIT MINORITY STATUS BASED ON HOMOSEXUALITY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201c (1) Asa Right of Conscience, moral objection to the granting of minority status to, expressing approval of, or the promotion of homosexuality shall not be considered in law or by any government entity to be discrimination relating to civil rights. Wrongful sexual behavior does not form an appropriate basis upon which to construct a minority or class status relating to civil rights. To identify oneself as a person who participates in or has a preference for wrongful sexual behavior, such as homosexuality, fails to constitute a legitimate minority status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">\u201c(2) In the State of Oregon, including all political subdivisions and government units, minority status shall not apply to homosexuality; therefore, affirmative action, quotas, special class status or special classifications such as \u2018sexual orientation,\u2019 \u2018domestic partnerships\u2019 or similar designations shall not be established on the basis of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\u201c(3) Children, students and employees shall not be advised, instructed or taught by any government agency, department or political unit in the State of Oregon that homosexuality is the legal or social equivalent of race, color, religion, gender, age or national origin; nor shall public funds be expended in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>manner that has the purpose or effect of promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\u201c(a) The State of Oregon, political subdivisions and all units of state and local government shall not grant marital status or spousal benefits on the basis of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201c(b) The State of Oregon, political subdivisions and all units of state and local government, with regard to public employees, shall generally consider private lawful sexual behaviors as non-job related factors, provided such factors do not disrupt the work place and that such consideration does not violate subsection (1), (2) and (3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">\u201c(c) Though subsections (1), (2) and (3) are established and in effect, no unit of state or local government shall deny to private persons business licenses, permits or services otherwise due under existing statutes; nor deprive, nullify, or diminish the holding or exercise of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Oregon or the Constitution of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201c(d) Though subsections (1), (2) and (3) are established and in effect, this section shall not limit the availability in public libraries of books and materials written for adults which address homosexuality, provided access to such materials is limited to adults and meets local standards as established through the existing library review process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201c(4) In compliance with Article I Section 20 of this Constitution no citizen or group of citizens constituted as having a minority status relating to civil rights shall be afforded privileges, immunities or preferential treatment, which upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u201c(5) Any person residing in Oregon or non-profit entity doing business in Oregon has standing to bring suit to enforce this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201c (6) The PEOPLE INTEND, that if any part of this enactment be found unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall survive in full force and effect. This Section shall be in all parts self-executing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The issue before us is whether the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title substantially complies with ORS 250.035 (1)(a), (b), and (c). ORS 250.085(2). We discuss the Caption, Question, and Summary in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The Caption must reasonably identify the subject of the measure in 10 words or less. ORS 250.035(l)(a). This court has held that ORS 250.035(l)(a) \u201crequires only <em>identification </em>of the subject matter of the measure; it should not be * * * a vehicle for conclusions about how a measure may affect legal rights and duties.\u201d <em>Bauman v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 490, 494, 789 P2d 258 (1990) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">This measure touches on a number of facets of governmental power in relation to homosexuality. Among its provisions, the measure states, in section (1), that homosexuality is \u201c[wjrongful sexual behavior.\u201d In its other sections, the measure forbids governments from establishing \u201caffirmative action, quotas, special class status or special classifications * * * on the basis of homosexuality\u201d (section (2)), from teaching that homosexuality is \u201cthe legal or social equivalent of race, color, religion, gender, age or national origin\u201d (section (3)), and from using public funds to promote or approve homosexuality (section (3)). From the text and context of the measure, we believe that the most significant aim of the measure is that of <em>prohibiting </em>governments from passing laws that create any protected status based on homosexuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s Caption reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: ALLOWS ANTI-HOMOSEXUAL LAWS; BARS HOMOSEXUAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The Attorney General\u2019s Caption does not reasonably identify the subject of the measure and, therefore, does not comply with ORS 250.035(1)(a). A main thrust of the initiative is to <em>forbid </em>governments from <em>passing </em>laws that establish legally protected homosexuality classifications; it is <em>not </em>a main thrust to allow the passage of \u201canti-homosexual laws.\u201d Thus, the phrase, \u201callows anti-homosexual laws,\u201d does not substantially comply with ORS 250.035(1). Another part of the measure forbids governments from teaching that homosexuality is like statuses such as race, gender, and religion. Because of the 10-word limitation of ORS 250.035(1)(a), it is impossible to capture all those concepts in the Caption. We therefore have modified the proposed Caption to refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>proposed measure\u2019s dominant concepts, <em>viz., </em>declaring homosexuality to be wrongful sexual behavior and prohibiting government from establishing any legally protected status based on homosexuality. The Caption that we approve reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION.</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">DECLARES HOMOSEXUALITY WRONGFUL. FORBIDS HOMOSEXUALITY AS PROTECTED STATUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We now turn to the Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">ORS 250.035(l)(b) requires a Question of not more than 20 words that \u201cplainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure.\u201d <em>Deras v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 410, 417, 788 P2d 987 (1990), instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">\u201cThe Question must plainly phrase the \u2018chief purpose\u2019 of the measure in not more than twenty words so that an affirmative response to the Question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure. ORS 250.035(l)(b). The chief purpose of a measure is the most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to bring about. The chief purpose requirement is determined in a manner analogous to legislative determination. The proposed measure is reviewed for its unambiguous language and the context in which it was drafted and for statements made by its sponsors. Context includes the legal context, as well as the more particular circumstances under which a measure is drafted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">When a measure has more than one apparent purpose, the statute requires the Question to include \u201cthe most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to bring about.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Attorney General\u2019s Question reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall constitution allow laws denying homosexuals rights, bar homosexual civil rights laws, prevent spending public funds in manner promoting homosexuality?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">For reasons similar to those discussed above concerning the Caption, the Question in part fails to comply with ORS 250.035(l)(b). The major goals that this measure aims to achieve are to declare homosexuality to be wrongful sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>behavior and to <em>forbid </em>governments from passing laws establishing classifications that grant \u201cspecial class status or special classifications\u201d based on homosexuality. Allowing governments to pass laws <em>denying </em>rights to homosexuals is not a major goal. It follows that the first clause of the Attorney General\u2019s Question \u2014 \u201cShall constitution allow laws denying homosexuals rights\u201d \u2014 does not comply with ORS 250.035(1)(b). The focus of the Question should include the declaration that homosexuality is wrongful sexual behavior and the limitation placed on governments that they cannot establish any protected status or classification based on homosexuality. We therefore revise the Question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">QUESTION: Shall constitution declare homosexuality wrongful sexual behavior, forbid laws establishing homosexuality as protected status, prohibit public spending promoting, approving homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We turn to the Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">THE SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The Summary is to be a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d ORS 250.035(1)(e). This measure has a number of provisions, and it is possible to include most of them in the Summary. The Attorney General\u2019s Summary provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends constitution. Allows laws that deny homosexuals rights. Governments cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u2014 adopt homosexual civil rights laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u2014 grant \u2018minority status\u2019 for persons who practice or prefer \u2018wrongful\u2019 sexual behavior, including homosexuality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\u2014 advise or teach children, students, employees that homosexuality equates legally or socially with race, other protected classifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">\u2014 spend public funds in manner promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">\u201cGovernment nonetheless cannot deny constitutional rights, or licenses, permits or services due under existing statutes. Public employees\u2019 private lawful sexual behaviors disrupting workplace may justify discipline. Other changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The words \u201c[a]llows laws that deny homosexuals rights\u201d do not substantially comply with ORS 250.035(1) for the reasons set forth above. We also can fold into one statement the concepts that are contained in the first six lines of the Attorney General\u2019s title and thereby include more of the salient provisions of the measure in the Summary. We adopt this Summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution. Declares homosexuality wrongful sexual behavior. Governments cannot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u2014 Establish homosexuality as legally protected status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u2014 Advise or teach children, students, employees that homosexuality equates legally or socially with race, other protected classifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u2014 spend public funds to promote, express approval of homosexuality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">With access limited to adults, public libraries can have adult books about homosexuality. Provided workplace is not disrupted, public employees\u2019 lawful sexual behaviors are not considered work related. Governments nonetheless cannot deny constitutional rights, permits or services due under constitution, existing statutes. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">ORS 250.035(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">\u201cThe ballot title shall not resemble, so far as probably to create confusion, any title previously filed for a measure to be submitted at that election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Because of that statute, we note a similar initiative measure, involved in <em>Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or 406, 856 P2d 1023 (1993). That measure is identical to the measure before us, except for sections (1), (4), and (5) of this measure, which are new. In <em>Mabon, </em>we revised the ballot title. Because of the similarities in the measures, the ballot title that we approve here necessarily has some similarities to the ballot title approved in <em>Mabon. </em>But the differences in the two ballot titles are sufficient to avoid confusion between the two measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">We certify the following ballot title for the proposed initiative measure:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">DECLARES HOMOSEXUALITY WRONGFUL.</p>\n<p id=\"ANo\">FORBIDS HOMOSEXUALITY AS PROTECTED STATUS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>QUESTION: Shall constitution declare homosexuality wrongful sexual behavior, forbid laws establishing homosexuality as protected status, prohibit public spending promoting, approving homosexuality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution.
