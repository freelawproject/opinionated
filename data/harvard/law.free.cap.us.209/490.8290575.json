The Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Company to the state court, from whence it came.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfJV\">The facts are these: On November 16, 1906, Albert Newton Moore, an infant, over the age of fourteen years, presented his petition to the Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, stating that he desired to institute a suit in that court against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, and praying for the appointment of a next friend, whereupon George Safford, of St.. Louis, was duly appointed such next friend. Thereupon a petition was filed in said state court in the name of Moore, by his next friend, i against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company; to recover damages for personal injuries. After service of summons, but before answer was due, the railroad company filed its application for removal to the Circuit Court of the United. States for the Eastern Division of the Eastern Judicial District of Missouri. This application for removal was based on the. ground of diverse citizenship, and. alleged that the plaintiff Moore was a citizen and resident of the State of Illinois; that Safford, the next friend, was a resident and citizen of the State of Missouri, and the defendant, a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of Kentucky and a citizen and resident of that State. The petition and bond were in due form, and the case was transferred to the United States Circuit Court. Thereafter, and on March 22, 1907, the. plaintiff filed in that court an amended petition. On March- 25, by stipulation of the parties, the defendant was given time to plead to the plaintiff\u2019s amended petition. . Three or four times thereafter stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>lations for continuances were entered into by the counsel for both sides. At the September term, 1907, a motion to remand, made by the plaintiff, was overruled, and a subsequent application to reconsider this ruling was also overruled. Thereupon this application for mandamus was presented.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-4\"><em>Mr. Thomas T.

S. 449, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201cUnder sections 1, 2, 3 of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, as amended by the act of March 1, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by the act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, an action commenced in a state court, by a citizen of another State, against a non-resident defendant, who is a citizen of a State other than that of the plaintiff, cannot be removed by the defendant into the Circuit Court of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On the authority of this case it is contended by petitioner that as in this action none of the parties were citizens of the. State of Missouri, it could not be removed by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>into the Circuit Court of the United States, and that upon the failure of the United _ States Circuit Court to remand the case to the state court in which it was originally brought mandamus from this court is an appropriate remedy. But in that case the plaintiff never consented to accept the jurisdiction of the United States court, while in this case it is contended that both parties did so consent, and that therefore the decision in that case.is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">This brings up two questions, first, whether both parties did consent to accept the jurisdiction of the United States court; and, second, if they did, what effect such consent had upon the jurisdiction of the United States court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">That the defendant consented to accept the jurisdiction of the United States court is obvious. It filed a petition for removal from the State to the United States court. No clearer expression of its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the latter court could be had. After the removal the plaintiff, instead of challenging the jurisdiction of the United States court by a motion to remand, filed an amended petition in that court, signed a stipulation giving time to the defendant to answer; and then both parties entered into successive stipulations for a continuance of the trial in that court. Thereby the plaintiff consented to accept the jurisdiction of the United States court, and was willing that his controversy with the defendant should be settled by a trial in that court. The mere filing of an amended petition was an appeal to that court for a trial upon the facts averred by him as they might be controverted by the defendant. And this, as we have seen, was followed by repeated recognitions of the jurisdiction of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">That a next friend may select the tribunal in- which the suit shall be brought is clear. While he may do nothing prejudicial \u2022 to the substantial rights of the minor, yet the mere selection of one out of many tribunals having jurisdiction cannot' be considered as an act to the latter\u2019s prejudice. Certainly the election to accept the jurisdiction of a court of the United States is not an act prejudicial to substantial rights. In Kings-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>bury </em>v. <em>Buckner, </em>134 U. S. 650, where the next friend consented that a case on a writ of error might be heard in some other grand division of the Supreme Court of Illinois than the one in which it was decided, and at a term of that court earlier than such writ of error could ordinarily be heard, and also waived the execution of an appeal bond by the opposite party, it was held that the infant was bound by such action, the court saying (p. 680):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cNow it is contended that the Supreme Court of the State, sitting in the Central Grand Division/ could not, except by consent, entertain jurisdiction of those appeals, and that the next friend and guardian <em>ad litem </em>was incapable/in law, of giving such consent. It is undoubtedly the rule in Illinois, as elsewhere, that a next friend or guardian <em>ad litem </em>cannot, by admissions or stipulations, surrender the rights of the infant. The court, whose duty it is to protect'the interests of the infant, should see to it that they are not bargained away by those assuming or appointed to represent him. But this rule does not prevent a guardian <em>ad litem </em>or <em>prochein amy </em>from assenting to such arrangements as will facilitate the determination of the case in which the rights of the infant are involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Again, in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Maxwell Land Grant Company, </em>168 U. S. 451, where the question was whether the infant was bound by a consent decree, it wras said (p. 462):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cThat infants are bound by a consent decree is affirmed by the authorities, and this notwithstanding that it does not appear that a prior inquiry was made by the court as to whether it was for their benefit. In 1 Dan. Ch. PI. &amp; Pr. 163, it is said: \u2018Although the court usually will not, where infants are concerned, make a decree by consent, without an inquiry whether it is for their benefit, yet when once a decree has been pronounced without that previous step, it is considered as of the same authority as if such an inquiry had been directed, and a certificate thereupon made that it would be for their benefit.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">a# tU tj. \u2022\u00cd* \u00abJ\u00bb ^ \u00abI* \u00abJ\u00bb <em>7fi</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201cIn <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>116 Massachusetts, 377, a decree had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>been entered as follows: \u2018And the plaintiff and the defendants, . . .

In that case it was held that the next friend was the party to make application and affidavit for a change of venue from one state court to another, and the court said (p. 514):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cSection 2261, Revised Statutes 1889, requires the application and affidavits to be made by the party, and it has been held that this means the party in his own person and not by agent or attorney. <em>Squire </em>v. <em>Chillicothe, </em>89 Missouri, 226. But it has never been decided in case of an infant suing by his next friend that the application cannot be made by the next friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">-\u201cA next friend is neither the agent nor attorney for his ward. An agent or attorney derives his- authority as such from his principal, but an infant cannot appoint an agent and empower him to do an act which in contemplation of law he is himself incapable of doing. The next friend does not derive his authority from the infant, and his office does not rest on such authority, either express or implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">o* j. \u00abi* \u00bfJ\u00bb ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cIt is because the law regards an infant incapable of conducting a law suit in his own behalf that it has made provisions for the appointment of a next friend to act for him. The next friend derives his authority from the court which appoints him, and as he is appointed to institute and conduct the suit it follows that he has authority to do every act which the interest of the infant demands and the law authorizes. If this, statute is to be considered so strictly as to deny the next friend the authority to make an application for a change of venue, then we necessarily deny to infants who are unable to act for themselves the equal protection with other litigants that the statute was designed to afford. Not only would this be rank injustice to a class- for whose interests the law has always been watchful, but it would raise a serious question as to the validity of the statute itself. . . .

Ill, \u00a7 2, provides that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies \u201cbetween citizens of different States.\u201d Section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 78) granted to the Circuit Courts original cognizance \u201cof all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity . . . where the suit is between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State,\u201d and added: \u201cAnd no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts (Circuit or District) against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.\u201d Section 12 (p. 79) provided \u201cthat if a suit be commenced in any state court ... by a citizen of the State in which the suit is brought against a citizen of another State,\u201d a removal might be had of the case to the next Circuit Court to be held in the district where the suit is pending.' The first section of the act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, like the Judiciary Act, invested the Circuit Courts of the United States with original cognizance of suits in which there is a controversy between citizen's of different States, provided that no civil suit should be brought before either of said courts (Circuit or District) against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant,\u2018and. closed with these words, \u201cbut where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d The second sentence of \u00a7 2 prescribed, in respect to removals, that \u201cany other suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, of which the Circuit Courts of the United States are given jurisdiction by the preceding section, and which are now pending, or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed into the Circuit Courts of the United States for the proper district by the defendant or defendants therein, being non-residents of that State.\u201d It will thus be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>seen that by both the act of 1789 and that of 1888 there is a general grant to Circuit Courts of jurisdiction over controversies between citizens of different States, and in each of them there is a limitation as to the district in which the action must be brought. In the light of this similarity between these two acts must the second question be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The contention is that as this action could not have been originally brought in. the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri by reason of the last provision quoted from \u00a7 1, it cannot under \u00a7 2 be removed to that court, as the authorized removal is only of those cases of which by the prior section original jurisdiction is given to the' United States Circuit Courts. But this ignores the distinction between the general description of the jurisdiction of the United States courts and the clause naming the particular district in which an action must be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">It may be well to examine the authorities touching this matter. In <em>Gracie </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Wheat. 699, the court, by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cThe exemption from arrest in a district in which the defendant was not an inhabitant, or in which he was not found at the time of serving the process, was the privilege of the defendant, which he might waive by a voluntary appearance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>12 Pet. 300, 330, Mr. Justice Barbour thus stated the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cNow, if the case were one of a want of jurisdiction in .the court, it would not, according to well-established principles, be competent for the parties, by any act of theirs, to give it. But that is not the case. The court had jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in dispute; the objection was, that the party defendant, not being an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, nor found therein, personal process could not reach him; and that the process of attachment could only be properly issued against a party under circumstances which subjected him to process <em>in personam. </em>Now this was a personal privilege or exemption, which it was competent for the party to waive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>4 Cranch, 421; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Foyles, </em>1 Pet. 311.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In <em>Ex parte Schollenberger, </em>96 U.

It is rather in the nature of a personal exemption in favor of a defendant, and it is one which he may waive.

If it (the exemption) had been claimed by the defendant when appearing in the Superior Court of Cleveland County, it must have been recognized. The defendant did not, however, choose to claim immunity from suit in that court. It made defense upon the merits, and, having been unsuccessful, prosecuted a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State, and in the latter tribunal, for the first time, claimed the immunity granted to it by Congress. This was too late. . . . Wo are of opinion that its exemption from suits in other courts of the same State was a personal privilege that it could waive, and which, in this case, the defendant did waive, by appearing and making defense without claiming the immunity granted by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">In <em>McCormick Harvesting Machine Company </em>v. <em>Walthers, </em>134 U. S. 41, 43, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, quoting the provisions of \u00a7 1 of the act of 1888, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201cThe jurisdiction common to all Circuit Courts of the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ted States in respect to the subject-matter of the suit and the character of the parties who might sustain suits in those courts is described in the section, while the foregoing clause [the last clause in the section] relates to' the district in which a suit may be originally brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>St. Louis &amp;c.

But the defendant company did not choose to plead that provision of the statute, but entered a general appearance and joined with the complainant in its prayer for the appointment of a receiver, and thus was brought within the ruling of this court, so frequently made, that the exemption from being sued out of the district of its domicil is a personal privilege which may be waived, and which is waived by pleading to the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">In <em>Martin\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, </em>151 U.

But the direction as to the time of filing the petition is more analogous to the direction that a civil suit within the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States shall bo brought in a certain district, a non-compliance with which is waived by a defendant who does not seasonably object that the suit is brought in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>wrong district. <em>Grade </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Wheat. 699; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Longworth, </em>14 Pet. 172, 174; <em>St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>141 U.

Section 2, however, refers to the first part of section 1, by which jurisdiction is conferred, and not to the clause relating to the district in which suit may be brought. <em>McCormick Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Walthers, </em>134 U.

S. 217, 219, Mr. Justice Gray thus stated the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cDiversity of citizenship is a condition of jurisdiction, and, when that does not appear upon the record, the court, of its own motion, will order the action to be dismissed. .But the provision as to the particular district in which the action shall be brought does not touch the general jurisdiction of the court over such a cause between such parties; but affects only the proceedings taken to bring the defendant within such jurisdiction, and is a matter of personal privilege, which the defendant may insist upon, or may waive, at his election; and the defendant\u2019s right to object that an action, within the general jurisdiction of the court, is brought in the wrong district, is waived by entering a general appearance, without taking the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In <em>Ex parte Wisner, supra, </em>Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to <em>St. Louis &amp;c. Railway Company </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>141 U. S. 127, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">\u201cAs the defendant appeared and pleaded to the merits, he thereby waived his right to challenge thereafter the jurisdiction of the court over him on the ground that the suit had been brought in the wrong district. And there are many other cases to the same effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Several other cases in this court, as well as many in the Circuit Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeal, might be noticed, in which a similar ruling as to the effect of a waiver was announced. It is true that in most of the cases the waiver was by the defendant, but the. reasoning by which a defendant is precluded by a waiver from insisting upon any objection to the particular United States court in which the action was brought compels the same conclusion as to the effect of a waiver by the plaintiff of his right to challenge that jurisdiction in case of a removal. As held in <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Columbia Saving &amp; Loan Association, </em>191 U. S. 78, a petition and bond for removal are in the nature of process. They constitute the process by which the case is transferred from the state to the Federal court, and if when the defendant is brought into a Federal court by the. service of original process he can waive the objection to the particular court in which the suit is brought, clearly the plaintiff, when brought into the Federal court by the process of removal, may in like manner waive his objection to that court. So long as diverse citizenship exists the Circuit Courts of the United States have a general jurisdiction. That jurisdiction may be invoked in an action originally brought in a Circuit Court or one subsequently removed from a state court, and if any objection arises to the particular court which does not run to the Circuit Courts as a class that objection may be waived by the party entitled to make it. As 0we have seen in this case, the defendant applied for a removal of the case to the Federal court. Thereby he is foreclosed from objecting to its jurisdiction. In like manner, after the removal had been ordered, the plaintiff elected to remain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>that court, and he is, equally with the defendant, precluded from making objection to its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Special reliance is placed by petitioner upon this statement in the <em>Wisner case </em>(p. 460):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201cBut it is contended that Beardsley was entitled to remove the case to the Circuit Court, and as by his petition for removal he waived the objection so far as he was personally concerned that he was not sued in his district, hence that the Circuit Court obtained jurisdiction over the suit. This does not follow, inasmuch as in view of the intention of Congress by the act of 1887 to contract the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, and of the limitations imposed thereby, jurisdiction of the suit could not have obtained, even with the consent of both parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It is said that here is a distinct declaration that \u201cjurisdiction of the suit could not have obtained, even with the consent of both parties.\u201d There was no pretense of any consent on the part of the plaintiff in that c\u00e1se, and therefore this statement was unnecessary. In order, however, to prevent future misconception we add that nothing in the opinion in the <em>Wisner case </em>is to be regarded as changing the rule as to the effect of a waiver in .respect to a particular court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">It may not be amiss to note that in several of the Circuit Courts and Courts of Appeal the <em>Wisner case </em>has\u2019 been considered, and in all held that no change was intended by it. <em>Corwin M. Company </em>v. <em>Henrici Washer Company, </em>opinion by Lowell, Circuit Judge, 151 Fed. Rep. 938; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>155 Fed. Rep. 68, Circuit Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit), opinion by Lurton, Circuit Judge; <em>Shanburg </em>v. <em>F. &amp; C. Co., </em>Circuit Court of Appeals (Eighth Circuit), opinion by Riner, District Judge; <em>McPhee &amp; McGinnity Company </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. R. Co., </em>Circuit Court of Appeals (Eighth Circuit), opinion by Sanborn, Circuit Judge. These two opinions are not yet published.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We might also refer to the several text books in which is affirmed the general doctrine of the effect of the waiver of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>objection to a particular court in which the suit has been brought or to which it has been removed. We have made these many quotations and references, not simply to establish the doctrine itself, but to emphasize the widespread injurious results which may be expected to follow from now enforcing a different rule; for, if in a case between citizens of different States, of which the Circuit Courts of the United States are given general jurisdiction, an objection to the jurisdiction of .a particular one of those courts cannot be waived and no consent can give jurisdiction, it is clear that many judgments have* been rendered by those courts in reliance upon such a waiver, which will necessarily be held to be absolutely void, and the litigation must be had over again in some other courts, resulting, possibly, in different decisions f rough the disappearance of witnesses, the loss of testimony, of the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri was settled by the proceedings had by the two parties, and the application for a writ of mandamus is</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-6\">The Chief Justice</author>\n<p id=\"ATz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The right of action was not vested in the next friend and the citizenship of the infant controls. The case is one, therefore, in which the plaintiff was a citizen and resident of the State of Illinois' and the defendant a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of- Kentucky, and a citizen and resident of that State. The action was brought in the Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, of which State neither of the parties was a citizen. The fact that the next .friend, who also acted as attorney-at-law for the minor, was a citizen of Missouri, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The question is whether, where neither of the parties is a citizen of the State in which the action is, brought, the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>diction of the Circuit Court can be maintained if both parties consent to it. Jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts depends upon some act of Congress, <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Fain, </em>195 U. S. 165, 167; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>4 Dall. 8, 10; <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 Cranch, 504, 506; and I quote at length from the opinion of Mr. Justice Gray in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Quincy Mining Co., </em>145 U. S. 444, because he therein examines the statutory provisions bearing on the question before us, saying (p. 446): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to be brought in any other district than that whereof the defendant is an inhabitant; and the effect is that 'where the jurisdiction is founded upon-any of the causes mentioned in this section, except the citizenship of the parties, it must be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded solely upon the fact that the parties are citizens of different States, the suit may be brought in the district in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resides.\u2019 <em>McCormick Co. </em>v. <em>Walthers, </em>134 U.

It was held by this court from the beginning that an averment that a party resided within the State or the district in which the suit was brought was not sufficient to support the jurisdiction, because in the common use of words a resident might be a citizen, and therefore it was not stated expressly and beyond ambiguity that he was a citizen of the State, which was the fact on which the jurisdiction depended under the provisions of the Constitution and of the Judiciary Act. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cBy the act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, \u00a7 1, it was enacted that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>in a State containing more than one district, actions not local should \u2018be brought in the district in which the defendant resides,\u2019 or \u2018if there be two or more defendants residing in different districts in the same State,\u2019 then in either district. 11 Stat. 272. The whole purport and effect of that act was not to enlarge, but to restrict and distribute jurisdiction. It applied only to a State containing two or more districts; and directed suits against citizens of such a State to be brought jn that district thereof in which they or cither of them resided. It did not subject defendants to any new liability to be sued \u2019 out of the State of which they were citizens, but simply proscribed in which district of that' State they might be sued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cThese provisions of the acts of. 1789 and 1858 were substantially reenacted in sections 739 and 740 of the Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cThe act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, \u00a7 1, after giving the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of suits \u2018in which .there shall be a controversy between citizens of different States,\u2019 and enlarging their jurisdiction in other respects, substantially reenacted the corresponding provision of the . act of 1789 by providing that no civil suit should be brought \u2018against any person,\u2019 \u2018in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant or in which he shall be found\u2019 at the time of service, with certain exceptions not affecting the matter now under consideration. 18 Stat. 470.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cThe act of 1887, both in its original form and as corrected in 1888, reenacts the rule that no civil suit slip.ll be brought against any person in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, but omits the clause allowing a defendant to be sued in the district where he is found, and adds this clause: \u2018But where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the. action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either -the plaintiff or the defendant.\u2019 24 Stat. 552; 25 Stat. 434.

And it is not conferred on the Circuit Court of the district of neither of them, and cannot be even by consent. If this were not so, as Mr. Justice Harlan said in <em>Bors </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>111 U. S. 255, \u201cit would be in the power of the parties by negligence or design to invest those courts with a jurisdiction expressly denied to them;\u2019\u2019 or where it may also be said, such jurisdiction was not expressly conferred. This view was expressed in <em>Ex parte Wisner, </em>203 U. S. 449, and although it is true that the proposition need not have been there announced, because in that case it was correctly decided that there was not a consent to the jurisdiction by both parties, yet the rule was so laid down, and the result of the opinion in this case is to disapprove of and overrule <em>In re Wisner, </em>so far as that proposition is concerned. And as I adhere to that view I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">But it should be added that this case was brought in a state court and removed by the defendant into the Federal court under the second section of the act of August 13, 1888, which provided \u201c any other suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, of which the Circuit Courts of the United States are given jurisdiction by the preceding section, which are now pending, or which may hereafter be brought in any state court, may be removed into the Circuit Court of the United State's for the proper district by the defendant or defendants therein being non-residents of that State.\u201d And it is settled that.in order to make a suit removable under this part of the act itTnust be one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>which the plaintiff could have brought originally in the United States Circuit Court. The right of removal given to the non-resident defendant or defendants by the second clause of \u00a72, removing the cause from the state court to the United States Circuit Court, is subject to the limitations of that clause that it must be a suit within the jurisdiction of such Circuit Court, and that it must be removed to the proper district, and therefore the act does not authorize him or them to remove it to the United States Circuit Court held in a district wherein that court was not given jurisdiction of the suit removed, or to any other judicial district in which the suit is not pending, as provided in \u00a7 3. Plaintiff brought his suit in a district wherein the defendant could not be sued in the Federal court within the meaning of the act. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Woodland Amusement Company, </em>158 Fed. Rep. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The proper district within the meaning of the second clause of the second section means either of the districts made \u201cproper districts\u201d'by the first section of the act, and when the third section requires the petition to be \u201cfor the removal of such suit into a Circuit Court to be held in the district.where such suit is.pending,\u201d it must have been contemplated that the suit would be pending in a \u201cproper district.\u201d It is plain that the entire act is not to be construed as giving jurisdiction by reason of citizenship to a Circuit Court held in a State of which neither party is a citizen, but, on the contrary, that it restricts the jurisdiction to the district in which one of the parties resides within the State of which he is a citizen,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
