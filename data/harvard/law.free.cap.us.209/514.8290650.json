It was accepted by the constitutional convention of the proposed new State, carried into its constitution and adopted by the people; and when the State was admitted into the Union by the Congress, with the assent of Virginia, it became a completed compact between competent.parties, upon adequate consideration, protected by the Constitution of the United States from impairment by either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\">Whether it was or was not the lawful government of Virginia was a political question. When the House of Representatives admitted the members of Congress from that State and the Senate admitted the senators elected by the legislature of the \u201cRestored State,\u201d and the President recognized that government, as the true government of Virginia, that forever settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>its legality and regularity beyond the power, of judicial review and made valid its acts ab' <em>initio. </em>But for that <em>\u201c </em>Restored State of Virginia,\u201d and- its recognition by the political departments of the Federal- Government, there would have -been no government of Virginia under the Constitution of the United States from April, 1861, to -the close of the war. The ordinance of the \"Wheeling convention of 1861, which was the g\u00e9nesis of\" the State of West Virginia, and the adoption of its constitution, are, from the standpoint of law, as clearly acts of the Commonwealth of Virginia as. if they had taken place in 1851 instead of in 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-4\">An agreement between States, such as this special agreement in respect to the proportion of the debt of Virginia which was to be assumed by the State Of West Virginia, when consented to by Congress, binds the citizens of both States, and. is irrevocable by either party.

Ill, plaintiff\u2019s draft, directs that the master \u201cwill make and return with his report any special or alternative statements of the accounts between the complainant and the defendant in the premises which either may desire him to state or which he may deem to be desirable to present to the ' court.\u201d</p><p id=\"b547-4\">Complainant. objects to par. II, defendant\u2019s draft, on th\u00e9 ground that it seems to lend the sanction of the court in advance to a basis or scheme for the statement of the account, which is not shown by anything as yet in the cause to be either equitable or just.</p><p id=\"b547-5\">Before any such question can be fairly adjudicated, it is necessary that the evidence in the. case be taken and have the aid of its master in collating and thoroughly digesting it.</p><p id=\"b547-6\">There is not enough in the record to enable the court to come to any just or definite conclusion as to the precise scheme which it would be equitable to adppt in stating the account. To do so at this stage of the litigation, would be to decide an important question in the case b\u00e9fore the evidence- is taken. The effect of par. II would be to have the court prejudge the case as to the basis on which the account shall be stated.</p><p id=\"b547-7\">The case is now only submitted for a decree referring it to a master, to state and report to the court the data necessary to enable the court to justly decide it upon its merits.</p><p id=\"b547-8\">If it should then appear that the basis prescribed by the Wheeling ordinance is binding upon the parties, and must be followed as the basis upon which the account shall be made up, that basis would be adopted. But if it should be then-manifest that that arbitrary basis of settlement is not the one on which the account should be stated, because it would, if applied to the facts of the c\u00e1se as they shall appear in the evidence, lead to absolutely unconscionable results and operate to impair the obligation of the contracts by which, the common debt was created, contracts which were and are alike-obligatory upon Virginia and upon West Virginia, or for any other valid reason, then the scheme of settlement indicated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Wheeling ordinance would have to be. discarded, and an equitable basis and scheme of settlement adopted.</p><p id=\"b548-5\">Complainant contends that, while the Wheeling ordinance upon its face, prescribes an absolutely arbitrary basis of settlement, the representatives of Virginia are satisfied that upon a fair, reasonable and just construction of the language of that ordinance, and of the subsequent supplemental enactments, the scheme of settlement therein defined will, when applied to the facts as stated in the bill, and as-it is believed they can be established by proofs, result in fixing the proportion of the debt of Virginia which West Virginia should assume and pay, inclusive of interest, at a very large sum-, though not so large a sum as it would be equitable for West Virginia to pay.</p><p id=\"b548-6\">The debt, a portion of which she was to pay, was an interest-bearing debt. It would be manifestly \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cequitable\u201d that West Virginia should be required to pay interest as well as principal. Indeed, any settlement which does not require that State to pay interest during the long period of her default and refusal to- pay anything, would be not only unjust, and inequitable, but iniquitous.</p><p id=\"b548-7\">West Virginia came into the Union upon the distinct condition expressed in her constitution, that she would- assume an equitable proportion of the common debt of the undivided State, as it existed prior to January 1, 1861, and would provide for the payment of the accruing interest .and the redemption of the principal thereof.</p><p id=\"b548-8\">While it is believed that, upon the facts stated in the bill and accompanying exhibits, and upon the proofs hereafter -to be adduced in support thereof, West Virginia will owe a very large sum, even under the arbitrary scheme of the Wheeling ordinance, we submit that we should not, in the present status of the litigation, be tied down to the terms of that ordinance.</p><p id=\"b548-9\">Another palpable objection to the defendant\u2019s draft is, that it excludes from the account the value of the property, assets, and money which West Virginia has received from the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>monwealth. Upon any basis of just accounting, these items should be brought into the account.</p><p id=\"b549-5\">If the account should be stated on t\u00f1e Dasis of the Wheeling ordinance, these items would manifestly be proper charges against West Virginia. By the terms. of that ordinance, Virginia\u2019s title to, and ownership of, all of the property and assets theretofore belonging to the Commonwealth remain intact.</p><p id=\"b549-6\">By it, West Virginia would acquire no title to any of those assets or of that property. Framed as that ordinance was, by Western Virginians, and arbitrary, and on its face unjust, as were the criteria by which it undertook to provide that West. Virginia\u2019s proportion of the common debt should be computed, its authors were not so conscienceless as to also propose that the new State, after making such an inadequate contribution to its share of a debt which had been chiefly contracted by the votes of the representatives of its people and for their benefit, should also have a share of the property and\u2019 assets of the Commonwealth, free of charge.</p><p id=\"b549-9\">Another objection to the account c\u00e1ll\u00e9d for by defendant\u2019s draft, is that it does not direct any account to be taken ascertaining the amount and proportion of the debt of Virginia on and prior to January 1, 1861, which West Virginia should assume and pay, but contents itself with merely directing the arbitrary and inconsequential accounts defined in par. II, defendant\u2019s draft.</p><p id=\"b549-10\">Complainant\u2019s principal insistance is that defendant\u2019s draft of a decree prejudges the case in advance of a hearing upon the merits, while that tendered for the plaintiff cannot operate to the prejudice of either party, upon any material question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the cause; by this draft the adjudication of these questions being left to await a hearing after the master\u2019s report shall be filed, upon the evidence then fully in the cause.</p><p id=\"b550-4\">\u25a0 The precise accounts called for by par. II, defendant\u2019s draft, will be taken by the master if he shall find it necessary and proper to take them in order to ascertain the amount and proportion of the Virginia debt which West Virginia should pay; and if the master shall for any reason deem it unnecessary to take those accounts, the defendant can, under par. Ill, complainant\u2019s draft, h&amp;ve them stated as special accounts, if she shall be so advised.</p><p id=\"b550-5\">Par. Ill of complainant\u2019s draft is designed to enable each party, or the master, to have alternative, or special statements of the accounts made up on any basis on which either party or the master may deem it proper or desirable that the same shall be stated.</p><p id=\"b550-6\">By having the respective views and contentions of the complainant and the defendant thus presented in contrast in such concrete form, the court, with the assistance of the findings of the master, will be enabled more readily and intelligently to reach adjust conclusion.</p><p id=\"b550-7\">If the inquiries defined in pars. Ill, IV, V and VI, defendant\u2019s draft, have any pertinency to any question in the ease, it must be because of something not yet in the record.</p><p id=\"b550-8\">Complainant objects to them as being unnecessary and irrelevant.</p><p id=\"b550-9\">There is nothing in the cause, or so far as we know out of it, to show that there is- any foundation in fact for the inquiry mentioned in par. Ill, defendant\u2019s draft,, as to whether Virginia has made any other contracts or arrangements with the public creditors, since January 1, 1861, in reference to \u2022the public debt. That inquiry, though harmless, is useless.</p><p id=\"b550-10\">. The accounts provided for in pars. IV and V, defendant\u2019s draft, are not pertinent to any issue in the cause.</p><p id=\"b550-11\">Both relate to the certificates or receipts given by Virginia, to the holders of the' bonds issued by the Commonwealth b.e-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>fore her dismemberment, who have deposited these bonds with her.</p><p id=\"b551-5\">. Those certificates are in the nature of a declaration of trust by Virginia, that she holds said bonds (so far as they have not been funded in the new securities which the Commonwealth has given for about two-thirds of the aggregate amount thereof, principal and interest), for the benefit of the owners of the bonds deposited with her.</p><p id=\"b551-6\">Those transactions cannot in any way affect any question in the cause.</p><p id=\"b551-7\">The only function of those certificates is to show who are now entitled to the bonds which were so deposited with Virginia, and which she holds in her treasury for the benefit of these certificate holders, awaiting a settlement with West Vir-gihia. These inquiries are unnecessary and useless.</p><p id=\"b551-8\">The same objection applies to par. VI, defendant\u2019s draft. That relates to the obligations which were issued by Virginia, as now constituted, in settlement of the two-thirds of the old bonds funded, and payment of which was assumed by her.</p><p id=\"b551-9\">That is a matter with which West Virginia has nothing to do, and which does not affect the rights or obligations of either party in respect to the claims asserted in complainant\u2019s bill.</p><p id=\"b551-11\">West Virginia is not sued here to pay any part of that two-thirds so settled by Virginia. She is sued to have her assume and pay so much of the remaining unfunded third of the common debt of' the undivided State, as may be West Virginia\u2019s equitable portion of the whole of the debt represented by the bonds of the original State. It has never been claimed or suggested that there was any liability on West Virginia beyond said unfunded third of the bonds of the original State which have been funded; or that West Virginia should pay more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>one-third of the bonds issued by Virginia prior to the formation of West Virginia, which have not been funded.</p><p id=\"b552-6\">The liability of West Virginia on account of the common public debt, has sometimes been estimated by Virginia or her representatives at one-third thereof, but never at more than one-third, and Virginia has undertaken to take care of the other two-thirds with which West Virginia has nothing to do.</p><p id=\"b552-7\">It is true, that there are some millions of the debt of the undivided State, which Virginia has paid in full, and holds the obligation's so taken up by her as a claim against the new State, to the extent of West Virginia\u2019s equitable liability for contribution therefor; and the extent of that liability can be ascertained and stated in the account directed by par. II, complainant\u2019s draft.</p><p id=\"b552-8\">There is no occasion for any of the accounts directed by pars. Ill, IV, V and VI, defendant\u2019s draft. If West Virginia wants any of them to be stated, she can have that done as a special statement under par. Ill of complainant\u2019s draft.</p><p id=\"b552-10\">The difference between the two proposed decrees -is radical, and presents to the court a question which in our view is fundamental and which West Virginia contends, - respectfully and very earnestly, should be decided before any reference to a master to state the account between the parties.</p><p id=\"b552-11\">The jurisdiction of the court over this case is settled by the decision overruling the demurrer. We are quite aware that the court has recognized a distinction between suits by private parties in respect of the application of the rules of pleading and of practice, and suits between States. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>13 Peters, 23; <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>14 Peters, 256.</p><p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>West Virginia does not and could not successfully here contest the principles thus laid down, but the principles of equity and the rules of chancery procedure so far as essential to protect the rights of parties litigating in this tribunal will, of course, be substantially enforced. The application of some of the rules of procedure are certainly essential to substantial justice. 2 Bates, Fed. Eq. Pro. 802, \u00a7 753.</p><p id=\"b553-4\">Thus it stands alleged in the bill and admitted by the answer, and if it were not admitted by the answer, it is conclusively established by the bill and its exhibits, that there was a solemn agreement entered into in 1861 between the State of Virginia and the new State of West Virginia, with the consent of the Congress, by which, the latter State assumed (as one of the conditions of the assent of Virginia to her becoming a State) a just proportion of the indebtedness of that Commonwealth as it existed prior tp January 1, 1861, the manner of ascertaining which proportion was defined by the ordinance itself.</p><p id=\"b553-6\">The ordinance defines what would be a just proportion; for it provides not only for the assumption of a just proportion, but specifically in what manner that proportion shall be ascertained.</p><p id=\"b553-7\">The obligation of a lawful compact between tw.o States, justiciable in its nature, certainly is as binding in. law upon both until abrogated by both in a constitutional way, as a contract between a State and an individual, or between two individuals, and a disregard or violation of it by one, certainly cannot thereby release it from its obligation.</p><p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u2022 From the averments of the bill and the admissions in the answer, and the argument at the bar, it cannot be an open question in this case that the. only liability of West Virginia for an equitable proportion of the <em>ante-bellum </em>debt of Virginia is upon the basis of the ordinance.</p><p id=\"b554-4\">The general rule stated in <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Greenhow, </em>102 U. S. 672, to the effect that where- a State is divided into two or more States, in the. adjustment of liabilities between each other, the debts of the parent State should be ratably apportioned among them, is essentially qualified by the authorities there quoted, in this, that a special agreement between the two States in respect of the assumption of a proportion of the debt as it existed before the separation, takes the case out of .the general rule; so that the second ground alleged in the bill which specifically avers a special agreement, destroys the applicability of the rule to this case. This special agreement cannot be dismissed from this case as the decree proposed on behalf of Virginia would do. This court has sustained the validity of this ordinance in <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>11 Wallace, 39, in respect of the provision contained in it for the incorporation of the counties of- Berkeley and Jefferson in the latter State conditioned upon a popular vote therefor.</p><p id=\"b554-5\">If the ordinance was valid then in respect of the incorpora- tioii of these counties, it cannot be held to be invalid as to the specific provision contained in \u00a7 9 for. the assumption by the new State of a just proportion of the indebtedness to be ascertained in the manner defined, clearly carried into the constitu-\u2019 tion of the new State and assented to by Congress by the admission of West Virginia into the Union.</p><p id=\"b555-5\">The Wheeling ordinance was carried into the constitution of West Virginia as follows:</p><p id=\"b555-6\">\u201cArticle VIII. Section 8. An .equitable proportion of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia .prior to the 1st day of January, 1861, shall be assumed by this State, and the Legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accruing interest and to redeem the principal within thirty-four years.\u201d</p><p id=\"b555-7\">The convention \\assembled within ninety days after the adoption of the ordinance. Its sole warrant for assembling was the ordinance. Its authority to frame the constitution was derived from the ordinance. The ordinance as a whole was \u00e1 proposition to that convention and, as a whole, was accepted by the convention. The' convention complied with all the provisions of the ordinance. The constitution was framed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>meet all the requirements of the ordinance. It was tne oasis of the constitution.</p><p id=\"b556-6\">The inconsistent attempt to eliminate the ordinance from the c\u00e1se \u2014 the present posture of counsel for Virginia \u2014 is in order that the ordinance may be eliminated, and \u00a7 8 of the first constitution is to be construed as the assumption by the new State of an equitable^ proportion of the public indebtedness of Virginia prior to January 1-, 1861, upon the basis of population and territory. Such cannot be the law of this case. The assembling of the convention was an acceptance of \u00a7 9 of the ordinance. The ordinance embodi\u00e9d the conditions, and \u00a7 9 by no means the least important of them, of Virginia\u2019s consent to the erection of the new State out of her territory.</p><p id=\"b556-7\">The suggestion that \u00a7 8 of Article 8 of the constitution had no reference to \u00a7 9 of the ordinance, assumes' that the new \u2022 State was taking upon herself an equitable proportion of the public debt of- the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to the first day of January, 1861, without definition or understanding as to the basis upon which it was to be ascertained, therefore leaving open the vital question as to what would constitute an equitable proportion, for future adjustment between the two States. This is not to be believed.</p><p id=\"b556-8\">The debt of Virginia on January 1, 1861, was doubtless well known throughout the State of Virginia. It is alleged in the bill that about $33,000,000 of it were incurred in connection with the construction of works of internal improvement. If it had been the purpose of Virginia, in requiring as a condition of her assent, the assumption by the proposed new State of an equitable proportion of the public debt without specification as to the manner in which, and the basis upon which that proportion should be ascertained, it is inconceivable that the language of \u00a7 9 of the ordinance would have been what it was, and that the language of \u00a7 8 of Article 8 of the constitution would have been what it was. It was entirely for Virginia to dictate the terms, and if it had been her purpose to require an assumption of the debt upon the basis of territory and popu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>lation, West Virginia would have been required'to assume \u201cone-third of the debt as it existed prior to the first day of January, 1861,\u201d or \u201can equitable proportion to be ascertained upon the basis of territory arid population.\u201d</p><p id=\"b557-5\">If the ordinance be valid and binding, it cannot be disregarded by the court. While West Virginia could not by any suit prevent Virginia from disregarding it in the adjustment with her creditors of her debt or any portion of it, when Virginia invokes the original jurisdiction of this court in a suit against West Virginia to compel her to account for an equitable proportion of her debt prior to January 1, 1861, upon the basis of the ordinance and upon other and different bases, she may plead the ordinance as the only basis upon which the court can decree an accounting by her. \u2022 The court will not make a new contract for the parties. They were competent to make one for themselves, and they did make one for themselves. It is unfortunate that the two States were unable many years ago to adjust the matter in accordance with the agreement which they had entered into and which subsists between them.</p><p id=\"b557-6\">\" West Virginia is entitled to have the question whether or not the special agreement as to what shall constitute a just proportion of the debt solemnly entered into between the two States is binding, determined at this juncture by the court and, if it be held to be a binding agreement, Virginia is entitled to no accounting with West Virginia in this suit for her equitable proportion of the debt of the Commonwealth prior to January 1, 1861, except under the terms of that ordinance, carried into the constitution.</p><p id=\"b557-7\">Complainant\u2019s draft directs that the master \u2014 \u201cIII. Make and return with .his report any special or alternative statements of the account between the plaintiff and the.defendant in the premises which either may desire him to state or which he may deem to be desirable to present to the court.\u201d This asks the court to leave the determination of the pivotal point in the case, which defendant contends should be decided by it in advance of an accounting, to a master, albeit only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>an advisory . way, and it gives West Virginia permission to have, an accounting made, if she desires it, on the basis of the ordinance at her. own expense. She is defendant here. In that event we would have two lines of investigation proceeding \"before the master at the same time, each entirely distinct in basic principle from the other, each burdensome in labor, expense and the consumption of time. Neither would throw any light upon the other. An exhaustive accounting under the ordinance would not aid the court in determining whether it is binding and the only legal basis of settlement or not. An exhaustive investigation upon the international law basis would no more aid the' court in determining whether the ordinance is binding and therefore the sole ground upon which the liability of West Virginia to an- accounting at all can be based. If the compact is in force, any accounting save under that will.be not only burdensome, but superfluous.</p><p id=\"b558-6\">Defendant\u2019s draft is in literal execution of the,contract of the parties, as evidenced by the ordinance and \u00a7 8 of .the first constitution;</p><p id=\"b558-7\">It directs the master to ascertain and report:</p><p id=\"b558-9\">Defendant agrees that the last clause need not be inserted. ,</p><p id=\"b558-10\">(\u0431)' To ascertain the aggregate ordinary expenses of the state government of the Commonwealth prior to January 1,-1861, and since any. part of said indebtedness was contracted.</p><p id=\"b558-12\">The items-(a) and <em>(b) </em>are. under the ordinance, to be charged to West Virginia.</p><p id=\"b558-13\">The item'(c) is. under,the ordinance to be credited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>State of West Virginia, and when these three steps shall have been taken, and the two items charged, and the one item credited, the sum which it was agreed between the two States, should constitute a- just proportion of the debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to January 1, 1861, which West Virginia assumed, will have been ascertained. These provisions are not \u201carbitrary and inconsequential items.\u201d</p><p id=\"b559-4\">They are the items which Virginia herself framed and required to be accepted by the proposed new State as a condition of assent to her separation and admission into .the Union.</p><p id=\"b559-5\">There is but one item in \u00a7 9 \u2014 defining the manner in which the account should be taken in order to ascertain the proportion of the debt to be taken upon herself by the proposed new State \u2014 left at all indefinite, and that is item (6), \u201c\u2018a just proportion \u2019 of the ordinary expenses of the state government,, since any part of said debt was contracted.\u201d This involves -a determination of the basis upon which a \u201cjust proportion\u201d of the aggregate ordinary expenses of the state government during the said period is to be ascertained. Shall it be population or territory, or both, or taxable values? Defendant contends that it should be based upon population, since \u201cgovernment\u201d \u2014 including the administration of justice, the making and administering of the laws, the education of the .children through a system of common schools, academies and a state university, the maintenance of state institutions, the support of prisoners, the care of the insane and paupers, and the like\u2014 is for people, not acres. Defendant suggests there 'should be added to defendant\u2019s draft, in respect of an ascertainment of the aggregate ordinary expenses of the .State, a direction to th\u00a7 master to find alternatively certain facts substantially as follows: \u201cFor the purpose of enabling the court to determine the just proportion of the aggregate of the ordinary expenses of the state government of the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to January 1, 1861, and since any part of said indebtedness was contracted, said master shall ascertain and report the population during the said period of the counties now con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>stituting. the Commonwealth of Yirginia, and separately the population of the counties now constituting the State of West Virginia, as shown by the decennial censuses taken during the said' period by the United States, and also the average population of Virginia during each of said periods of ten years.\u201d</p><p id=\"b560-4\">The aggregate ordinary expenses, being found, and the items suggested as- to population, it will be easy to determine the \u201cjust proportion\u201d if that is the proper basis.</p><p id=\"AGeS\">This case should not be cast at large, with no definition of the principles to govern his action, into the hands of a master; that at least it should be settled before a reference for the purpose of taking an -account, whether-, the liability of West Virginia to Virginia is upon the special agreement which preceded and accompanied her admission into the Union, or, because of the absence, of a special agreement, upon the basis of population and territory.</p><p id=\"b560-6\">It will be observed that.in par. II, complainant\u2019s draft, the master is not only directed to ascertain the amount and proportion of said indebtedness, but \u201c of the interest accrued thereon.\u201d</p><p id=\"b560-7\">Defendant objects to this paragraph because there is no legal ground for directing the ascertainment of interest. West Virginia has not obligated herself in any manner for the payment of interest. A State is not liable to pay interest '\u00fanless it has expressly contracted to do so.
