Long and Robert Wliatkinson Long, in trust for the benefit of said Elizabeth Long and her children, on or about August 1, 1853; that a trust patent of that import was issued by the United States to said parties; that Alicia Lucia Burton, Eleanor Mary Taylor, Alice E.

Hadden, and that said Hadden claims to have acquired the title to the same through a pretended purchase, etc., made by said Robert F. and Elizabeth Long, but they deny that said Hadden ever had any valid deed, that it is void, etc.; that Hadden knew that the title was a trust title, in said Robert F. and Robert W.

The cause was continued, from time to time, until the 26th day of- June, A. B. 1882, when, by agreement of parties, the venue was changed to the circuit court of Kane county. Thereafter, on the 11th of Becember, A. B. 1882, the death of the defendant George M. Hadden was suggested. Subsequently, his heirs-at-law were made defendants, and duly summoned, and a guardian ad litem was appointed for the minor defendants, who filed the requisite answer. The cause was then again continued, from time to time, until the 19th day of Becember, A.

B. 1886, of the Kane circuit court, but the court took time for advisement, and, at the next following October term, decree was rendered. The decree finds that the United States, in 1853, conveyed, by patent, the land in said bill mentioned, to-wit, the south half of the south-west quarter of section 36, township 39 north, range 4, east of the third principal meridian, to Robert F. Long and Robert W. Long, as trustees, for the use of Elizabeth Long, wife of Robert F-. Long, and her children; that said grantees were naked trustees, having no duties to perform and no trusts to execute, and that the title to said land, immediately upon the issuing of said patent, became vested in said Elizabeth Long and her children, in like manner and to the same extent as if they had been named as grantees in said patent, and they, the said Elizabeth Long and her children, held said lands in fee simple, as tenants in common thereof; that June 13, 1855, the said Elizabeth Long, and Robert F. Long, her husband, joined in a deed of conveyance-of said lands, with full covenants of warranty, to George. M. Hadden, one of the original defendants herein, whereby the said Hadden succeeded to the interest of said Elizabeth Long, and became a tenant in common of said lands with the children of said Elizabeth Long; that January 9,1865, the said Hadden conveyed, by warranty deed, to the defendant Erastus Dean, the 'said land, and that said Dean entered into immediate possession of said land, and from thence hitherto continued in such possession; that said Dean, ever since the time of his purchasing and taking possession of said lands, as aforesaid, has in good faith paid all the taxes and assessments on said lands, without any notice of or information (until the commencement of this suit) that the children of said Elizabeth Long, or any other person than said Hadden, had, or claimed to have, any right, title or interest in or to said land; that said Hadden p&gt;aid all the taxes and assessments on said land, from the time of his purchase thereof, in 1855, to the date of his conveyance of same to said Dean, in 1865; that at the time of the commencement of this suit, the said Henry C. Long was the only one of the children of the said Elizabeth Long who was under the age of twenty-four years, he then being in his twenty-second year; that at the time of the birth of said Henry C. Long, Elizabeth Long had four other children, thus making the share of each child in the ownership of said land one-sixth. It is therefore decreed, that by the conveyance of said Elizabeth Long and her husband to said George M. Hadden, one-sixth of the title to the said lands was vested in said Hadden, and the other five-sixths were vested in the five children of said Elizabeth Long, as tenants in common; that said Elizabeth, having conveyed her interest in said land to said Hadden, had no interest in said land at the commencement of this suit, and that all the other complainants, except the said Henry 0. Long, having failed to make any claim or to assert their rights to said land within three years next after their majorities, respectively, were, at the time of the commencement of this suit, barred of all right, claim, title or interest of, in and to said land, and at such time had no rightful claim, demand or interest to or in said land, the defendant Dean having, for more than seven successive years prior thereto, been in the actual possession thereof under claim and color of title made in good faith, and during all said time having paid all taxes and assessments levied on said land; and said Dean and said Hadden, under whom he claimed, having been in the actual, exclusive and adverse possession of said land for more than twenty years prior to the commencement of this suit, it is therefore adjudged and decreed that as to all of said complainants, except the said Henry C. Long, the bill be dismissed. The court further finds that the said Henry C. Long, at the date of said patent, was not then born, yet being the child of the said Elizabeth Long, though born subsequent to the date of the patent, and the patent not limiting the grant to the children then in esse, it included the said Henry C. Long. It is therefore adjudged and decreed that the said Henry' C. Long is the owner of, and entitled to recover, an undivided one-sixth part of said land in fee simple absolute.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\" pgmap=\"459\">By agreement of parties no decree or order was made in respect to rents and profits, which are reserved for future consideration.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\" pgmap=\"459\">The patent for the land reads as follows:1</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-7\" pgmap=\"459(138) 460(38)\">\u201cWhereas, Robert Furniss Long and Robert Whatkinson Long, in trust for Elizabeth Long and her children, of Cook county, Rlinois, have deposited in the general land office of the United States a certificate of the register of the land office at Chicago, whereby it appears that full payment has been made by the said Robert Furniss Long and Robert Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid, according to the provisions of an act of Congress on the 24th of April, 1820, entitled \u201cAn act making further provision for the sale of public lands,\u201d for the south half of the south-east quarter, and the south half of the south-west quarter, of section 36, in township 39, of range 4, in the district of lands subject to sale at Chicago, Illinois, containing one hundred and sixty acres according to the official plat of the survey of said lands returned to the general land office by the Surveyor General, which said tract has been purchased by the said Bobert Furniss Long and Bobert Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\" pgmap=\"460\">\u201cNow, know ye that the United States of America, in consideration of the premises, and in conformity with the several acts of Congress in such cases made and provided, have given and granted, and by these presents do give and grant, unto the said Bobert Furniss Long and Bobert Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid, and to their hens, the said tract above described, to have and to hold the same, together with all the rights, privileges, -immunities, appurtenances, of whatsoever nature thereunto belonging, unto the said Bobert Furniss Long and Bobert WTiatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid, and to their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\" pgmap=\"460\">Then follow the .attestation, signature, etc., on the 1st day of August, A.

But omitting those depositions, the patent establishes, beyond all question, that the only title that Robert Furniss Long had in the land was as joint trustee with Robert Whatkinson Long, for the wife of the former, Elizabeth Long, and her children. The patent recites that \u201cRobert Furniss' Long and Robert Whatkinson Long, in trust for Elizabeth Long and her children, of Cook county, Illinois, have deposited in the land office of the United States a certificate of the register of the land office at Chicago, whereby it appears that full payment has been made by the said Robert Furniss Long and Robert. Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid,\u201d for the tract of land therein described, adding: \u201cWhich said tract has been purchased by said Robert Furniss Long and Robert Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid, and the land is therefore conveyed unto the said Robert Furniss Long and Robert Whatkinson Long, trustees as aforesaid.\u201d There is nothing in the record tending to contradict this recital, and it must therefore be accepted as conclusive as to the facts recited, and therefore that a trust, only, is conveyed by the patent.</p> <p id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464\">The case is unlike Witham v. Brooner, 63 Ill. 344, Lynch v. Swayne, 83 id. 336, and Kirkland v. Cox, 94 id. 400, where it was held, that under the operation of section 3, chapter 24, of the Revised Statutes of 1845, a conveyance in trust, or to the use of any person, which requires no duties, prescribes the execution of no trust, but leaves the trustee only a passive title, carries to the cestid que trust lawful seizin, estate and possession. The trust here created is for a married woman and her children. At the date of its creation she was not, under the law then in force, sid juris, in all respects, with reference to her separate property, and some or all of her children were then minors, and therefore incapable of legally contracting in regard to their property; and in such cases it is held the statute will not vest the estate in the cestui que trust, but the estate will vest in the trustee for the cestui que trust. Perry on Trusts, (1st ed.) secs. 310, 311, and authorities cited in note 1, on page 29.0, and in note 3, on page 291.</p> <p id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464(74) 465(404) 466(17)\">We are unable to agree with counsel for appellees, that the language employed in this patent created a life estate in Elizabeth Long,.with remainder over, after her death, to her children. There is no language creating a particular estate in Elizabeth Long, and that is indispensable to the creation of a remainder. No words are employed showing an intention to carve out a life estate.\" We agree with them that the words, '\u201cchildren,\u201d here, are words of purchase and not of limitation, but they are to be read conjunctively with the name of Elizabeth Long. The pleadings show that Robert Furniss Long was the husband, and that Robert Whatkinson Long was the \u25a0step-son, of Elizabeth Long. The transaction was therefore in the nature of a family settlement, in which the present as well as the remote welfare of the children was as much an object of concern as the present and remote welfare of Elizabeth Long. In such cases, the rule relied upon by counsel for appellant, as laid down in Handberry v. Doolittle, 38 Ill. 206, does not apply. That applies only to cases where a class of persons are to come into immediate possession upon the death of the testator. Here, the object and intention is the support of a family, in which after-born children are as much the concern of the donor as those then in being; and so it is said: \u201cWhenever the fortune of a married woman is within the jurisdiction of the court, either by having been paid into court or by a suit concerning its possession, the court always directs :an inquiry whether a settlement has been made; and the constant habit is to direct a settlement, not only upon the wife, but upon the children also. The wife can not say that she claims a settlement for herself, and not for the children. She has the, option to have no settlement; but if a settlement is made, it must be upon the wife and children.\u201d Perry on Trusts, (1st ed.) sec. 627. And this includes children unborn as well as those \u25a0 then in being. (1 Bishop on the Law of Married Women, \u25a0sec. 673.) And so a grant to a wife, and her child begotten by ihe grantor, has been held to give a joint estate to the wife and a child subsequently born. (Powell v. Powell, 5 Bush, 619.) And so, \u201cif there be a devise or limitation to the use of the \u25a0children of A, the estate may vest in joint tenancy in one, and afterwards in other children, as they progressively are born.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com. (8th ed.) 376, *359. A conveyance, as here, to the use of a woman and her children, plainly means to her and all of her children, the right vesting in each child, &gt; successively, as born. No other view is consistent with the object and purpose of such a limitation.</p> <p id=\"b466-4\" pgmap=\"466\">It is not pretended, in the view that the legal estate did not vest in the cestuis que trust, eo instanti, the execution of the deed, that there is any difficulty in the trustees holding for the benefit of the unborn child. Hadden was not a purchaser in good faith, without notice. The only proof in regard to his obtaining title is, that Robert Furniss Long and Elizabeth Long conveyed to him, and he immediately went into possession. The rule is thus laid down by Sugden, in his work on Vendors, (8th Am. ed.) vol. 2, page 561: \u201cIn all cases where a purchaser can not make.out a title but by a deed which leads him to another fact, whether by description .of the parties, recital or otherwise, he will be cognizant thereof, for it was crassa negligentia that he sought not after it.\u201d Hadden, here, could not make out a title but by the patent, and that being obtained would have disclosed the trust, for there is not the slightest pretense that any other title was exhibited as that under which they held. It was by reason of his own gross negligence that he did not know the contents of the patent,\u2014if, in fact, he did not know them,\u2014and he could, therefore, only have taken under the deed to him, subject to the trust. But his deed to-Dean was clearly color of title, and on Dean\u2019s part it was obtained in good faith; and since there was the requisite proof of possession, and payment of taxes thereunder, and the lapse of more than the period of seven years between the time Dean obtained it and the bringing of suit, the bar of the Statute of Limitations is complete as to all the parties except Harry 0. Long, who was only twenty-one years and some odd months old when the suit was brought, and who, consequently, is within the saving clause of the act.</p> <p id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466\">We are, therefore, of opinion that neither the errors nor cross-errors are well assigned, and the decree below is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
