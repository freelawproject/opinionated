This note was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">$400. Philadelphia, July 28, 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">Twelve months after date I promise to pay to Thomas Gillingham, trustee, or order, four hundred dollars without defalcation, with interest from this date, for value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">Joseph Gillingham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-11\">Received 4th M. 21, 1846, of Joseph Gillingham, two hundred dollars, on account. Thomas Gillingham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-12\">Interest on the within note, sixteen years, seven months, and twenty-four days, $399.60</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-13\">Cash received as above, 200.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-14\">Balance of interest now due and unpaid, $199.60</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-15\">There was also an assignment of the note on 27th day of Sep- ' tember, 1846, by Thomas Gillingham, trustee, to Robert P. Gillingham. It was signed by Thomas G. Gillingham, Trustee. Sealed. Reassigned November 18, 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-16\">The principal ground of defence was the statute of limitations. The testimony mainly relied upon to take the claim out of the statute was that of Dr. W. II. Gillingham, who said, \u201c within two years, Joseph (the defendant) called on me several times about a settlement between him and Thomas. In reference to the note in suit, he said, \u201c I acknowledge I owe the money; I acknowledge I got the money of Thomas, and I intend to pay it. But it was not Thomas\u2019s money. It is my impression that legally it is Stacey\u2019s money. Equitably it is John\u2019s.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-17\">His Honor, Bell, J., instructed the jury, that if they believed Dr. Gillingham, the acknowledgment of debt and promise to pay is sufficiently plain, distinct, and unambiguous, to take the case out of the operation of the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The case was argued by <em>Todd, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aux\">An acknowledgment to affect the party must be to the owner or his agent: 10 <em>Watts </em>262, Mechanics Bank <em>v. </em>Wilson; 4 <em>Barr </em>323, Morgan <em>v. </em>Walton.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-4\"><em>Brightly, </em>with whom was <em>Mann, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2T8\">January 29,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b303-6\">Coulter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlR\">This case is ruled by Kyle and Wells, decided at this term, the opinion in which case was foreshadowed by dictums in Walton <em>v. </em>Morgan, 4 <em>Barr, </em>and in Christy <em>v. </em>Flemington, 10 <em>Barr </em>129, and which establishes definitively and distinctly, that a promise, to take the case out of the statute of limitations, must be made to the plaintiff or his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">But the alleged promise, which in fact was no promise to the plaintiff or to any one in his behalf, but a mere statement by the defendant to his friend, was too vague and uncertain, even if made to the plaintiff or his agent, to take the case out of the statute. Defendant stated that he had got the money, but that it never belonged to plaintiff, but to another person whom he named, and that he intended to pay it. But it was entirely equivocal to whom he intended to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Indeed, the whole of his conversation and the whole of the <em>res gesta </em>would seem to indicate that he meant to pay it to the person to whom it really and justly belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
