In 1837, two of the executors having died, the surviving executor and the executors of the second deceased executor settled an account, in which they were charged with the balance due on the <em>first </em>account, and resulting in an increased balance in favor of the estate of the first decedent. In 1847, an account was settled by the surviving executor, in which he charged himself with the balance on the <em>second </em>account. It was <em>held, </em>that the surviving executor, in the distribution of the balance decreed on the last account, could not set off the amount of the one-third of the balance on the first account against the claim of the wife of the first deceased executor, who claimed under the will of her father, the first testator, who had devised to her the <em>interest </em>only of the amount in dispute, and the principal sum to her children. The whole of the balance was, on the face of the third account, admitted to be in the hands of the surviving executor. The claim of the surviving executor against the husband of the claimant was but an ordinary debt, which, if recoverable in the Orphans\u2019 Court, could only be recovered in the distribution of the husband\u2019s estate; and nearly <em>thirty years </em>having elapsed since the settlement of the <em>first </em>account, the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. It could not be treated as a payment to the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of liis wife\u2019s legacy, because the principal sum was not payable either to the husband or wife; and because it could not consistently with the proceedings be presumed to have been received by the husband, as the last executor had charged himself with it, as being in his hands at the exhibition of his last account.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">In the matter of Sarah Haage\u2019s appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery county, December Term, 1850, No. 25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">This is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, appropriating the legacy of Sarah Haage out of the estate of her father Jacob Acuff, deceased, to the payment of an alleged debt of her deceased husband, George Haage, to David Acuff, surviving executor of the will of said Jacob Acuff, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">Jacob Acuff left a will dated September 19, 1816, and a codicil of the same date, proved October 28,1816, the parts of which material here are as follows, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">\u201cItem.

Haage, Mary A. Ha,age, Christiann-Haage, David W. Haage, Joseph A.

The auditor erred in deducting from the balance of the estate in the accountant\u2019s hands, the sum of $8333 33|- to be set apart as a fund to raise the \u00bf\u00a375 per annum which the testator bequeathed to. his wife to be paid to her annually, as under the will said \u00bf\u00a375 are to be raised from the rents of the real estate as well as from moneys at interest, and from the shares of the daughters, and the widow has taken the rents, issues, and profits of the real estate unsold, for her said annuity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">The auditor therefore ought to have distributed the whole amount in the accountant\u2019s hands ($15,547.07J), among the legatees or their legal representatives, to each $1554.70 instead of $1270.29.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">2. The auditor erred in distributing Sarah Haage\u2019s share or dividend \u201cto be retained by David Acuff, for his own use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2MN\">3. As the shares of the daughters of the testator under his will, are to be loaned on mortgage by his executors, and the interest thereof to be paid annually to them, during their natural lives, and after the decease of any one of them, her share is to be divided among the children born of her body; the auditor ought to have distributed Sarah Haage\u2019s share to be loaned on mortgage, the interest thereon to be paid to her annually during her life, and after her death the principal of such share to be paid to the children of said Sarah Haage, instead of distributing said share \u201cto be retained by David Acuff for his own use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-13\">4. As Sarah Haage is entitled to the interest on her share or dividend of the decedent\u2019s estate during her life, and such share or dividend after the decease of said Sarah Haage, is directed to be then divided among the children born of her body, this share not coming to said Sarah Haage, wife of George Haage, absolutely, <em>but to her children after her </em>death, could not be received or reduced into possession by him as her husband, or be considered as received or retained by him on account of said share of his wife. And no debts due to the estate of the decedent by George Haage, nor any bonds or other evidences of debts owing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to the testator from other persons, remaining in Haage\u2019s hands as executor of decedent, can be deducted from or set off against the share given to Sarah Haage and her children by said will. The auditor therefore erred in setting off the alleged liability of George Haage, co-executor, of $1267.25, and deducting the same from the portion given to Sarah Haage and her children, and allowing David Acuff to retain the amount of such share for his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">5. The auditor erred in deciding that from the evidence it was manifest that George Haage had received of the estate $8699.91, and by the settlement of March 13, 1824, was reduced to $1267.25, and that this sum had not come to David Acuff\u2019s hands, but was received by George Haage and retained by him and appropriated to his own use; as there was no evidence to sustain such conclusion, or that any money came to the hands of George Haage belonging to testator\u2019s estate but what was accounted for by him, the vouchers for which were taken by D. Acuff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">The papers referred to relating to the first sum, are an old memorandum without date, or signature, or evidence where found, and a memorandum in a book, all made before the first settlement of 1818, was filed, and that amount is almost entirely made up of bonds, mortgages, notes, &amp;c., due to the decedent. The two papers dated March 13, 1824, referred to, to establish the last sum, $1267.25, themselves show this amount is made up entirely of bonds and notes, &amp;c., given by decedent, and interest calculated, and not money; all of which bonds, notes, &amp;c., and other papers and books relating to decedent\u2019s estate, were proved to have been delivered to David Acuff after Haage\u2019s death, and no evidence that this sum ever came into the hands of George Haage or his representatives was produced, or could he.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">6. The auditor erred in deciding that there had been a long-continued acquiescence of Sarah Haage and some of her children, in the disposition of this fund, which disarmed D. Acuff\u2019s vigilance, and induced him not to pursue Haage\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">Neither she nor his childreu ever knew or heard of the claim now set up (except that in 1837, nineteen years after the first settlement and fourteen years after Haage\u2019s death, the amount in paper \u201cA. M.\u201d was mentioned to her and one of the children, without showing the paper or any account thereof). No assent was then or at any other time ever given to the claim now made either by Mrs. Haage or any of her children, nor any act done by any of them to induce D. Acuff to believe they acquiesced in this demand (or the said disposition of the fund), which has been always denied since known. And they allege that D. Acuff\u2019s forbearance to take any steps to assert the claim now set up, for from 25 to 30 years, and allowing Haage\u2019s estate to be set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tied without presenting such a claim, while he was taking possession of all bonds, papers, and even vouchers of George Haage, relating to the estate, and charging himself with the whole estate, including this sum, in his settlement, and obtaining the written consent of the legatees to the correctness of the settlements, is conclusive evidence that the claim now set up did not exist, and that the whole estate was in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">7. The auditor erred in deciding that Sarah Haage and her children had already received this fund in the distribution of George Haage\u2019s estate. There was no proof before the auditor of their having received the fund in this way or any other way; nor any evidence of this in the' settlement of George Haage\u2019s estate, or in the proceedings relating thereto; nor could they have received such fund or share in any way, or such receipt be enforced : as under Jacob Acuff\u2019s will, the said fund or share could not have been paid or received, as it is said to have been received and disposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">8. The auditor ought to have distributed the shares to which the daughters are entitled, to them absolutely, or the excess over <em>\u00a3500.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">The second opinion and decree of the court after argument, after the recommitment of the auditor\u2019s report, was as follows :\u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">\u201c The court sees no reason for changing its former opinion in regard to the principles involved. The facts are varied in some respects by the new evidence, but they fully show that SarahHaage received enough of personal property from her husband\u2019s estate, who was a co-executor and debtor, to the amount of her distributive share to satisfy it. She has therefore in effect had the full use of her share since 1824, being equal in value to all she can claim up to this time. And that property, it is more than probable, still remains in her hands as part of her husband\u2019s estate, liable to be taken by means of a citation or otherwise, for satisfaction of what he owes this estate, as one of its executors. The court thinks it inequitable therefore at present to compel this accountant to pay her the interest of the share awarded in her name in this distribution, and accordingly orders the clerk to deduct first from the whole fund the expenses of the second audit, and so proportionally reduce each distributive share; and then it orders David Acuff, the accountant, to pay, or vest, taking mortgage for security, each share as directed in the report; but allows him to .take the interest of the share described as Sarah Haage\u2019s for his own use, annually, until further orders from the court. And it further orders, that as Mary Acuff, the decedent\u2019s widow, has filed a release of $3333.33|- set apart for her annuity in consideration of her being permitted to enjoy the real estate therein mentioned, the said David Acuff also pay over and vest in the same way and proportions this sum whenever the distributees shall have secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>said widow in the enjoyment of said land, or an equal sum out of its proceeds on a sale thereof, according to the terms expressed in her said release, and in the mean time pay her the annuity out of the fund.

B. </em>Mulvany, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASxY\">George Haage, the husband of Sarah Haage, the appellant, was one of the executors of the^-last will of Jacob Acuff, deceased. In 1818, he joined his two co-executors, David Acuff and Casper Schlater, in a settlement, whereby there appeared a balance due the estate of their testator of $5490.13. On the face of this settlement, George Haage would be liable to account to his co-executors for one equal third of the amount of the balance, to wit, the sum of $1830.04. But after his decease, to wit, on the 13th of March, 1824, it was settled by an account made out by <em>Ms </em>executors, and the two surviving executors of Jacob Acuff, deceased, that the true amount which was in the hands of George Haage at the time of his decease, belonging to the estate of his testator, was $1267.25, with interest thereon from April 1, 1823. Now, with this sum of $1267.25, David Acuff, as surviving executor of the will of Jacob Acuff, was charged in his subsequent settlements, and it forms part of the balance of $15,428.49, which was finally decreed against him, as being the fund in his hands for distribution, and to the one-tenth part of which, after deducting advancement, amounting to the sum of $1041.79, Sarah Haage would have been entitled, but for the circumstance that the money <em>had never come into the hands of David Acuff, </em>but had been received by her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>husband in his lifetime, had been bequeathed by him in his will <em>to </em>her, and had been actually received by her from his executors! Her attempt now is, to compel David Acuff to pay over money to her which he never received, but which is already in her own hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">The appellant, after acquiescing for a period of twenty-six years in the settlement made between the executors of her husband and the surviving executors of her father, by which the balance due from her husband was ascertained to be $1267.25, now denies the correctness of the account, and asserts that the true balance was only $653.28. For all the purposes of the case, however, it is immaterial whether the former or the latter sum be regarded as the correct amount. The \u201c share of Sarah Haage,\u201d as ascertained by the auditor in 1850, was $1041.79, whereas, $653.28, with interest thereon from 1824 to 1850, a period of twenty-six years, would amount to the sum of $1772.22, showing still <em>a loss </em>on <em>the </em>part of David Acuff to the amount of $730.43. That the true amount of Haage\u2019s indebtedness, however, in 1824, was the full sum of $1267.25, is shown by the papers in evidence in the case, and by the auditor\u2019s report, and by testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\">Although the husband of Sarah Haage directed in his will that all his just debts should be paid, yet <em>this debt </em>never was paid, and she got <em>the whole of his </em>estate, for life, including $833.48 of the personal property. Sarah Haage did know of the existence of the debt, as is shown by the testimony of Andrew Gilkeson and others; and if the executors of her husband had actually paid the debt out of his estate, her interests would still have been much better subserved by taking the residue under the will, than by electing to take her dower at common law. At any rate, she did take under the will, and thereby acquired the very fund, or its equivalent, which she now seeks to recover again: Ellis <em>v. </em>Baldwin, 2 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>263; 9 <em>Ves. </em>174; 12 <em>Id. </em>497.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">Opposed to the argument on the part of the appellant that her husband <em>could not </em>have received her legacy prior <em>to his </em>death, because it was not due at the time, is the <em>fact </em>that <em>he did receive it.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-9\">As the whole share which, under other circumstances, might be due to Sarah Haage in her lifetime, or to her children after her decease, is not sufficient to pay the debt due to the appellee, it is unnecessary to pursue the argument further.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_A7\">January 5, 1852,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b190-11\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJK\">When, in 1818, the three executors of Jacob Acuff settled their joint account, and that was confirmed, this confirmation was a decree of the court that they jointly had the balance, $5490.34, of the estate of Jacob Acuff in their hands. It may be that George Haage\u2019s share of that balance was properly settled in 1823, at $1267.25. But he died in 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">When, in 1837, the other two executors settled a second account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>charging themselves with the balance clue of the first account, and that was confirmed, this was a decree that they jointly had the whole estate, $7525.93, in their hands, and that George Ilaage and his executors owed the estate of Jacob Acuff nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">When, in 1847, the surviving executor, David Acuff, settled a third account in which he was charged with the balance of the second account, and that third account was confirmed, this was a decree that David had the whole balance of his father\u2019s estate in his hands, $15,021.37, and that the other executors had none of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In 1837, therefore, if not before, George Haage and his executors were by the' decree of the court declared to owe nothing to the estate of Jacob Acuff, and were finally discharged from all account, and from any connection with the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and have never since been recalled into court as parties. By that decree the alleged balance of $1267.25 ceased to be a debt to the estate of Jacob Acuff; and if it remains as a debt at all, it is a debt to David Acuff individually, and not in his character as executor; because he was forced as a joint debtor to take it all on himself, and the executors of George Haage were, as to the estate of Jacob Acuff, discharged from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Now it must be plain that, in the distribution of Jacob Acuff\u2019s estate among his legatees, David Acuff cannot claim to set off this debt of George Haage against the legacy coming to his wife, Sarah Haage; because it is an ordinary debt not recoverable in the Orphans\u2019 Court, at all events not recoverable there except in another proceeding, that is, in the\u2019 distribution of George Haage\u2019s estate; because the debtors, George Haage\u2019s executors, and the creditor, David Acuff, in his individual capacity, are not parties to the proceeding; and because the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. As a debt therefore it is entirely eliminated from the matter upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court was sitting in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">But it is argued that, if this debt was due by George Haage in 1823, it went to increase the estate which his widow Sarah Haage enjoys under his will, and, as the payment of it out of that estate would diminish to that extent her share of her husband\u2019s estate, it is proper to let her keep her husband\u2019s estate untouched, and to refund David Acuff out of her money in his hands as the executor of her father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Now, however strongly the suggestions of honesty may incline the court to amplify its jurisdiction to favor an honest claim, in the spirit of the maxim, <em>mala </em>restring\u00ed, <em>et bona convenit </em>amfliari, yet it must not be forgotten that there is natural justice in government refusing a remedy where the claim has become doubtful\u2019by lapse of time, and by the neglect of the claimant; and that the authority of the court is very properly limited. The court can neither transgress its jurisdiction nor the principles of law in order to enforce even the plainest justice; and it is better that indivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>dual instances of injustice should escape redress, than that the court should disregard the forms of justice, which are necessary to juridical order and stability, and those restrictions upon authority which are necessary to individual liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">As a debt of George Haage to David Acuff, we have seen that this claim could not be set off. Can it be treated as a payment to him of his wife\u2019s share? This is impossible. If he had had a right to receive it for her, it might possibly have been presumed that he had so received it. But it is a fact, shown by the will of Jacob Acuff and by the state of the accounts, that neither he nor she had any right then to receive even the interest of it. Moreover it cannot, consistently with other circumstances, be presumed to have been thus received or retained; for in 1837 and in 1847 the claimant, David Acuff, charges himself in his accounts with having this very money still in his hands, and because it is perfectly apparent that he received it as executor. His death did not change that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">But in all its aspects, the claim is of a most singular and doubtful character. We hear of it in 1823 and 1824, and not again until 1849, except that there is some ambiguous evidence that his widow admitted it in 1837. No interest appears to have ever been paid or claimed on it. David Acuff settles two accounts in which no notice is taken of it, though it is included in the general balance declared to be due by himself. And besides this, the executors of the real debtor, George Haage, settled their accounts in 1845, and it was not claimed there. Under such circumstances of incompatible acts and negligence, it would be most dangerous to the principles of administrative justice to enforce this claim. There are solemn acts and an eloquent silence that forbid any judicial conclusion in favor of its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">January 5, 1852. This cause came to be heard on the appeal of Sarah Haage, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery county, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, on consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, That the decree of the said Orphans\u2019 Court be reversed, so far as it allows any deduction from the share of the said Sarah and her children, on account of the claim of David Acuff, and that the record be returned to the said court, with directions to proceed to make distribution, without any regard to said claim, and that the said David Acuff pay the costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
