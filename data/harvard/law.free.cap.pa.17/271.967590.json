He decided against the granting of an issue, and awarded the fund to the payment of the <em>first </em>execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">Exceptions as follows, were filed to his report:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">1.

The court below erred in dismissing the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report and confirming the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">2. The court below erred in refusing an issue demanded by the appellant to try the question of fact, whether the fund in court was raised by property belonging to the firm of Bennett &amp; Van-dike or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\">3. The court below erred in awarding the money in court to John J. McCahen.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-14\">The case was argued by <em>Wain, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay-\">The return to the first writ, was that the property of the <em>defendant </em>(Bennett) was sold, which meant that his interest in the property was sold. But the sheriff sold the property under all of the writs; and the return being that the levy was subject to the first writ, the court should have suffered the sheriff to <em>amend </em>this return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-15\"><em>J. A. Phillips, </em>contr\u00e1.\u2014The return to the first execution, states that the property sold was the interest or property of the partner. The complainant had no right to an issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-16\"><em>Knight, </em>in reply. The 86th section of the Act of 16th June, 1836, relating to executions, is not confined to the proceeds of sale of <em>real </em>estate.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AfqW\">January 26, 1852,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b273-17\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">The auditor held in this case that the return of the sheriff, on the writ against Bennett alone, was conclusive on the sheriff and between the different execution creditors; that the goods levied on were the property of Bennett, and not of Bennett &amp; Yandike; and that therefore the creditors of the firm could not he allowed to prove that they were partnership goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">If this be true, the rights of the sheriff and of the parties are endangered by a mere mistake of the sheriff (for the goods were the same in each case); and rather than allow such a result, the court below ought to have granted the motion to amend. But the truth of the case may be reached without an amendment. The money was made and paid into court on these four writs, and under these returns was submitted to the auditor. In the distribution, therefore, all the writs and returns must be regarded. They together present the transaction on which the auditor is to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">By a strict construction of the first writ and its return, the money was made out of the goods of Bennett; and by a similar construction of the other, it was made out of the goods of Bennett &amp; Yandike. Now, these being all of equal authority, which is conclusive against the other ? One against four, or four against one? Neither way.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The sheriff says he made the money on all of the executions; he brings it into court on them all, and it is referred on them all. If the levies are incompatible, let them be rejected. The return is complete without them, in stating the amount of money made. To know how to distribute this, we must know whether it was made out of individual or partnership property. Let that fact be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7u\">Decree: This cause came on to be heard on an appeal from the District Court of Philadelphia county, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, on consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the decree appealed from be reversed, and that the cause be remanded to the said District Court with instructions to proceed in due form of law to ascertain out of whose property the money returned on these four executions was made, and then to distribute it according to the rights of the execution creditors.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
