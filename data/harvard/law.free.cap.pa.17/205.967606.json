I gave $20 for building the church; I don\u2019t know how the present debt is to be paid; 1 was one of the building committee; the debt we owe is for building the church; the whole committee joined in the building ; the building committee made the contract with the mechanics for the building; David Price took the contract, and I believe a portion of this debt is due him; I guess there was no written contract with him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">The plaintiff also offered Roderick R. Williams, the pastor of the congregation, who was objected to and rejected on the ground of interest. On his examination, on his <em>voire dire, </em>he testified as follows:\u2014\u201c I am pastor of this Welsh congregation, and-have been for a little more than three years; I was pastor when this church was built; I was not one of the building committee; I am not a trustee; we have no by-laws; everything is passed by the congregation ; my salary is paid by voluntary contribution; the society owes about $1000; I took an active part in getting subscriptions, and in having the church built; the building committee was elected by the congregation; I did not vote, but generally put questions to vote; I was present when the building committee was chosen, and I had no objection to the committee appointed; it was agreed by official members; I was to receive $24 every four weeks. Our officers are deacons, secretaries, trustees, and pastor. The builder said he would build for such a price, and this fact was stated to the society, and the society authorized the contract. Perhaps $200 are due Price; most of the balance of the debt is due members, who lent money to the society; they gave their private notes; it was understood the trustees were to find the money, and the society was to repay them; there was no formal agreement on the part of the society to refund the money; no note was given to Price; the understanding is that all are to be bound by a majority.

The rents were directly applicable to the support of Mr. Williams, and the only legally certain salary he could receive. All else was voluntary.

The instrument in dispute contained a devise of a \u201c dwelling-house to the Welsh Congregation, or Independent Church of Minersville; the property not to be sold, but the rents to be paid by my executors to the official members of said church, to the end of being appropriated to the use of said church.\u201d Roderick R. Williams, the pastor, and John L. Davies, a member of the congregation, interested in establishing the paper, were offered as witnesses to prove the execution, but were rejected by the court on the ground of interest. In general, the members 'of <em>pecuniary </em>or <em>moneyed </em>institutions, such as banks, insurance and manufacturing companies, and the like, are not witnesses in favor of such corporations, because they are directly interested in the result. The property in controversy would go to swell their profits, and thus increase the dividends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>payable to the members offered as witnesses. But societies for <em>religious purposes </em>stand upon a different footing. No dividends are payable to the members of such corporations. They do not make merchandise of their religion, for the <em>pecuniary </em>profit of the members. Donations, bequests, and devises to them may increase their ability to pay their debts, but this does not create such a <em>direct </em>interest as to disqualify a member. The liability of members of religious societies is in general voluntary, and the rule is so in the case before us. It does not appear that the society is unable, independent of the property involved in this suit, to pay its debts; nor have we any assurance that the property, if recovered, would be applied to existing liabilities. There is nothing to prevent its appropriation to <em>new </em>erections, or <em>new </em>expenditures, \u201cfor the use of the church.\u201d Professor Greenleaf, in his work on Evidence, gives the rule correctly. In section 333, he states that \u201cmembers of <em>charitable </em>and <em>religious </em>societies, having no <em>personal </em>and <em>private interest </em>in the property holden by the corporation, are competent witnesses in any suit in which the corporation is a party.\u201d As to what are called <em>quasi </em>corporations, or the civil divisions of the country, where the question to be decided involves an increase or diminution of the corporate means or funds, so as to add to or lighten the burden of taxation upon the individual, the English Courts have holden that his mere <em>liability to be rated, </em>constitutes an interest <em>too remote </em>and <em>contingent to operate as the ground of exclusion, </em>although it is said to be otherwise if he be <em>actually rated. </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>17,19, 5 <em>Id. </em>664, 667. 6 <em>Id. </em>157. In this country, Avhere no one can be rated against his consent for the support of religion, there can be no ground for excluding members of churches or societies for worship, upon the ground of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">By the probate taken before the Register, it appears that the two witnesses state that they saw the testator <em>\u201csign, </em>seal, publish, pronounce, and declare,\u201d &amp;e. As the <em>name </em>of the testator appears to be <em>signed </em>to the instrument, the court cannot say, on inspection, that the witnesses did not see the testator <em>sign </em>it. The addition of a \u201cmark\u201d does not necessarily import against the testimony of the witnesses, that the testator did not <em>sign </em>his name. There may have been an inadvertence in the statement of the witnesses, or they may have considered the affixing of a mark as a <em>signing </em>of the will. It is certain, however, that there was nothing upon the face of the paper, thus admitted to probate, which raised the question respecting the effect of a <em>mark, </em>Avhen used instead cf a <em>signature, </em>in the execution of a will; or which authorized the court to reject the probate as not even <em>prima facie </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The instrument, after probate, ought to have been received in evidence, subject to explanation; and the witnesses offered ought to have been admitted. When the whole case shall be presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to the court and jury, a proper decision can be made upon the validity of the instrument in dispute..</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
