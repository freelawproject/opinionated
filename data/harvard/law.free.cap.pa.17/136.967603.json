But, although he becomes a member of the corporation by the act, the insurance, as between himself and the company, is a contract, no term of which can be altered save by the consent of the parties thereto; his character as a party to the contract is not merged in his character as a member of the corporation. They are characters as independent of each other, and as distinct, as though they were different individuals. Hence no act of the corporation, whether it be expressly or only impliedly assented to by a member, as such, can be allowed to effect <em>a contract </em>of the corporation with that member10 <em>Mass. </em>384; 13 <em>Id. </em>282.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">\u201c The power conferred upon the managers of the Mutual Insurance Company by the general meeting of 'the corporation of' the 6th August, 1830, to <em>\u2018 </em>pass all by-laws, rules, and regulations necessary for the well government of the affairs of the company,\u2019 does not, as we conceive, authorize the passage of any by-law to <em>have a retrospective operation upon </em>contracts of the company, such as the one before us. \u25a0 To bind Mr. Connor by the by-law of 15th August, 1848, No. 14, his consent, not as a corporator, but as a party to the contract of insurance, was necessary, and the power-to pass the by-law no more reaches him in that latter character than does the by-law itself. In the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cain, 5 <em>Ser. JR. </em>510, no contract existed; it was a case between corporators as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEJ\">\u201c This by-law was passed in August, 1845, and if it was capable of being extended to the case of plaintiff against his consent as a contractor, it would bind him as a corporator whether he received notice of its passage or not\u2014the assent, though absent when it passed the general meeting, would be presumed; Stetson <em>v. </em>Kemp-ton, 13 <em>Mass.

But in that case the company could not, as has been done here, ask contribution to losses from the plaintiff, upon the footing of the policy or contract, and then deny its liabilities to make good the losses against which it had insured him, upon the footing of the by-law. If Mr. Connor was bound by that by-law, he was bound from its passage, and not from the date when he received notice of its passage <em>three years aftemoards, </em>having in the meanwhile performed every duty to the company which his contract with them required at his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-10\">\u201c Let judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>It was assigned for error, .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">1.

Connor paid his contributions for losses, and was not in default except in the matter of interest, which, from the case stated, does not appear to have been demanded, and of the penalty for non-payment of which he does not appear to have received any notice until the 21st June, 1849, twenty-two days before his property was destroyed by fire. He was not then in arrear for three months after the notice.

The eases cited do not sustain the position that a by-la-vy imposing new conditions, is void; the rule is, that where acts transcend the charter, they are void: Yates, J., in Burr <em>v. </em>Spencer, 3 <em>Burr. </em>1839; 5 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>510, Com. <em>v. </em>Cain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-13\">Though a by-law is not to affect <em>past transactions, </em>such was not the ease in this instance; it merely provided a rule in regard to the non payment of interest after the passage of the by-law. The by-law was passed 15th August, 1845; one year\u2019s interest on the note was due on 5th November, 1845; and that year\u2019s interest was paid on 5th January, 1846, within three months after the first in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>terest became due, subsequent to the by-law; the interest unpaid, and for which he was in default, became due after the passage of the by-law. The operation of the by-law was, therefore, in this case, entirely prospective. The interest in arrear <em>commenced </em>to accrue on 5th November, 1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-5\">The case in 7 <em>JB\"ill </em>49, was referred to as in point.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AX-q\">December 29, 1851,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b141-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AILU\">On the 5th November, 1844, a policy was executed by the parties, by which the buildings of the plaintiff below were insured. The policy acknowledged the payment of the premium, but, on the day of its date, the insured gave his note, payable at six months, with interest, which is stated on the record to have been given for the premium. At the time of executing these instruments a by-law existed (a copy of which was annexed to the policy) by which the treasurer was authorized to enforce the payment of interest on all moneys invested, by calling in the principal sum, in case the interest was not paid within ten days after it became due. On the 15th August, 1845, nine months after the contract of insurance was entered into, the corporation adopted a by-law, declaring, that \u201c if a note be given for the deposit on -any policy, and the interest thereof (to be paid semi-annually) be at any time three months in arrear, the policy shall be suspended, and of no effect to make the company liable for loss until the interest be paid.\u201d On the 22d June, 1849, Cornelius Connor received notice of this by-law; and on the 15th July, 1849 (the interest on the note being more than three months in arrear), the buildings insured were destroyed by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">According to our construction of the by-law, it is prospective in its terms. If a retrospective operation be allowed to the words <em>11 if a note be given,\u201d </em>we see no reason why a similar construction should not be given to the words which immediately succeed, \u201c <em>and the interest be three months in arrear.\u201d </em>The result would be-that instead of a by-law, a rule <em>prescribed </em>to regulate <em>future </em>conduct, we have an <em>adjudication, </em>without trial or notice, by which the rights of the party under his covenant are decreed to be forfeited for an omission, not in violation of any by-law in existence when it was made. Such a decree would be against the plain principles of justice. But the rule is that a statute shall not be construed to have a retro-active effect, unless that intent be expressed by the lawgiver. No such intention is expressed in the by-law, and our construction restricts its operation to notes given and contracts made after its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">But as those who enacted the by-law give it a different-interpretion, and claim the power to pass by-laws affecting contracts previously made, it is proper to state our opinion on this question also. Corporations are the creations of the law, and. possess only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>such powers as are specifically granted, or are necessary to carry into effect the powers thus granted. In general, acts of incorporation are designed to give them only the like capacity to act, in respect to the particular objects for which they are created, that natural persons possess in respect to their own affairs. A corporation has no power to invade the rights of individuals. A by-law, when used for this purpose, is totally misapplied. The design is to regulate the government of the corporation, not to operate upon or affect injuriously the rights of strangers. A mutual insurance company differs from other insurance companies in this, that the person insured participates in the profits and losses. These rights and liabilities have respect to his corporate privileges, and a reasonable by-law regulating them might bo free from objection. But in addition to his rights and duties as a corporator, Cornelius Con-nor stands before us as a party to a covenant executed by himself on the one part, and by the insurance company under its corporate seal on the other. His rights under that covenant are as fully protected by law from the corporate action of the company as if he were a stranger. It affects not his rights under that contract, that by virtue of it he becomes a member of the company, and, as such, subject to liabilities and entitled to privileges. This is an incident of the contract of insurance which may subject his corporate rights to the authority of the corporation; but his rights as a party insured stand entirely free from such control. If he neglected to pay the interest on his note, the remedy provided was to call in the principal. Poverty, accident, illness, and various circumstances beyond his control, may prevent the payment of interest without any wilful default. Under such circumstances the remedies existing at the time of the contract, or such as the law may provide for enforcing the payment, are all that can be resorted to. The soundness of this position may not readily be perceived, because corporate action assimilates in form to the action of sovereignties, and the aggregation of intelligence and influence which exists in such cases, creates habits of thought, and, in practice, produces a power which tends to obscure the sense of right and equality. But an individual has an equal right with a corporation to adopt rules of action for his own government, whether those rules are denominated regulations or by-laws. If Cornelius Connor had adopted a rule suspending the obligation of his own note for the premium in case the company failed to comply with some new condition which formed no part of the original contract, his pretensions would strike the mind as remarkable for something more than their injustice. The pretensions of the plaintiff in error stand on no better foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The purchase of a freehold estate within a certain locality, or the loan of a sum of money on mortgage, under certain charter regulations, confers the privileges of membership, and secures the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>right to vote at municipal elections in the one case, and to hold stock in the other, in proportion to the amount of the loan. The holder\u2019s privileges, as a corporator, might be subject to the reasonable control of the corporation; but no general authority to pass by-laws for its good government could confer the right to deprive the party of his freehold, or to impair the obligation of his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">What security is there in a policy of insurance which is liable to be declared forfeited by one party without the consent of the other ? The chances of indemnity against loss would scarcely be diminished by such an uncertain provision. If this be established as the law which is to govern contracts with mutual insurance companies, it will be destructive of all business transactions with them. Its tendency would be to defeat the chief object of the party who effects an insurance. The recognition of the power claimed in this case by the plaintiff in error would be injurious to the interests of insurance companies, contrary to the principles upon which they are founded, and dangerous to the just and equal rights of the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">It is the opinion of the court that the forfeiture of Cornelius Connor\u2019s rights, under his covenant of insurance, upon the ground assigned in this case, is unreasonable and oppressive, and is a penalty which, it is clear, the other party to the contract has no right to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
