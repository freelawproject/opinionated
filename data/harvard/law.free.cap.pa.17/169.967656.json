Mauger.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-9\">D. Mauger was examined on the part of the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9L\">He said, <em>cum alia, </em>that the signature of R. Oromelien &amp; Co. to the note in question in this suit, is in the handwriting of Rowland Oromelien; that he had a conversation with him in relation to it in 1843 or 1844; and that Oromelien then offered to settle it for less than the amount due on its face.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-10\">\u25a0 He further said, that when he had this conversation with <em>Oromelien, </em>his brother Charles Mauger was the holder of it; that he (the witness) had bought a farm from Charles, and that he gave him this note in part payment; that this was before it was due; that he took it without recourse to the witness; he took it for the amount due on its face. Thought the note was given to his brother in 1842.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-11\">The counsel for the defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that upon the testimony and evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; but the court instructed the jury, \u201c that if they believed the testimony of Mr. Alsop, they ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff,\u201d which they did, for the amount of the bill claimed, and interest, being $493.31.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-12\">The case was argued by <em>Ingraham </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avk\">There was no evidence of any assignment or transfer of this bill. The only claim relied on before the jury, or counted upon in the declaration, viz., that it was held as collateral to the note, is disproved by Daniel Mauger himself; nor is there any evidence of any new consideration, or any consideration at all upon which a promise to pay <em>Charles </em>Mauger a debt due to <em>Daniel </em>Manger, can be the subject of an action in <em>Charles </em>Mauger\u2019s name: 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>320, 321; and Price <em>v. </em>Sedman, 4 <em>Barn. &amp; Cres. </em>525, are referred to as directly in&lt; point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-14\"><em>Perhins, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFm\">If any objection had been made to the pleadings, they could have been amended. The defendant not having called the attention of the court below to any variance between the pleadings and the evidence, he cannot after verdict assign such variance for error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-15\">The verdict was right on the pleadings and evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-16\">The course of the defendant was virtually a demurrer to evidence ; and a party cannot claim the benefit of a demurrer to evidence without taking the risk of it. If he wishes to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tbe effect of evidence to tbe court it is his business to demur: 6 <em>Barr </em>179.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">Tbe evidence shows an account stated between plaintiff and defendant, resulting in a balance at tbe time of tbe promise of $459.77.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">Tbe plaintiff was tbe owner of tbe note of $778, on wbicb tbe defendant was liable as endorser, and could have sued him as sucb: be also held tbe account made out in tbe name of D. Mauger, wbicb was tbe consideration of tbe note: tbe defendant denies owing tbe larger amount; both parties agree upon tbe amount tbe defendant is to pay, and be makes an express promise to pay it. Bringing the transaction within tbe very words of tbe count in the declaration, on an account stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">As to tbe consideration of tbe promise\u2014there was both a benefit to defendant, and a disadvantage to plaintiff. Tbe claim was about becoming barred by tbe statute; tbe defendant wanted time; it was granted, and be promised to pay tbe plaintiff tbe amount it was agreed be owed. Suit was not brought till tbe 29th of December, 1848, as the record shows. Tbe promise must have been made in July, 1848, as that is tbe date to wbicb it appears they calculated tbe interest when they settled tbe amount due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">Tbe witness says it would have been barred in two or three Weeks. The date of tbe note shows it would have been barred on tbe 7th of September, 1848: so tbe promise must have been prior to that date; and suit is not brought till tbe 29th of December, 1848; so there was not only a benefit and forbearance extended to defendant at bis request, but a delay, risk, and probability of loss to plaintiff to support tbe promise of defendant; either of which would have been sufficient.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A91\">January 5, 1852,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Tbe opinion of tbe court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b172-11\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1i\">Tbe maxim, \u201c <em>expressa nooent, et non expressa non nooent,\" </em>is a rule of law, because it is sound logic, and it is of very general application. When, therefore, tbe court is requested to charge tbe jury, that on the evidence tbe plaintiff can-hot recover, this request claims simply that tbe evidence presents no cause of action as between the parties, and raises no question as to tbe correspondence between the declaration and the evidence. If, then, tbe evidence of Robert Alsop is sucb that the jury might infer a valid promise by tbe defendant to tbe plaintiff to pay this debt, tbe instruction of tbe court is right, and we cannot convict of error for not expressing what was not called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">We are satisfied that tbe evidence was sufficient for that purpose. The debt was originally due to another person, but tbe note given as collateral security, was assigned to and held by tbe plaintiff, and under these circumstances tbe defendant promised to pay tbe plaintiff. This was an admission that tbe plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>then the proper owner of the claim. The charge of the court was therefore substantially thus: if there was a debt justly due by the defendant to a person who has assigned it to the plaintiff, and in consideration of that debt and assignment, the defendant has expressly promised to pay the plaintiff, the latter has a good cause of action. Such instruction is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
