Darlington </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avc\">The Act of the 7th of April, 1849, entitled \u201cAn Act for the regulation and continuance of a system of education by Common Schools,\u201d <em>[Acts of </em>1849, p. 411), is a general regulation, to which the llth section of the Act of the 9th of April, of the same year, establishing the Crookville district, is subordinate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-13\">The <em>first </em>Act provides for the continuance of an established system. The <em>second, </em>for the erection of a single school district, under that system.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-14\">The first makes every township a school district, and directs what shall be done when a new district is formed; the second creates a new district, such as is contemplated by the first, and such as must be governed by the rules prescribed by the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-15\">The two Acts relate to the same subject-matter, and are to be construed together, and in relation to the same general plan. There is no inconsistency or repugnance between them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-16\">The object of the provision for the continuance of the organization of the old district till the election of a board of directors for the new district, was certainly to prevent the new district from being deprived of the benefits of the school system for the term that might elapse between the creation of a new district, and the organization of a board for its government. But for such a provision Crookville would have had no public schools for a year. The Act was passed in April, and no election of .officers could take place till the following March; and until officers were elected, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>steps could be taken to put the schools of the new district in operation. Had the legislature intended that the Crookville school district should not come under the regulations of the general law, they would have said so, and would have provided for the immediate election of directors, and the organization of the board. This was the construction put upon the Act at the time, as is apparent from the fact that the children of Crookville were taught till March, 1850, in the schools of Nether Providence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">Besides, it is to be observed that the limits of Crookville were not defined till the Act of 2d April, 1850. That Act first locates it. See <em>Pamphlet Laivs for </em>1850, p. 311. Theretofore it was but a <em>terra </em>incognita\u2014was \u201ca creature of the mind, and existed only in contemplation.\u201d It had not \u201c defined its position;\u201d and whether Mr. Crook should be found within or without the village that was to rejoice in the honor of his name, was still a secret of the future.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">It is a general principle of construction, that statutes relating to one subject are governed by one spirit and policy, and are intended to be consistent and harmonious in their several parts.and provisions: <em>Dwarris on Statutes, </em>p. 699; 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>461; 3 <em>Howard </em>557.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-7\"><em>W.

The school year of 1849 ended the first Monday of June, 1849: Act of June 13, 1836, s. 21, <em>Pamph. </em>533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">2. A statute for the commencement of which no time is fixed, commences at its date: Matthews <em>v. </em>Zane, 7 <em>Wheat. </em>164; The Ann, 1 <em>Grallison (U. S.) </em>62 ; Smits <em>v. </em>Weathersher, <em>R. M. Charlt.

(Ill.) </em>555.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-9\">3. The Act erecting Crookville into a school district (Ap. 9, \u201949), took effect from its passage. \u201cThe same is hereby erected,\u201d &amp;e. It then became a separate school district. It has no connection with the common school law of April 7,1849, and contains only a general reference to its provisions. Anything in the Act of April 7, inconsistent with the Act of April 9, is repealed and supplied by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-10\">If the Act of April 7 declares that no new district shall be organized and take effect until one year after its erection, and the Act of April 9 declares the new district shall take effect instanter, which must prevail ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-11\">It is supposed by the plaintiff in error, that the Act of 9th April cannot take effect from its passage, because the Act of 7th April postpones its operation, until the termination of the then current school year. But that terminated in June, 1849, and the tax here levied was subsequent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>It is supposed also to be postponed until a board of directors is elected and organized. But the Act of April 7 does not contemplate such postponement. It is inconsistent with itself. Its literal reading is, the new district shall not be recognised until its directors are elected and organized, but its directors may levy a tax in the mean time, &amp;c. But the intention of the legislature is presumed to be that the new district shall not receive its proportion of the state appropriation until its directors are elected and organized, and until the current year expires; but that, in the mean time, they may levy tax, build school-houses, &amp;c., and, in short, be a separate school district as to all else.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMa\">January 13,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b204-7\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">The 11th section of the Act of 9th April, 1849, must be construed in connexion with the 2d section of the Act of 7th April, 1849, relating to the same subject. In considering the statutes regulating the common school system, great regard should be paid to the general intention of the legislature as manifested in the-various provisions on the subject. It is plain from our examination of the legislation establishing and regulating this system, that the great object was to provide for the education of children by the continuance of the public schools in each district <em>without interruption. </em>To accomplish this object, in cases where new districts were created, it was necessary that the old districts should continue to provide for the public wants, not only during the current school year, but until the new district was in a condition to supply the place of the old, by the election and organization of a board of directors. If the new directors should be chosen before the expiration of the current school year, public convenience required that the old directors should complete the <em>term </em>which had commenced, and for which they had assessed taxes and made contracts ; while the new directors were authorized to levy a tax and make all other preparations for the commencement of teaching for the <em>ensuing </em>year. So, if the <em>current </em>school year should expire before the election of directors for the new district, the same reason would require that the powers of the old board of directors should continue until a new one was elected and organized. The 2d section of the Act of 7th April, 1849, accomplishes these objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In the case before us, the warrant to levy the school tax for Nether Providence school district was issued before the election of directors for the new district of Crookville, and was therefore issued in conformity to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">If the village of Crookville had no legal existence as a borough, township, or district (of which the courts would take notice), and was without any known boundaries, or the means of ascertaining them, its existence as a school district was necessarily suspended, until its boundaries were designated by the Act of 2d April, 1850.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>We are of opinion that the points presented by the defendant below ought to have been answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
