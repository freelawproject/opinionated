In 1832, a <em>scire facias </em>was issued against <em>the </em>defendant and <em>terre tenants, </em>and was returned <em>nihil </em>as to defendant, and served as to the <em>tern tenants, </em>and judgment was entered generally, for want of appearance. In 1849, a <em>scire facias </em>issued on the judgment in another county to which the record had been-removed under the Act of 1840, against the administrator of the defendant, with notice to <em>terre tenants, </em>which was returned served as to the administrator, and <em>nihil </em>as to <em>terre tenants-; </em>in the <em>scire facias </em>both of the judgments being recited. It was <em>held, </em>that the first <em>scire facias </em>(that writ being <em>the appropriate remedy) </em>having issued within the time at which the presumption of payment might arise, viz. twenty years, and being prosecuted, and also being issued, not for the sole purpose of repelling the presumption, but with the view of recovering the debt, the presumption of payment of the debt did not arise in 1849, when the last <em>scire facias </em>issued. Also; that the irregularity of the judgment against the original defendant was unimportant in this court; it was considered as regular, no application having been made to set it aside.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">Error to the District Court, <em>Philadelphia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">This was an action of <em>scire facias </em>issued in the name of Jonathan Jarrett and others, executors of the will of Azor Lukens, deceased, against David E.

Reference was made to the remarks of Duncan, J., on p. 22 of that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-13\">Evidence of the commencement of a former suit, afterwards abandoned, will not rebut the presumption of payment of a bond on which no interest had been paid for twenty-three years.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-14\"><em>Bead, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuNT\">\u201cIf a judgment creditor has lain by for twenty years without any effort to enforce his' judgment, and it has not been acknowledged by the debtor within that time, it will be presumed to be satisfied:\u201d <em>Shelford\u2019s Bead Property Statutes, </em>in note, p. 240.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-15\">This is the principle of Cope <em>v. </em>Humphreys, where no proceeding was had on the original judgment for upwards of twenty-two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>years, and nothing was alleged to rebut the presumption of payment. In Pennsylvania, each revival regularly entered, has the effect of a new judgment in binding land and carrying interest.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKq\">February 16,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b372-7\">Black,, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEz\">This was a <em>scire facias </em>issued in 1849 to revive a judgment originally entered in \u00cd827. The defendant pleaded payment, and, to sustain the plea, relied altogether on the lapse of 'time, it being more than twenty years from the date of the first judgment to the taking out of this writ. If this were the whole case, the defence would have been a clear one. But the plaintiff shows that he issued a <em>scire facias </em>in 1832, and that the writ being returned \u201c <em>nihil habet </em>as <em>to the </em>defendant, and made known to the <em>terre tenants,\u201d </em>judgment was taken for want of appearance. The latter judgment, as well as that of 1827, is recited in the present <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We do not stop here to inquire into the regularity of the judgment taken against Sandman, the defendant himself, in 1832: in the first place, because that is a question which could only be considered on the motion <em>to </em>open it; and, secondly, because in the view we take of the case, it can make no difference whether that judgment was right or wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">It is not necessary to discuss the cases. The rule dedueible from all of them, whose authority is binding on us, is that where a party has a debt against another evidenced by a specialty or a record, and to which no statute of limitation applies, the burden of proving it unpaid is not thrown upon him who claims it, even in a suit brought more than twenty years after it has become payable, if within the twenty years a fair effort, though an unsuccessful one, has been made to recover it, by suing out legal process for that purpose. In McCulloh <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>17, which was a suit brought more than twenty years after the date of the instrument on which it was founded, the record of an earlier suit <em>for the same debt, </em>but in a different form of action, was declared by Chief Justice Tilghman to be proper and powerful evidence to rebut the presumption of payment set up by the defendant. But a former legal proceeding will not be allowed to have this effect if it was instituted for the sole purpose of repelling the presumption, and not in good faith, with the sincere object of recovering the debt claimed. Nor can it be said that the mere impetration of an original writ (I do not speak of a <em>scire facias),-without </em>service on the defendant, is the institution of a legal proceeding. The rule must also be understood with this further and very obvious modification, namely, that the suit relied on to repel the presumption of payment must have been commenced before the expiration of the twenty years, and not afterwards, as in the case of Cope <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>15; because, although the effort to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>a debt is a circumstance strong enough to prevent the presumption from arising, it is not sufficient to repel that presumption after it has acquired the full force which twenty years\u2019 supineness of the creditor would give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The present case is clearly within the rule. The plaintiff\u2019s proceeding in 1832, was the only one he could have adopted. It is marked with all the signs of a fair prosecution of his claim. He obtained a judgment in a way undeniably proper against the <em>terre </em>tenants, which put him in a condition to sell the defendant\u2019s land. Moreover, he recovered at the same time a judgment against the defendant himself, of which the regularity must be taken as admitted, since no application has been made to set it aside. These facts fully justified the judge of the District Court in charging the jury that the presumption from lapse of time did not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
