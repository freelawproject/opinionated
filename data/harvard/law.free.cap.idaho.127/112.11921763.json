This was her first year of teaching. She was hired by the District shortly before school started in September of 1990, and did not actually sign a formal contract of employment until the middle of that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-21\">On October 8, 1990, the principal of Washington School, Dennis Keogh, evaluated Brown\u2019s performance. Although some areas were identified as needing improvement, her overall performance was rated as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d On December 11,1990, assistant superintendent Tom Moore sent Brown a letter informing her that her name would appear on a tentative 1991-92 roster, filling a position as fifth grade teacher at the District\u2019s Lincoln School. On December 21, Brown received a second letter from Moore along with a copy of the tentative roster on which her name appeared. The second letter stated that the roster was \u201ctentative\u201d only in the sense that some teachers listed might choose to retire or seek another position. Brown advised District personnel that she intended to remain with the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-22\">On February 6, 1991, Keogh conducted a second evaluation of Brown\u2019s performance. Although her performance was again labeled \u201csatisfactory,\u201d her ratings on this evaluation were higher than those on the first. However, at a meeting of the District\u2019s board of trustees (the Board), Keogh recommended that Brown not be reemployed. The Board followed the recommendation and sent Brown a letter to that effect on May 22,1991. This letter stated that the Board\u2019s decision was based on the \u201cbelief that the school district\u2019s interest would be best served by not continuing a contract relationship with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-23\">On May 30, 1991, Brown requested an informal review of the Board\u2019s decision pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>suant to I.C. \u00a7 33-514. The review was held on June 4, 1991, but no specific substantive reasons for the Board\u2019s decision were revealed to Brown. On June 17, the Board reaffirmed its decision not to reemploy Brown. Brown subsequently brought this action alleging that the District had violated I.C. \u00a7 33-514, breached an alleged employment contract for the 1991-92 school year, and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The District made a motion for summary judgment which was granted by the district court. In ruling on the motion, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that I.C. \u00a7 33-514 was not violated, that no contract was formed relating to Brown\u2019s employment during the 1991-92 school year, and that the District did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">COMPLIANCE WITH I.C. \u00a7 33-514</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">There are two categories of public school teachers in Idaho: those with \u201crenewable contract\u201d status and those with \u201cannual contract\u201d status. Renewable contract teachers are those who have served three or more consecutive years in the same school district and who are entitled to \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d of their employment contracts. I.C. \u00a7 33-515. Annual contract teachers are those who have served less than three years in the same district. This latter group of teachers is notified on an annual basis whether they will be reemployed for the ensuing year. I.C. \u00a7 33-514. Brown was an annual contract teacher who was not reemployed following her first year of teaching. On appeal she argues that the District violated I.C. \u00a7 33-514 for two separate reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">A. Whether Brown\u2019s Performance was \u201cUnsatisfactory\u201d Within the Meaning of I.C. \u00a7 33-514</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Section 33-514 of the Idaho Code requires a school district which elects not to reemploy an annual contract teacher on the basis of unsatisfactory performance to first place that teacher on probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gunter v. Board of Trustees, Pocatello Sch. Dist. No. 25, </em>123 Idaho 910, 854 P.2d 253 (1993). Brown argues that although her work was formally evaluated as \u201csatisfactory,\u201d the decision not to reemploy her was actually based on the fact that the District found her performance unsatisfactory. Therefore, Brown contends she should have been placed on probation. The district court granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue, finding the record \u201cdevoid of any evidence that [Brown\u2019s] work was unsatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">When considering an appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment, this Court\u2019s standard of review is the same as that used by the district court in passing on the motion. <em>Curtis v. Firth, </em>123 Idaho 598, 610, 850 P.2d 749, 761 (1993). This standard requires the district court, and this Court on appeal, to construe liberally the facts in favor of the non-moving party and determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. I.R.C.P. 56(e); <em>Anderson v. City of Pocatello, </em>112 Idaho 176, 179, 731 P.2d 171, 174 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">We, like the district court, do not interpret I.C. \u00a7 33-514 to require probation every time an annual contract teacher is not reemployed. There are circumstances unrelated to performance deficiencies which would allow a school board to make a decision not to reemploy without implicating the statutory probation requirement. However, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, there is evidence in the record, apart from the mere fact that she was not reemployed, from which reasonable minds might conclude that Brown was not reemployed because the District found her performance unsatisfactory-</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The Board relies primarily on its principals\u2019 recommendations in determining whether to reemploy annual contract teachers. In this case, principal Keogh testified that current performance is one of the criteria on which he bases his recommendations. There is evidence that Keogh had concerns about Brown\u2019s communication skills. Further, in making his recommendation to the Board, Keogh stated that although Brown\u2019s work was \u201csatisfactory,\u201d he felt that he could hire someone better. He also told the Board that he would not want his own children in her class.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The District argues that the fact it believed it could hire someone better than Brown does not necessarily mean that Brown\u2019s work was unsatisfactory. We agree. However, if a performance deficiency in a teacher is such that it affects whether he or she will be reemployed, I.C. \u00a7 33-514 requires that that teacher be placed on probation. Reasonable minds could conclude that there is <em>something </em>wrong with a teacher\u2019s performance when she is not reemployed due to the possibility of employing a better teacher. This deficiency appears more serious when a principal has identified performance-related concerns and has even stated that he would not want his own children to be taught by that teacher. We hold that this evidence is sufficient at least to raise a factual question as to whether the District\u2019s decision was based on deficient or unsatisfactory performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the order of the district court granting summary judgment on this issue is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">B. Whether the Statement of Reasons Provided by the District for its Decision not to Reemploy Brown was Insufficient</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Section 33-514 of the Idaho Code also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">each [annual contract teacher] shall be given notice, in writing, whether he or she will be reemployed for the next ensuing year.... If the board of trustees has decided not to reemploy the certificated employee, then the notice must contain a statement of reasons for such decision and the employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Brown contends that \u00a7 33-514 requires an accurate statement providing specific reasons for a decision not to reemploy. According to Brown, the statement\u2019s purpose is to pinpoint the problem leading to the adverse decision and to enable a teacher to respond to the charge. In this case, the District sent Brown a letter stating that its decision not to reemploy her \u201cwas based on the Board\u2019s belief that the school district\u2019s interest would be best served by not continuing a contract relationship with you.\u201d Since this \u201creason\u201d was meaningless, Brown contends that the District violated \u00a7 33-514. The district court, on the other hand, concluded that the statement\u2019s purpose is simply to allow the teacher to make an informed decision about whether to request an informal review. According to the district court, the question of the adequacy of a statement of reasons loses all importance where review is actually sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>A statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be rendered superfluous or insignificant. <em>Norton v. Department of Employment, </em>94 Idaho 924, 928, 500 P.2d 825, 829 (1972) (citations omitted). Further, we do not presume that the legislature performed an idle act by enacting a meaningless provision. <em>Sweitzer v. Dean, </em>118 Idaho 568, 572, 798 P.2d 27, 31 (1990) (citations omitted). Applying these rules of construction to I.C. \u00a7 33-514, it appears that the requirement of a statement of reasons was included to provide a teacher with the means to develop a meaningful response to an adverse decision by a board of trustees. It is clear that a teacher cannot dispute the reasons for an adverse decision when that teacher is not given notice of what those reasons are. In this scenario, the informal review expressly provided for by statute becomes a meaningless exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">We hold, as a matter of law, that the statement of reasons provided by the Board in this case was in violation I.C. \u00a7 33-514. The Board essentially informed Brown that its decision was based on the belief that the District would be better off without her. However, it failed to supply any reason <em>why </em>it believed the District would be better off. As the district court found, the statement \u201cdoes not really convey any real information as to why Brown\u2019s contract was not renewed.\u201d Thus, Brown was given no meaningful opportunity to show why the decision was incorrect. Accordingly, the order of the district court granting summary judgment on this issue is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">WHETHER AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE DISTRICT AND BROWN FOR THE 1991-92 SCHOOL YEAR</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In December of 1990, assistant superintendent Moore informed Brown that her name appeared on the tentative 1991-92 roster for Lincoln School and that the roster was \u201ctentative\u201d only in the sense that some of the teachers listed might retire or seek a different position. Brown claims that these communications gave rise to an employment contract for the 1991-92 school year and that the District\u2019s decision not to reemploy her was, therefore, a breach of contract. The district court disagreed and granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The communications which Brown claims gave rise to an employment contract were not made by the Board, but by assistant superintendent Moore. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine at the outset whether Moore had any type of authority to enter into an employment contract on behalf of the Board. The burden of establishing an agency relationship is on the party asserting it. <em>Transamerica Leasing Corp. v. Van\u2019s Realty Co., Inc., </em>91 Idaho 510, 427 P.2d 284 (1967). Since Brown has pointed to no evidence of express or implied authority in the record, the question becomes whether Moore had apparent authority. We conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Apparent authority is created when a principal voluntarily places an agent in such a position that a reasonable person, conversant with the business usages and nature of the particular business, is justified in believing that the agent is acting pursuant to existing authority. <em>Clark v. Gneiting, </em>95 Idaho 10, 12, 501 P.2d 278, 280 (1972). Certainly the communications from Moore imply that he was authorized to speak on behalf of the Board and that the District intended to reemploy Brown. However, apparent authority cannot be created by the acts or statements of the alleged agent alone. <em>E.g., Idaho Title Co. v. American States Ins. Co., </em>96 Idaho 465, 468, 531 P.2d 227, 230 (1975). During the 1990-91 school year, Brown worked for a time before a formal employment contract was executed. This ratification of an informal employment agreement is an action by the Board which could give rise to a belief that District administrators are authorized to enter into informal employment contracts. The issue is whether such a belief is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Section 33-513 of the Idaho Code sets out a detailed procedure to be followed when a school district seeks to employ professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>personnel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since Brown can be fairly charged with knowledge of this provision, <em>Powers v. Canyon County, </em>108 Idaho 967, 703 P.2d 1342 (1985), any belief on her part that Moore could contract with her outside of the statutory procedure was unjustified. Thus, Moore lacked apparent authority to enter into a binding contract on behalf of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Brown also contends that the District is bound by operation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel. This doctrine is grounded on the concept of justifiable reliance on the part of a promisee. <em>Smith v. Boise Kenworth Sales, Inc., </em>102 Idaho 63, 67-68, 625 P.2d 417, 421-22 (1981). Not only did Moore lack authority to make a promise of continued employment on behalf of the District, Brown\u2019s reliance on such a promise is unjustified in light of I.C. \u00a7 33-513. Thus, the doctrine of promissory estoppel is inapplicable. The order of the district court granting summary judgment on the issue of the formation of an employment contract is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">WHETHER THE DISTRICT BREACHED THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In <em>Metcalf v. Intermountain Gas Co., </em>116 Idaho 622, 778 P.2d 744 (1989), we adopted an implied-in-law covenant of good faith and fair dealing as part of every employment contract. As Brown correctly asserts, the statutory requirements detailed in I.C. \u00a7 33-514 became part of her contract with the District for the 1990-91 school year. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 150, </em>100 Idaho 263, 265, 596 P.2d 436, 438 (1979) (extant law is written into and made part of every contract). Therefore, she contends that because the District deprived her of the benefit of these statutory/eontractual rights, it breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Although the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 33-514 technically became part of her employment contract, Brown has not alleged any act in violation of the implied covenant in addition to the statutory violations enumerated above. Any relief to which Brown is entitled for a violation of the statutory procedure is provided directly by the statute itself, and no additional remedy is provided by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, the order of the district court granting summary judgment on this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">The district court\u2019s determinations relating to the existence of an employment contract and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are hereby affirmed. The granting of summary judgment was improper on the issue of the District\u2019s compliance with I.C. \u00a7 33-514 and that decision is, therefore, reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>attorney fees are awarded on appeal. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-4\">McDEVTTT, C.J., JOHNSON, SILAK, JJ., and TRANSTRUM, J. Pro Tem., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. Idaho Code \u00a7 33-514 provides in relevant part: When any [annual contract teacher\u2019s] work is found to be unsatisfactory a reasonable period of probation shall be established by the board after which action shall he taken by the board as to whether the employee is to be retained, immediately discharged, discharged upon termination of the current contract or reemployed at the end of the contract term under a continued probationary status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. The District has argued that the satisfactory marks on Brown\u2019s formal evaluations are conclusive as to her level of performance; therefore, its decision not to reemploy her could not have been based on unsatisfactory performance. This position is untenable. Although I.C. \u00a7 33-514 contemplates the use of formal performance evaluations, whether a teacher is not reemployed due to unsatisfactory performance is a question that cannot be answered solely by reference to those evaluations. In other words, a school district cannot simply raise evaluations marked \"satisfactory\u201d as a shield to further inquiry into a decision not to reemploy a teacher. Where, as here, evidence is produced raising questions as to whether such a decision was <em>in fact </em>based on deficient performance, summary judgment is inappropriate notwithstanding the existence of satisfactory evaluations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. Although the requirement of notice with regard to renewable contract teachers is a means of providing procedural due process, <em>Ferguson v. Board of Trustees, </em>98 Idaho 359, 564 P.2d 971 (1977), non-tenured teachers have not been found to have a \"property\" interest in continued employment. <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Loebeck v. Idaho Estate Bd. of Educ., </em>96 Idaho 459, 530 P.2d 1149 (1975). Thus, Brown was not entitled to procedural due process and the analysis in this case is confined to an application of I.C. \u00a7 33-514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">. Idaho Code \u00a7 33-513 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZp\">Professional personnel. \u2014 The board of trustees of each school district ... shall have the following powers and duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">1.
