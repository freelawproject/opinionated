Peterson injured his back in the course of his employment on May 20, 1990. Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation (Liberty) is Shilo Inn\u2019s surety for worker\u2019s compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">On June 11, 1990, Peterson sought chiropractic treatment from Dr. John Downey, doing business as Downey Chiropractic Clinic (Downey).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">On July 6, 1990, Liberty\u2019s claims adjustor, Tom Harrison (Harrison), became aware of Peterson\u2019s claim for benefits and informed him that Nampa Restaurant Corporation had a designated medical provider, Medical Center Physicians. Harrison then advised Peterson that, unless he undertook treatment by that provider, his temporary total disability benefits would cease. When Peterson informed Harrison that he would like to continue treatment with Downey, Harrison further advised Peterson that any future such treatment would be at his own expense. Harrison did not base this determination on any medical consultation with a health care provider, or on the basis of a physical examination of Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">As a result of this conversation, Peterson terminated his treatment with Downey, despite the fact that Downey offered to continue treatment free of charge if Liberty would not pay. Peterson declined this offer because he felt it would be wrong to accept free treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">At the time Peterson discontinued treatment with Downey, Downey was uncertain as to Peterson\u2019s prognosis, but gave a conservative estimate that Peterson would require eight weeks of additional treatment. On July 17, 1990, Peterson was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Schneider, who diagnosed Peterson\u2019s condition as a herniated disk. Dr. Schneider testified that the conservative chiropractic treatment that Peterson had received was reasonable given his condition, and that such treatment would have continued to be reasonable for at least another' month. After receiving additional physical therapy, Peterson eventually underwent surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">Downey filed this action on May 29, 1991, followed by an amended complaint two days later. In his complaint, Downey claimed that Liberty intentionally interfered with Dow-ney\u2019s prospective economic relationship with Peterson by refusing to pay for Downey\u2019s continued treatment of Peterson. Downey prayed for judgment against Liberty in the amount of $1,118.00 together with accruing interest to the date of judgment, and statutory interest from and after the date of judgment. Downey also prayed for relief to amend his complaint to include punitive damages and for an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">On July 18,1991, Liberty filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to I.R.C.P. 12(b)(1), challenging the magistrate court\u2019s jurisdiction. That motion was denied, and the matter was tried on July 17, 1992. Liberty again moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, which motion was likewise denied. Judgment for Downey was entered on September 17, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>As the prevailing party, Downey moved for an award of reasonable attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1) and (3). The court granted Downey\u2019s motion and an amended judgment was entered November 30, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Liberty appealed the case to the district court. Downey cross-appealed for attorney fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1). Judgment affirming the magistrate\u2019s decision in favor of Downey, but denying Downey\u2019s motion for attorney fees on appeal, was entered by the district court on September 7, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Liberty now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">This Court exercises free review over questions of law. When this Court reviews a case appealed from the district court\u2019s appellate review of a magistrate\u2019s decision, we independently review the magistrate\u2019s decision, giving due regard to the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Ausman v. State, </em>124 Idaho 839, 840-41, 864 P.2d 1126, 1127-28 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">The threshold issue in this appeal is whether the magistrate court had jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter. Liberty argues that the magistrate court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Dow-ney\u2019s claim because it presents a question of law arising under our worker\u2019s compensation law, namely: Whether Liberty, as Shilo Inn\u2019s surety, has a statutory duty to pay for Dow-ney\u2019s reasonable medical treatment of Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">The Idaho Industrial Commission (Commission) has exclusive jurisdiction of all questions arising under our worker\u2019s compensation law. I.C. \u00a7 72-707. As we recently noted in <em>Van Tine v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, </em>126 Idaho 688, 889 P.2d 717 (1994), when a claim arises under our worker\u2019s compensation laws, the trial court lacks jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 889 P.2d at 718. Thus it is our task to examine the worker\u2019s compensation law to determine whether there is any portion of that law under which the present claim may be said to arise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">In <em>Van Tine, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that the employer\u2019s surety violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing and its fiduciary duty by initially refusing to satisfy Kerby Van Tine\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation claims. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed the Van Tines\u2019 claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">To the extent that the Van Tines allege that SIF contested claims for compensation without reasonable ground, refused within a reasonable time to pay compensation, or without reasonable ground discontinued payment of compensation justly due and owing, their claims arise under I.C. \u00a7 72-804, and the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Here, Downey\u2019s claim does not arise under, nor require interpretation or application of, our worker\u2019s compensation law. Rather, it is a separate tort, wholly distinct from our worker\u2019s compensation statutory scheme. Unlike the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in <em>Van Tine, </em>our worker\u2019s compensation law does not provide a remedy for Downey\u2019s claim. Thus, the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-19\">THE MAGISTRATE COURT DID NOT ERR IN ALLOWING DOWNEY\u2019S CLAIM FOR INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH A PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b321-20\">A. THE TORT OF INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH A PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-21\">In <em>Idaho First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bliss Valley Foods, Inc., </em>121 Idaho 266, 824 P.2d 841 (1991), we held that, in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship, a plaintiff must show that the claimed interference was wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself. <em>Id. </em>at 286, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>824 P.2d at 861. Accordingly, the plaintiff must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">(1) The defendant had an improper purpose or objective to harm the plaintiff; or (2) The defendant used a wrongful means to cause injury to the prospective business relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In so ruling, we adopted the <em>Oregon </em>Supreme Court\u2019s formulation of this tort, as outlined in <em>Top Serv. Body Shop, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>283 Or. 201, 582 P.2d 1365 (1978). In that case, the plaintiff alleged that Allstate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">sought to and did induce Top Service\u2019s patrons not to have Top Service repair their automobiles, making false statements about the quality of plaintiffs workmanship and threats about withdrawing insurance coverage or subjecting the settlement of claims to possible arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Id. 582 P.2d at 1371. Top Service also alleged that Allstate\u2019s conduct was \u201cwith the sole design of injuring Plaintiff and destroying his business.\u201d <em>Id. The Oregon Supreme </em>Court held that these allegations, if proven along with causation and damages, would satisfy the elements of the tort of intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Although there was no direct evidence that Allstate acted with a specific purpose to destroy Top Service\u2019s business, Top Service argued that such a purpose could be inferred from evidence of Allstate\u2019s conduct in directing customers to other body repair shops. <em>Id. at </em>1371-72. However, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the record would not support such an inference. <em>Id </em>at 1372. In particular, the court held that Allstate\u2019s designation of certain repair shops as \u201ccompetitive shops\u201d to which it preferred to send insurance claimants, together with its discontinued use of Top Service as a \u201cdrive-in\u201d shop where claimants were directed for estimates by an Allstate claims adjuster following a dispute with Top Service, and Allstate adjusters\u2019 active discouragement of claimants\u2019 use of Top Service and their disparagement of the quality of Top Service\u2019s work, were acts \u201cwholly consistent with Allstate\u2019s pursuit of its own business purposes as it saw them and did not suffice to support an inference of the alleged improper purpose to injure Top Service.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">In discussing the elements necessary to establish the tort of intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship by improper means, the <em>Top Service </em>court stated that improper means may be wrongful by reason of a statute or other regulation, or a recognized mile of common law, or an established standard of a trade or profession. <em>Top Serv., </em>582 P.2d at 1371. Some additional examples of improper means cited by the <em>Top Service </em>court include violence, threats or other intimidation, deceit or misrepresentation, bribery, unfounded litigation, defamation, or disparaging falsehood. <em>Id. </em>at 1371 n. 11. However, while the court stated that Allstate\u2019s conduct may well have constituted intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship by improper means, it did not reach that issue because the case had not been submitted to the jury on that theory-</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">B. DOWNEY\u2019S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">Like the defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Top Service, </em>Liberty\u2019s insistence that Peterson receive treatment from Shilo Inn\u2019s designated medical provider, its threat to discontinue Peterson\u2019s temporary total disability benefits if he refused to seek treatment from the designated provider, and its refusal to pay for Peterson\u2019s continued treatment by Downey do not support an inference that Liberty\u2019s sole motivation was to harm Downey.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">However, while the above cited conduct does not support an inference that Liberty\u2019s sole motivation was to harm Downey, such conduct is contrary to established professional standards for sureties. Thus, Liberty employed improper means to cause injury to Downey\u2019s prospective economic relationship with Peterson and, as a matter of law, judgment was properly entered in favor of Dow-ney.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">THE MAGISTRATE COURT DID NOT ERR IN AWARDING DOWNEY ATTORNEY FEES PURSUANT TO I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Liberty next argues that, because Downey prayed for leave to amend his com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>plaint to seek punitive damages in addition to the $1,118.00 he sought in actual damages, it was error for the magistrate to award him attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Liberty bases this argument on the limitation of that statute\u2019s application to \u201cany action where the amount pleaded is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or less[.]\u201d I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">However, at the time Liberty briefed this issue, it did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cox v. Mueller, </em>125 Idaho 734, 874 P.2d 545 (1994). In <em>Cox, </em>we noted that I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1) and our decision in <em>Pancoast v. Indian Cove Irrigation Dist., </em>121 Idaho 984, 829 P.2d 1333 (1992), place a \u201cpremium on the pleadings.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>125 Idaho at 737, 874 P.2d at 548. Thus we held that the district court erred when it construed a statement by Cox\u2019s counsel during closing argument, to the effect that the jury was free to decide whether to award more than $25,-000 in damages, as a waiver of Cox\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Similarly, Downey\u2019s unutilized prayer for leave to amend his complaint to seek unspecified punitive damages should not be construed as a waiver to his entitlement to attorney fees under this statute. As we noted in <em>Cox:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">The obvious purpose of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1) is to discourage litigation, since the statute requires the defendant to be notified of the plaintiffs claim against the defendant for at least ten days before a complaint can even be filed. In the event that a complaint is filed, the statute again encourages early settlement by requiring that the pleadings warn the parties that this statute will be invoked for mandatory attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\"><em>Id. </em>By pleading actual damages of $1,118.00, including a prayer for attorney fees, and otherwise complying with the terms of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1), Downey gave Liberty sufficient notice of the amount of his claim as well as his intent to seek attorney fees. Thus, the magistrate court\u2019s award of attorney fees was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">YI.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">DOWNEY IS ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL PURSUANT TO I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">Downey argues on cross appeal that it was error for the district court to deny him attorney fees as the prevailing party on appeal to that court. Although Downey requested attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1), the district denied Downey\u2019s request based on the discretionary language of I.C. \u00a7 12-121<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1), which limits the discretionary application of I.C. \u00a7 12-121 to those cases which the court finds are \u201cbrought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\u201d This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">This Court has held that I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> generally mandates an award of attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fees to the prevailing party on appeal as well as at trial. <em>Bott v. Idaho State Bldg. Auth., </em>122 Idaho 471, 481, 835 P.2d 1282, 1292 (1992). In light of the fact that the language of both I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1) and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is mandatory, the holding of <em>Bott </em>equally pertains here. Thus, Downey is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party on appeal to the district court, pursuant'to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1). Likewise, Downey is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party on appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">YII.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the magistrate\u2019s decision in favor of Downey\u2019s claim that Liberty tortiously interfered with his prospective economic relationship with Peterson. We likewise affirm the magistrate\u2019s award of attorney fees to Downey pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(1). We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of an award of attorney fees to Downey on appeal to that court, and we award attorney fees to Downey as the prevailing party on appeal to this Court. Costs on appeal are awarded to Dow-ney, pursuant to I.A.R. 40.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-7\">JOHNSON, TROUT and SILAK, JJ., and GUITIERREZ, Justice Pro Tern, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">.12-120.
