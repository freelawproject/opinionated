The defendant\u2019s appeal has been consolidated with the automatic review of his death sentence and given priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The facts will be stated in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Pamela Benner was nineteen years old in February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>1982. After leaving high school, she had worked at the Pentagon, but on February 25, 1982, was unemployed and living in her parents\u2019 home in Woodbridge. She was acquainted with the defendant, but was not particularly fond of him. It had been more than three months since she had last seen him. She stayed at home most days, but, having an interest in popular music groups, she attended band performances at night. Frequently, she invited band members, their wives, and girlfriends to her parents\u2019 home during the day. Mr. and Mrs. Benner were both employed. They became concerned about occasional items missing from the house and habitually locked the door to their bedroom to safeguard their belongings. Pamela\u2019s brother, Rick, also worked during the day and kept his bedroom door locked for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">About 5:40 p.m. on February 25, 1982, Pamela\u2019s parents and brother returned home from work together. The front door was open. There was a strong smell of \u201cammonia, Clorox or something of this nature,\u201d and the kitchen exhaust fan was running. The doors to both the parents\u2019 and Rick\u2019s bedrooms had been kicked in. The locks and many wood splinters were on the floor. There were bloodstains on the broken doors and pieces of hair and blood on the floor. Pamela\u2019s purse was in the middle of her bed, and some articles from it had been emptied onto the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In a downstairs family room they found Pamela\u2019s body. Her ankles were bound together with masking tape and a cord from a stereo headset. An ice pick and a two-pronged carving fork were protruding from her back. She had three \u201cpenetrating wounds\u201d beside the right eye, and over forty other wounds, abrasions, and lacerations covering her body. The back of her head was crushed by blows from a blunt instrument. There were some stab wounds which showed no hemorrhaging. In the medical examiner\u2019s opinion, this indicated that they had been inflicted after heartbeat had ceased. Some of the wounds to the hands were described as \u201cdefensive,\u201d evidently incurred while the victim tried to ward off additional blows. She was clad in a long green bathrobe. It and the body had been soaked in a liquid bleach, which discolored the fabric and burned the skin. A curtain rod lay on her body, and a fireplace poker lay on a blanket near her feet. Charred marks on the carpet indicated that an unsuccessful effort had been made to burn the body. A telephone jack receptable was found on the floor near the victim\u2019s feet. A latent fingerprint was found on it which proved to be the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The defendant\u2019s blood-spattered shoes and clothing were later found in a plastic bag in a trash \u201cdumpster\u201d some distance from his home. Forensic laboratory tests identified the stains as having been made by the victim\u2019s blood. Various items stolen from the victim\u2019s family home the day of the murder were found in the bag with the clothing. Some of these items had been kept in the locked bedrooms which had been kicked open.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Gerald Frazier testified that he had known the defendant for two years. At about 4:15 p.m. on February 25, 1982, the defendant came, with his wife, to the apartment where Frazier was visiting, and asked \u201cif I could give him an alibi, that he needed to say that he was with me from two to four o\u2019clock . . . that day.\u201d The defendant was smiling and seemed normal. He showed no signs of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Frazier told him that he would be unable to provide an alibi because he had attended a job interview at 2:30 p.m. When he asked why an alibi was needed, the defendant said \u201che had killed somebody.\u201d He said it had been a girl named \u201cPam .... some big, fat slob ... I went to rob her.\u201d Frazier testified that the defendant told him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">A. He said that he came in through the back of the house. And he said that first he hit her in the back of the head with some object. I can\u2019t remember what the object was, but he hit her with it and she fell to the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">And he said she pleaded with him to stop, to leave her alone. She even said that she loved him so that, you know, he would leave her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">And he said, you know, the bitch wouldn\u2019t die and he kept hitting her. And then he said he got a two-pronged kitchen fork and stabbed her, and an ice pick, and stabbed her repeatedly with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">And then he said that he looked for money and all he could find was about two sixty-five in change, or something like that. Then he said that he couldn\u2019t stand to be in the house any longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">He tried to destroy the evidence by using a bleach or laundry detergent \u2014 that\u2019s what he said \u2014 to pour over her. To get rid of fingerprints and things like that. Then he said \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">Q. Did you ask him anything about the effect of that bleach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">Q. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>A. </em>Well, he just said, you know, he thought it was like acid. You know, he thought it would remove the fingerprints and destroy the evidence or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The defendant then told Frazier that he had gone home, changed clothes, showered, and threw his clothing in a \u201cdumpster\u201d at the Bayview Apartments. Frazier told him to \u201cgo and turn himself in. And I didn\u2019t want to have any part to do with it. I wasn\u2019t going to give him an alibi or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Later that evening the defendant called Frazier and held the telephone close to a police radio scanner to which the defendant was listening. Frazier could hear the police radio transmissions discussing a \u201cpossible D.O.A.\u201d The defendant told Frazier he was thinking of going to Kentucky to stay with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The next day the defendant went with his attorneys to the Garfield substation and surrendered himself to the police. He stood by a police officer who was seeking the issuance of a robbery warrant from a magistrate. When the officer stated that the Benners had reported a theft of about twenty dollars in cash from their home, the defendant, who had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, interrupted and said, \u201cI only got three dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Later, while riding with an officer in a police car, the defendant said, \u201cIf I\u2019d burned her, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through this . . . [expletive deleted].\u201d The defendant later testified that he could not recall making this remark, but that he might have said it and would not deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The defendant made no denial of the atrocious nature of the crime or of his responsibility for the killing. This was made clear to the jury in the opening statement of the defense. Defense counsel told the jury that the evidence would not show the defendant guilty of capital murder, but rather would show guilt of \u201ca lesser degree of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The defendant testified that he was living with his wife and child in his mother\u2019s home in February 1982. His father, with whom he was particularly close, had died the previous year. The defendant is Vietnamese, having been adopted by the LeVasseurs when he was two years old. He was unemployed at the time and felt guilty about living in his mother\u2019s home because he was not helping her with the family printing business. He said that he looked for jobs sporadically. He was depressed and attempted to relieve his depression by the heavy use of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>On February 25, 1982, he said his wife awoke him around 10:30 a.m., and asked him if he was going out to look for a job. He said he dressed and smoked \u201cfrom seven to ten bong hits\u201d of marijuana, which was not unusual for him. He then went to two service stations which had advertised for help, but was turned down by both. He then went to a restaurant and consumed \u201ctwo beers\u201d plus \u201ca hit of acid\u201d (lycergic acid diethylamide, or LSD), on a piece of paper. He said he then felt \u201climp\u201d and had impaired vision. He went to Pam Benner\u2019s house because it was nearby and he wanted to get out of the car and either \u201ccrash out or just talk about what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Pam, he testified, did not immediately answer the door. He looked in a basement window and saw her in the recreation room \u201csitting and eating eggs, I think, watching T.V.\u201d He attracted her attention, and she admitted him to the home. He said he \u201chad a migraine headache, and . . . was feeling terrible ... I felt like there was a brick inside my head.\u201d He said they discussed his work situation, his living arrangements, and the recent death of his father. Pam had formerly worked in the LeVasseurs\u2019 print shop and had a photo album containing a picture of his father. She showed this to him and \u201cwas making snide remarks because we had it made or I really had it made as far as living under the same roof with my mother and getting free meals and working in the same place of employment.\u201d Then, he testified, \u201c I didn\u2019t take too kindly of it and I started getting upset and then the next thing alls I remember was a flash of light went into my head and \u2014 all I remember is seeing my father in Walter Reed \u2014 I mean Fort Belvoir Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">He said he then heard a woman\u2019s screams, but the next thing he remembered seeing was Pam\u2019s body with \u201ctwo objects sticking from the back.\u201d He said he had been sitting behind Pam, massaging her back, when the \u201cflash of light\u201d occurred, and that he remembered none of the intervening events.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The defendant further testified that he \u201cwent hysteric and panic,\u201d ran up the stairs and kicked open two doors \u201cto get out.\u201d He remembered the smell of bleach and the bloodstains on his shoes, pants, and hands. He saw the masking tape and \u201crope\u201d around the victim\u2019s ankles.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The defendant said that he had no recollection of removing any objects from the house, but that while he was driving home he noticed that he had with him, lying on the passenger seat of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>car, a photo album, a calculator, two watches, \u201cand money lying all over the seat.\u201d When he arrived home, he said he was feeling \u201cdisgust [sic] and scared.\u201d His wife told him to take a shower while she put all of the items taken from the Benner home, together with the defendant\u2019s clothing, into a plastic bag. He testified that while in the shower, he saw a murder inside his head. \u201cIt was me beating up on Pam Benner . . . with a poker.\u201d He and his wife then drove to the Bayview Apartments where they disposed of the plastic bag in a \u201cbig, giant dumpster.\u201d They then went to a bank where his wife withdrew some money. \u201c[A]t the time we didn\u2019t know whether I was going to skip town or turn myself in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The defendant largely corroborated Frazier\u2019s testimony. He admitted that he had gone to Frazier to ask him for an alibi and that he had disclosed the murder. He did not recall having referred to the victim as \u201ca fat slob,\u201d but said he would probably have said it \u201cto be macho at the time.\u201d He admitted having said to Frazier that \u201cthe bitch wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d Asked to explain this remark, he said, \u201cBecause \u2014 well, when I was in the house there was more than just stabs on her.\u201d He remembered having called Frazier later and listening to reports of a \u201cpossible D.O.A.\u201d on the radio scanner.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Later that evening the defendant called another friend, Mike Hamilton, to \u201ccome over and party with me \u2014 I\u2019ve got some good pot.\u201d Hamilton had other plans. The defendant then took \u201cabout 15 to 20 bong hits and had about two or three glasses of Jack Daniels.\u201d The next day, accompanied by his counsel, he surrendered himself to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The defendant denied going to the Benner house for the purpose of robbing Pamela. He did admit, however, that two weeks earlier he had discussed with Mike Hamilton the prospect of committing burglaries and specifically proposed a robbery of another woman for the purpose of raising money.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth called three fellow inmates of the Prince William County jail, with whom the defendant had, while in custody, discussed the case. All were convicted felons. Bruce Jackson testified that the defendant told him that he had gone to Pam\u2019s house for sexual favors, that when she rebuffed him he had beaten her with a poker, and that he had gone upstairs to the kitchen, obtained a large fork, an ice pick, and a steak knife, stabbed her with them and then poured some kind of \u201cdetergent\u201d over her. He said that the defendant described taking watches, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>calculators, and money from the house, all of which he later hid in a garbage bag with his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Donald McKenna testified that the defendant told him a similar story as to his motive, that the defendant said the victim\u2019s skull \u201csounded like a coconut breaking when he was hitting her,\u201d with the poker, that the defendant said \u201cthe bitch wouldn\u2019t die,\u201d and that after obtaining the fork and ice pick, he lay down beside the body to ascertain the location of the heart in order to be sure to stab her fatally.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Louis Aris Mendy testified that the defendant told him that he had argued with Pam over money. The defendant gave him a similar account of the beating and stabbing, then said that he returned to the kitchen, got some \u201cClorox,\u201d and poured it over the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defense was based entirely upon the contention that the defendant was so affected by the drugs and alcohol he had ingested that he was incapable of premeditation or deliberation at the time of the killing. He further argues that the evidence shows that the intent to commit robbery did not come into existence until after the killing, and that he was therefore guilty of no more than second-degree murder. The defendant filed fifty-six assignments of error, which he has reduced to eleven questions presented on appeal. We shall consider them <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">A. Jury Selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">I. <em>Voir Dire </em>Examination as to Jurors\u2019 Attitudes Toward the Death Penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The defendant argues that subjecting veniremen to a test as to their ability to apply the death penalty, in a proper case, deprives him of a fair cross section of the community and provides him with a jury that is \u201cguilt prone.\u201d He sought to introduce statistical evidence to this effect, similar to that relied upon in <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>28 Cal.3d 1, 616 P.2d 1301 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">We have specifically approved the examination of veniremen, on <em>voir dire, </em>as to their willingness, or lack thereof, to impose capital punishment. <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 251 S.E.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 273 S.E.2d 36 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1011 (1981). Moreover, we have expressly rejected the type of evidence adduced in <em>Hovey, Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>S.E.2d 905 (1981), <em>cert. </em>denied, 455 U.S. 983 (1982), and we continue to adhere to that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">II. Change of Venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The defendant filed a motion for a change of venue which was argued six days before trial. In support thereof, he offered sixteen newspaper clippings and a privately-taken local opinion poll. The court received the newspaper clippings in evidence, but rejected the results of the opinion poll. No affidavits were offered in support of the motion. The court denied the motion, but stated that it might be renewed if <em>voir dire </em>questioning should reveal widespread prejudice against the defendant. The court also indicated its intention to question the veniremen directly with respect to pre-trial publicity and possible bias resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">At trial, thirty-three veniremen were subjected to <em>voir dire </em>questions, at first together and then in groups of two. Three were excused because of personal acquaintance with the defendant or the victim. Of the remaining thirty, only ten recalled any exposure to publicity concerning the case. None of them was aware of any bias against the defendant, none had formed an opinion as to his guilt, and all stated a willingness to lay aside whatever they had heard or read and to decide the case solely on the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions. Indeed, the defendant concedes on brief that \u201cthe record discloses no widespread prejudice during voir dire,\u201d but argues that this is of little significance since <em>voir dire </em>was limited and the judge\u2019s questions were \u201cleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We find no undue limitations in the record as to <em>voir dire </em>questioning on the subject of bias. The trial judge asked questions designed to elicit responses showing the effects of pretrial publicity, and there is no indication that appropriate follow-up questions would have been prohibited, if any had been indicated. In fact, none were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">It is presumed that a defendant can receive a fair trial in the locality where, the offense occurred, and the burden is on the accused to overcome that presumption by clearly demonstrating widespread prejudice against him. <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 248, 257 S.E.2d 797, 801 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). The trial court\u2019s discretion in ruling upon such a motion will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing of abuse. <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 41, 50, 286 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>172, 177 (1982). No such showing was made here. The news articles tendered to the court simply reported the facts, which are shocking in themselves. They were not inflammatory. They were numerous, but sheer volume of publicity is not alone sufficient to justify a change of venue. <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 538, 273 S.E.2d 48, 52 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981). The trial court\u2019s discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">III. <em>Voir Dire </em>Examination as to Jurors\u2019 Attitudes Toward the Use of Drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">After all prospective jurors had been subjected to <em>voir dire </em>questioning as a group, they were sequestered and groups of two were brought into the courtroom for further questioning. One of these pairs consisted of Anna V. Cornwell and Linda Curren. The court propounded questions to both concerning pre-trial publicity, the existence of any bias or prejudice, the formation of opinion, as to guilt, willingness to base a verdict solely on the law and the evidence, and attitudes toward the death penalty. The Commonwealth Attorney asked two questions concerning their willingness to impose the death penalty if the law and evidence so warranted. When defense counsel arose to question them, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">The Court: Mr. Zauzig.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Mr. Zauzig: I would assume that both of you are opposed to drugs, the use of illegal drugs. Do you have any bias or prejudice that would make you unable to consider the usage by the defendant, of illegal drugs, as part of his defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">Ms. Cornwell: Say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Mr. Zauzig: Would you be able to \u2014 would you be unable to consider the usage by the defendant of illegal drugs, as a part of his defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">Ms. Cornwell: I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">The Court: You would be able to consider it or \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">Ms. Cornwell: I would be against the use of the drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">The Court: That presumption is there for all law-abiding citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">The fact that he might have used that \u2014 the fact that it may develop that he had used illegal drugs, could you consider that as a part of his defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-15\">Ms. Cornwell: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Mr. Zauzig: Your Honor, I have a motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">The Court: Motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Notwithstanding this ruling, the record discloses that Anna Cornwell was struck from the jury as a result of peremptory challenge by the Commonwealth, rather than by the defendant. The defendant argues that he had a constitutional right to twelve impartial jurors who would freely entertain his defense of voluntary intoxication, and erroneously argues on brief that he was forced to use one of his peremptory strikes to remove her, since, she \u201charbored a bias and prejudice toward the use of [illegal] drugs, which was a fundamental issue in the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Leaving aside the defendant\u2019s error in asserting that this ruling cost him a peremptory strike, his underlying argument is fallacious. Indeed, it is to be hoped that all responsible citizens are prejudiced against the use of illegal drugs. A challenge for cause based upon such a question would eliminate from the jury all except those who approve of crime. A proper question, which might have been framed to meet the defendant\u2019s concern, would have inquired whether the juror could follow the court\u2019s instruction which would reduce the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility if the jury found that he was so affected by voluntary intoxication as to be incapable of premeditation or deliberation. The questions, as asked, are equivocal: \u201cWould you be able to \u2014 would you be unable to . . . .\u201d They were in fact clearly misunderstood by the juror: \u201cI would be against the use of the drugs.\u201d Further, a question which asks whether the juror would be able to consider the use of illegal drugs \u201cas a part of his defense\u201d is so ambiguous as to render the answer meaningless. Does it ask whether the juror would consider drug intoxication a mitigating factor, or does it ask whether the juror would treat it as total justification or excuse for the crime, necessitating an acquittal? No principle of law would support the last premise. Because the question was improper, the motion to challenge the juror for cause was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">IV. Further <em>Voir Dire </em>Questions Concerning Attitudes Toward the Use of Illegal Drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">At a pretrial hearing, the court directed counsel to submit in writing their respective proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions. In response, the defendant submitted a list of fifty-eight questions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>eight of which inquired elaborately into the attitudes of veniremen toward illegal drugs in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The court held that the proposed questions were argumentative and ambiguous. However, the court advised counsel that he would have an opportunity to rephrase them and that such an effort would be considered at the beginning of trial. The defendant made no objection to the ruling, but agreed to rephrase the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">No written rephrasing of the questions appears in the record. Counsel was, however, permitted to propound questions on this subject orally to the prospective jurors as they came before the court in groups of two. Each time the question was asked, its phraseology differed. The first time it was used, counsel asked: \u201cDo any of the two of you, or would either of you be unable to consider evidence of the use of illegal drugs in support of defense to the crime of murder?\u201d There was no response. With each successive pair of veniremen, the question became more convoluted, but no more precise. Eventually, the Commonwealth objected. The court suggested a revision, which would meet the objection, but counsel, rather than adopting the suggestion, rephrased the question as quoted in the previous section, and propounded it to Anna Cornwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">After the Cornwell colloquy, another pair of jurors was subjected to <em>voir dire </em>examination. When defense counsel arose to interrogate them, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Mr. Zauzig, the other question which you have asked in the past has been rephrased. The Court has previously ruled on this question and how this should come forward. It did not come forward. What your question in the past has been getting at is, in effect, asking the jury to sanction what is an illegal act. For that reason, I\u2019m denying you the right to ask that question as far as any further prospective jurors are concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The defendant made no further effort to improve the question, but objected and challenged this ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-358, as amended in 1981, now makes the direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel a matter of right. <em>Cf. Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 273 S.E.2d 36 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1011 (1981). It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The court and counsel for either party shall have the right to examine under oath any person who is called as a juror therein and shall have the right to ask such person or juror directly any <em>relevant </em>question to ascertain whether <em>he is related to either </em>party, or <em>has any interest in the cause, </em>or <em>has expressed or formed any opinion, </em>or is <em>sensible of any bias or prejudice </em>therein. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Code \u00a7 8.01-358 (emphasis added). While the 1981 amendment makes mandatory the formerly discretionary right of counsel to question the prospective jurors directly, it has no effect on the nature of the questions which may be asked. The questions propounded by counsel must be relevant, as always, and the trial court must, in its discretion, decide the issue of relevancy, subject to review for abuse. <em>See Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 844, 853, 284 S.E.2d 844, 850 (1981); <em>Deal </em>v. <em>Nix &amp; Son, Inc., </em>206 Va. 57, 63, 141 S.E.2d 683, 688 (1965); <em>Slade </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 1099, 156 S.E. 388 (1931). The test of relevancy is whether the questions relate to any of the four criteria set forth in the statute. If an answer to the question would necessarily disclose, or clearly lead to the disclosure of the statutory factors of relationship, interest, opinion, or prejudice, it must be permitted. Questions which go beyond this standard are entirely within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>202 Va. 952, 121 S.E.2d 513 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">A party has no right, statutory or otherwise, to propound any question he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad infinitum. </em>The court must afford a party a full and fair opportunity to ascertain whether prospective jurors \u201cstand indifferent in the cause,\u201d but the trial judge retains the discretion to determine when the parties have had sufficient opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Here, the defendant made no proffer of the questions he would have asked of subsequent prospective jurors. On appellate review, we can only assume that they would have been similar to those put to the series of veniremen culminating with Anna Cornwell. For the reasons stated in the preceding part of this opinion, the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding such questions. They were not relevant to a determination of bias or prejudice. Rather, they were calculated to elicit a prospective ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ror\u2019s underlying attitude toward the use of illegal drugs generally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such attitudes might well be interesting to counsel, but they have no relationship to the juror\u2019s ability to abide by the court\u2019s instructions, to find the facts impartially, and to apply the law to the facts conscientiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Moreover, the record indicates that the trial court afforded the defendant every reasonable opportunity to ask relevant questions which would be designed to elicit bias or prejudice on the part of prospective jurors. At least seven opportunities were given to counsel to rephrase the question, finally accompanied by a direct suggestion from the court, which was not followed. The questioning actually conducted by the court was sufficient to preserve the defendant\u2019s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to permit further <em>voir dire </em>questioning by the defendant on the subject of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">V. <em>Voir Dire </em>Questions as to a Juror\u2019s Ability to Impose the Death Penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">During the questioning of prospective jurors in groups of two, questions were put by the court to Rudolph Woltner and Edward Tostenson. Mr. Woltner responded to the effect that if capital murder were proved, he would automatically vote to impose the death penalty. Without awaiting a challenge, the court excused him for cause. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then questioned Mr. Tostenson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">Mr. Ebert: Mr. Tostenson, if under the law and the evidence of this case, as it develops, it develops that the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>is one of the alternatives available to you, could you consider voting for that alternative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">Mr. Tostenson: I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">Mr. Ebert: Well, you\u2019ll have to tell us one way or the other. I understand you\u2019re not sure, but are you saying that you don\u2019t know? Do you have any feeling as to whether or not you could consider that alternative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">The Court: May I ask him the second part of the question? Mr. Ebert: Let me ask you the second part of the \u2014 the next thing I was going to ask you \u2014 could you actually vote, as one of 12 jurors, for the death penalty, should the law and the evidence warrant the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Mr. Tostenson: For the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Mr. Ebert: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">Mr. Tostenson: I don\u2019t know if I could be party to that or not. There is some doubt in my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">The Court: Excuse me, Mr. Ebert. I don\u2019t think there is any necessity in going any further and causing this gentlemen to agonize. Mr. Zauzig, do you insist upon questions to be asked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">Mr. Zauzig: Yes; I\u2019d like to ask some questions, Your Honor, if I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">The Court: All right; I\u2019ll permit you to ask questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">Mr. Zauzig: Mr. \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">Mr. Ebert: Your Honor, at this point, I would object. It seems to me that from his answers, he does have at least a moral or philosophical problem with the potential of imposing the death sentence and I don\u2019t think he should be questioned further or permit the defendant \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">The Court: Let me ask that question; excuse me, Mr. Zauzig. Do you have a moral or philosophical problem with imposing the death penalty, regardless of how severe the facts and circumstances \u2014 the evidence may be \u2014 not facts and circumstances, but the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">Mr. Tostenson: Would you please repeat that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">The Court: Do you have a moral or philosophical problem with imposing the death penalty, regardless of how severe the evidence might develop to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-18\">Mr. Tostenson: I suppose I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-19\">The Court: Under the circumstances, Mr. Zauzig, I see no reason to go any further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The defendant objected to this ruling, citing <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>393 U.S. 898 (1968), and further objected on the ground that he was not given an opportunity to \u201crehabilitate\u201d Mr. Tostenson by further questioning. Defense counsel pointed out that, under <em>Witherspoon, </em>the mere fact that a juror had religious or moral objection to the death penalty would not alone warrant his exclusion; he could be excluded for cause, in effect, only if he would refuse under any circumstances to consider it. The court responded: \u201cMr. Zauzig, the Court has ruled on that, and it is my interpretation from his answers that he has that problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">A prospective juror may be excluded for cause if his views on capital punishment \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980). We have interpreted <em>Witherspoon </em>to mean that a juror who is irrevocably committed to vote against the imposition of the death penalty may be excluded for cause. <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 250, 257 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). Whether a juror is thus \u201cirrevocably committed,\u201d is a mixed question of law and fact for determination by the trial court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">As fact-finder, the trial court must weigh the meaning of the answers given in light of the phrasing of the questions posed, the inflections, tone, and tenor of the dialogue, and the general demeanor of the prospective juror. We are aware that, while the words employed may, when transcribed and read in retrospect, appear ambivalent, the judge who heard them uttered was uniquely positioned to assess their ultimate import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\"><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 464-65, 248 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). The trial judge must satisfy himself that the juror\u2019s commitment against the death penalty is \u201cunmistakably clear.\u201d This finding of fact cannot be disturbed on appeal unless we can say, upon consideration of the <em>voir dire </em>as a whole, that it was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 248 S.E.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We can neither see nor hear Mr. Tostenson. Factors beyond the printed record of his response led the trial court to conclude: \u201cit is my interpretation from his answers that he has that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>problem.\u201d It was apparent to the trial court that his commitment against the death penalty was \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d and that his ability to perform his duties, within the statutory scheme governing a capital murder case was, in the words of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>\u201csubstantially impair [ed].\u201d 448 U.S. at 45. We cannot say from an examination of the <em>voir dire </em>as a whole that this finding of fact was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied an opportunity to \u201crehabilitate\u201d Mr. Tostenson, suffers from the same infirmity as his argument concerning his right to ask further <em>voir dire </em>questions on the subject of illegal drugs. No proffer was made as to the further questions which might have been put to the prospective juror, and we are unable to determine from the record whether they would have been relevant, or whether their exclusion would have been an abuse of discretion. Rule 5:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Moreover, when <em>voir dire </em>examination has disclosed a juror\u2019s state of mind which warrants his exclusion for cause, further questions put to him for the purpose of \u201crehabilitating\u201d him can have little effect. <em>See Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 977, 266 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1980); <em>Breeden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1976). Unless the subsequent questions serve to dispel a clear misunderstanding or correct an inadvertent misstatement, the trial judge is left with the ambiguous task of deciding which answer is more reliable, the first or the last.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">B. The Guilt Phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">VI. Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Mental History and the Effects of Drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">1. Emotional problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The defendant offered in evidence, at the guilt phase of the trial, certain school records from his childhood and the testimony of two social workers who had counselled him from 1974 until January 1982. The purpose of the evidence was to show that the defendant had a long history of anti-social behavior, emotional problems, difficulties in controlling impulses, low self-esteem, and involvement with alcohol and drugs. In addition, expert opinions were offered from a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist who had interviewed and administered tests to the defendant while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was in custody awaiting trial. The purpose of their testimony was to show that the defendant, although not psychotic, suffered from a \u201cborderline personality disorder.\u201d Because the only defense offered in the case was that of voluntary intoxication, the defendant contends that this evidence was probative of his mental state at the time of the offenses, <em>i.e., </em>that he was in a condition which precluded premeditation and deliberation. The trial court excluded most of this evidence at the guilt stage, but permitted its introduction at the penalty stage of the trial as matter in mitigation of punishment. The defense was also permitted to make an extensive proffer of the excluded evidence out of the jury\u2019s presence at the guilt stage, and its content is a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">When, as here, no insanity defense is interposed, the defendant\u2019s mental condition is only relevant insofar as it might be probative of a fact in issue: <em>i.e., </em>premeditation at the time of the killing. Neither the school records, nor the history of the defendant\u2019s past \u201cproblems\u201d related by the social workers was competent to address this issue, and they did not purport to do so. Rather, the defendant argues, they were proper as foundation for the opinions of the experts, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Dr. Reuben Horlick, a clinical psychologist, interviewed the defendant three times and administered a battery of psychological tests. He opined that the defendant had a \u201clow to average level of general intelligence,\u201d with an I.Q. of 95. He described him as \u201ca seriously disturbed individual\u201d who acted \u201cin an immature and impulsive manner.\u201d His diagnosis was \u201cborderline personality basic disorder . . . aggravated by substance abuse and alcohol.\u201d He offered no opinion on the question whether the defendant\u2019s mental condition was such, on February 25, 1982, as to affect his ability to premeditate and deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Dr. David Lanham, a psychiatrist, interviewed the defendant three times in jail. He agreed with Dr. Horlick\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cborderline personality disorder,\u201d and opined that the defendant would be prone to impulsive behavior. On cross-examination during the penalty phase he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Q. [I]s there anything about this disorder which would prevent an individual from planning and thinking about committing a crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">A. I would say that impulsive behavior is much more likely. But it would not prevent, necessarily, a planning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Neither expert expressed, nor was asked to express, an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime, and neither characterized his underlying condition as one which would necessarily affect his ability to premeditate. If the evidence had been admitted, the jury would have been required to speculate as to what, if any, effect it might have had upon the crucial fact in issue. In <em>Spruill </em>v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 475, 479, 271 S.E.2d 419, 421 (1980), considering medical testimony as to mental state which dealt only with \u201cpossibility,\u201d we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">In order for such testimony to become relevant, it must be brought out of the realm of speculation and into the realm of reasonable probability; the law in this area deals in \u201cprobabilities\u201d and not \u201cpossibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The proffered evidence suffered from the same infirmity as that we rejected in <em>Spruill, </em>and the trial court correctly excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">2. Effect of Drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The defendant further sought to elicit from Dr. Lanham an expert opinion as to the effect of LSD upon a user, particularly a user suffering from a \u201cborderline personality disorder\u201d such as his. Here, the defendant relies upon <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 629-32, 292 S.E.2d 798, 806 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983), where an expert toxicologist, without objection, testified to the individual and cumulative effects of LSD, Tranxene, and alcohol. In response to a hypothetical question, the witness then gave a positive opinion that the ingestion of various quantities of these drugs in combination could neither cause the user to commit violent acts nor render him incapable of premeditating them. This was probative upon the issue of premeditation by reason of its certainty. It met the test of <em>Spruill </em>because it did not leave the jurors adrift to speculate in an area of expertise beyond their knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Here, by contrast, Dr. Lanham\u2019s opinion was expressed in the proffer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">Q. Can you testify to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that a person as I just told you, ingesting those types of drugs, could you tell me if a person could perpetrate the acts such as homicide without premeditation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>A. It\u2019s entirely possible; yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The defendant was permitted to describe his own condition, at the time of the offense, to the jury. The jury also heard the testimony of Gerald Frazier, Michael Hamilton, and the defendant\u2019s mother as to his appearance and demeanor that day. Frazier and Hamilton described his use of drugs, and Frazier testified as to his condition when under their influence. This factual testimony, although circumstantial, was probative of the fact in issue. The proffered expert testimony, however, raised only a \u201cpossibility.\u201d It failed to meet the test of <em>Spruill, </em>and was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">VII. Improper Question by Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">On direct examination, the defendant was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">Q. How did you feel towards your mother after you left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">A. Sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">On cross-examination, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">Q. Did you not say that you felt sorry for your mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">A. That too; yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">Q. Did you have any hard feelings towards your mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-15\">Q. Did you ever make the statement that you would like to have your mother done away with?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Defense counsel objected. The court immediately excused the jury for a ten-minute recess, told the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney that the question had been \u201cmost inappropriate,\u201d and announced his intention to give a cautionary instruction. The defendant moved for a mistrial which the court denied. The court said: \u201cI do not intend to repeat the question because I think to repeat it would be just to amplify it.\u201d The jury was then recalled and instructed by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-17\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, just prior to the recess, the Commonwealth was questioning or cross-examining the witness. Please disregard the last remarks that the Commonwealth Attorney made in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We will give him a chance to go back to his cross-examination at this time; but I ask you to disregard the remarks or question that was asked and remarks made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The defendant argues that the effect of this improper question was so prejudicial that the court\u2019s admittedly prompt corrective action could not remove it. We disagree. \u201c[E]rror arising from an improper question or improper conduct of counsel may usually be cured by prompt and decisive action of the trial court without granting a motion for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 277, 286, 288 S.E.2d 449, 454 (1982). The Trial court must make an initial factual determination, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, whether the defendant\u2019s rights had been so indelibly prejudiced as to require a new trial. Unless we can say as a matter of law that this determination was wrong, it will not be disturbed on appeal. Unless the record shows the contrary, it is to be presumed that the jury followed an explicit cautionary instruction promptly given. <em>See Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 80, 84, 175 S.E.2d 236, 239 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Here, the trial court pointed out a significant circumstance bearing upon the degree of prejudice actually suffered by the defendant. When the improper question was asked, the defendant had recently completed his direct testimony in which he had, in effect, admitted beating the helpless victim to death with a fireplace poker. In comparison to that shocking story, any imputation that he might have once entertained unpleasant thoughts about his mother would pale into relative insignificance.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">VIII. Second-Degree Murder as a Lesser-Included Offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The court instructed the jury as to the element of capital murder and of first-degree murder. The jury was also instructed, at the defendant\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">If you find that the defendant was so greatly intoxicated by the voluntary use of alcohol or drugs or both, that he was incapable of deliberating or premeditating, then you cannot find him guilty of capital murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Further instructions told the jury that if it entertained any reasonable doubt as to the grade of offense, it must resolve that doubt in the defendant\u2019s favor and find him guilty of the lesser offense; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>if it reasonably doubted that he was guilty at all, it must acquit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The defendant objected to the court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on second-degree murder as an additional lesser-included offense. He argues that, although he admitted committing murder with a deadly weapon, the Commonwealth was nevertheless required to prove two elements to raise it to capital murder; (1) premeditation and deliberation, and (2) killing in the commission of a robbery. He contends that if the jury should find only one of these elements to have accompanied the killing, he would be guilty of first-degree murder, and if the jury should find neither element present, he would be guilty of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 629, 634, 159 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1968), overruling an earlier decision to the contrary, we held that the trial court properly refused an instruction on second-degree murder where the evidence would support only findings of first-degree murder or not guilty. This was so notwithstanding the presumption that every homicide is second-degree murder. In <em>Wooden, </em>we adopted the view of the dissenting justices in <em>Plymale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 582, 602, 79 S.E.2d 610, 620 (1954): \u201cThe presumption of second-degree murder yields to facts.\u201d No instruction should be given unless it is supported by evidence, and such evidence must be more than a scintilla. <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 811, 814, 241 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">It is true that if the jury found the element of premeditation and deliberation to be lacking, by reason of voluntary intoxication, it could not convict the defendant of capital murder. But we do not agree with the defendant that, under the evidence in this case, the jury could further find the element of contemporaneous robbery lacking, so as to reduce the crime to second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d 477, 483 (1978), we adopted the view that the felony-murder statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-32, applies where a killing is so closely related to a robbery in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise. That statute makes murder, other than capital murder, in the commission of robbery, murder of the first degree. Premeditation and deliberation are not elements of felony-murder, but malice is. Malice inheres in the doing of a wrongful act intentionally or without just cause or excuse. Thus, the malice inherent in the robbery provides the malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>prerequisite for a felony-murder conviction. <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 758, 284 S.E.2d 811 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 273 S.E.2d 48 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981), we held that the relationships of time, place, and causal connection between a robbery and a murder need not necessarily be jury questions. They could, in a proper case, be determined as a matter of law. Briley and his accomplices had intercepted their victim outside a restaurant, robbed him at gunpoint, and forced him to enter his own automobile, in which they abducted him for some miles to Mayo\u2019s Island in the James River. Arriving at the island fifteen to twenty minutes after the initial robbery, they shot the victim fatally. They drove away in his car, which they then stripped of parts and abandoned. We held that the killing involved there was so closely related in time, place, and causal connection to the robbery as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Applying these principles to the evidence before us, it is manifest that the robbery and the murder of Pamela Benner are even more inextricably connected than the crimes in <em>Briley. </em>The victim was, in the absence of her family, the custodian of the home and its contents. The property was stolen through the exercise of violence against her. The bloodstains on the splintered doors to the locked bedrooms in which the stolen property was kept are circumstantial evidence that her ability to protect the property had been subdued by overwhelming violence before the theft occurred. While it is impossible to ascertain the precise time of her death, in relation to the taking of the property, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence shows that the defendant, having gone there to rob her, bound and beat her with a poker, before he went upstairs to the kitchen, leaving traces of blood and hair, to secure the ice pick and carving fork with which he then stabbed her repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The defendant\u2019s evidence does nothing to separate the crimes as to time, place, or causal connection. Indeed, his version, if believed, makes it unmistakably clear that the robbery and the murder were a part of the same criminal enterprise. He admitted leaving the house, in possession of the stolen goods, spattered with blood. There was not a scintilla of evidence upon which the jury could have found the murder unrelated to the robbery in time, place, or causal connection. Only speculation could support such a finding. The record permits no construction except that of a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>mon criminal enterprise as a matter of law. Thus, the court correctly refused to instruct the jury as to second-degree murder. <em>See Hopper </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>456 U.S. 605 (1983); <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 424, 304 S.E.2d 271 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We agree, moreover, with the Attorney General\u2019s argument that even if the refusal of a second-degree murder instruction were deemed to be error, it would, in the circumstances of this case, be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury\u2019s capital murder verdict makes clear that it rejected the defense of voluntary intoxication. Had that defense been believed, the jury would have been required, by the court\u2019s instructions, to make a first-degree, rather than a capital murder finding. Thus, even if the jury had been presented with a second-degree murder option, it could never have actually reached such a verdict in view of its finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant acted with premeditation and deliberation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">C. The Penalty Phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">IX. Facial Constitutionality of Statutory Sentencing Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The defendant argues that Virginia\u2019s capital murder sentencing procedure is facially unconstitutional for the reasons we considered and rejected in <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 201, 257 S.E.2d 784 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980); <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Va. 683, 251 S.E.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979); and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). We adhere to the views expressed in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">X. Conflict between Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 and Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendant pointed out to the trial court, at the penalty phase, that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 provides that the trier of fact shall not impose the death penalty unless it makes one of the prerequisite findings \u201cafter consideration of the past criminal record of convictions of the defendant;\u201d while Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed unless the Commonwealth proves beyond a reasonable doubt</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">that there is a probability based upon <em>evidence of the prior history of the defendant </em>or of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which he is accused that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, or that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated battery of the victim (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">He argues that the dichotomy between \u201cpast criminal record of convictions\u201d and \u201cprior history\u201d renders the statutory scheme unconstitutionally vague. He made a motion <em>in limine, </em>at the beginning of the penalty phase, to restrict the Commonwealth to proof of his \u201cpast criminal record,\u201d and to exclude any other references to his \u201cprior history.\u201d This argument is based upon the alleged vagueness of the term \u201cprior history.\u201d He says that it does \u201cnot provide the defendant with an objective standard on which to prepare for the defense of the penalty phase,\u201d while \u201ccriminal record of convictions\u201d does.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 477, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979), we rejected a contention that the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) was unconstitutionally vague. We relied on the reasoning of <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>429 U.S. 875 (1976). The rationale of <em>Jurek </em>is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The task that a Texas jury must perform in answering the statutory question in issue [determining the probability of future criminal conduct, under a statute similar to Virginia\u2019s] is thus basically no different from the task performed countless times each day throughout the American system of criminal justice. What is essential is that the jury have before it <em>all possible relevant information </em>about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">428 U.S. at 275-76 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"ATv\">The admission of evidence, other than criminal convictions, as to the defendant\u2019s dangerousness, was expressly approved in <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 295 S.E.2d 643 (1982). We adhere to the views expressed in <em>Smith, </em>and reject the contention that unconstitutional vagueness affects the statutory scheme, either by reason of the terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C), or because of the differing language of the two sections.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">XI. Instruction to Consider Mitigating Circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The defendant tendered five proposed jury instructions at the penalty phase dealing with the jury\u2019s duty to consider mitigating circumstances in fixing punishment. All were either defective in form or erroneous statements of the law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Instead, the jury was instructed that the death penalty could not be imposed unless the Commonwealth proved at least one of the statutory predicates (\u201cdangerousness\u201d or \u201cvileness,\u201d framed in the statutory language) beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if one or both were proved, the jury was told only that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>may </em>fix the punishment at death; but if the jury believed from <em>all the evidence </em>that the death penalty was not justified, then it <em>shall </em>fix punishment at life imprisonment. The instruction further told the jury that if the Commonwealth failed to prove either predicate beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury must impose life imprisonment. These instructions adequately stated the statutory framework and were sufficient. <em>See Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. at 255, 257 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The defendant argues that even if his offered instructions were not to be given, his constitutional right to have the jury consider all mitigating factors before deciding punishment was impaired by the trial court\u2019s refusal to give some instruction especially drawing the jury\u2019s attention to evidence in mitigation. We disagree. The defendant was given a full opportunity to adduce evidence in mitigation, and in fact did so. Over one hundred pages of the trial transcript are devoted to it, and it was fully argued. The jury was instructed to consider \u201call the evidence,\u201d and the burden of proof was correctly allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We have repeatedly held that an instruction is improper which singles out one portion of the evidence for special emphasis. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 792, 797, 263 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1980); <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 543, 547-48, 199 S.E. 465, 467 (1938). We find no error in the court\u2019s rulings on the instructions at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">D. Statutory Sentence Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Although not argued on appeal, we must determine, by statutory mandate, \u201c1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and 2. Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">A careful examination of the entire record shows no evidence of \u201cpassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d which might have affected the jury\u2019s determination of punishment. As we did in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>we have examined the records in all the capital murder cases reviewed by this Court, taking particular note of the facts in those in which juries imposed capital punishment solely on the basis of the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. We found that the vileness of Fitzgerald\u2019s treatment of his victim exceeded that of any prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>case we had reviewed until that time. We now conclude that LeVasseur\u2019s atrocious conduct toward Pamela Benner is a close, competitor in sheer, unprovoked viciousness. We hold that the sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by Virginia juries in crimes of a similar but less horrifying nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Having found no reversible error in the proceedings, and having independently determined that the sentence of death was properly imposed, we decline to disturb or commute the sentence and will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-13\"> In a separate non-jury trial, the defendant was convicted of the robbery of Pamela Benner and sentenced to life imprisonment. That conviction is not before us in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> At the time of <em>voir dire </em>questioning, the veniremen had not been instructed in the law relating to the defense of voluntary intoxication. The questions gave them no legal framework by which to fix the inquiry in the context of that defense. The veniremen might properly have been asked whether they objected so strongly to the use of illegal drugs that they would be unable to follow an instruction by the court which would reduce the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility if the jury found from the evidence that he was so affected by the voluntary ingestion of such drugs that he was incapable of premeditation or deliberation, a requisite element of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Without such a framework, the questions were abstract. As noted above, the veniremen could readily infer that they were being asked if they could acquit the defendant if they found that he was using illegal drugs. There being no such principle of law, the only effect of the questions was to elicit the intensity of the veniremen\u2019s objections to criminal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> In <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 606, 611, 283 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1981), and <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 654, 212 S.E.2d 290 (1975), we rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions that the refusal of lesser-included offense instructions was harmless. Those decisions, unlike the present case, were based upon the fact that the jury\u2019s rejection of one defense did not necessarily indicate that it would also have rejected another defense, supported by credible evidence, which was the subject of the refused instruction. The defendant here relies on <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625 (1980). <em>Beck </em>is inapposite. It deals with an Alabama capital murder statute which required the jury to choose between capital murder and acquittal, excluding any lesser offense. The Supreme Court foresaw the danger that such a scheme might tempt the jury to convict a defendant of capital murder who was actually guilty of a lesser offense, rather than acquit him when he was obviously guilty of some crime. There was no such danger here. If the jury had any reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt of capital murder, but believed him guilty of a lesser offense, it would not have been forced to an acquittal, but rather could have convicted him of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"><em> </em>We note that although the jury was instructed as to both the \u201cdangerousness\u201d and the \u201cvileness\u201d predicates for capital punishment, and the Commonwealth argued that both were present, the jury\u2019s verdict rejected \u201cdangerousness\u201d and fixed punishment solely on the basis of the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. Obviously, a finding of \u201cvileness\u201d can be based only on the circumstances of the case on trial. The defendant\u2019s \u201cprior history\u201d is thus irrelevant to a finding of \u201cvileness.\u201d \u201cPast criminal record of convictions\u201d and \u201cprior history\u201d would be relevant only to the \u201cdangerousness\u201d predicate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-13\"> Instructions \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d referred to \u201cdeath by electrocution.\u201d This term is improper. The method of execution of the death penalty is a legislative concern, not within the province of the jury. Instruction \u201cG\u201d told the jury that it <em>must </em>find that a mitigating circumstance exists if there is <em>any </em>\u201csubstantial\u201d evidence to support it. Instruction \u201cH\u201d purported to establish limits on the aggravating circumstances which the jury might consider. Instruction \u201cI\u201d purported to establish a balancing test for the relative weight to be given to mitigating and aggravating circumstances. There was no authority for any of these instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b644-6\">STEPHENSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">LeVasseur contends he was so intoxicated he was incapable of forming a willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to kill the deceased, and therefore could not be guilty of capital murder. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 524, 115 S.E. 673 (1923). This was his only defense, and the trial court found there was evidence to support the giving of a jury instruction therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Since his alleged voluntary intoxication was produced primarily by the use of illegal drugs, LeVasseur argues his counsel had the right during jury <em>voir dire </em>to ascertain whether a prospective juror would apply the voluntary intoxication rule even though illicit drugs were involved. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">It is apparent from the record that defense counsel intended to question each prospective juror to determine whether he or she was \u201csensible of any bias or prejudice,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358, respecting the use of illegal drugs, which would preclude that person from following the court\u2019s instruction respecting voluntary intoxication. Apparently, this line of questioning proceeded without incident until prospective juror Anna Cornwell was questioned. At that point, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney suggested to the court that the question defense counsel had been asking in this regard should be reframed, and the court instructed defense counsel to ask the following question: \u201cAssuming that you are all opposed to the use of illegal drugs, would this fact, alone, prejudice you to such a degree that you could not consider their usage, if the evidence develops that they were used, as a part of the defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Essentially following the court\u2019s suggestion, defense counsel asked Cornwell the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">I would assume that... you are opposed to drugs, the use of illegal drugs. Do you have any bias or prejudice that would make you unable to consider the usage by the defendant, of illegal drugs, as part of his defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">Would you be able to \u2014 would you be unable to consider the usage by the defendant of illegal drugs, as a part of his defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">When Cornwell appeared not to understand the question, the court inquired: \u201cthe fact that it may develop that he had used illegal drugs, could you consider that as a part of his defense?\u201d Cornwell responded in the negative. Thereupon, the defendant challenged Cornwell for cause. The court overruled this motion, and Cornwell was deemed qualified to serve as a juror in this case. Clearly, Cornwell did not \u201cstand indifferent in the cause,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s challenge of her for cause should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">When defense counsel began to question the next prospective juror, the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Mr. Zauzig [defense counsel], the other question which you have asked in the past has been rephrased. The Court has previously ruled on this question and how this should come forward. It did not come forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">What your question in the past has been getting at is, in effect, asking the jury to sanction what is an illegal act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">For that reason, I\u2019m denying you the right to ask that question as far as any further prospective jurors are concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">As a result of this ruling, nine jurors in this case were not examined regarding any bias or prejudice they might have had respecting the use of illegal drugs as it related to LeVasseur\u2019s intoxication defense. In my judgment, this omission prejudiced the defendant and constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The majority argues that defense counsel\u2019s question was both ambiguous, because the prospective juror did not know whether drug intoxication could be considered merely in mitigation or for acquittal, and irrelevant, because it only was \u201ccalculated to elicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>a prospective juror\u2019s underlying attitude toward the use of illegal drugs generally.\u201d I consider these arguments to be hyper-technical and strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">While defense counsel\u2019s question may not have been a model of clarity, the prospective jurors, prior to Cornwell, apparently understood and answered it to the satisfaction of both the court and counsel. It is to be remembered that the court, not counsel, asked Cornwell the question which received her negative response. In addition, the court, at the instance of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, framed the question which counsel was instructed to use for the remaining prospective jurors. My reading of the record indicates that counsel, on the single occasion afforded him, substantially complied with the trial court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">There is no doubt defendant\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>was extremely relevant in determining whether bias or prejudice existed, as it touched upon the only defense he advanced. The trial court has the ultimate responsibility of determining whether a prospective juror \u201c[h]as a bias or prejudice against the Commonwealth or the accused,\u201d or whether there is \u201cany reason to believe he might not give a fair and impartial trial to the Commonwealth and the accused based solely on the law and the evidence.\u201d Rule 3A:20. \u201cThe constitutional and statutory guarantee of an impartial jury is no mere \u2018legal technicality,\u2019 but a substantive right scrupulously to be observed in the day-to-day administration of justice.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 445, 271 S.E.2d 123, 129 (1980). If defense counsel\u2019s question was unclear, the trial court should have clarified it, rather than forbidding further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cPreservation of the opportunity to prove actual bias is a guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>339 U.S. 162, 171-72 (1950). In the present case, the defendant was not given this opportunity. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">COCHRAN and POFF, JJ., join in dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
