She worked alone in six-hour and nine-hour shifts without scheduled breaks or lunch hours, and her duties required her to be constantly on her feet. As part of her uniform, Bean was required to buy and wear \u201cclosed shoes\u201d with hard soles. In November, she began having pain in her left foot, and in February she consulted Dr. Bruce Vogel, a podiatrist. Dr. Vogel diagnosed her condition as \u201cchronic bursitis secondary to hallux valgus, metatarsus primus varus, inflamed metatarsal-phalangeal joint (bunion) [secondary] to repeated trauma.\u201d Bean underwent surgery (\u201cBunionectomy left foot\u201d and \u201cWedge osteotomy 1st metatarsal\u201d) on March 4, 1981, and thereafter was unable to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">In his attending physician\u2019s report, Dr. Vogel noted: \u201cPre-existing condition: patient stated she had a small \u2018bump\u2019 for a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>years before she began her job but that it never caused her any problems.\u201d In a letter addressed to Bean\u2019s employer, he said that \u201c[t]he amount of time spent on her feet in closed hard shoes was definitely a factor in the cause of her problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Bean filed an application against her employer and its insurer, Insurance Company of North America, seeking compensation for disability resulting from \u201cOccupational Disease\u201d. A deputy commissioner found \u201can insufficient causal connection to hold this to be a compensable occupational disease\u201d and denied the claim. On review, the full Commission, with one member dissenting, found that Bean \u201cbecame disabled as a result of inflammation of a preexisting bunion on her left foot.\u201d The Commission entered an award in Bean\u2019s favor on the ground that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s pre-existing condition was aggravated by her work to the point that it became disabling\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The Commission\u2019s findings of fact are not challenged on appeal. The issue before us is a question of law. At every stage of the proceedings below, the parties and the Commission treated Bean\u2019s bunion condition as a disease pre-existing her employment and the claim as one governed by the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-46. On appeal, we analyze the case as it was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-46 provides that \u201cthe term \u2018occupational disease\u2019 means a disease arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Explicating that definition, the statute states that \u201c[a] disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if . . . [it] had its origin in a risk connected with the employment\u201d. Bean\u2019s disease did not arise out of her employment because its origin antedated her employment. Hence, it was not an occupational disease, and only disabilities resulting from occupational diseases are compensable. The statute expressly provides that, with certain exceptions inapplicable here, \u201c[n]o ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall be compensable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Apparently, the Commission concluded that Bean\u2019s disability was compensable because the underlying disease was aggravated by \u201ca risk connected with the employment\u201d. If so, the Commission implicitly overruled its own holdings in earlier cases. \u201c[T]here is no provision under the occupational disease law of our Act permitting recovery for aggravation of ordinary diseases of life.\u201d <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Star Band Company, Inc., </em>56 O.I.C. 190, 192 (1974) (duodenal ulcer); <em>accord Sullins </em>v. <em>Southern States Coop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>erative, Inc., </em>49 O.I.C. 315 (1967) (bronchial asthma); <em>Noel </em>v. <em>Virginia Chemicals, Inc., </em>48 O.I.C. 177 (1966) (sinusitis); <em>Burner </em>v. <em>Southern Lightweight Aggregate Corp., </em>31 O.I.C. 239 (1949) (dermatitis). See also <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Brunswick Corp., </em>333 F. Supp. 221, 223 (W.D. Va. 1971) (pneumothorax), where the court quoted and applied the opinion of a deputy commissioner who held that \u201c \u2018an ordinary disease, of life aggravated by work environment is [not] compensable under the Act.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We hold that the Commission misapplied the controlling statute, and we will reverse the award and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
