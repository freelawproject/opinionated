Prior to 1972, Marine Development Corporation (MDC) had been engaged primarily in the manufacture and marketing of air conditioning units for yachts. Due to its success in this field, and the fact that its opportunity for expansion and future growth there had become quite limited, MDC investigated the possibility of developing an additional product line of commercial marine refrigeration equipment. Seeking a chief project engineer for this venture, MDC contacted Rodak because of his expertise in this area and began negotiations with him. According to Rodak, MDC offered him a \u201cliving wage.\u201d Specifically, the proposal was that Rodak would be employed at a substandard salary with the understanding that once the new product line was developed, it would be transferred to a new corporation which would be owned by Rodak and MDC in proportion to the value of their respective contributions to development of the product. Rodak accepted the offer and went to work for MDC in June, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Rodak remained with MDC until April, 1978. During that time, he designed and developed a new line of commercial refrigeration products suited for fishing boats. Rodak also set up the manufacturing facilities and supervised the manufacture of this refrigeration equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In 1977, MDC organized a subsidiary corporation known as Commercial Marine Products (CMP) to which it transferred the marketing right to the new product line. The manufacturing rights, however, were retained by MDC. Rodak objected, insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that this reorganization did not comport with MDC\u2019s earlier promise to transfer the entire commercial marine refrigeration operation to a new company. When MDC refused to modify the arrangement and offered Rodak only a 15% stock ownership in CMP, Rodak resigned and instituted the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In his motion for judgment, Rodak, pleading in the alternative, claimed in Count I that MDC had breached its oral contract and in Count II that MDC was liable to him on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. MDC denied these allegations in its grounds of defense, claiming that the annual salary which had been paid to Rodak was the only compensation to which he was entitled. During the presentation of Rodak\u2019s evidence, the court ruled <em>sua sponte </em>that, as a matter of law, there was no express contract. Count II, the issue of <em>quantum meruit, </em>was submitted to a jury which, at the end of the four-day trial, returned a verdict for Rodak in the amount of $170,000. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict, and MDC now contends that the trial court erred in: (1) submitting the <em>quantum meruit </em>claim to the jury, and (2) granting instruction number 7. We reject both contentions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I. <em>Quantum Meruit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As to the appropriateness of Rodak\u2019s recovery on <em>quantum meruit, </em>there can be little doubt. In <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>161 Va. 193, 198, 170 S.E. 602, 604 (1933), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">It is a general rule of law that he who gains the labor . . . of another must make reasonable compensation for the same. Hence, when one furnishes labor to another under a contract which, for reasons not prejudicial to the former, is void and of no effect, he may recover the value of his services on a <em>quantum meruit. </em>[Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>See also Cochran </em>v. <em>Bise, </em>197 Va. 483, 90 S.E.2d 178 (1955); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>193 Va. 130, 67 S.E.2d 917 (1951); <em>Ricks </em>v. <em>Sumler, </em>179 Va. 571, 19 S.E.2d 889 (1942); and <em>Adam-Christian </em>v. <em>McGavock, </em>147 Va. 252, 137 S.E. 374 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In this same vein, we approve the conclusions of the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>Brakensiek </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>203 Kan. 817, 821-822, 457 P.2d 511, 514-515 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Contract: Quantum Meruit. Where the parties contract for the doing of certain work, and the work is done and accepted, and it appears that there was a misunderstanding as to the price to be paid for it, the law rejects the understanding of each, and awards reasonable compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">However, after services . . . have been furnished and accepted, the fact that no price had been agreed on or that the compensation mentioned ... is too indefinite does not prevent the recovery of reasonable compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Here, after the trial court\u2019s ruling that no express contract between MDC and Rodak was proven, the sole remaining issue was the <em>quantum meruit </em>claim raised in Count II of the motion for judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>Under the pleadings and evidence presented, the issue whether Rodak was entitled to recover the value of the services he provided to MDC was clearly a jury question, and the trial court was correct in submitting the case to the jury on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">II. <em>Instruction number </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">MDC argues that the trial court should not have given instruction number 7 and correctly points out that the first two sentences were criticized in <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Meredith, supra </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>There, Meredith brought an action against the estate of the deceased, seeking to recover the value of the services she rendered during the last several years of his life. At trial, the only matter in dispute was whether the deceased had promised Meredith that, in addition to paying her $2.50 per week and furnishing her board and clothing, he would make provision for her and provide her a home as long as she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In discussing these two sentences of the sole jury instruction given by the trial court in <em>Hendrickson, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">The object of all principles or rules of law promulgated is to do justice between contending parties. If that is the interpretation of the first sentence in the instruction it is correct. There are quasi contracts, or \u201ccontracts implied in law,\u201d in which the assent of the parties is immaterial. In such cases the liability exists from an implication of law that arises from the facts and circumstances, independent of agreement or presumed intention. In such cases, the promise is implied from the consideration received, there the legal duty imposed upon the defendant defines the contract. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">But the facts do not bring this case within this class of quasi contracts. It belongs to that class of cases usually referred to by text writers as \u201ccontracts implied in fact,\u201d and the only difference between an express contract and a contract implied in fact is that in the former all of the terms and conditions are expressed between the parties, while in the latter some of the terms and conditions are implied in law from the conduct of the parties. Thus: \u201cWhere one renders services for another at the latter\u2019s request, the law, in the absence of an express agreement, implies a promise to pay what the services are reasonably worth, unless it can be inferred from the circumstances that the services were to be rendered without compensation.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">Without further discussion, these authorities are sufficient to show that, even as abstract propositions of law, the princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>pies enunciated in that part of the instruction quoted are not fully stated, and even if they were, they are abstract principles which have a tendency to confuse, rather than to clarify, the issue to be decided by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 200-201, 170 S.E. at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Against this background, we turn to an analysis of instruction number 7. On brief, MDC initially contends that, due to the inclusion of the two sentences found in the <em>Hendrickson </em>instruction, this instruction suffers the same infirmities. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We acknowledge that in <em>Hendrickson </em>we criticized the first two sentences of the instruction there involved. It is obvious from our reading of instruction number 7, however, that the objections raised in <em>Hendrickson </em>are inapplicable in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">First, unlike its counterpart in <em>Hendrickson, </em>MDC\u2019s position was adequately covered by the inclusion of the last paragraph of the instruction. The jury was clearly instructed that it could find that the agreement between MDC and Rodak either included additional undetermined compensation beyond Rodak\u2019s salary or it was limited to the salary alone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Second, in addition to instruction number 7, the substantive law of <em>quantum meruit </em>was explicated in two other instructions. One instruction listed criteria from which the jury could ascertain the value of Rodak\u2019s services, while the other informed the jury how to deal with the significance of profit or lack thereof to MDC resulting from Rodak\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Third, there is no contention of a quasi contract or a contract implied in law in the instant case. Although MDC suggests that instruction number 7 could be misinterpreted by the jury to require that MDC pay to Rodak the reasonable value of his services without a finding that this additional compensation beyond the salary was agreed to, we conclude otherwise. Implicit in any verdict for Rodak based upon <em>quantum meruit </em>was a finding that something more than a salary had been promised. The instruction\u2019s first two sentences were statements of abstract propositions entirely extraneous to the issues raised by the pleadings. In <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>199 Va. 296, 309-10, 99 S.E.2d 629, 640 (1957), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The long established rule of this Court is that: \u201cAll instructions must be read in the light of the evidence, and if when so read they are not misleading, technical errors as to abstract propositions are not regarded as prejudicial.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">MDC asserts that the instructions failed to require that MDC needed to derive some benefit from the services rendered by Rodak. As Rodak points out, this argument overlooks the following statement in Hendrickson: \u201cThe measure of recovery is the reasonable value of the services performed, and not the amount of benefit which actually accrued from them to him for whom they were performed.\u201d <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>161 Va. at 202, 170 S.E. at 605 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Finally, MDC asserts that Rodak should not be allowed to recover more under <em>quantum meruit </em>than he would have under the express contract alleged in Count I. We find this argument untenable and again point to our quotation from <em>Brakensiek </em>v. <em>Shaffer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Finding no reversible error in the court below, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> The ruling that no express contract had been proven is not before us for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> For purposes of comparison, the instruction in <em>Hendrickson </em>and instruction number 7 in the instant case are listed below:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">\n<em>Hendrickson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">The court instructs the jury that an implied contract is created by law to establish justice between parties. It does not require mutual assent, but may bind a party against his will. And the court further instructs the jury that if they believe by a preponderance of the evidence that . . .

Rodak in such amount as you may think such services were reasonably worth less the amount of compensation actually paid to . . .
