The trial court confirmed the findings of guilt and imposed consecutive sentences of five years in prison with two years suspended. We awarded defendant an appeal from the February 1982 judgments, and limited the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">On April 29, 1981, during daylight about 8:00 p.m., the victims were traveling westbound on a motorcycle in Goochland County. They were on Interstate Route 64 en route from Richmond to Charlottesville. They stopped at a Rest Area so DeGraide could use the restroom. Tetreault remained at the vehicle. As she was was returning to the motorcycle, a 1977 green Ford pickup truck entered the parking area at a high rate of speed. Occupied only by the operator, the truck was driven into the space adjacent to the motorcycle, bouncing off the curb as it stopped 10-15 feet from the victims amid \u201csquealing of tires.\u201d The driver, later identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>as defendant, jumped from the truck \u201cin stocking feet.\u201d He was cursing and shaking his fist \u201cin general at no one.\u201d He ran to a nearby telephone booth, still shouting obscenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Worried by the conduct of defendant, a complete stranger, Tetreault quickly drove from the wayside, accompanied by his companion (his wife at the time of trial). After proceeding west on Interstate 64 for several miles, Tetreault observed the truck, driven by defendant, approaching from the rear \u201cat an extremely high rate of speed.\u201d Tetreault increased his speed to 65-70 miles per hour but defendant \u201ccaught up\u201d nonetheless. As defendant was within 20 feet, driving directly toward the motorcycle, Tetreault took evasive action to avoid being struck, moving abruptly to the \u201cbreakdown lane.\u201d Defendant pulled in front of the motorcycle and stopped. Anticipating defendant would back over the motorcycle, Tetreault drove quickly onto the travel lanes of the highway to escape the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">From that location to a point about six to seven miles farther west, defendant made a series of attempts to run into the motorcycle. During this time, the motorcycle, traveling about 25 miles per hour, was driven by Tetreault from lane to lane to avoid collisions with the pursuing vehicle and was forced into the grass median strip. On several occasions, defendant released the steering wheel of the truck as it was close to the motorcycle, \u201cthrew\u201d both arms out of the window, shook his fists at the victims, cursed them, and said, \u201c T am going to kill you, you [expletive deleted].\u2019 \u201d Finally, with the aid of passing motorists, Tetreault was able to escape defendant, exit the Interstate, and proceed to his destination by another route. The victims had memorized the license number of the truck, which led to defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">At trial, the central factual issue was the accuracy of the identification of defendant as the criminal agent. The truck was registered in the name of defendant\u2019s brother, Fred Odum. The accused denied being the driver of the truck at the time in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Fred Odum, present at trial, resembled his accused brother. According to the record, defendant was of medium build, five feet ten inches tall, had very long \u201cblondish red\u201d hair tied in a pony tail, had a bushy beard, and wore glasses. At the time of the offense he wore a khaki cap, a khaki shirt, khaki pants, and white socks. Fred Odum appeared at trial wearing a beard, glasses, and khaki clothing; he was described as \u201cvery husky,\u201d with long light brown hair tied in a pony tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Tetreault and DeGraide repeatedly and positively identified defendant to the jury as the perpetrator of the crimes, based on their observations of him at the Rest Area and during the highway incidents. Tetreault said, \u201cI was within six feet of [defendant] at several points during our exchange and I got a very good look at him.\u201d He further testified, \u201che was very close to me when we were in the rest area ... so there is no doubt in my mind.\u201d Tetreault, a registered nurse at the University of Virginia Hospital, previously had seen Fred Odum who was being treated at the hospital for a gunshot wound. Noting he had \u201ca good look\u201d at Fred then, Tetreault identified defendant as the assailant. When asked during the trial to point out distinguishing features between Fred and defendant, Tetreault said, \u201cI see a strong family resemblance but I wouldn\u2019t say they look alike.\u201d He stated their body shapes, coarseness of beards, length of hair, and facial features were different, noting, \u201cI was able to get a good look at both gentlemen on different occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">DeGraide testified, having only seen Fred Odum at court on the day of trial, that she had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d defendant was operating the truck at the time in question. She said she observed him during \u201c[a] couple of minutes\u201d at the Rest Area and several times on the highway when \u201che had most of the upper half of his body hanging out of the driver\u2019s side of the truck\u201d screaming \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d At the time the motorcycle was traveling \u201cvery slow,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The brothers were the only witnesses called to testify at trial for the defense. Fred, a resident of Amelia County and employed in Richmond, stated he was living in Louisa County on April 29, the day in question. Fred, a convicted felon, testified he operated his truck that day but did not know where the vehicle was at 8:00 p.m. Under questioning by the trial judge, he said, during a series of evasive answers, that he told the investigating police officer the day after the offense that he \u201cdidn\u2019t recall\u201d where his truck had been on the previous day and that he \u201cmay have\u201d told the officer the defendant was using the truck when the incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The defendant, a resident of Amelia County, testified he didn\u2019t \u201cusually\u201d borrow his brother\u2019s truck, but stated, \u201cI have driven it.\u201d Although denying he drove the truck in Goochland County on April 29, defendant could not recall his whereabouts on that day. He said that at the time of his arrest two days after the incident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>he had no \u201creal\u201d recollection of his activities on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The verdicts were rendered on November 5, 1981, and sentencing was postponed pending receipt of a probation officer\u2019s report. Seven days later, defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdicts and grant a new trial. The ground of the motion was that newly discovered evidence had become available since the trial in that Fred Odum had \u201cconfessed\u201d on November 9. On that day, according to the motion, Odum \u201cconfessed\u201d to Lt. Parrish of the Goochland County Sheriffs Department and at the same time signed an affidavit. The brief affidavit was attached to the motion. It recited that Fred Odum was the \u201conly one\u201d who drove his truck on April 29 and that he drove it on Interstate 64 from Richmond to Louisa at about 8:00 p.m. on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion on November 30. After a lengthy discussion among the court and counsel as to the legal sufficiency of the motion, the trial judge invited defense counsel to put on \u201cany evidence that you wish to present at this time.\u201d The Odums\u2019 mother, Clara Mae Collier, was called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Collier, employed as a manager at \u201cFamily Dollar\u201d in Louisa, stated Fred Odum.was residing at her Louisa home on April 29. She testified Fred arrived there alone near 8:30 p.m. on that day driving his truck and dressed in khaki work clothes. She stated Odum was \u201ccompletely out of his mind,\u201d yelling and making \u201ca terrible noise.\u201d He was under the influence of alcohol and possibly \u201cdope,\u201d she said. She stated he wanted to call his brother, Randy, in Amelia \u201cbecause somebody had done [Fred] an injustice,\u201d and he \u201cwanted to go do some fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Collier further testified she learned subsequently that defendant had been charged with the instant offence. She was present at the preliminary hearing when the victims testified and identified defendant as their assailant. She stated she \u201cknew beyond a doubt\u201d that Fred \u201chad really done it because he had told me over and over that night that he had stopped at that phone booth to call his brother.\u201d Collier testified she told defendant to tell Fred \u201cthat he had to tell the truth\u201d and \u201cadmit that it was [Fred] driving the truck and that it was him that had done it even though he was drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Commenting on her failure to appear at the trial, Collier testified that she had \u201ca district meeting\u201d in Richmond on that day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and that she would have lost her job if she had failed to attend. She was not subpoenaed for the trial. She testified that if she had received a summons to show her district manager, she \u201cprobably\u201d would not have been fired. Furthermore, Collier said, Fred had informed her that he would confess at the trial and \u201cthat everything would be okay.\u201d In addition, Collier said she did not go to court because she did not feel there was a chance defendant would be convicted. She said the victims \u201cwould know\u201d Fred was the perpetrator and \u201ccould tell which was which if they seen them both together.\u201d Collier answered, \u201cWell no\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s question: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact in the family that they probably thought [Fred and Randy] looked so much alike that it will be confusing to the jury as well as everybody else\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Defense counsel called Fred Odum to the stand. At the time, Odum was represented by counsel who was not at the hearing because he was recuperating at home from surgery. Responding to inquiries by the trial judge, Odum stated his attorney \u201cdon\u2019t want me talking to anybody about the case\u201d and \u201che didn\u2019t know I was going to be on the stand today either.\u201d Ruling \u201cit would be unfair to you and your attorney for the court to permit you to testify,\u201d the trial judge refused to receive any testimony from Odum.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing on November 30, the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion, stating \u201cthere is no occasion to have this case retried\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not open to hearing a further motion from either side on this type of disposition of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Subsequently, the Odum family employed an attorney, who was substituted for defendant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer as counsel of record. On February 16, 1982, new counsel filed a second motion for a new trial, assigning Fred Odum\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d as grounds for the relief sought. At the outset of the sentencing hearing on February 19, defendant\u2019s attorney sought to present evidence in support of the second motion. The trial judge expressed the view that defendant merely was asking the court for rehearing of a previous motion for a new trial. The court refused to permit further testimony, allowed defendant to proffer evidence for the record, and denied the second motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in refusing to order a new trial \u201cin light of the evidence offered in support of the said Motion including the fact of a third party confession [made] after the conviction.\u201d Defendant contends Fred Odum\\\u201cgave perjured or strongly evasive testimony at trial which the.defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>could not predict.\u201d He contends that if a jury has the opportunity to hear the facts disclosed in Odum\u2019s November 9 detailed \u201cconfession\u201d and affidavit, which are \u201csubstantially different\u201d from his trial testimony, another trial of defendant would produce opposite results.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The essence of Odum\u2019s seven-page \u201cconfession,\u201d proffered during the February 19 hearing, is that he left a bar in Richmond during the early evening of April 29 after being refused further service because he \u201cwas too drunk to drink any more\u201d; he proceeded to his mother\u2019s Louisa home via Interstate 64, driving his truck while dressed in his khaki work clothes; he stopped at the Rest Area to call Randy; he observed the motorcycle there; he did not remember the subsequent events as related by the victims but he \u201cbelieve[s] probably it did happen\u201d; and he \u201ccannot say\u201d he \u201cdid not do it.\u201d During the \u201cconfession,\u201d Odum was asked why he failed to \u201ccome forward\u201d before trial with the admission. He responded that when the incident occurred he had just finished serving a sentence for \u201cfelonious assault\u201d; that another like charge would surely land him in \u201cthe slammer\u201d; and that, if he said his brother was driving the truck, probably a mere reckless driving charge would be lodged. As the case \u201cprogressed,\u201d he said, he \u201cfelt certain that [Randy] wouldn\u2019t be convicted.\u201d Defendant argues that because of Odum\u2019s \u201cconfession,\u201d corroborated by his mother, \u201ca disinterested and impartial witness,\u201d the trial court was wrong in denying a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Motions for new trials based on after-discovered evidence are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, are not looked upon with favor, are considered with special care and caution, and are awarded with great reluctance. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 602, 608, 166 S.E.2d 248, 253 (1969). The applicant bears the burden to establish that the evidence (1) appears to have been discovered subsequent to the trial; (2) could not have been secured for use at the trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the movant; (3) is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral; and (4) is material, and such as should produce opposite results on the merits at another trial. <em>Fulcher </em>v. <em>Whitlow, </em>208 Va. 34, 37-38, 155 S.E.2d 362, 365 (1967), citing <em>Reiber </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>206 Va. 657, 663, 145 S.E.2d 157, 161-62 (1965). <em>Accord Starks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 48, 301 S.E.2d 152 (1983), decided today. Here, three of these mandatory criteria have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Preliminarily, we must define \u201cthe evidence\u201d which supposedly was newly discovered under the circumstances of this case. \u201cThe evidence\u201d is not merely the written documents \u2014 the affidavit and the seven-page transcript of the question-and-answer interrogation. Rather, \u201cthe evidence\u201d is substantive information indicating Fred Odum was the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">With this concept in mind, the first requirement was not met in that \u201cthe evidence\u201d does not appear to have been discovered after the trial. Indeed, if defendant\u2019s mother is to be believed, as defendant urges, she knew immediately after the incident that Fred was operating his truck at the time in question. Also, she says she informed defendant of the alleged fact of Fred\u2019s involvement and she urged defendant, prior to trial, to persuade Fred \u201cto tell the truth\u201d and admit he was the culprit. In addition, after listening to the preliminary hearing testimony, she \u201cknew beyond a doubt\u201d Fred was the assailant. Thus, defendant and his mother were armed before the trial with the very information which surfaced after the trial via the \u201cconfession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Second, defendant has not demonstrated the evidence could not have been obtained for use at trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Actually, the record affirmatively shows lack of due diligence. While, as defendant argues, he could not force Fred to confess, nevertheless the mother was armed, as was defendant himself, with facts to present to the jury that, if true, would have tended to exonerate defendant by showing Fred to be the perpetrator. The mother was available, within the jurisdiction, and susceptible to subpoena. Yet, she was not served with process and was not present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Third, while the evidence, if believed, was material, the trial court, assessing the credibility of defendant\u2019s witnesses both at trial and at the motion hearing, properly could find that it was not such as should produce opposite results on the merits at another trial. At a future trial, the contents of Odum\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d would be only the latest in a series of inconsistent statements. More importantly, the trial court was justified in concluding that because of the positive, credible, largely unimpeached identification of defendant by the victims, the same results would occur upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">We reject summarily two other contentions of defendant. He complains because the trial court refused to receive evidence on the second motion at the sentencing hearing. At the first motion hearing, defendant was given a full opportunity to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>facts in support of the motion. After defendant offered evidence, the court ruled on the motion, admonishing counsel not to present a further motion raising the same issue. In the face of this ruling, defendant, through new counsel, attempted to have the trial court rehear the matter. There was no abuse of discretion when the court denied the rehearing, particularly in view of the fact that all information proffered on February 19, except polygraph results, was submitted or available at the time the first motion was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, defendant on February 19, as noted, proffered the results of polygraph examinations of defendant and Fred Odum, apparently conducted after the first motion hearing. They were made pursuant to written agreements between the respective parties and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. The agreements stipulated that either party could introduce the results in any hearing relating to the prosecution of defendant or Fred Odum. The trial court refused to consider the examination results, and correctly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In Virginia, results of lie detector tests are not viewed as scientifically reliable, and we have held that the exclusion of such findings, even though favorable to the accused, was proper. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 233, 237, 105 S.E.2d 152, 154-55 (1958). In the present case, we likewise hold that, even though the prosecutor and the accused stipulate to the use of such results, the trial court in the exercise of discretion properly may refuse to consider such inherently unreliable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside these verdicts and grant a new trial. Consequently, the judgments appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b180-9\">RUSSELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">I cannot agree with the conclusion reached by the majority. Fred Odum, evidently affected by the pangs of conscience, asked to speak privately with the trial judge immediately after the jury had been discharged. When this request was properly refused, Fred went to Randy\u2019s counsel that same evening and disclosed that he had committed perjury at trial and that he had been the driver of the truck at the time in question. The following week he gave a sworn statement, after proper warnings, to a deputy sheriff in the presence of Randy\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>This was, in my view, evidence which on its face meets the fourfold test of <em>Fulcher </em>v. <em>Whitlow, </em>208 Va. 34, 155 S.E.2d 362 (1967). (1) It was clearly discovered after trial. (2) It was not available to Randy at trial; as the majority concedes, by no amount of diligence could he have forced his brother to confess.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (3) It was not cumulative, corroborative, or collateral; it went directly to the gravamen of the case and was the only evidence of a criminal agent other than the defendant. (4) It was material and, if believed, would produce opposite results on the merits. It is difficult to imagine evidence more likely to result in acquittal than these admissions by the defendant\u2019s brother. This conclusion is strenghtened by the strong resemblance between the two brothers, rendering the victims\u2019 identification of Randy less persuasive than might otherwise have been the case. The trial court observed: \u201cThe defendant and his brother appeared in this courtroom before the jury dressed almost identically, appearing almost identical</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">My concern is that the court never permitted Fred Odum to testify in support of the motion for a new trial. At the hearing on the motion on November 30, 1981, Fred was present in court and was sworn as a witness. He had engaged counsel who was recuperating at home from surgery and was unable to be present that day. In these circumstances, the trial judge refused to hear any testimony from Fred. This problem was temporary and could have been resolved by a continuance. After the court instructed him not to testify until he had consulted further with his attorney, Fred blurted out: \u201cWell can I tell you all that I was the only one that operated my motor vehicle on that day?\u201d The court stated that it would disregard that remark and told Fred to \u201cstand aside.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">THE COURT: . . . Mr. Williamson, any other witnesses you wish to call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">MR. WILLIAMSON: Not at this time Your Honor. Without the benefit of this witness\u2019 testimony I don\u2019t believe it would be in the best interest of my client to conclude my evidence under this motion at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>THE COURT: Why not? What do you propose to do? When is the court going to have finality? Isn\u2019t that a risk that you run anytime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The court asked the Commonwealth Attorney his position with respect to the motion. The response was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Your honor, the problem as I indicated from the outset is that I see the office of the Commonwealth Attorney, the responsibility there is to make sure that justice prevails. The question is whether or not it did prevail with the verdict returned as it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">THE COURT: What do you propose I do now, do you move for the court to set aside this verdict or do you oppose it? [The Commonwealth Attorney] I can\u2019t oppose it at this point in time, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">After further colloquy, the court informed counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">I don\u2019t give second trials. I want you to be sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The Commonwealth Attorney then stated that he would oppose the motion. The trial judge found that Randy had participated in a \u201ccover-up\u201d when he testified at trial. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">. . . And when you let the person suffer for his own misconduct that is a proper remedy and that is exactly what Randy Odum is doing. He chose to make this bed and now the court says that he must sleep in it. He had his day in court and the fact that he took it on the chin for his brother is his problem. We don\u2019t know whether the brother will be convicted or not or whether the brother is lying today. Whether the brother was lying last week. There is nothing that says that Fred Odum is telling the truth. I wouldn\u2019t believe him on a stack of Bibles and I don\u2019t think any jury would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">The court thereupon denied the motion for new trial and stated: \u201cI\u2019m not open to hearing a further motion from either side on this type of disposition of this case.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">When Randy appeared for sentencing on February 19, 1982, his then retained counsel presented a new motion and offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>present \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support thereof. The court stated that this was a request for a rehearing of the previous motion for a new trial. Defense counsel replied that the court had not previously heard \u201call the evidence.\u201d Asked what new evidence was tendered, counsel presented a seven-page confession of Fred Odum, taken and transcribed by the Goochland County Sheriffs Department, after Fred had been given the requisite warnings. The court expressed the belief that the confession had been presented on November 30. Counsel responded that the court had seen only Fred\u2019s brief affidavit on November 30, not the seven-page confession. The court then examined the confession and said: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not before the court then.\u201d Counsel pointed out other differences between the first and second motions for new trial. The court, however, refused to hear any evidence. It overruled the motion and proceeded to impose the sentences fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The trial court surmised that both Odum brothers, and probably their mother, participated in a \u201ccover-up\u201d to exculpate Fred from the consequences of his guilt. They appeared at trial looking almost identical to confuse identification, gave evasive, probably perjured testimony, and kept Mrs. Collier in reserve, withholding her evidence from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Even if this suspicion is well-founded, it does not justify the trial court\u2019s conclusion. If Randy perpetrated a fraud on the court, conspired to obstruct justice, or committed perjury, he should be tried and punished for those wrongs, but he should not be penalized for a crime he did not commit. I cannot agree with the trial court that in \u201ctaking it on the chin for his brother,\u201d Randy is subjected to \u201ca proper remedy.\u201d The court\u2019s remarks make it plain that it had some doubt whether Randy had committed the crime; but in view of his wrongful participation in a scheme to shield his brother, it considered that to be \u201chis problem.\u201d I think it is our problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The multiple protections which surround an accused in our criminal justice system are often mystifying to observers trained in other disciplines. We justify them by our overriding concern that no innocent person will be convicted in error. In order to have peace of mind on this point, we can tolerate the escape from punishment of many whose guilt is probable, but not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Abhorrence of conviction of the innocent is not only the bedrock upon which our criminal justice system rests, it is also fundamental to the public perception of its fairness. Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. A system which is perceived to be tolerant of the danger that an innocent person has been convicted, in order to punish him for some other act of which he is suspect, will forfeit public confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The evidence of Fred Odum was so fundamental to the integrity of the conviction that it should have been heard, tested by cross-examination, and searched for corroboration before the motion for new trial was ruled on. In my view, the trial court abused its discretion by concluding in advance that it was unworthy of belief and disposing of the motion for a new trial without hearing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the convictions and remand the cases for a hearing of all of the evidence tendered on the motions for a new trial, other than that relating to polygraph tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">POFF, J., joins in dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> The majority opinion focuses on the fact that Mrs. Collier knew of \u201cthe alleged fact of Fred's involvement\u201d before trial, and that she told Randy what she had heard. Even if this hearsay would have been available to Randy through an exception to the hearsay rule, it is no substitute for a direct confession by the actual perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
