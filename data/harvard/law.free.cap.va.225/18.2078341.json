Blevins, on the alternative grounds of constructive desertion and one year\u2019s separation; she also sought support and maintenance, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. By a subsequent amendment to her bill of complaint, Mrs. Blevins added a charge of adultery as a ground of divorce. Responding, Mr. Blevins denied his wife\u2019s allegations and, in a cross-bill, prayed that he be granted a divorce on the ground that Mrs. Blevins deserted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">By final decree entered July 29, 1980, the trial court awarded the parties a divorce from one another on the ground of one year\u2019s separation. The decree also provided that Mrs. Blevins \u201cshall continue to receive her monthly social security and black lung benefits as her sole spousal support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The record shows that the parties were married September 16, 1959, and that they separated August 3, 1978. At the time Mrs. Blevins filed her bill of complaint, she was seventy-five years of age and Mr. Blevins was sixty-seven. Neither was employed. She received Social Security benefits of $176 monthly in her own right and black lung benefits of $127 per month as a dependent of Mr. Blevins. He was a retired miner receiving $954 monthly in union pensions and Social Security and black lung benefits. He held life estates in two parcels of land he conveyed to his children following his separation from Mrs. Blevins.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">On appeal, Mrs. Blevins contends she established that she was entitled to and in need of support from her husband and that he was able to contribute to her maintenance. She argues that, by limiting her to benefits she was already receiving, the trial court imposed \u201cno obligation whatsoever\u201d upon Mr. Blevins and made no real provision for her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">On the other hand, Mr. Blevins contends that he proved Mrs. Blevins deserted him and that the trial court \u201cwould have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>justified in awarding [him] a divorce . . . upon the grounds of willful desertion and abandonment . . . .\u201d Mr. Blevins argues that, under the no-fault divorce provisions of Virginia law, a spouse is not entitled to support if there exists against him or her a fault ground of divorce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, Mr. Blevins concludes, the trial court was not required to award Mrs. Blevins any support and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">A basic fallacy in Mr. Blevins\u2019 argument renders his position untenable; the trial court did not find that the separation in this case was caused by the fault or misconduct of Mrs. Blevins. Absent such a finding, Mr. Blevins is not relieved of his obligation to support Mrs. Blevins. <em>Brooker </em>v. <em>Brooker, </em>218 Va. 12, 13, 235 S.E.2d 309, 310 (1977); <em>accord Bristow </em>v. <em>Bristow, </em>221 Va. 1, 3, 267 S.E.2d 89, 90 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Alternatively, Mr. Blevins argues that the provisions of the final decree relating to Social Security and black lung benefits constitute \u201can adjudication as to support and maintenance for [Mrs. Blevins].\u201d This adjudication, Mr. Blevins maintains, was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">We disagree. It is undisputed that Mrs. Blevins was entitled to the Social Security benefits in her own right, unaffected by the provisions of the final decree. Hence, these benefits cannot be considered as spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">With respect to the black lung benefits, they would continue after the divorce only if (a) Mrs. Blevins received at least half her support from Mr. Blevins, (b) she received substantial contributions from him pursuant to a written agreement, or (c) there was in effect a court order requiring him to make substantial contributions to her support. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.351 (1982); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.207 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Mr. Blevins does not contend that Mrs. Blevins qualifies for continued black lung benefits under (a) or (b) above. He argues, however, that the \u201cfinal divorce decree is in effect a Court Order [within the meaning of (c)] for substantial contribution to be furnished to [Mrs. Blevins] by [Mr. Blevins] since her qualification for Black Lung Benefits was a result of the husband\u2019s earnings while employed as a miner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">This is mere bootstrapping on Mr. Blevins\u2019 part. Under another applicable regulation, the \u201cterm \u2018contributions\u2019 refers to contributions actually provided by the contributor from his own property, or the use thereof, or by the use of his own credit.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.395(b) (1982); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.233(b) (1982). Clearly, black lung benefits themselves do not constitute contributions within this definition. It follows that the provisions of the final decree disqualify Mrs. Blevins from receiving continued black lung benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, it was error for the trial court to consider these benefits as spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The record demonstrates Mrs. Blevins\u2019 need for support in addition to the amounts she received in government benefits. As she points out on brief, however, the trial court made no findings with respect to the extent of her needs or the ability of Mr. Blevins to contribute to her support. This was error. Accordingly, we will reverse the decree appealed from insofar as it failed to make such findings. We will remand the case for an adjudication concerning support for Mrs. Blevins, consistent both with the views expressed in this opinion and with the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Lancaster, </em>212 Va. 127, 127-28, 183 S.E.2d 158, 158-59 (1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> Code \u00a7 20-91 (9)(c) provides that \u201c[a] decree of divorce granted pursuant to [the provisions of] subsection (9) shall in no way lessen any obligation any party may otherwise have to support the spouse unless such party shall prove that there exists in the favor of such party some other ground of divorce under this section or \u00a7 20-95.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\"> Mr. Blevins cites sections in Part 400 of Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and Mrs. Blevins cites sections in Part 725. Part 400 would apply to this case if Mr. Blevins\u2019 claim for black lung benefits was filed pursuant to a 1969 act of Congress, as amended in 1972; Part 725 would apply if the claim was filed pursuant to a 1977 act, as amended the same year. The record contains no information that would indicate under which act Mr. Blevins\u2019 claim was filed, and the briefs are not helpful in resolving the problem. It is irrelevant which act is applicable, however; the language of the Part 400 sections cited in this opinion is substantially the same as the wording of the Part 725 sections also cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"><em> </em>Mrs. Blevins states on brief that, subsequent to the entry of the final divorce decree in this case, her \u201cblack lung check was no longer issued\u201d after Mr. Blevins\u2019 \u201cnew wife\u201d applied for black lung benefits as a dependent spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> Code \u00a7 20-107, which contained factors a trial court should consider in determining spousal support, was repealed in 1982 and replaced in part by Code \u00a7 20-107.1. The new legislation, however, \u201cshall not affect any pending litigation.\u201d Acts 1982, ch. 309.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\"><em> </em>Mrs. Blevins also complains that the trial court erred in the amounts it allowed her for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The court awarded Mrs. Blevins a total of $750 in attorney\u2019s fees and $275 in costs. These were matters resting in the court\u2019s sound discretion, and we do not believe this discretion was abused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
