Vincent Pross, Comptroller (the Commonwealth), appeals from an order dismissing its motion for judgment against the Board of Supervisors of the County of Spotsylvania and the former County Administrator (collectively, the Board) as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The motion for judgment, dated November 30, 1979, demanded reimbursement of a portion of certain funds advanced to the Board by the Virginia Division of Justice and Crime Prevention, an agency of the Commonwealth. Invoking the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-552, the Board demurred on the ground the suit was filed more than six months after the Commonwealth\u2019s claim was disallowed. Over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted parol testimony which showed that, although the official minutes of the meetings of the Board did not so reflect, the Board had voted on July 25, 1978, to disallow the claim and had given the Commonwealth written notice to that effect. The trial court held that the Commonwealth was a \u201cperson\u201d subject to the time limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tation prescribed in the statute, ruled that the limitation was jurisdictional, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The record reveals several errors in the proceedings below. \u201c[T]he defense that the statutory limitation period has expired cannot be set up by demurrer.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-235. \u201cUpon demurrer, the test of the sufficiency of a motion for judgment is whether it states the essential elements of a cause of action, not whether evidence might be adduced to defeat it.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Grether, </em>218 Va. 630, 633, 239 S.E.2d 103, 105 (1977). Thus, the demurrer was not cognizable and, even if it were, it raised a purely legal question, in the determination of which receipt of evidence was improper. But these errors were not assigned on appeal, and neither will be noticed in this opinion \u201cas a ground for reversal of [the] decision below.\u201d Rule 5:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We will reverse the judgment, however, because the trial court erred in holding that the Commonwealth was a \u201cperson\u201d subject to the statutory time limitation in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Insofar as relevant here, Code \u00a7 15.1-552 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">When a claim of any person against a county is disallowed ... by the board of supervisors . . . such person . . . may appeal from the decision of the board to the circuit court . . . but in no case shall the appeal be taken after the lapse of six months from the date of the decision ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">It is an ancient rule of statutory construction, one consistently applied by this Court for more than a century, that the sovereign is not bound by a statute of general application, no matter how comprehensive the language, unless named expressly or included by necessary implication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">It is old and familiar law, and is applicable to the <em>state </em>as well as the crown, at common law, that where a statute is general, and any prerogative, right, title or interest is diverted or taken from the king, in such case, the king shall not be bound unless the statute is made by express words or necessary implication to extend to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\"><em>Whiteacre, sheriff </em>v. <em>Rector &amp; wife, </em>70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 714, 716 (1878); <em>see </em>3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 62.01 (4th ed. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In particular, this rule, most recently applied in <em>Deal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 618, 299 S.E.2d 346 (1982) (Commonwealth not a \u201cperson\u201d within the intendment of arbitration statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-577), has governed our construction of statutes of limitation. \u201c[N]o statute of limitations has been held to apply to suits by the crown, unless there has been an express provision including it.\u201d <em>Levasser </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 572, 576 (1854). <em>\"Nullum tempus occurrit regi, </em>applies in this state to the Commonwealth, as it does in England to the king.\u201d <em>Taylor &amp; als\u2019 Case, </em>70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 780, 794 (1878). \u201c[T]he statute of limitations does not run against the State unless expressly mentioned.\u201d <em>Va. Hot Springs Co. </em>v. <em>Lowman, </em>126 Va. 424, 432, 101 S.E. 326, 329 (1919); <em>see also Norfolk &amp; W. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>110 Va. 95, 103, 65 S.E. 531, 534 (1909); <em>Buntin </em>v. <em>Danville, </em>93 Va. 200, 208, 24 S.E. 830, 832 (1896). The Commonwealth is not named, expressly or by implication, in Code \u00a7 15.1-552.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The ruling sustaining the Board\u2019s demurrer imposes a time limitation upon the sovereign\u2019s power to collect money due the public purse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 8.01-231 plainly provides that \u201c[n]o statute of limitations which shall not in express terms apply to the Commonwealth shall be deemed a bar to any proceeding by or on behalf of the same.\u201d That statute is absolute and unqualified. It makes no distinction between so-called \u201cpure\u201d statutes of limitation (those which time-restrict the availability of a remedy) and \u201cspecial\u201d limitations (those prescribed by statute as an element of a newly-created right).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, whether the time limitation prescribed in Code \u00a7 15.1-552 is \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cjurisdictional\u201d, as the Board contends, or merely procedural, it does not operate as \u201ca bar to any proceeding by or on behalf of the [Commonwealth] .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We hold that the Commonwealth is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to the time limitation in issue and that the trial court erred in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>missing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for judgment.
