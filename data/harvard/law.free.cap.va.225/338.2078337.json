I. M. Corporation, a company engaged in the distribution of \u201cMrs. Smith\u2019s Pies\u201d products, amounted to \u201cemployment\u201d under the Act. After a hearing, a special examiner designated by the Commission ruled that the services performed by \u201cowner-operators\u201d of A. I. M. constitute such employment. Accordingly, in a decision reciting findings of fact, the Commission ordered A. I. M. to file payroll contribution reports as required by the Act and Commission regulations, covering remuneration paid to those employees for the years 1976, 1978, and 1979 and thereafter as long as A. I. M. is liable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>A. I. M. filed a petition for judicial review in the court below pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.1-71. After consideration of the pleadings, the record of proceedings before the Commission, and argument of counsel, the trial court set aside and vacated the Commission\u2019s decision, ruling the relationship between the owner-operators and A. I. M. did not constitute employment under the applicable provisions of the Act. This appeal by the Commission ensued, following entry of the June 1980 final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Under Code \u00a7 60.1-71, \u201cthe findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by the evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the [trial] court shall be confined to questions of law.\u201d Here, the pertinent facts are undisputed and there is no claim of fraud. The record before the Commission is comprised of a specimen copy of a seven-page written agreement between A. I. M. and the owner-operators, the testimony of two witnesses, and several other exhibits. Thus, our task is to determine whether the trial court committed an error of law in setting aside the Commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Since 1975, A. I. M. has been a distributor for \u201cMrs. Smith\u2019s Pies\u201d products in the Richmond metropolitan area. The merchandise is purchased at a distribution point in Maryland and delivered daily to A. I. M.\u2019s Henrico County facility. In order to distribute the products locally, A. I. M. enters into contracts with individuals, called \u201cowner-operators,\u201d who purchase the products from A. I. M. and resell them to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The contract, labelled \u201cOwner-Operator License Agreement,\u201d and the method of operation may be summarized as follows: A. I. M., the \u201ccompany,\u201d grants the owner-operator a \u201clicense\u201d to sell all types of the company\u2019s pies in a described \u201cgeographic area of prime responsibility.\u201d The individual agrees \u201cto fully and adequately service such territory in a manner that could be reasonably expected to obtain the maximum number of sales\u201d of the company\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The owner-operator promises to purchase from the company the quantities of products he determines are necessary to maintain \u201ca sufficient distribution in the Territory.\u201d He agrees \u201cto maintain route books showing the name and address and the amounts sold to each customer so that a permanent record can be made of the customers within the territory.\u201d Such record is to be delivered to the company upon termination of the agreement. According to the contract, the individual may add customers at any time, terminate service to customers in his sole discretion, and may sell to customers outside the geographic area of prime responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The owner-operator is required to \u201cmaintain telephone service at his place of residence so that he can communicate, or be communicated with, on any special problems.\u201d He promises to work a minimum of six days per week, although, in practice, this provision is not strictly enforced. The agreement contemplates \u201cactive engagement by the Owner-Operator in his own business of distributing and selling Company\u2019s products.\u201d The individual may conduct whatever other business activities he wishes, however, except he may not distribute products within the territory that compete with Mrs. Smith\u2019s Pies products.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The individual agrees \u201cto purchase or lease and equip a truck with racks and shelves\u201d suitable for delivery of the products \u201cin a business like manner.\u201d He promises to maintain liability insurance on the vehicle and to have painted on the truck\u2019s front doors \u201cOwned and Operated by\u201d followed by the individual\u2019s name and address. He is permitted to \u201cutilize his truck equipment as he deems fit\u201d provided the use does not violate any terms of the contract. He promises to obtain, at his expense, any licenses and permits required by law for the equipment, to pay any taxes or fees assessed in respect to the equipment, and \u201cto pay all the expenses of his business operations.\u201d He is permitted to use \u201ca company owned spare vehicle\u201d for three days each calendar quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The owner-operator agrees to pay cash on the day of receipt for products purchased. Testimony showed that the individuals return to A. I. M.\u2019s Henrico County facility each evening \u201cto settle\u201d with the company. Balances owed to or by the owner-operator are carried over in some instances from day to day with settlement of each account required by Friday of each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The individual promises not to distribute \u201cday-old Soft Pies\u201d and the company declines to \u201caccept responsibility\u201d for products which have become adulterated by the \u201cOwner-Operator\u2019s mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>handling.\u201d The company agrees to \u201caccept responsibility\u201d for adulterations resulting from the manufacturing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The owner-operator may employ others \u201cin the conduct of his business\u201d and promises \u201cto service the territory with a competent, experienced and qualified Driver-Salesman\u201d who shall be under the sole control of the owner-operator. The payment of all amounts due for taxes or charges (unemployment, social security, workmen\u2019s compensation, withholding) upon such employees is the responsibility of the owner-operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The individual covenants not to compete with the company in the territory for a period of six months from termination of the agreement. He agrees that if he becomes \u201cinvolved in a labor dispute\u201d which interferes with the individual\u2019s activity for the company, the contract is subject to \u201cimmediate cancellation by the company without liability of any kind whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">According to an affidavit submitted at the hearing by A. I. M.\u2019s president, corroborated by his testimony, the owner-operator \u201creceives no payment for services from A. I. M.\u201d Although the written contract provides the company \u201cagrees to pay the Owner-Operator for services rendered to the company,\u201d an attachment to the contract interprets this provision solely as requiring the company to allow the individual a percentage discount off the posted wholesale price of company products upon sale to the owner-operator. According to the affidavit, the products so purchased from the company may be sold by the individual to his customers at a price determined solely in his discretion. The profit, if any, to the individual is the result of the owner-operator\u2019s ability to sell his products at a premium over the price paid, while minimizing the expense of his business enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The contract states the relationship of the individual to the company \u201cshall be that of independent contractor.\u201d It provides the agreement may be cancelled after the first 30 days upon either party receiving 15 days written notice from the other. It further recites the owner-operator may assign or sell his rights under the contract, subject to prior written approval of the company and provided the assignee or purchaser agrees to enter into a new agreement under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the present contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">During the administrative hearing, the Commission\u2019s field tax representative offered an an exhibit a September 25, 1978 letter of A. I. M.\u2019s president, Arnold I. Meyer. The letter was written to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Patricia Knapp, one of the owner-operators, who was subsequently discharged and applied to the Commission for unemployment compensation. Meyer testified he had been \u201cwith her\u201d during the week before the letter was written and \u201cthe lady asked for my comments on how she conducted her business on her route.\u201d The letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cDear Pat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cYou have asked for my comments on your route.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201c1. The deluxe boxed pies you put out on Tuesday, 9-19-78, should have been picked up on Friday, 9-23-78. These pies also should have a pull date on them, of no more than 3 days for fruit and 2 days for custard and meringue. Let\u2019s change this practice this week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201c2. When you over-charge a chain account like Big Star, we all get hurt, because when you get caught, we get put out of the store and possibly out of the company operation. This has happened already. Remember, Mrs. Smith Pie Co. is Coast to Coast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201c3. You will be able to serve the <em>STOPS </em>I gave you on Tuesday and Thursday or Friday, by working route 30, this side of 360, with a little extra driving. Give it a chance to develop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201c4. Your truck is in need of repair. Like a new muffler (which you have already) and repair or replace the magnets on the pie cabinets. If you would like, I will LOAN you a new cabinet for your truck and YOU at your own expense get it put in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201c5. I want from you, no later than Thursday September 28, 1978, a complete and up to date, including the stops I added, Route List of your area, listing the items put in each stop, whether it be deluxe, mellowrich, pastry or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201c6. I think that if you would start to work before 6 A.M., you could handle more business and complete your job. Your job is not finished until you have returned to the warehouse and checked in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">\u201cThis letter may be taken as a warning. I have done for you, now do for me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Having examined the relationship of the parties as demonstrated by the facts, we now turn to the applicable law. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>meaning of \u201cemployment\u201d in the unemployment compensation context is controlled by statute. The Act is essentially a public welfare measure and the levying of taxes on the employer is merely incidental to its purpose, \u201cwhich is to assure a measure of security against the hazard of unemployment in our economic life.\u201d <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>182 Va. 426, 438, 29 S.E.2d 388, 393 (1944). The Act is to be liberally construed to effect its beneficent purpose and in borderline cases \u201cemployment\u201d should be found to exist. <em>Id. </em>Exemptions in the Act should be strictly construed against the alleged employer, the rule requiring liberal construction in favor of the taxpayer not being applicable. <em>Huffman Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>184 Va. 727, 740, 36 S.E.2d 641, 646 (1946). As defined in the Act, the term \u201cemployment\u201d should be accorded a broader and more inclusive meaning than in the common-law context of master and servant. <em>Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>178 Va. 46, 57, 16 S.E.2d 357, 361 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">As pertinent here, \u201cemployment\u201d generally means any service performed for remuneration or under any contract of hire, written or oral. Code \u00a7 60.1-14(l)(a). The section specifically provides in subsection (6) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cServices performed by an individual for remuneration shall be deemed to be employment subject to this title unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">(a) Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services, both under his contract of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">(b) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed; or such individual, in the performance of such service, is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Thus, the services individuals perform for remuneration under a contract for hire are deemed \u201cemployment\u201d unless they are exempt under both (a) and (b) above. And the burden is on the putative employer to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it is within the statutory exemptions. 178 Va. at 57, 16 S.E.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The dispositive question in this case arises from subsection (a) of \u00a7 60.1-14(6); it is whether the trial court correctly decided A. I. M. established by a preponderance of the evidence that its owner-operators have been and will continue to be free from control over the performance of their services, both under the agreement and in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">As at common law, and in the worker\u2019s compensation context, the existence of the master-servant relationship under the unemployment Act \u201cdoes not depend upon how the parties designate each other in their contract.\u201d <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>189 Va. 692, 708, 54 S.E.2d 72, 80 (1949). <em>See Richmond Newspapers Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 98-99, 294 S.E.2d 840, 843-44 (1982). Rather, the individual\u2019s status in relation to the alleged employer is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances adduced by the evidence, including the provisions of any written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In any master-servant analysis, be it in the area of tort liability, worker\u2019s compensation, or unemployment compensation, the power of control is the determining factor in ascertaining the parties\u2019 status. The potential power of control, not the actual exercise of control, is the important element. <em>Texas Company </em>v. <em>Zeigler, 177 </em>Va. 557, 14 S.E.2d 704 (1941). And the right of control does not include only the power to specify the result to be accomplished, but, in the language of the Act, it must include the power over the \u201cperformance of such services, both under [the] contract of service and in fact.\u201d \u00a7 60.1-14(6)(a). If the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work, an employer-employee relationship exists; if the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor. <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. at 98, 294 S.E.2d at 843. Among the tests used to determine if the right to control exists are: whether instructions have to be obeyed, and whether either of the parties possesses the right to terminate services at will without incurring liability to the other. <em>Zeigler, 177 </em>Va. at 565, 567, 14 S.E.2d at 707, 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Both parties rely on <em>Sinclair Refining Company, supra, </em>and claim it factually supports their respective positions on the question of control. There, this Court decided delivery truck drivers performing services under contract with Sinclair, a petroleum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>distributor, were entitled to unemployment compensation coverage as employees and that they were not independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Attorney General lists similarities between <em>Sinclair </em>and this case: Sinclair and A. I. M. are distributors of products; both employ delivery truck drivers under a contract of hire to deliver products to retail outlets; Sinclair and A. I. M. drivers pay all expenses incident to delivery; Sinclair and A. I. M. drivers operate in designated geographical areas; both companies require hold-harmless agreements of the drivers; Sinclair and A. I. M. drivers must insure those who assist on their delivery routes; Sinclair and A. I. M. drivers are required to maintain telephone service for the employer\u2019s convenience; Sinclair and A. I. M. drivers cannot assign their contracts without prior permission; and termination without cause is possible without resulting liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">A. I. M., on the other hand, observes the <em>Sinclair </em>Court noted several factors in support of the conclusion that the individuals in question were employees of the oil distributor, \u201cnone of which factors are present in the relationship between A. I. M. and the Owner-Operators.\u201d For example, A. I. M. says, the Court noted that the oil distributor did not sell its products to the truck drivers; cash and credit sales were made in the name of the oil distributor, not the driver, and receipts were signed in the distributor\u2019s name by the driver; the oil distributor, not the driver, fixed the sales price of the product sold; the drivers were required to pay one-half of the advertising expenses incurred by the distributor; and the drivers were required to have a telephone listed in the distributor\u2019s name. Given these crucial distinctions from <em>Sinclair, </em>A. I. M. argues, the trial court correctly recognized the owner-operators were free from A. I. M.\u2019s control in selling bakery products to their customers. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Careful scrutiny of the contract and other evidence in this case convinces us that A. I. M. has failed to prove that the owner-operators are free from the company\u2019s control and direction in the performance of their service of distributing the products in issue. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates A. I. M.\u2019s potential power of control, and an actual exercise of that control in the case of Patricia Knapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Potentially, A. I. M. has the right to discharge without cause any owner-operator without incurring any liability to the individual. In this contract, which has no fixed term, the cancellation provision, reasonably construed, provides that within the first 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>days, discharge without cause may be accomplished without notice; thereafter termination without cause may be upon a 15-day notice. The language of the provision is: \u201cThis Agreement may be cancelled at any time after the first thirty (30) days upon either party receiving fifteen (15) days written notice from the other.\u201d And an examination of the agreement as a whole does not require a different construction of the termination provision. Such provisions are consistent with the existence of an employer-employee relationship, <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. at 100, 294 S.E.2d at 844, and A. I. M. has failed to prove otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">More important, however, is the conduct demonstrated by the Knapp letter. That document is more revealing upon the real relationship of the parties than the professionally drawn contract and the carefully worded affidavit,: with appropriate legalese, of A. I. M.\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Meyer\u2019s \u201ccomments\u201d in the letter show the actual exercise of control over the performance of the daily duties of an owner-operator in Knapp\u2019s position. In paragraph 1, the details of date-marking and the timing for recovery of the perishable goods are outlined. In paragraph 2, the fixing of Knapp\u2019s profit margin is under close scrutiny. In paragraph 4, the need for vehicle and equipment maintenance is specified. In paragraph 5, there is close supervision of the manner of compiling the information in the route books; a deadline for compliance is fixed. In paragraph 6, control is exercised over the hours of work. And, finally, the letter is labelled a \u201cwarning\u201d and the employer says: \u201cI have done for you, now [you] do for me.\u201d When asked about the meaning of the \u201cwarning,\u201d Meyer testified it related to \u201ctermination of her contract and arrangements with me.\u201d Moreover, the letter shows, in many instances, the sharp inconsistencies as to control between the actual practice and that apparently contemplated by the theoretical contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A. I. M.\u2019s reliance on the <em>Gill </em>case, <em>supra, </em>is misplaced. There, a newspaper route carrier was held to be an independent contractor and not an employee. But in that worker\u2019s compensation case with similar facts, the statute that governs here, providing the employee must be \u201cfree from control,\u201d was not, of course, involved. In addition, the degree of control exercised by Richmond Newspapers over Gill was much less than A. I. M. exerted over Knapp. For example, in contrast to the Knapp situation, the newspaper did not interfere with Gill\u2019s hours of work, did not specify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>manner in which Gill was to serve his customers, and did not monitor the condition of the equipment used in the delivery operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In summary, under this evidence, as in <em>Sinclair, </em>it cannot be said that the delivery persons are \u201cfree from direction or control in the performance of their specified services\u201d; the \u201ccontract requires obedience to the business methods prescribed\u201d by A. I. M. and places the owner-operators \u201cunder a complete system of restraint and control, a control constant during\u201d the life of the agreement. 189 Va. at 711, 54 S.E.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In conclusion, A. I. M. contends no \u201cwages\u201d within contemplation of the Act are paid the owner-operators, and, thus, it has no potential liability for unemployment taxes. It says that because no money actually is transferred by A. I. M. to the owner-operators, there is no basis upon which to apply any percentage to determine the amount of tax owed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 60.1-72. We reject that contention. The term \u201cwages\u201d is broadly defined in Code \u00a7 60.1-26. As pertinent here, the statute provides that: \u201c \u2018Wages\u2019 means all remuneration payable for personal services, including . . . any payments made by an employer to an employee . . . and the cash value of all remuneration payable in any medium other than cash.\u201d The manner in which the remuneration is achieved is never controlling. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>179 Va. 202, 215, 18 S.E.2d 390, 396 (1942). Here, the owner-operator obtained the goods from A. I. M at a percentage discount of the wholesale price of the company\u2019s products. If we assume a 20 per cent discount, the remuneration to the owner-operator would be at least an amount equalling that percentage of \u201cthe posted wholesale price of Company products,\u201d in the language of the contract. Manifestly, while the employees may not have been paid cash in hand, they nevertheless were \u201cpaid\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 60.1-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, the Commission\u2019s decision in this matter dated December 18, 1979 will be reinstated, and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> A. I. M. moves to dismiss this appeal. It contends the Commission lacks standing to seek review of the order below because it is not a person \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-670. There is no merit to this contention. Given the nature of the instant proceeding under chapter 5 of the Act, we believe Code \u00a7 60.1-71 implicitly recognizes the Commission\u2019s standing as an aggrieved party because it provides without qualification that in the appeal before this Court, \u201cthe Commission shall be represented by the Attorney General.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
