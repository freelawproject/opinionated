XV, \u00a7 2 of the city charter of Danville authorized the city council to delegate to the planning commission the power to approve requests for rezoning. Section 19-27 of the city code actually accomplished the delegation; \u00a7 19-28 prescribed the procedures for disposition of zoning applications by the planning commission; and \u00a7 19-29 provided for an appeal to city council and for reversal of a planning commission decision if council found the decision to be arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. The principal question in this case concerns the validity of these charter and code provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">On December 1, 1978, Harry D. Ireson and Iris M. Ireson filed an application with the planning commission for the rezoning from R-l residential to C-2 commercial of certain property located in the northwest quadrant of the intersection of Riverside Drive, or U.S. Route 58, and Park Avenue in the City of Danville. The property, or a portion thereof, was under contract of sale to Grover Adkins and Glen Wood, who planned to use the land for an automobile dealership. A competing dealership was located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection, and another commercial use was located in the southeast quadrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">At a meeting held February 21, 1979, the planning commission denied the rezoning request. The Iresons appealed to city council. On March 13, council rezoned a portion of the property, designated as Lots IB and 1C, to C-2 commercial. On March 28, Ruth C. Laird, Bruce C. Dungan, William E. Evans, Victor W. White, and David C. Brooks (collectively, Laird), owners of property in Windsor Heights subdivision located to the north of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>in question, filed a petition for declaratory judgment seeking an adjudication that council\u2019s action in rezoning Lots IB and 1C was illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On June 6, the trial court held that council\u2019s rezoning action was \u201cinvalid and of no effect\u201d because council had not made a finding that \u201cthe Planning Commission acted arbitrarily or abused its discretion in making its decision.\u201d The court remanded the matter to council \u201cfor its consideration ... of the appeal from the Planning Commission in accordance with applicable standards.\u201d The court retained jurisdiction of the case in the event further relief became necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On June 7, city council adopted an ordinance stating that council had reviewed the planning commission\u2019s refusal to rezone and had found the decision to be \u201carbitrary and an abuse of discretion.\u201d The ordinance rezoned Lots IB and 1C to C-2 commercial. Laird immediately filed a \u201cPetition for Relief,\u201d requesting the court to void this rezoning action by council.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In the meantime, on March 16, 1979, Lewis E. Ireson, Louise M. Ireson, and Pearle E. Cox filed an application with the planning commission for the rezoning to C-2 commercial of Lot 3 5 A, which fronted on Riverside Drive and adjoined Lot IB on the east. Lot 35A was also under contract of sale to Adkins and Wood, who intended to use it in their car dealership. On June 21, the planning commission denied this rezoning request, and the denial was appealed to city council. On September 11, council adopted an ordinance stating that the planning commission\u2019s refusal to rezone Lot 35A was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. The ordinance rezoned the lot to C-2 commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">On September 12, Laird filed another petition for declaratory judgment, this time seeking an adjudication that city council\u2019s rezoning of Lot 35A was illegal and void. This new proceeding and Laird\u2019s pending \u201cPetition for Relief\u2019 in the case involving Lots IB and 1C were heard by the court on June 10, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court announced its findings, which were incorporated into final decrees entered August 27, 1980. The decree relating specifically to Lots IB and 1C stated that ch. XV, \u00a7 2 of the city charter and \u00a7\u00a7 19-27, -28, and -29 of the city code were invalid because they produced an unlawful delegation of legislative power in authorizing the planning commission to rezone property. The decree stated further that city council\u2019s June 7, 1979 rezoning of Lots IB and 1C was void and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>invalid because it was accomplished \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid Charter and Code sections and not in conformance with the requirements of law otherwise applicable.\u201d The decree went on to say, however, that subsequent to the June 10 hearing, the planning commission and city council had reconsidered the zoning of Lots IB and 1C \u201cin accordance with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code of Virginia\u201d and that on July 17, 1980, upon the planning commission\u2019s recommendation, council had adopted an ordinance rezoning Lot IB to C-2 commercial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The decree ended with the language, \u201cthis matter is accordingly dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The decree relating to Lot 35A reiterated the trial court\u2019s findings that ch. XV, \u00a7 2 of the city charter and \u00a7\u00a7 19-27, -28, and -29 of the city code were void and invalid. This decree stated further, however, that \u201cLot 3 5-A was properly rezoned by the Council of the City of Danville at its regular meeting on September 11, 1979,\u201d and that \u201csaid lot ... is and shall be zoned C-2 Commercial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Laird has not questioned in this appeal the trial court\u2019s finding in the August 27, 1980 decree that Lot IB had been rezoned to C-2 commercial \u201cin accordance with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code of Virginia.\u201d This finding and, hence, the rezoning of Lot IB, have become final and not subject to further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Accordingly, we consider only the rezoning of Lot 3 5A. With respect to this lot, Laird argues that the provisions of the city charter authorizing city council to delegate to the planning commission the power to rezone are entitled to a presumption of legislative validity. The key factor in giving effect to this presumption, Laird submits, is that the grant of authority was from the General Assembly and not city council; therefore, the grant must be measured against the General Assembly\u2019s authority to delegate power. The Constitution of Virginia imposes no limitation upon this authority, Laird maintains, but appears, instead, to authorize the delegation involved here by providing in art. Ill, \u00a7 1 for the creation of administrative agencies \u201cwith such authority and duties as the General Assembly may prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Continuing, Laird argues that the delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency is proper if accompanied by a statement of policies, purposes, and principles to guide and control the agency in the performance of its duties. Here, Laird states, sufficient guidelines are found in Title 15.1 of the Virginia Code and in the city\u2019s comprehensive plan, charter, and code. Council has actually performed the legislative act of zoning the entire city, Laird asserts, and, with the guidelines established for the planning commission, \u201c[tjhere is no discernible reason why the partial rezoning of a few lots is so purely legislative as to be exercisable only by a purely legislative body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We disagree. Laird\u2019s arguments are interesting, but for the most part they are irrelevant or esoteric. We believe the case turns on the simple proposition that the rezoning of property, no less than the establishment of its original zoning classification, is wholly legislative, requiring action in the form of an amendatory ordinance adopted by the one \u201cpurely legislative body\u201d that exists in the locality involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Under Va. Code \u00a7 15.1-486, the zoning of property is accomplished when the \u201cgoverning body\u201d of a county or municipality \u201cby ordinance\u201d classifies the territory within its jurisdiction. Similarly, under Code \u00a7 15.1-491(g), the rezoning of property is accomplished when the \u201cgoverning body ... by ordinance\u201d amends the property\u2019s zoning classification. In each instance, the term \u201cgoverning body\u201d identifies the board of supervisors in a county, or the municipal council in a city or town, as the entity which alone has the authority to legislate \u201cby ordinance\u201d in a particular locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">It might be argued that these statutory requirements are nullified when the provisions of Danville\u2019s city charter interact with Va. Code \u00a7 15.1-501. This Code section, a part of ch. 11 of Title 15.1, states in part that \u201c[n]o provision in any municipal charter in conflict with this chapter shall be affected hereby.\u201d Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-486 and -491(g) are in the same chapter as \u00a7 15.1-501. Hence, because the city charter permits rezoning by the planning commission, which obviously cannot enact ordinances, it might be argued that in Danville property may be rezoned other than by ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">It would appear, however, that this argument is refuted by another charter provision. Chapter II, \u00a7 11 of the charter (Acts 1952, ch. 578) states in part that \u201cevery act of the council . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>placing any burden upon or limiting the use of private property shall be by ordinance.\u201d Rezoning unquestionably places burdens upon or limits the use of private property; therefore, if ch. II, \u00a7 11 controls, rezoning even in Danville must be accomplished by ordinance adopted by city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We believe ch. II, \u00a7 11 does control; this charter provision recognizes what in our view is an overriding requirement of zoning law in Virginia: only the governing body of a locality may zone or rezone property and then only by ordinance. Thus, with the invalid ch. XV, \u00a7 2 excised, ch. II, \u00a7 11 actually brings the city charter into harmony, rather than conflict, with ch. 11 of Title 15.1 of the Virginia Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">For these reasons, we agree with the trial court that ch. XV, \u00a7 2 of the city charter and \u00a7\u00a7 19-27, -28, and -29 of the city code produced an unlawful delegation of legislative power in authorizing the planning commission to rezone property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> **8 This brings us to Laird\u2019s remaining contention, <em>viz., </em>that the trial court erred in \u201cnot finding the rezoning of Lot 35A to be improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Laird\u2019s argument on this point presents the question whether the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to make the issue of the zoning of Lot 35A fairly debatable. The appellees maintain that the sufficiency question is not properly before this court; they say the case \u201cwas not tried [below] as a \u2018zoning\u2019 case, but dealt only with constitutional and procedural issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">While we question whether the sufficiency issue is indeed properly before this court, we will observe that we have examined the entire record and are satisfied the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to make the issue of the zoning of Lot 35A fairly debatable. Hence, city council\u2019s action in rezoning the lot must stand. <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>221 Va. 328, 335, 269 S.E.2d 381, 386 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We will affirm the decrees of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Chapter XV, \u00a7 2 of the city charter and \u00a7\u00a7 19-27, -28, and -29 of the city code are reproduced below as they appear in Danville, Va.

The decision stands for the principle that the General Assembly may delegate to an administrative board the power to make rules and regulations to carry out the purposes and provisions of a legislative enactment.
