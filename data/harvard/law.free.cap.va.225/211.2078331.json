Prior to the trial, Winfield gave written notice to the Commonwealth, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7(B), that he wished to offer the following evidence as to Sandra\u2019s prior sexual conduct with others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">(1) Testimony of Leon Moore that Sandra Nelson agreed to have sexual intercourse with him on the condition he. pay her twenty dollars; that he had sexual intercourse with Sandra Nelson; that he did not pay her the twenty dollars; that Sandra Nelson stated that if he did not pay her the twenty dollars that she would tell his wife; that he paid her twenty dollars; that Sandra Nelson has a reputation in the community for being unchaste and immoral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">(2) Testimony of Lawrence Winfield that Sandra Nelson asked him if she should have sexual intercourse with Leon Moore for money; that Sandra Nelson stated to him that she needed the money so she would have sexual intercourse with Leon Moore; that Lawrence Win-field has had sexual intercourse with Sandra Nelson; that he paid her ten dollars after having sexual intercourse with her; that Sandra Nelson has a reputation in the community for being unchaste and immoral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>(3) Testimony of Denise Daniels that Sandra Nelson has stated to her that a man was going to give Sandra Nelson $100.00 if she would go to bed with him and she decided not to do it but that she allowed him to feel her breasts for $25.00; that Sandra Nelson has a bad reputation in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">(4) Testimony of Towana Parham that Sandra Nelson has stated to her on three different occasions that Sandra Nelson has been to bed with different men; that Sandra Nelson stated to her Sandra Nelson was pregnant but did not know who the father of the child was; that Sandra Nelson has a bad reputation in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">(5) Testimony of Anthony Branch that Sandra Nelson has an unchaste and immoral reputation in the community; that Sandra Nelson has on several occasions had sexual intercourse with various men and then told the man\u2019s wife or girl friend of the incident in an effort to create trouble between the man and his wife or girl friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">(6) Testimony of Carol Jackson that Sandra Nelson has an unchaste and immoral reputation in the community; that he has had sexual intercourse with Sandra Nelson; that he had a friend tell him he paid Sandra Nelson $150.00 to have sexual intercourse with her; that Sandra Nelson has had sexual intercourse with a man and then told the man\u2019s girl friend about the incident in an effort to create trouble between the man and his girl friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The matter was set for hearing in advance of trial for a determination of the admissibility of the proffered evidence. For the purposes of the hearing, the Commonwealth stipulated that the six witnesses would testify as indicated in the notice quoted above. Accordingly, their actual testimony was dispensed with, and the parties submitted the question of admissibility to the court as a matter of law. The court determined that the evidence was \u201cinadmissible ... as evidence relevant to show that the complaining witness had a motive to fabricate the charge against the accused.\u201d This ruling presents the dispositive question on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">At Winfield\u2019s subsequent jury trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that Sandra, nineteen years of age, and Winfield, thirty-two, lived in the same apartment development in Chester<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>field County and were on friendly terms. On the afternoon of July 24, 1981, Sandra asked Winfield to give her a ride in his car to a \u201cnight spot\u201d in Petersburg that night. She testified that long after dark, he picked her up and drove her to a rural area in Dinwiddie County and frightened her by telling her they were in an area where the \u201cKKK\u201d met and that she would be caught by the \u201cKKK\u201d if she attempted to leave the car. He then stopped the car, threatened to hurt her if she resisted, forcibly removed her clothing, pinned her hands behind her and forcibly subjected her to rape and sodomy. She testified that she cried and attempted to push him away but \u201cjust didn\u2019t have the strength.\u201d Afterwards, driving back toward Petersburg, the defendant stopped at a service station and went inside to buy cigarettes. At this point, Sandra testified, she jumped out of the car and ran to three strangers in a truck, offering them all the money in her purse if they would take her home. When she arrived home, she told a friend that Winfield had raped her and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">A state trooper interviewed her at her apartment at about 2:00 a.m. on July 25th, within thirty minutes of her call. He found her upset, nervous, and crying. He saw no signs of physical injury. She accompanied him to Dinwiddie County and pointed out the area in which she said the offenses had occurred. Sandra and the trooper were the only witnesses called by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Winfield testified that he had known Sandra for six months and that they had frequent discussions concerning sex. On the afternoon of July 24, 1981, he said that she asked him if he thought she should spend the night with another man who had offered her $150.00. Winfield responded that that was up to her, but that he would give her $50.00 for sexual favors. She agreed. About 11:00 p.m. that night, she came to his apartment and said she was ready to go with him. He drove her down Interstate 95 and she suggested that they stop at a motel. He told her that he could not afford a motel room and drove her to the end of a country road. He testified that they then engaged in sexual intercourse with Sandra\u2019s consent and willing participation. On the way home, Sandra asked him for the promised $50.00. He told her that he had it at home, but not with him. She became angry and said that she was going to have him arrested. When he stopped at a service station to buy $2.00 worth of gas and some cigarettes, she got into a car with somebody he didn\u2019t know and left. He returned home and went to bed. Later, he said, he was awakened by Sandra\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>boyfriend who asked him about the money and threatened him with jail. Soon thereafter the police took him to the Dinwiddie County jail on a rape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Winfield\u2019s testimony was partially corroborated by three defense witnesses. William Swann testified that he had been present during the afternoon conversation between Sandra and Winfield and had heard Sandra agree to accept $50.00 for sexual favors. Sandra admitted on cross-examination that Swann had been present, along with another man, when she had an afternoon conversation with Winfield. Clifford Coles, a cousin of Sandra\u2019s, testified that she later told him that she had had sexual intercourse with Winfield, that she \u201cwished he had given her $50.00,\u201d and that she was \u201cgoing to make sure he gets some time.\u201d James Harris, who knew both parties, testified that he saw them sitting together in Winfield\u2019s parked car late on the evening of July 24th and that Sandra was sitting close against Winfield, who had his arm over the seat. Harris stopped to talk, but Sandra seemed to be in a hurry, saying: \u201cAh, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d Harris left, and heard of Winfield\u2019s arrest for rape the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The jury found Winfield guilty under both indictments and fixed his punishment at five years confinement in each case. The court overruled his post-trial motions and imposed the two sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We first consider Winfield\u2019s principal assignment of error: that the trial court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that the evidence of the six witnesses proffered in his notice was not relevant to show a motive to fabricate the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Prior to July 1, 1981, Virginia followed the well-settled rules of the common law that the accused in a rape case, asserting the defense of consent, might introduce evidence of the previously unchaste character of his accuser. <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 355, 218 S.E.2d 445 (1975). This could only be shown by proof of general reputation of the complaining witness in the community for unchastity or prostitution. <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 356, 158 S.E.2d 108 (1967); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 703, 20 S.E.2d 536 (1942). The reason for the rule was set forth in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 110-11 (1886):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">This offence may be committed as well on a woman unchaste, or a common prostitute, as on any other female. In [the] matter of evidence, however, want of chastity may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>within recognized limits, be shown as rendering it more probable that she consented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">This rule has been subjected to increasing criticism in recent years. Commentators observed, first, that there is no logical connection between a woman\u2019s willingness to submit to the defendant accused of raping her, and her willingness to share intimacies with another man with whom she might have had a special relationship. This is particularly true since the law always permitted the defendant to show that he personally had a prior sexual relationship with the complaining witness. <em>See Finney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 808, 152 S.E. 555 (1930). Second, proof of general reputation in the community has very little probative weight. In a transient urban society, it often boils down to the uninformed opinion of a character witness. Finally, such reputation evidence was extremely prejudicial to the rape victim. It tended to turn the trial into a inquiry as to her chastity, rather than the guilt of the accused. Defense counsel was enabled to focus the trial so effectively upon her prior life that she was understandably reluctant to testify. The result was that many sexual assaults went unreported because of fear of the traumatic effects of prosecuting them. <em>See </em>Kneedler, <em>Sexual Assault Law Reform in Virginia\u2014A Legislative History, </em>68 Va. L. Rev. 459 (1982); Berger, <em>Man\u2019s Trial, Woman\u2019s Tribulation: Rape Cases in the Courtroom, </em>77 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1977); Tanford and Bocchino, <em>Rape Victim Shield Laws and the Sixth Amendment, </em>128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 544 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The legislative response was a series of \u201crape shield\u201d laws, adopted by forty-seven states and by the Congress. Most of these limit or prohibit the admission of general reputation evidence as to the prior unchastity of the complaining witness, but some, like ours, permit the introduction of evidence of specific acts of sexual conduct between the complaining witness and third persons in carefully limited circumstances. <em>See </em>Tanford and Bocchino, <em>supra </em>at 592-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The application of these laws has presented the courts with the concomitant problem that no legislation, however salutary its purpose, can be so construed as to deprive a criminal defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine his accuser and to call witnesses in his defense. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308 (1974), (state law shielding disclosure of juvenile-offender status of a prosecution witness is subordinate to defendants\u2019 right of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>frontation), and <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14 (1967), (state law barring accomplice testimony is subordinate to defendant\u2019s right to offer evidence in his defense.) The analogy of these cases to the \u201crape shield\u201d laws is plain. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 1 A.L.R.4th 283 (1980). Some jurisdictions have held such laws unconstitutional where they purport to preclude the defendant from showing the prior sexual conduct of the complaining witness. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Jalo, </em>27 Or. App. 845, 557 P.2d 1359 (1976). Others have, in order to give the statute a constitutional interpretation, implied an exception where the trial court, in an <em>in camera </em>hearing, makes a preliminary determination that the proffered evidence would be relevant and probative on the issue of consent. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>121 N.H. 53, 426 A.2d 457 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Instructed by the experience of other jurisdictions, and with the evident purpose of steering a safe course through these shoals, the Virginia General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 as a part of a sweeping revision of the general laws pertaining to criminal sexual assault, effective July 1, 1981. Kneedler\u2019s analysis suggests that the specific sanction given by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 to evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, for strictly limited purposes, will accommodate most of the foreseeable constitutional claims which a defendant might legitimately raise. Kneedler, <em>supra, </em>at 500-02. While the constitutional problems are instructive in determining the legislative intent as to the scope of the exceptions contained in the statute, no constitutional challenge is raised in this case. Indeed, the parties here debate only whether the proffered evidence meets the requirements of the statute\u2014that is, was it <em>relevant </em>to show that the complaining witness had a \u201cmotive to fabricate\u201d the charge against the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Winfield argues that his defense was \u201ccontract and consent;\u201d that Sandra, having no other way to enforce collection of her agreed fee, threatened a rape prosecution to \u201cblackmail the appellant into payment, to obtain revenge for non-payment and to maintain her standing in her \u2018business community\u2019.\u201d This, he says, was her \u201cmotive to fabricate.\u201d He argues that the excluded evidence shows a pattern of such past sexual conduct on her part, and that it is thus relevant to show her \u201cmotive to fabricate\u201d the charge. The Commonwealth responds that the evidence amounts to nothing more than a generalized assault on the character of the complaining witness, tending to attack her credibility but not showing any particular motive to fabricate. Evidence of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>prior sexual conduct with third persons as a general attack on credibility was, the Commonwealth argues, prohibited at common law and is still prohibited under the \u201crape shield\u201d law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On the limited record before us, consisting only of the terse representations contained in the notice quoted above, it is impossible for us to determine the entire form and extent of the proffered evidence, but certain conclusions may be drawn. In our view, the General Assembly intended to preclude evidence of general reputation or opinion of the unchaste character of the complaining witness in all circumstances. This view arises not only from the criticisms of this kind of evidence, mentioned above, which underlay the legislative reforms of 1981, but also from the fact that the new law gives a defendant access for the first time to far more probative evidence: specific prior sexual conduct with third persons, if it is relevant for the purposes set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7. All six of the proffered witnesses would testify to Sandra\u2019s bad reputation, and that part of their testimony was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We agree with Winfield, however, that evidence tending to show that Sandra had a distinctive pattern of past sexual conduct, involving the extortion of money by threat after acts of prostitution, of which her alleged conduct in this case was but an example, is relevant, probative, and admissible in his defense. The proffered testimony of Leon Moore appears to contain elements of this kind. If, upon an evidentiary hearing conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7(C), it tends to show such a pattern, and otherwise meets the rules of evidence, it should be admitted. <em>See </em>Kneedler, <em>supra, </em>at 501. Its exclusion as a matter of law, based only upon the description contained in the notice, is error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Evidence of past sexual conduct, to be admissible under the \u201cmotive to fabricate\u201d provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7(B), however, must show a pattern of behavior which directly relates to the conduct charged against the complaining witness in the case on trial. Thus there is a sufficient nexus between Sandra\u2019s alleged efforts to extort money by threats from others, after acts of prostitution, and Winfield\u2019s version of her conduct in the present case, to render such evidence relevant and probative of a motive to fabricate. On the other hand, the proffered evidence of most of the witnesses to the effect that Sandra had engaged in sexual acts with others for money, is a mere attack on her character, related only indirectly to the theory of the defense. It attempts to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>her reputation, by specific acts, as a prostitute, but it does not directly establish a motive to fabricate any charge against the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such evidence was inadmissible at common law and the new statutory scheme does not open the door to its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Finally, any evidence of prior sexual conduct by the complaining witness must comply with the usual rules of evidence as well as the requirements of the \u201crape shield\u201d law. Since general reputation or opinion evidence as to unchaste character is to be excluded, it appears probable from the defendant\u2019s notice that at least three of the proffered witnesses would relate nothing more than inadmissible hearsay. We cannot make this determination on the record before us. In an evidentiary hearing conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7(0), the trial court should ascertain whether the evidence is presented in a form which meets an exception to the hearsay rule, and is otherwise admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Winfield also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict on the ground that the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support his convictions. There is no merit in this contention. Sandra\u2019s testimony is not incredible, and would be sufficient to support the verdicts even if entirely uncorroborated. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 936, 45 S.E.2d 167 (1947). Here, however, corroboration was supplied by the testimony of the trooper as to her prompt report of the crime and her distraught condition. <em>See Bailey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">For the reasons earlier stated, the judgments appealed from will be reversed, and the cases remanded to the trial court for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth may be advised, not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-12\"> \u00a7 18.2-67.7. Admission of evidence.\u2014A. In prosecutions under this article, general reputation or opinion evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s unchaste character or prior sexual conduct shall not be admitted. Unless the complaining witness voluntarily agrees otherwise, evidence of specific instances of his or her prior sexual conduct shall be admitted only if it is relevant and is:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">1. Evidence offered to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence of the offense charged which is introduced by the prosecution, limited to evidence designed to explain the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease, or physical injury to the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts; or</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">2. Evidence of sexual conduct between the complaining witness and the accused offered to support a contention that the alleged offense was not accomplished by force, threat or.intimidation or through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness, provided that the sexual conduct occurred within a period of time reasonably proximate to the offense charged under the circumstances of this case; or</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">3. Evidence offered to rebut evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s prior sexual conduct introduced by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">3.

If such evidence relates to the past sexual conduct of the complaining witness with a person other than the accused, it shall not be admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ted and may not be referred to at any preliminary hearing or trial unless the party offering same files a written notice generally describing the evidence prior to the introduction of any evidence, or the opening statement of either counsel, whichever first occurs, at the preliminary hearing or trial at which the admission of the evidence may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">C. Evidence described in subsections A and B of this section shall not be admitted and may not be referred to at any preliminary hearing or trial until the court first determines the admissibility of that evidence at an evidentiary hearing to be held \u2022before the evidence is introduced at such preliminary hearing or trial. The court shall exclude from the evidentiary hearing all persons except the accused, the complaining witness, other necessary witnesses, and required court personnel. If the court determines that the evidence meets the requirements of subsections A and B of this section, it shall be admissible before the judge or jury trying the case in the ordinary course of the preliminary hearing or trial. If the court initially determines that the evidence is inadmissible, but new information is discovered during the course of the preliminary hearing or trial which may make such evidence admissible, the court shall determine in an evidentiary hearing whether such evidence is admissible. (1981, c. 397.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\"> This is not to say that evidence showing that the complaining witness had acted as a prostitute would never be admissible. In certain circumstances it might be directly relevant to the defense, as showing a motive to fabricate the charge. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>225 Kan. 576, 592 P.2d 897 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"At\">THOMPSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">As I construe the majority opinion, the only evidence in the proffer that would be admissible is (1) involving Leon Moore. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>We agree with Winfield, however, that evidence tending to show that Sandra had a distinctive pattern of past sexual conduct, involving the extortion of money by threat after acts of prostitution, of which her conduct in this case was but an example, is relevant, probative, and admissible in his defense. The proffered testimony of Leon Moore appears to contain elements of this kind. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">. . . Thus there is a sufficient nexus between Sandra\u2019s alleged efforts to extort money by threats from others, after acts of prostitution, and Winfield\u2019s version of her conduct in the present case, to render such evidence relevant and probative of a motive to fabricate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The majority pays due respect to the analysis of the statute by Dean Kneedler, but omits his explication of the \u201cmotive-to-fabricate\u201d provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">[The provision] was intended to be quite narrow in scope, limited to instances in which evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct creates an inference that the victim had an ulterior motive to charge the defendant with sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">. . . Properly interpreted, therefore, the provision operates only where the motive to fabricate arises directly from the past sexual conduct. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">The victim\u2019s relationship with a third person may suggest a motive to fabricate the charge apart from evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with that person. In such cases, evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with that person should be excluded. For example, if a man finds his fiancee in bed with his best friend, and his fiancee then accuses the best friend of rape, how much evidence of the relationship between the man and his fiancee should be admitted to support the defense that the fiancee fabricated the charge? Obviously, the best friend would be permitted to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s relationship with her fiancee as evidence that she had a motive to fabricate the charge. The provision, however, does not permit the admission of . evidence of the <em>sexual </em>relationship between the victim and her fiancee unless it is the sexual relationship that gave rise to the motive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fabricate. On the facts of this hypothetical, unless it could be shown that the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with her fiancee gave rise to the motive to fabricate, evidence of that conduct would not be probative of a motive to fabricate and should, therefore, be excluded. An even clearer case would arise if the accused attempted to show that the victim had had prior sexual relations with third persons with whom the victim had no current relationship. Such evidence clearly would be irrelevant to the existence of a motive to fabricate. Its only use would be either to show that the victim had a general propensity to engage in consensual sexual acts or to impeach the victim\u2019s general credibility, both of which are prohibited under the new sexual assault law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">In sum, a sexual relationship may be relevant to demonstrate a motive to fabricate, but it will not be relevant in every case. Thus, under the motive-to-fabricate provision, the trial judge must consider carefully whether there is a sufficiently direct link between the past sexual conduct and the motive to fabricate to warrant admission of that conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Kneedler, <em>Sexual Assault Law Reform in Virginia\u2014A Legislative History, </em>68 Va. L. Rev. 459, 494, 495-496 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">These isolated episodes have two common ingredients: (1) sexual intercourse; and (2) the client\u2019s unwillingness to pay for the services rendered. In the first instance, compliance was effected after a threat to expose the client\u2019s conduct to his spouse; in this case, it was alleged that the collection method was an accusation of rape. The majority states there is a nexus or common link between the two. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In the Leon Moore liaison, there was no falsehood, no motive to fabricate. Yet from this can the fact finder logically infer the motive to fabricate the charges against Winfield? Is a threat to expose the truth the same as a motive to fabricate? I do not perceive a common thread in such dissimilar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">In my opinion, the Leon Moore incident is not admissible. A threat to extort money is not the legal equivalent of a motive to fabricate, and I dissent to that extent</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
