Following a bench trial, the district court sentenced Contreras to six months of imprisonment and ten years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">Contreras contends that his conviction violates due process because no state has implemented SORNA and thus registration under SORNA was impossible. SORNA\u2019s registration requirements for individual offenders took effect on the date of SORNA\u2019s enactment regardless whether any state had implemented SORNA\u2019s administrative requirements. <em>United States v. Heth, </em>596 F.3d 255, 258-60 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2010). Because Texas had its own sex offender registry, Contreras was not convicted of failing to do the impossible. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">Contreras asserts as well that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he knowingly violated SORNA. To sustain a criminal conviction for a violation of \u00a7 2250, the Government had to prove that Contreras (1) was required to register under SORNA, (2) traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, and (3) \u201cknowingly fail[ed] to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA].\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2250. Contreras contends that the plain language of the statute makes clear that the term \u201cknowingly\u201d applies not only to failure either to register or update a registration generally, but also to the provisions of SORNA specifically. Thus, the Government could not prove that he \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to register. SORNA contains \u201c \u2018no language requiring specific intent or a willful failure to register such that [the defendant] must know his failure to register violated federal law.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Whaley, 577 F.3d 254, 262 &amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Gould, </em>568 F.3d 459, 468 (4th Cir.2009)). As the Government was not required to prove Contreras knew that he violated SORNA and the evidence presented at trial supported a finding that Contreras knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>failed to register, his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Contreras\u2019s arguments that Congress lacked authority to enact SORNA and that his lack of notice of the specific provisions of SORNA violates due process are foreclosed, as he concedes. <em>See Whaley, </em>577 F.3d at 261-62. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
