Specifically, he asserts that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to justify the upward variance was unreasonable because the guidelines range already accounted for the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, whether the sentence falls \u201cinside, just -outside, or significantly outside\u201d the applicable advisory guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if, under the totality of the circumstances, it fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) [the sentencing guidelines range;] (5) any pertinent policy statement [of the Sentencing Commission;] (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeCy\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In addition, the district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">\u201c[W]e recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Moreover, in reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we have compared the actual sentence imposed to the applicable statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">More particularly, \u201c[i]n reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may [ ] take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95. Generally, \u201ca major departure [, <em>i.e., </em>variance,] should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Nevertheless, no \u201cpresumption of unreasonableness\u201d attaches to a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595. Likewise, \u201cquantifying the variance as a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or median prison sentence recommended by the Guidelines\u201d is unhelpful because \u201cdeviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme-in percentage terms-when the range itself is low.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 128 S.Ct. at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>In sum, \u201c[b]ecause of its institutional advantage in making sentence determinations, a district court has considerable discretion in deciding whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance and the extent of one that is appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.) (quotations and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). Stated differently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">[w]e may vacate a sentence because of the variance only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKI\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[Tjhat we might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In sentencing the appellant, the district court gave this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-8\">Now the court has conducted an upward variance here pursuant to the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">As I said on two or three occasions here in the last few minutes, this is not the Defendant\u2019s first criminal endeavor. He has two prior felony convictions: burglary of a conveyance and delivery of cocaine. Now granted, the Defendant\u2019s convictions occurred when he was several years younger. But the treatment of those offenses that are in a Category I gives him great benefit and leniency and does not, in the Court\u2019s opinion, adequately reflect the history and characteristics of this Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-10\">As the prosecutor pointed out, he had opportunities to withdraw. He made one previous criminal excursion in this area. And so, the advisory sentence in this case, the Court finds, does not adequately address the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">Upon consideration of the record on appeal, and after review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court\u2019s imposition of the upward variance did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Specifically, Dukes\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum term of imprisonment and exceeded the top end of the guidelines range by only eight months. Additionally, the district court, in justifying the upward variance, applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a reasonable fashion, even if the guidelines range itself already accounted for many of the same factors. As a result, we cannot say that Dukes\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
