On appeal, Muhammad argues that AVSG\u2019s failure to pay him the amount of overtime pay that he requested amounted to race discrimination. Muhammad asserts that, during discovery, AVSG failed to produce its March 2006 payroll roster. He argues that this document would have demonstrated that he was the victim of race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">In addition, Muhammad argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in AVSG\u2019s favor as to his retaliation claim, which was based on AVSG\u2019s termination of his employment. He argues that AVSG\u2019s proffered reasons for his termination \u2014 his alleged threat against an AVSG manager and his aggressive demeanor during a telephone call \u2014 were false, and constituted a mere pretext for retaliation. In support of this argument, he asserts that Peggy Myers, AVSG\u2019s Senior Regional Director for Human Resources, told the Georgia Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) that there was no reason for his termination. In his reply brief, Muhammad attaches an unlabelled and unsigned document, which, he contends, constitutes evidence that a DOL employee interviewed Myers, and that Myers stated that there was no reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination. Muhammad also relies on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (\u201cEEOC\u201d) determination that it was reasonable to conclude that AVSG had retaliated against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">Through counsel, Muhammad, who is African-American, filed a complaint alleging that AVSG terminated him in violation of his rights under Title VII of the Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Rights Act of 1964. In his complaint, Muhammad alleged that he had worked on a part-time basis for AVSG as an audiovisual technician. He further alleged that, on March 21, 2006, he learned that his overtime pay rate, which previously had been approved by an AVSG regional director, had been reduced due to his race. Muhammad asserted that, after he complained about this discriminatory treatment, AVSG terminated him on March 27, 2006. Muhammad alleged that these events demonstrated that AVSG had discriminated against him on the basis of his race, and had retaliated against him for engaging in activity that is protected under Title VII. Based on these events, Muhammad had filed charges with the EEOC on March 29, 2006, ultimately receiving a notice of his right to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Near the beginning of the discovery period, the magistrate judge ordered that a discovery request \u201cmust be served sufficiently in advance (usually thirty (30) days) of the deadline for responses to be made within the discovery cut-off date.\u201d The parties and the court agreed that the discovery period would end on November 3, 2008. The parties\u2019 exhibits reflect that, in his interrogatories and document requests, Muhammad did not request that AVSG produce a copy of the freelance-employee payroll roster for the pay period ending on March 17, 2006. Muhammad\u2019s exhibits included, however, an email dated December 4, 2008, in which Muhammad stated that he was \u201cstill waiting\u201d for AVSG to produce its payroll roster for March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">After the end of the discovery period, AVSG filed a motion for summary judgment as to both of Muhammad\u2019s claims. It supported its motion with a statement of material facts, exhibits, and deposition testimony. These statements, depositions, and exhibits demonstrated the following undisputed facts. AVSG was in the business of providing audio and visual services to clients holding business meetings or presenting large-scale productions. AVSG held a contract with the Westin Peachtree Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, to provide audio-visual services to the hotel and its guests. In order to satisfy this contract and similar contracts, AVSG employed \u201cas-needed,\u201d or freelance, employees. Muhammad began working at the Westin in 2005 as a freelance employee. At that time, Jose Martinez was AVSG\u2019s Director at the Westin, and William Parsons was AVSG\u2019s Director of Sales at the Westin. The hourly rate that Muhammad would receive for providing audio-visual services was to be negotiated between himself and Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">According to Muhammad\u2019s deposition testimony, he and Martinez agreed that he would receive overtime pay at the rate of 1.5 times what he earned during a regular work hour. They further agreed that he would receive overtime pay after he worked 10 hours in a single day, as well as when he worked over 40 hours in a week. As a result, if Muhammad worked 12 hours on four days during a week, he would receive overtime pay for two hours on each of the four days that he worked. In addition to this overtime pay, he would also receive eight hours of overtime pay for the work week.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">In his deposition, Parsons testified that, during March 2006, he assumed temporary responsibility for the duties formerly performed by Martinez, including duties related to the payment of freelance audio-visual employees such as Muhammad. In preparing the payroll for freelance employees for the pay period ending on March 17, Parsons learned that there were discrepancies in the overtime pay rates being received by Muhammad and other freelance employees. Parsons believed that AVSG paid overtime rates only where an employee worked more than 40 hours in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>week, and did not also pay overtime rates where an employee worked more than 10 hours in a day. Because he believed that the overtime rates that Muhammad and other employees were receiving did not comply with this policy, Parsons contacted Stewart Young, AVSG\u2019s Regional Vice President for the Atlanta Hotel Division. Young asked Parsons to forward the payroll information to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">In his deposition, Young testified that, when he received the payroll information from Parsons, he discovered that Muhammad, Mark Spikes, and Jason Porter, all of whom were black, were being paid overtime pay that was calculated in an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d manner that was inconsistent with AVSG policy. Young considered this overtime pay calculation to be improper, because it resulted in an employee being paid at a rate that was in excess of the value of his work. Young was not aware that some employees had been receiving overtime pay calculated in this manner until he reviewed the March 17, 2006, payroll roster. After reviewing the March 17 payroll roster, Young contacted AVSG\u2019s payroll department, and asked it to hold Muhammad\u2019s, Porter\u2019s, and Spikes\u2019s checks until their correct overtime pay rate was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Myers also provided deposition testimony in this case. Myers testified that, on March 23, 2006, Muhammad called her to complain about Young\u2019s decision regarding his overtime pay. Myers stated that, \u201cDuring the conversation, Mr. Muhammad became very upset, had raised his voice, was very angry about the fact that he hadn\u2019t been paid his overtime properly in his mind. And he said that [Young] would have to bear the brunt of any result of us not paying him.\u201d Myers interpreted this statement as a threat against Young. Later that day, Myers decided to seek Muhammad\u2019s termination. After speaking with her supervisor about her concerns arising from Muhammad\u2019s telephone call, Myers received permission to terminate Muhammad. Myers stated that she had terminated Muhammad based on his \u201cdemeanor during the [March 23] conversation and based on the threat.\u201d She explained that Muhammad\u2019s tone during the March 23 conversation was \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201caggressive.\u201d When asked whether there was any reason for terminating Muhammad apart from his alleged threat, Myers stated, \u201c[I]t was the threat in addition to the demeanor during the discussion and the demeanor in the communication.\u201d On March 27, 2006, Myers informed Muhammad that AVSG had terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Regarding his termination, Muhammad testified that, when he contacted the payroll department to inquire about his delayed check, the department informed him that his overtime pay rate had been changed. Muhammad discussed this change with Young and, according to Muhammad, Young agreed that Muhammad\u2019s pending paycheck would include overtime pay at the rate that he had agreed upon with Martinez. When Muhammad received his paycheck, however, it included overtime pay calculated under the new, reduced pay rate. Muhammad further testified that he complained to Myers that Young had mistreated him and other black employees by unfairly reducing their overtime pay rates. Muhammad asked Myers \u201cto look into\u201d Young\u2019s treatment of black employees. Muhammad denied that he made a threat against Young during his conversation with Myers, or that he made a statement indicating that Young would bear the \u201cbrunt\u201d of the consequences of his decision to reduce Muhammad\u2019s overtime pay. Muhammad acknowledged, however, that he was \u201cpassionate\u201d during the March 23 telephone conversation, and that he spoke to Myers with \u201cstrong emphasis.\u201d He asked Myers to \u201cpardon [his] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>passion,\u201d because his tone with her had been \u201cvery passionate.\u201d On the Monday following March 23, Muhammad again called Myers, and Myers informed him that AVSG had \u201cdecided to no longer use his services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">AVSG\u2019s exhibits that it submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment included its payroll roster for freelance employees during the pay period beginning on March 11, 2006, and ending on March 17, 2006. This roster showed the work hours reported for numerous freelance employees, including Muhammad, Spikes, and Porter. During his deposition testimony, Muhammad identified one of AVSG\u2019s exhibits as AVSG\u2019s payroll roster for freelance employees for the pay period ending on March 17, 2006. He stated that he knew that every employee on the March 17 payroll roster, with the exception of Jason Patrick, was black. At the time of his deposition, Muhammad was not aware of Patrick\u2019s race. In one of his exhibits, however, Muhammad identified Patrick\u2019s race as black.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Muhammad filed a response opposing summary judgment, which he supported with a brief, a statement of disputed facts, and exhibits. Muhammad\u2019s exhibits included the affidavit of James Beattie, who averred that his race was white, and that AVSG had employed him as a freelance worker. Beattie further averred that, during March 2006, AVSG had employed him to provide audio-visual labor at the Westin Hotel. Beattie stated that, \u201c[djuring [his] freelance employment with [AVSG], [his] agreed upon/contracted rate per job was never changed without [his] permission.\u201d Beattie did not state whether he had worked during the pay period ending on March 17, 2006. Beattie also did not state whether he had received overtime pay that was calculated based on an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">One of Muhammad\u2019s exhibits was an excerpt from the deposition testimony of Spikes, another freelance AVSG employee. Spikes testified that he had not complained to AVSG about the reduction in overtime pay rates because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be retaliated against.\u201d He did not explain why he had believed that AVSG would retaliate against him if he complained about his overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Muhammad\u2019s exhibits also included a document entitled \u201cGeorgia Department of Labor Claims Examiner\u2019s Determination.\u201d This document informed Muhammad that he was considered to be eligible for unemployment benefits. In a section entitled \u201cReasoning,\u201d the DOL stated, in relevant part, \u201cYou were fired and no specific reason was given to you.\u201d At the bottom of the document, the date of April 14, 2006, was designated as the \u201cdate of interview.\u201d The document did not indicate who had been interviewed on that date. In addition, this document did not state whether a DOL representative had actually spoken with an AVSG employee regarding Muhammad\u2019s termination. The parties\u2019 exhibits do not include any additional evidence indicating whether the DOL contacted AVSG or Myers. Although Muhammad, in his deposition testimony, stated that Myers told a DOL unemployment investigator that there was no reason for his termination, he did not explain how he had personal knowledge of whether a DOL investigator had spoken with Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Muhammad\u2019s exhibits further included a copy of the EEOC\u2019s determination of the merits of his race discrimination and retaliation claims. The EEOC stated that the evidence did not establish that Muhammad was denied wages, suspended, or discharged due to his race. Regarding Muhammad\u2019s retaliation claim, the EEOC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>The investigation did reveal, however, that four (4) days after [Muhammad] complained about his wages, he was suspended and later discharged. Respondent\u2019s explanation for [Muhammad\u2019s] suspension and subsequent discharge is pretextual, and does not withstand scrutiny. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that [Muhammad] was suspended and discharged in retaliation for having opposed unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The EEOC did not set forth any additional facts or reasoning in support of its conclusion regarding Muhammad\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In addition to filing exhibits in support of his opposition to summary judgment, Muhammad also filed a brief. In his brief, Muhammad argued that AVSG\u2019s motion for summary judgment was not ripe because it had failed to produce its payroll roster for March 2006. Muhammad asserted that he had requested that AVSG provide him with this document, and that .this document would be probative of the pay rates received by black and white freelance employees. Muhammad further argued that he had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination because AVSG had reduced the overtime pay rates only of black employees. Muhammad pointed out that Beattie, a white AVSG freelance employee, had executed an affidavit averring that AVSG did not alter his pay rate without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In his brief, Muhammad also argued that he had established a <em>prim a facie </em>case of retaliation because he had believed that his complaint to Myers about the discriminatory overtime pay rate constituted protected activity under Title VII. Muhammad contended that the question of whether AVSG had articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination constituted a disputed issue of fact. Muhammad asserted that he did not make a threat during his conversation with Myers. In addition, he asserted that, when the DOL requested that Myers provide a reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination, she did not provide the DOL with a reason. As evidence of this, Muhammad relied on his own testimony and the DOL\u2019s notice that he was entitled to unemployment benefits. Muhammad contended that, due to Myers\u2019s failure to provide a reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination to the DOL, the EEOC concluded that AVSG had retaliated against him. Based on this evidence, Muhammad argued, a jury could determine that AVSG\u2019s proffered reason for his termination was a mere pretext for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">In the report and recommendation, the magistrate recommended that the district court grant AVSG\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The magistrate found that Muhammad\u2019s ripeness argument lacked merit because he did not point to any documents indicating that he had requested that AVSG produce its March 2006 payroll roster, nor had he filed a motion to compel the production of this evidence. In addition, the magistrate determined that Muhammad had failed to explain how this evidence would demonstrate that summary judgment was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Addressing the merits of Muhammad\u2019s race discrimination claim, the magistrate found that he had failed to establish a prima <em>facie </em>case because he did not point to a white employee who was permitted to receive overtime pay calculated based on an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method. Accordingly, the magistrate concluded that the court should grant summary judgment in favor of AVSG as to Muhammad\u2019s race discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The magistrate also found that Muhammad had failed to establish a <em>pyima facie </em>retaliation claim. Because Muhammad al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>leged that AVSG retaliated against him before he filed a formal charge with the EEOC, the magistrate found that Muhammad\u2019s retaliation claim was brought under Title VU\u2019s opposition clause, rather than the participatory clause. As a result, the magistrate determined that Muhammad was required to show that, at the time he voiced his complaint to Myers, he held an objectively reasonable good faith belief that AVSG had engaged in unlawful discrimination. The magistrate found that Muhammad\u2019s belief that he was the victim of discrimination was not objectively reasonable, because he was not aware of any white employee who received overtime pay calculated based on the \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method. The magistrate further found that, even assuming that Muhammad had established a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case, AVSG had articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination because Myers had requested Muhammad\u2019s termination based on his angry demeanor and his threat against Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Having determined that AVSG had articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination, the magistrate went on to find that none of the facts that Muhammad had pointed to in his brief demonstrated that AVSG\u2019s proffered reason for his termination was pretextual. Specifically, the magistrate determined that the DOL\u2019s statement regarding unemployment benefits was not evidence of pretext because it reflected only that Muhammad did not provide the DOL with a reason for his termination, and did not show that AVSG had failed to provide the DOL with a reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination. Regarding the EEOC\u2019s determination, the magistrate found that the court was not required to defer to the EEOC\u2019s finding in deciding summary judgment. Moreover, the magistrate stated, the EEOC\u2019s finding in this case was conclusory, and thus failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext. Accordingly, the magistrate concluded that the court should grant summary judgment in favor of AVSG as to Muhammad\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Shortly after the magistrate entered the report and recommendation, counsel for Muhammad withdrew from the case. Muhammad, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed objections to the report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In his objections, Muhammad argued that AVSG\u2019s alleged refusal to provide him with the payroll roster for the pay period ending on March 17, 2006, constituted circumstantial evidence of race discrimination. Muhammad also argued that he was terminated in retaliation for opposing race discrimination. Relying on the DOL\u2019s letter, Muhammad asserted that Myers did not provide the DOL with a reason for his termination. In an amendment to his objections, Muhammad specifically asserted that the DOL had asked Myers why Muhammad was terminated during a telephone conversation that took place on April 14, 2006. Muhammad did not cite to any evidence in support of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The district court overruled Muhammad\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. The court determined that Muhammad\u2019s primary objection to the report and recommendation was the magistrate\u2019s reliance on Myers\u2019s testimony in finding that there was no merit to his retaliation claim. The court, however, found that it was undisputed that Myers had honestly believed that Muhammad\u2019s demeanor during the March 23 telephone call was \u201cthreatening.\u201d The court also found that Myers had sought Muhammad\u2019s termination based not only on his alleged threat against Young, but also based on his inappropriate tone. Accordingly, the court concluded that AVSG had presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Muhammad\u2019s termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>nation, which Muhammad had failed to rebut. In addition, the court determined that summary judgment was appropriate as to Muhammad\u2019s race discrimination claim because he had failed to show that he was treated differently from a similarly situated comparator. Accordingly, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment <em>de novo. Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2002). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWhen deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Rojas, </em>285 F.3d at 1341-42 (quotation omitted). We liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Title VII provides \u201cthat it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1561 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff may rely on circumstantial evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1561-62. When relying on circumstantial evidence to support his claim, a plaintiff may demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing that: \u201c(1) he belongs to a [protected class]; (2) he was subjected to [an] adverse job action; (3) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his classification more favorably; and (4) he was qualified to do the job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1562. \u201cTo make a comparison of the plaintiffs treatment to that of non-minority employees, the plaintiff must show that he and the employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a plaintiff cannot identify a similarly situated comparator who was treated more favorably than himself, then \u201csummary judgment is appropriate where no other evidence of discrimination is present.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in AVSG\u2019s favor as to Muhammad\u2019s race discrimination claim, because Muhammad failed to demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of .race discrimination. Muhammad failed to point to a white employee who received overtime pay calculated based on an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method. In addition, he failed to demonstrate that Young knowingly permitted any employee, white or black, to receive overtime pay calculated in this manner. While Young reduced the overtime pay of only black freelance employees, the record also shows that no white freelance employees worked during the pay period ending on March 17, 2006. Beattie\u2019s affidavit did not prove otherwise, since Beattie did not state that he worked during the pay period ending on March 17, 2006, or received overtime pay calculated based on an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method. Accordingly, Muhammad failed to point to a similarly situated white comparator who was treated more favorably than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Moreover, Muhammad also failed to point to additional evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination. While he emphasizes that AVSG allegedly failed to provide him with the payroll roster for the pay period ending on March 17, 2006, this argument lacks merit. Muhammad\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>terrogatories did not include a request that AVSG produce this document. While Muhammad\u2019s exhibits included an email to AVSG\u2019s counsel stating that he was waiting for them to produce this document, this email was dated December 4, 2008, well after the discovery period ended on November 3, 2008. Moreover, AVSG included this document in the exhibits that it filed in support of its motion for summary judgment, and Muhammad identified and discussed this document during his deposition testimony. The March 17, 2006, payroll roster did not indicate that any white freelance employees worked during that period, or were permitted to receive overtime pay calculated based on an \u201covertime on top of overtime\u201d method. Accordingly, there is no evidence that AVSG concealed this document from Muhammad, or that the information in this document created a genuine issue of material fact regarding Muhammad\u2019s race discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), an employer may not discriminate against an employee because \u201che has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice [under Title VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Total System Services, Inc., 221 </em>F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000). The statute\u2019s participation clause \u201cprotects proceedings and activities which occur in conjunction with or after the filing of a formal charge with the EEOC.\u201d <em>Total System Services, Inc., 221 F.3d </em>at 1174. The opposition clause, on the other hand, protects activity that occurs before the filing of a formal charge with the EEOC, such as submitting an internal complaint of discrimination to an employer, or informally complaining of discrimination to a supervisor. <em>See id; see also Rollins v. State of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Law Enforcement, </em>868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the plaintiff may show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is some causal relationship between the two events. <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1566. Where a plaintiff is proceeding under the opposition clause, \u201cthe plaintiff need not prove the underlying claim of discrimination which led to [his] protest.\u201d <em>Tipton v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, </em>872 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, the plaintiff must show that he held a reasonable good faith belief that the discrimination existed. <em>Id. </em>In order to demonstrate that he held a reasonable, good faith belief that discrimination occurred, the plaintiff must show not only that he subjectively believed that his employer\u2019s behavior was discriminatory, \u201cbut also that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented.\u201d <em>Butler v. Alabama Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>536 F.3d 1209, 1213 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe objective reasonableness of an employee\u2019s belief that [his] employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice must be measured against existing substantive law.\u201d <em>Clover v. Total System Services, Inc., </em>176 F.3d 1346, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cWhere binding precedent squarely holds that particular conduct is not an unlawful employment practice by the employer, and no decision of this Court or of the Supreme Court has called that precedent into question or undermined its reasoning, an employee\u2019s contrary belief that the practice is unlawful is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Butler; </em>536 F.3d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">\u201cOnce the plaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the employer must proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1566. This burden is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>\u201cexceedingly light.\u201d <em>Meeks v. Computer Assoc. Int\u2019l, </em>15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cIf the employer offers legitimate reasons for the employment action, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1566. In order to demonstrate pretext, \u201c[t]he plaintiff must meet the reason proffered head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In assessing the merits of a plaintiffs claims under Title VII, a court is not required to defer to the EEOC\u2019s determination of the merits of the claim. <em>Moore v. Devine, </em>767 F.2d 1541, 1549-51 (11th Cir.1985), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>780 F.2d 1559, 1560 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also Price v. Federal Exp. Coup., </em>283 F.3d 715, 719, 725 (5th Cir.2002). Instead, the court must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the claims. <em>Moore, </em>767 F.2d at 1550-51. \u201c[W]hile EEOC findings in general may be significant evidence, their probative force in individual cases varies considerably and is left to the determination of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in AVSG\u2019s favor as to Muhammad\u2019s retaliation claim. Because Muhammad alleged that AVSG retaliated against him before he filed a charge with the EEOC, the magistrate correctly determined that his retaliation claim fell under the opposition clause, and that Muhammad was thus required to show that he held a reasonable, good faith belief that unlawful discrimination had occurred. Muhammad failed to show that he held an objectively reasonable belief that AVSG had engaged in race discrimination. As discussed in the previous section, we have recognized that a black plaintiff may show that his employer engaged in race discrimination by pointing to a similarly situated white comparator that was treated more favorably than he was treated, or by pointing to additional evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination. As noted above, Muhammad had no evidence that white employees were treated more favorably than black employees regarding their overtime pay rates, and was aware of no other credible evidence of race discrimination. Due to this lack of evidence, Muhammad\u2019s belief that race discrimination had occurred was not objectively reasonable when viewed in light of our precedent addressing race discrimination claims. Because Muhammad did not hold an objectively reasonable belief that AVSG had engaged in race discrimination, he failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Moreover, even assuming that Muhammad could demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation claim, AVSG articulated a legitimate reason for his termination. Accepting as true Muhammad\u2019s testimony that he did not articulate a threat during his conversation with Myers, he admitted that his demeanor during this conversation was passionate, and he did not contest that Myers found his tone and demeanor to be offensive. Accordingly, AVSG has met its \u201cexceedingly light\u201d burden of articulating a legitimate reason for Muhammad\u2019s termination \u2014 his tone and demeanor during his March 23 telephone conversation with Myers, which she perceived to be offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Muhammad failed to demonstrate that this reason was a mere pretext for retaliation. Although Muhammad testified during his deposition that Myers told a DOL representative that there was no reason for his termination, he did not explain how he had personal knowledge of this matter. The DOL\u2019s determination regarding Muhammad\u2019s unemployment benefits does not indicate that a DOL representative contacted AVSG about Muhammad\u2019s termination. In addition, the document that Muhammad has attached to his reply brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>which, he asserts, constitutes evidence that Myers spoke with a DOL representative, was not submitted to the district court. Even assuming that we properly could consider this document on appeal, this document does not indicate that it was generated by the DOL. While Muhammad also relies on the EEOC\u2019s determination that he was the victim of retaliation, the district court was required to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the merits of Muhammad\u2019s claims, and was not required to defer to the EEOC\u2019s conclusion as to his retaliation claim. Moreover, the EEOC did not provide facts or reasoning in support of its conclusion. As a result, the court did not err by failing to attribute significant probative value to the EEOC\u2019s determination. Thus, even assuming that Muhammad could demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>claim of retaliation, his evidence does not demonstrate that AVSG\u2019s proffered reason for his termination was pretextual, and the court did not err in granting summary judgment as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
