The answer to this question matters because it determines whether the dispatcher is entitled to overtime pay under the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(2). The district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, so we affirm that court\u2019s decision exempting the dispatcher from overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Brian Rock was employed in several different capacities by Sunbelt Cranes, Construction, &amp; Hauling, Inc. (\u201cSunbelt\u201d) from 1999 until 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the end of his employment with Sunbelt, Rock was a dispatcher in the crane rental division. He voluntarily resigned in 2008 and brought this action against Sunbelt under the FLSA for unpaid overtime compensation and for liquidated damages. Sunbelt responded that Rock was exempt from the FLSA and thus was not eligible for overtime pay. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Sunbelt, finding that Rock was an administrative employee under the FLSA, and thus was not entitled to recover overtime pay or liquidated damages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions of law and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthington, </em>475 U.S. 709, 713, 106 S.Ct. 1527, 1529, 89 L.Ed.2d 739 (1986); <em>Renteria-Marin v. Ag-Mart Produce, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). Factual findings are clearly erroneous \u201cif the record lacks substantial evidence to support it so that our review of the entire record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Reich v. Dep\u2019t of Conservation and Natural Res., </em>28 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted). This is a highly deferential standard of review, and this Court will only disturb the district court\u2019s factual findings where, \u201cafter making all credibility choices in favor of the fact-finder and reviewing the record as a whole, it is clear that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>CFTC v. Gibraltar Monetary Corp., </em>575 F.3d 1180, 1186 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">Whether certain activities exclude an employee from FLSA overtime benefits is a question of law and is reviewed <em>de novo. Icicle Seafoods, </em>475 U.S. at 714, 106 S.Ct. at 1530; <em>Bothell v. Phase Metrics, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">The FLSA was enacted in 1938 to \u201c \u2018aid the unprotected, unorganized, and lowest paid of the nation\u2019s working population; that is, those employees who lacked sufficient bargaining power to secure for themselves a minimum subsistence wage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hogan v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>361 F.3d 621, 625 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Brooklyn Sav. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>Bank v. O\u2019Neil, </em>324 U.S. 697, 707 n. 18, 65 S.Ct. 895, 902 n. 18, 89 L.Ed. 1296 (1945)). To further the goals of protecting employees from abusive labor practices, Congress set federal standards regarding minimum wages and child labor, and established a forty-hour workweek.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">There are provisions for a workweek beyond the forty hours set by the statute. If an employee works more than forty hours in a week, the employee must be compensated at least time-and-a-half for each hour over forty. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(2). However, if the employee works in a \u201cbona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity,\u201d then the overtime pay requirements do not apply. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 213(a)(1). For the administrative exemption to apply, an employee must (1) earn no less than $455 per week, (2) have primary duties that involve \u201cthe performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer\u2019s customers,\u201d and (3) exercise \u201cdiscretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance\u201d in performing his primary duties. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(1)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The employer bears the burden of proving that an employee is exempt from overtime payments. <em>Atlanta Prof'l Firefighters Union, Local 134 </em>v. <em>City of Atlanta, </em>920 F.2d 800, 804 (11th Cir.1991). FLSA provisions are to be interpreted liberally in the employee\u2019s favor and its exemptions construed narrowly against the employer. <em>See Birdwell v. City of Gadsden, </em>970 F.2d 802, 805 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In this case, the district court determined that Rock met the three requirements for an administrative exemption, so he was not entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA. <em>See Rock v. Sunbelt Cranes, Constr. &amp; Hauling, Inc., </em>678 F.Supp.2d 1264, 1270-73 (M.D.Fla.2009). The parties do not dispute that Rock worked in excess of forty hours each week and that his salary exceeded $455 per week. For that reason, we go directly to the question of whether Rock\u2019s duties satisfied the remaining requirements for application of the administrative exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">The second prong of the administrative exemption test asks whether an employee\u2019s primary duties directly relate to \u201cthe management or general business operations of the employer or the employer\u2019s customers.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(2). To meet this requirement, the employee \u201cmust perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">The district court found that Rock\u2019s primary job duties included customer communication, choosing the appropriate crane for specific jobs, assigning operators to cranes, overseeing other employees, preparing and reviewing job tickets, and maintaining the crane rental schedule. <em>Rock, </em>678 F.Supp.2d at 1266. He was also responsible for selecting the type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment, and tools that were needed to meet the customers\u2019 needs. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69. In essence, the district court concluded that Rock effectively managed Sunbelt\u2019s crane rental department, which the district court found was \u201cthe heart of Sunbelt\u2019s business\u201d and necessary to Sunbelt\u2019s business operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1268, 1271. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>his primary duties related to servicing or running Sunbelt\u2019s general business operations, the district court concluded that Rock\u2019s work qualified him for the second prong of the administrative exemption from overtime pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Rock maintains that his position was more akin to sales and retail, and is therefore outside the scope of the second prong. He relies on recent Department of Labor guidance clarifying whether an employee\u2019s job duties relate primarily to production or administration for purposes of the second prong of the administrative exemption test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to this new guidance, the essence of the second prong\u2019s focus on \u201cgeneral business operations\u201d is to separate production from administration. <em>See </em>Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Administratoi\u2019\u2019s Interpretation No.2010-1, at 3 (Mar. 24, 2010), <em>available at </em>http://www.dol.gov/whd/opinion/ admi-nIntrprtn/FLSA/2010/FLSAAI2010_l.pdf. Production work relates to the goods and services that the business contributes to the marketplace, whereas administration relates to running the business. <em>Id. </em>Certain inside salespeople might be considered production personnel, rather than administrative personnel, if the primary purpose of the business is to sell products. <em>Id. </em>at 3. 6. Rock says his role in crane rental is akin to selling products and thus beyond the scope of the administrative exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">While Rock did engage in the kind of \u201csales\u201d described in the Department of Labor\u2019s recent guidance, the district court found that his primary duties went beyond mere sales. Given \u201cthe amount of time Mr. Rock spent on ... managerial duties, it is determined that Mr. Rock\u2019s primary duty ... was the \u2018management\u2019 of Sunbelt\u2019s crane rental division.\u201d <em>Rock, 678 </em>F.Supp.2d at 1269. The district court\u2019s finding is consistent with our decision in <em>Hogan, </em>in which we concluded that even when employees engage in sales, their duties are administrative if the majority of their time is spent advising customers, hiring and training staff, determining staff pay, and delegating matters to staff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hogan, </em>361 F.3d at 627. For these reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the district court properly concluded that Rock met the second prong of the administrative exemption test.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The third prong of the administrative exemption test looks to whether the employee\u2019s primary duties involve \u201cthe exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(a)(3). Courts must determine whether the employee\u2019s job \u201cinvolves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.202(a). The ultimate question is whether the employee has the ability \u201cto make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.202(c). Although there is no requirement that the employee operate free from oversight, <em>see id., </em>the employee\u2019s duties must involve \u201cmore than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.202(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The Department of Labor\u2019s Field Operations Handbook offers guidance as to whether dispatchers exercise sufficient discretion such that the administrative exemption should apply. <em>See </em>Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Field Operations Handbook \u00a7 22d04 (1994). Dispatchers, such as those in the bus and trucking industry, who merely \u201capply their knowledge in following prescribed procedures and techniques [do] not exereis[e] discretion and independent judgment within the meaning\u201d of the regulation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22d04(a). However, a dispatcher may exercise discretion and independent judgment where, for example, the dispatcher coordinates the movement of company vehicles and equipment over non-standard routes or handles emergency situations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 22d04(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The district court determined that Rock exercised discretion and independent judgment, finding that he was \u201cresponsible for directing and overseeing all operators, truck drivers, riggers, oilers, and erection crews.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>678 F.Supp.2d at 1272. The court further found that he exercised discretion \u201cas to which customers\u2019 jobs each employee should be assigned and what equipment is required to perform the job properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that he exercised independent judgment in deciding \u201cwhich employees to send, and where to send them, based on the employees\u2019 experience and reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also found that Rock had to exercise independent judgment in the event of an emergency as he was \u201cthe first line of communication\u201d and had to determine how best \u201cto resolve the conflict and ensure that the customer\u2019s needs were being met despite such emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rock, in the district court\u2019s view, required neither input nor approval when making these decisions. <em>Id. </em>The district court further found that Rock had supervisory authority to hire and fire employees, even though he never exercised that authority. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the district court was persuaded that maintaining the schedule required a level of skill that went beyond \u2018\u201capplying well-established techniques, procedures, or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">To be sure, evidence exists that Rock\u2019s position did not require the exercise of judgment or discretion. Rock testified that he only priced certain types of cranes based on his own experience and the information in the load charts and that the vast majority of his tasks simply involved the mechanical application of data from load charts. This testimony was corroborated by his former supervisor, who testified that the job is very simple once the dispatcher understands how to use the load <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>charts. For about seven out of the company\u2019s fifty cranes, Rock could quote a price to the customer; for all others, he had to hand the project off to a salesman. Rock testified that he never resolved customer complaints, but rather simply forwarded any complaints and problems to his supervisor. There is further evidence, substantiated by his former supervisor, that Rock had little to no role in hiring, firing, promoting, or disciplining employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Still, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Rock exercised substantial control over the day-to-day operation of Sunbelt\u2019s crane rental business. Patrick Gunn, a crane rental company dispatcher, testified that dispatchers ensure that crews get to where they are going with the right equipment. Dispatchers are in a superior position to crane operators and crane operators report to dispatchers. Dispatchers find work to keep the crew busy if they are not out on a job. Dispatchers, according to Mr. Gunn, have wide authority to resolve problems related to accidents and breakdowns, to hire and fire employees, and to set pay. Mr. Gunn also testified that load charts do not indicate every factor that must be considered in selecting a crane, so a dispatcher must consider factors such as ground conditions, curbing, and other physical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Although reasonable minds could differ about the degree of discretion Rock exercised as a dispatcher, sufficient evidence exists in the record to support the district court\u2019s finding that Rock exercised discretion and independent judgment. District courts are in a better position to judge the credibility of witnesses, and they have more experience in making factual determinations. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). And where two plausible views of the evidence exist, we will defer to the district court unless clear error is apparent. <em>See Gibraltar Monetary Corp., </em>575 F.3d at 1186. There is no clear error here, and in view of factual findings made by the district court, it properly concluded that Rock satisfied the third prong of the administrative exemption test. Based on this record, the district court correctly concluded that Rock is not entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Rock also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of liquidated damages. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Rock is not entitled to overtime pay, he suffered no actual damages, and as such is not entitled to liquidated damages. <em>See Rodriguez v. Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1259, 1272 (11th Cir.2008) (the FLSA authorizes an award liquidated damages that are equal in amount to actual damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">. Although Sunbelt was acquired by Ray Anthony International, LLC in July 2007, it continued to operate under the Sunbelt name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. We recognize that certain of these factual findings were made in discussing whether a different exemption to the FLSA's overtime requirements applied. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s opinion makes clear that it considered the whole of Rock's duties in concluding that the second prong of the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ministrative exemption test was satisfied. <em>See Rock, </em>678 F.Supp.2d at 1271 (explaining that \u201cMr. Rock\u2019s maintenance of the schedule and Mr, Rock's other responsibilities combined were necessary and of the type that every crane rental business must undertake in order to operate\u201d and concluding that \u201c[Sunbelt] has clearly established that [Rock's] primary duties were directly related to the servicing or running of Sunbelt's business operations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">.The district court also found that Rock knew when he accepted his promotion to dispatcher that he would be receiving a salary, that he would no longer be eligible for overtime benefits, that he believed $55,000 was fair compensation for the work he would be doing and that he did not try to negotiate a higher salary or better hours. <em>See Rock, </em>678 F.Supp.2d at 1266. We agree with Rock that none of this is relevant. As Rock correctly points out, FLSA rights cannot be waived. <em>See Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>450 U.S. 728, 740, 101 S.Ct. 1437, 1444-45, 67 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">. Although the guidance specifically addresses mortgage loan officers, the agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulation is nonetheless helpful to our review. This guidance is not binding law, but courts owe some deference to administrative guidance document where it is consistent with the agency\u2019s statutory mandate. <em>See Warshauer v. Solis, </em>577 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2009) (\"an agency\u2019s interpretive guidance construing a statute is entitled to deference \u2019proportional to its power to persuade' \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 235, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 2176, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b902-11\">. The guidance document Rock relies upon was issued after the district court's decision and therefore was not addressed by the court below. Nevertheless, it is clear the district court found Rock to be primarily a manager with duties that far exceeded those of a mere inside salesperson. Even if this Court were to agree with Rock that his primary duties were more akin to sales than to management, that is a factual determination and the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
