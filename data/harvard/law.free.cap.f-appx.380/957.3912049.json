This case began fifteen years ago when Paul sued William Morrow, CBS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>and Simon &amp; Schuster under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1330. Paul alleged that the late author Alex Haley copied from her unpublished autobiographical manuscript <em>The Bold Truth, </em>and that the defendants infringed on her copyright when they produced the book, television miniseries, and audiocassette tape versions of <em>Alex Haley\u2019s Queen. </em>In granting summary judgment for the defendants, the district court found that Paul failed to establish direct copying from her work, access to her work by Haley, or substantial similarity between the two works. <em>See Beal v. Paramount Pictures Corp., </em>20 F.3d 454, 459 (11th Cir.1994) (stating test for proof of infringement). In 1998, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and final judgment. Since then, Paul has filed ten motions seeking reconsideration or relief from the judgment. Each time, the district court dismissed her motion for lack of jurisdiction because the time limit for seeking such relief had long since expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Paul argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her most recent \u201cRule 7.16\u201d motion for reconsideration, as it had denied her three identical previous motions. Although there is no \u201cRule 7.16\u201d in either the Federal Rules or the district court\u2019s local rules, Paul\u2019s motion sought relief from judgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She presented what she claimed was new evidence showing that Haley did in fact have access to her unpublished manuscript.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration or a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Equity Investment Partners, LP v. Lenz, </em>594 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 842 (11th Cir.2008). Although <em>\u201cpro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed,\u201d this obligation \u201cis not the equivalent of a duty to re-write [a complaint] for [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">At the time, the Federal Rules required a motion for reconsideration to be filed within ten days of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That deadline expired thirteen years ago. When a motion for reconsideration is filed outside this time limit, it \u201cis cognizable only as a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1178 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). Under Rule 60(b), the district court may vacate a final judgment based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)\u201d \u2014 i.e., within ten days following the entry of judgment \u2014 if the plaintiff files the motion within one year after the entry of the challenged judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), (c)(1); <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(b). That deadline passed twelve years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Rule 60(b) also contains a catchall provision allowing a motion to be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d after the challenged judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Id. at 60(b)(6). However, a party may not use Rule 60(b) as a substitute <em>for </em>a timely and <em>proper </em>appeal, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>does not \u201cbring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 919 (11th Cir.1996). Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). It may not be used to grant relief for one of the reasons specified in the other clauses of Rule 60(b). <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 n. 3 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">No exceptional circumstances are present here. Paul does not show that the \u201cnew\u201d evidence she offers was unavailable to her back in 1997, when she failed to respond to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We note that even if she had presented her evidence back then, it would not have changed the outcome. In the absence of direct evidence of copying, Paul needed to show not only that Haley had access to her manuscript, but also that his work was substantially similar to hers. <em>See Beal, </em>20 F.3d at 459. After an exhaustive side-by-side comparison, the district court found no substantial similarity of protected expression between <em>The Bold Truth </em>and <em>Alex Haley\u2019s Queen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under \u201cRule 7.16\u201d because no such rule exists. Even construing Paul\u2019s brief liberally, the court also lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b)(2) because she did not file her motion within the applicable time limits. Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Paul\u2019s motion under Rule 60(b)(6), because she did not file it within a reasonable time after the challenged judgment and she did not identify extraordinary circumstances that would justify relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-6\">. Paul also seeks relief on the ground of a \"change of law,\u201d but she never identifies any change in the law controlling her claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b982-12\">. In 2009, an amendment to Rule 59 extended its time limits to 28 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
