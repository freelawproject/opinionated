Osborne appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>motion for summary judgment as to his complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006). The district court dismissed Part 2 of his complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The district court granted summary judgment as to Part 1 of his complaint on the basis of res judicata because the Superior Court of Cobb County had previously issued a judgment in Osborne\u2019s materially identical state action. Osborne argues that the district court\u2019s decision violated his constitutional rights and must be reversed because the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order granting summary judgment because the order in his state court proceeding was not yet final.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\u201cBarring a claim on the basis of res judicata is a determination of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Kizzire v. Baptist Health Sys., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). When we are \u201casked to give <em>res judicata </em>effect to a state court judgment, we must apply the <em>res judicata </em>principles of the law of the state whose decision is set up as a bar to further litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Under Georgia law, \u201c[t]he doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>prevents the re-litigation of all claims which have already been adjudicated ... between identical parties or their privies in identical causes of action.\u201d <em>Waldroup v. Greene County Hosp. Auth., </em>265 Ga. 864, 463 S.E.2d 5, 6 (1995). Res judi-cata applies when a claim involves (1) the same the cause of action, (2) the same parties or their privies, and (3) a previous adjudication on the merits by a court of competent. <em>Id. </em>at 7; Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-12-40 (2006). It is, however \u201cthe general rule that a judgment sought to be used as a basis for the application of the doctrine of res judicata must be a final judgment. In Georgia a judgment is suspended when an appeal is entered within the time allowed. And the judgment is not final as long as there is a right to appellate review.\u201d <em>Greene v. Transp. Ins. Co., </em>169 Ga.App. 504, 313 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1984) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Part 2 of Osborne\u2019s complaint because he abandoned the issue on appeal by not addressing it in his initial brief. <em>See Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived). The district court erred, however, in granting the City of Marietta\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Part 1 of Osborne\u2019s complaint on res judicata grounds because the judgment by the Cobb County Superior Court in Osborne\u2019s state action was not yet final under Georgia law. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand this case to the district court. We suggest that the district court stay the proceedings until Osborne\u2019s state suit is final under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
