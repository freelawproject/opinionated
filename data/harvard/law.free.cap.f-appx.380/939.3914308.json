We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">First, Young argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his third amended complaint as a sanction for failing fully to disclose his prior lawsuits on the complaint form the court\u2019s clerk provided him. He contends that it was error for the court to grant his motion to proceed IFP then to dismiss his case because the complaint was \u201cinartfully pled.\u201d He contends that he made a good faith effort to disclose his prior lawsuits but that he was hindered because (1) he could not afford to pay the copying and certification costs charged by the Florida state courts and (2) he no longer had the documents necessary to answer fully because of a Florida Department of Corrections rule prohibiting the possession of \u201cexcess legal material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions under its inherent power for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Sunshine Jr. Stores, Inc., </em>456 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). Federal courts have the inherent power to impose sanctions on parties, but the court must make a finding of bad faith on the part of the litigant before imposing such sanctions. <em>Id. </em>A party engages in bad faith by \u201cdelaying or disrupting the litigation or hampering enforcement of a court order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-15\">We also review for abuse of discretion sanctions imposed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 612 (11th Cir.1997). A dismissal with prejudice under \u00a7 1915 is an \u201cextreme sanction\u201d to be exercised only in appropriate cases. <em>Camp v. Oliver, </em>798 F.2d 434, 438 (11th Cir.1986). However, \u201cwhile dismissal of an action with prejudice is a sanction of last resort, it is appropriate in cases involving bad faith.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Lennon, </em>797 F.2d 934, 935 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(per curiam). </em>However, a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number><em>pro se </em>status in civil litigation generally will not excuse mistakes he makes regarding procedural rules. <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (stating that the Court had \u201cnever suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it sanctioned Young for failing to disclose his prior cases. The hindrances he identified did not absolve him of the requirement of disclosing, at a minimum, all of the information that was known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Second, Young argues that the district court abused its discretion by not giving him an opportunity to amend or supplement his complaint to disclose his other prior lawsuits. He asserts, based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, that the district court should have specifically ordered him to cure the defect in his complaint, and he concedes that if he did not cure \u201cafter being ordered then no abuse of discretion would have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to amend a complaint. <em>Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, </em>477 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2007). Rule 15 allows a party to amend its pleadings \u201conce as a matter of course.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). However, the party must then obtain either the adverse party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave in order to file further amendments. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). The court\u2019s leave shall be freely given \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Valid reasons for denying a motion to amend include \u201cbad faith ... on the part of the movant, [and] repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Young to file a fourth amended complaint after he failed to provide full disclosure in any of his prior complaints. The district court was not obliged to expend more of its resources in curing the very same type of defect that it had pointed out before, especially given that it had provided him with a suitable warning concerning the consequences of his failure to cure that defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Finally, Young argues that the district court denied him procedural due process by imposing dismissal as a sanction without providing him with notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Courts must afford a sanctioned party due process, both in determining the bad faith required to invoke the court\u2019s inherent power to impose sanctions and in assessing fees. <em>In re Mroz, </em>65 F.3d 1567, 1575 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). Due process in this context requires only that the sanctionee have fan notice of the possible imposition of sanctions and an opportunity to respond orally or in writing. <em>Donaldson v. Clark, </em>819 F.2d 1551, 1559-60 (11th Cir.1987) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">The district court did not deny Young procedural due process because it had warned him on several occasions that failure to follow the court\u2019s orders could result in dismissal, he had the opportunity to respond to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation by filing objections, and he has not pointed to anything in the record showing that he was treated unfairly in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-12\">.
