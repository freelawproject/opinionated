Gantea challenges the ruling on two grounds. First, Gantea argues that the administrative law judge failed to consider Gantea\u2019s complaints about the side effects of his medications. Second, Gantea argues that the administrative law judge submitted an incomplete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>hypothetical question to the vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden rests with the claimant to prove that he is disabled and entitled to Social Security benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The record establishes that the administrative law judge considered Gantea\u2019s complaints about the side effects of his prescription drugs and determined that those side effects did not cause Gantea significant problems. Gantea testified that he suffered from \u201call kinds of side effects\u201d from prescription medications, including headaches, dizziness, lack of sleep, and problems with his vision, heart, and liver, but the administrative law judge found that Gantea\u2019s complaints were \u201cnot fully credible.\u201d The administrative law judge was entitled to discredit Gantea\u2019s complaints because neither of the physicians who prescribed Gantea\u2019s medications stated that side effects limited Gantea\u2019s ability to work. <em>See Swindle v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 222, 226 (11th Cir.1990); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(4) (evaluating symptoms based on \u201cany inconsistencies in the evidence and the extent to which there are any conflicts between [the] statements [of the claimant] and the rest of the evidence\u201d). Dr. Marc Gerber, who prescribed Etodolac and Cyclobenzaprine for Gantea\u2019s back pain, did not report any side effects caused by those medicines. Dr. Bhaskar Raju, who prescribed Wellbutrin, Lorazepam, Temazepam, and Lexapro for Gantea\u2019s depression, reported a \u201closs of sexual interest\u201d as Gantea\u2019s only side effect. Dr. Zaponti recorded some symptoms reported by Gantea, but the doctor did not attribute the symptoms to Gantea\u2019s medications. The administrative law judge was not required to inquire further about Gantea\u2019s alleged side effects. <em>See Cherry v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1186, 1191 n. 7 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Gantea argues that the administrative law judge posed an incomplete hypothetical question to the vocational expert that omitted that Gantea had moderate difficulty with concentration, persistence, and pace, but we disagree. Gantea suffered moderate limitations in his concentration, persistence, and pace, but Dr. Amn Adams and Dr. Bruce Hertz reported that those impairments were not severe enough to constitute a functional limitation. Because Gantea\u2019s limitations did not meet or equal a listed impairment, the administrative law judge had to determine only whether Gan-tea could perform other work based on his residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii)-(v), 404.1520a(d)(3). The hypothetical question included all the impairments related to Gantea\u2019s residual functional capacity, and the answer of the vocational expert provided substantial evidence to support the finding that Gantea could perform the requirements of a table worker or assembly worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The denial of Gantea\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
