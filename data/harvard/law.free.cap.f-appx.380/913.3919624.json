Under a <em>de novo </em>review, the district court found that Salim had failed to meet his burden of showing that he met the good moral character requirement for naturalization. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(g); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">By administrative order, the USCIS initially denied Salim\u2019s application for naturalization for lack of good moral character based upon his conviction for selling alcohol to a minor. For this offense, Salim received a suspended sentence and twelve months\u2019 unsupervised probation. This conviction occurred within five years immediately preceding the date of filing the application for naturalization. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The district court agreed, finding that Salim did not submit any evidence of extenuating circumstances for his unlawful acts. It granted USCIS\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case, the briefs and the arguments of counsel. Finding no error, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
