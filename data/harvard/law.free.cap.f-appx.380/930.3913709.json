On appeal, Boykins raises several issues: (1) whether the government adduced sufficient evidence supporting his convictions, (2) whether the admission of a tape recorded statement with a confidential informant violated his right to confront the witnesses against him secured under the Sixth Amendment, (3) whether the district court erred by including a two-level increase in his Guidelines calculation for the possession of a firearm by a coconspirator, and (4) whether the district court erred by denying his request for a two-level reduction in his Guidelines calculation for a mi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>nor role. After review, we discern no error and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Boykins argues that the government did not prove that he knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily joined the conspiracy. He claims that the evidence showed that he was stranded at a Motel 6 without transportation where he allegedly counted drug money and made a trip to Louisiana with another party, Jenkins, allegedly to deliver drug money, but that he removed himself from that situation once he had access to his vehicle. Boykins also claims that he neither recruited the confidential informant to join the conspiracy over the phone nor did he sell any cocaine telephonieally.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the government and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A conviction must be affirmed unless under no reasonable construction of the evidence could the jury have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>Credibility determinations are for the factfinder to make, and we typically will not review such determinations. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">In order to secure a conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the appellant knew of the essential objectives of the conspiracy; and (3) the appellant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1326 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cWhether the [defendant] knowingly volunteered to join the conspiracy may be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence, including inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circumstantial evidence of a scheme.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>405 F.3d at 1270 (internal quotation marks omitted). The elements of possession with intent to distribute cocaine are: (1) knowing or intentional possession; (2) with intent to distribute or dispense; (3) cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Finally, to support a conviction for unlawful use of a communication facility under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), the government must prove that the defendant knowingly and intentionally used a communications facility, such as a telephone, to facilitate the commission of a narcotics offense. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1562 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government, supports Boykins\u2019 convictions. The record supports the conclusion that a large conspiracy existed and that the purpose of that conspiracy was to possess and distribute cocaine. The record also supports the conclusion that Boykins knowingly and voluntarily counted the proceeds from the sale of cocaine, that he knew the proceeds were from the sale of cocaine distributed by other members of the conspiracy, that he was present when the source of the cocaine collected some of the proceeds, and that he knowingly and voluntarily traveled to Louisiana with another member of the conspiracy to deliver further proceeds to the conspiracy\u2019s source of cocaine. Accordingly, the record contains sufficient evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The evidence also supports the conclusion that Boykins knowingly and intentionally used a telephone to facilitate the distribution of cocaine. The record shows that Boykins engaged in multiple phone calls with a confidential informant during which he discussed the price and availability of cocaine and offered to facilitate a connection between the confidential informant and an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>other member of the conspiracy for access to cocaine. Accordingly, the record contains sufficient evidence to support his conviction for unlawful use of a communications facility in committing a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">II. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Boykins argues that because the audio recordings of his alleged conversations with the confidential informant were not authenticated at trial by the confidential informant or any person physically present with him during the time of the conversations, they were inadmissible testimonial hearsay. He argues further that because the recordings were inadmissible hearsay, admission of the recordings violated right his to confront his accuser secured to him under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">We review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo </em>and determinations of the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2006). When a defendant fails to object to an alleged violation of the Confrontation Clause at trial, we review the alleged violation only for plain error. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1141 (11th Cir.1997). Simply raising a hearsay objection at trial is insufficient to \u201cpreserve a constitutional challenge under the Confrontation Clause for appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1291 n. 8 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). To establish plain error, the defendant must demonstrate that: (1) there was an error in the lower court\u2019s action; (2) such error was plain, clear, and obvious; and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Foree, </em>43 F.3d 1572, 1578 (11th Cir.1995). Even if these three elements are present, we will not reverse unless the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Notwithstanding several exceptions and exclusions, the Federal Rules of Evidence bar hearsay, which is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declar-ant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. Statements offered against a party which are the party\u2019s own statements, however, are not hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). Additionally, a confidential informant\u2019s recorded statements offered, as in the instant case, to give context to a defendant\u2019s statements are not hearsay because they are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Price, </em>792 F.2d 994, 996-97 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause protects the accused\u2019s right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Confrontation Clause, however, does not affect the admission of all out-of-court statements. Instead, the focus is on whether the statement is testimonial in nature. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Although the Supreme Court has not precisely defined the contours of testimonial statements, we do know that the core inquiry includes whether the hearsay statement \u201c[was] made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have previously held that where the challenged evidence was a recorded statement between a confidential informant and a co-conspirator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>regarding the purchase of cocaine, the evidence was not testimonial. <em>Underwood, </em>446 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In this case, the district court did not err in admitting the recorded conversations because they were neither hearsay nor barred by the Confrontation Clause. Boykins\u2019 statements on the tape are not hearsay because they are his own admissions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). The confidential informant\u2019s statements are not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the informant\u2019s statements were testimonial, the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of those statements because, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Crawford, </em>\u201c[t]he Clause ... does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9. Finally, the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of Boykins\u2019 statements because they were neither hearsay nor testimonial. A party\u2019s own out of court admissions are not hearsay, and, as in <em>Underwood, </em>Boykins clearly did not make his statements under circumstances which would lead him to believe they would later be used at trial against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">III. Firearm Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Boykins argues that the district court should not have enhanced his sentence due to the presence of a firearm because he did not possess a firearm, and there was no testimony regarding a firearm or the possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator at his trial. Boykins points out that the only evidence of a firearm was the Drug Enforcement Administration agent\u2019s testimony during sentencing regarding co-conspirators\u2019 proffers to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact [for a firearm enhancement] under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.1999). A firearm enhancement may be applied to a defendant if the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c(1) the possessor of the firearm was a co-conspirator, (2) the possession was in furtherance of the conspiracy, (3) the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of possession, and (4) the co-conspirator possession was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201c[t]he adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense,\u201d and \u201c[o]nce the government shows that a firearm was present, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">In <em>Pham, </em>we recognized that (1) there is an \u201coverpowering connection between the use of firearms and narcotics traffic,\u201d (2) \u201cit [is] reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a firearm where the conspiracy involved trafficking in lucrative and illegal drugs,\u201d and (3) firearm enhancements can be appropriate even if the defendant claims that he was unaware of the firearm. <em>See id. </em>at 1246. Furthermore, we specifically noted that in that case the district court did not err in applying the weapons enhancement where the vastness of the conspiracy and the large amount of drugs and money made it reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that a firearm would be possessed by a co-conspirator. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Here, the district court found that various co-conspirators possessed firearms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>that they did so in furtherance of the conspiracy, that Boykins was a member of the conspiracy at the time the co-conspirators possessed firearms, and that possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator was reasonably foreseeable given the type of drug conspiracy and amount of money at hand. The record supports those conclusions. At sentencing, the DEA agent testified to proffers made by various eo-con-spirators to the effect that they possessed firearms throughout and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Given the size and scope of the conspiracy, it was reasonable to conclude, as in <em>Pham, </em>that the possession of firearms by co-conspirators was reasonably foreseeable to Boykins. Moreover, Boykins has not proven that the connection between the firearms and cocaine conspiracy is clearly improbable. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the firearm enhancement to Boykins\u2019 Guidelines calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">IV. Minor Role</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Boykins argues that he was entitled to a minor role reduction in his sentence because (1) he never had contact with any of the cocaine in the alleged conspiracy; (2) all he did was count money, take a trip, and speak on the phone to the confidential informant; and (3) his actions took place during a four or five day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment under the Guidelines only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The defendant bears the burden at all times of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive detenni-nation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946. It is not necessary for the court to make specific findings of fact, so long as its \u201cdecision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any disputed factual issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">A defendant may receive an adjustment for his mitigating role in the offense if he \u201cplays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). A two-level, minor role reduction under \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\"><em>De Varon </em>sets forth a two-part analysis of a defendant\u2019s conduct to determine whether the defendant warrants a minor role reduction. 175 F.3d at 940-45. First, the court \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. The first prong of <em>De Varon </em>is often dispositive of the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 945. Second, the district court may compare \u201cthe defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. To apply the adjustment under this prong, the district court must find that \u201cthe defendant was less culpable than most other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (emphasis omitted). Even if a defendant\u2019s role is \u201cless than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct,\u201d he might not be entitled to an adjustment because, in some cases, there are no minor or minimal participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Boykins was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>to a minor role reduction. Boykins was held responsible for a conspiracy to distribute less than <em>five </em>kilograms of cocaine. Thus, the conduct he was held accountable for was identical to his actual conduct. In relation to the second <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>inquiry, Boykins attempts to minimize the scope of his own actions; however, he never suggests another participant against which to measure his culpability in the relevant conduct. Even if Boykins had advanced an argument along this line, we conclude that because Boykins participated in the counting and conveyance of the substantial proceeds from the sale of the cocaine in question to the cocaine source, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Boykins was a substantial participant. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Boykins a two-level deduction for a minor role.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-8\">. We note that the district court instructed the jury that the confidential informant's statements were not to be considered for the truth of the statements, but only to provide context to Boykins\u2019 statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-14\">.
