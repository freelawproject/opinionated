His petition challenged his 2003 conviction for simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling, for which he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) as to whether the district court reversibly erred by sua sponte applying the one-year limitation period in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) after the respondent conceded in its answer that the \u00a7 2254 petition was timely and provided reasons for reaching that conclusion. Because we may only review the issue on which the COA was granted, we do not consider the other arguments in Encardes\u2019s briefs. <em>See United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 339 n. 1 (5th Cir.2002). We grant Encardes\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out of time, but we deny his motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502-03 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-20\">The respondent\u2019s concession of the timeliness of Encardes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was erroneous. In calculating the \u00a7 2254 petition\u2019s due date, the respondent treated the one-year limitation period as having begun when the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Encardes\u2019s application for a supervisory writ on direct review. In fact, the one-year limitation period began to run when Encardes missed an August 19, 2005 extended deadline for filing the state writ application. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Butler v. Cain, </em>533 F.3d 314, 316-20 (5th Cir.2008). Because he did not seek state postconviction relief, his \u00a7 2254 petition was due one year later on Monday, August 21, 2006, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2244(d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)(1)(C), but he did not mail it until November 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-21\">Because the respondent mistakenly calculated the due date for Encardes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, \u201cthe federal court confronted no intelligent waiver on the [repondentjs part, only an evident miscalculation of the elapsed time under a statute designed to impose a tight time constraint on federal habeas petitioners,\u201d and \u201cthe federal court had discretion to correct the [respondent]^ error and, accordingly, to dismiss the petition as untimely.\u201d <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 202, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>accorded the parties fair notice and opportunity to present their positions. <em>See id. </em>at 210,126 S.Ct. 1675. \u201cNo court proceedings or action occurred\u201d in the five months between the time that the respondent answered the petition and the time that the court raised the timeliness issue, and \u201cnothing in the record suggests that the [respondent] \u2018strategically' withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">MOTION to file reply brief out of time GRANTED; MOTION for appointment of counsel DENIED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
