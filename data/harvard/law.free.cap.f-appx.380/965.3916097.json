On appeal, McWhorter challenges the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>his motion to reopen a suppression hearing. He also appeals an obstruction of justice enhancement to his sentence. After careful review, we AFFIRM his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">McWhorter filed a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence found during a search of his automobile. At the suppression hearing in April 2008, Corporal Anthony Kestle of the Montgomery Police Department testified that he responded to a call from Katorie Stinson (\u201cStinson\u201d) on 2 May 2007. Stinson said a black male named Jeremy McWhorter, whom she had been dating, had just threatened to shoot and kill her if she told anybody he was involved in a shooting that occurred the day before. Stinson described McWhorter\u2019s physical appearance and his vehicle. Stinson also said McWhorter probably had several assault rifles in his car. While Corporal Kestle and Stinson were talking, McWhorter drove by in his car and Stin-son pointed him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Corporal Kestle followed and stopped McWhorter\u2019s vehicle. The driver identified himself as Jeremy McWhorter. Corporal Kestle instructed McWhorter and a male passenger to exit the vehicle. Corporal Kestle then conducted a pat-down search of McWhorter. At that point, Officer M.D. Green arrived to assist. Corporal Kestle obtained McWhorter\u2019s consent to do a \u201cwingspan search of the vehicle, any area that was accessible to the driver.\u201d Doc. 22 at 13. The purpose of the search was to retrieve any weapons or contraband that would endanger the officers\u2019 safety. When Officer Green looked inside the vehicle, he smelled a \u201cvery strong\u201d odor of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 13. A red backpack found on the rear seat directly behind the driver\u2019s seat contained several marijuana seeds, plastic sandwich bags, and two-way radios. Corporal Kestle likewise smelled marijuana when he placed his head inside the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">McWhorter refused to consent to a search of his trunk, stating that it was unnecessary because \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anything back there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Corporal Kestle then requested a canine unit. During a perimeter search of the vehicle\u2019s exterior, a drug-sniffing dog scratched on the driver\u2019s side door and on the trunk, alerting the police to the presence of narcotics. An officer found marijuana inside the vehicle on the driver\u2019s side by the fuse box. Upon opening the trunk, officers discovered three assault rifles and a blue backpack. The dog immediately began hitting at the backpack. An officer opened the backpack and found approximately one pound of what appeared to be marijuana. On cross-examination, Corporal Kestle stated that his video camera had not been working for the past month, and neither his audio or video equipment was operational that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Based on the evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that McWhorter\u2019s motion to suppress be denied. The judge first found that Corporal Kestle had probable cause to stop and search the vehicle based on the credible information provided by Stinson. Alternatively, even absent probable cause, the judge found that the brief, investigative stop was justified under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The wingspan search was justified by McWhorter\u2019s consent. The officers had probable cause to search the rest of the vehicle, including the trunk, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>the smell of marijuana, the drug paraphernalia in the red backpack, and the canine search. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">McWhorter subsequently filed a Motion to Dismiss Indictment or in the Alternative to Exclude Evidence (\u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d). He contended that new evidence refuted Corporal Kestle\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing that his patrol car\u2019s audiovisual equipment had not been working. A hearing was held on the motion in July 2008. A communications technician testified that he repaired Corporal Kestle\u2019s audiovisual system and it was functioning properly as of 25 April 2007. Nevertheless, the system \u201cvery easily\u201d could have failed on the road if problems with the vehicle\u2019s alternator or battery occurred. Doc. 59 at 59. The technician further explained that only sergeants or higher-ranked officers have a key to open the vault containing the videotape inside a patrol car. There is no way an officer can destroy a tape without opening the vault. Nor can an officer rewind a tape and record over previously recorded material. An officer may manually turn off the audio and visual recording equipment so that it does not record, however. Records indicated that Corporal Kestle picked up a lapel microphone for his transmitter pack from the repair shop on 2 May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Corporal Kestle also testified at the July 2008 hearing. He stated that his rank was that of police officer on 2 May 2007 and he had never been a sergeant or higher rank. On 2 May 2007, he was driving his assigned patrol car, the same one that had been in the repair shop in April. He acknowledged that it is standard procedure to turn on the audiovisual equipment when an officer gets in his patrol car, and that he had assumed his camera was working properly when he stopped McWhorter on 2 May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Following the hearing, the district court denied McWhorter\u2019s motion to dismiss but granted his oral motion to continue the trial date. Additionally, the court granted McWhorter permission to file a motion to reopen the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">McWhorter subsequently filed a Motion to Reopen Suppression Hearing and supporting memorandum. He asserted that another hearing was warranted so he could present evidence that Corporal Kestle had materially misrepresented the status of his audiovisual equipment during the suppression hearing. The district court denied McWhorter\u2019s motion to reopen the suppression hearing \u201cbased upon representations from counsel to the court that the defendant has not discovered any new or additional evidence which would warrant the court granting said motion.\u201d Doc. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">A jury convicted McWhorter of both counts following a trial in May 2009, at which McWhorter testified in his own defense. At the sentencing hearing, McWhorter objected to the recommendation in the pre-sentence investigation report of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court overruled the objection and found that the enhancement applied based on McWhorter\u2019s perjury at trial. The court sentenced McWhorter within the guidelines range to 13 months imprisonment on count one and 60 months imprisonment on count two, to be served consecutively, and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">A. <em>Motion to Reopen the Suppression Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">McWhorter first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>to reopen the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose for reopening the hearing, according to McWhorter, was to test Corporal Kestle\u2019s credibility concerning his audiovisual equipment. McWhorter asserts that Corporal Kestle\u2019s credibility was critical to the district court\u2019s determination that McWhorter consented to the wingspan search. Additionally, McWhorter suggests it is possible Corporal Kestle destroyed or failed to preserve a recording, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider a suppression hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). As noted, the district court denied the motion to reopen based on representations from counsel that McWhorter had no \u201cnew or additional evidence which would warrant the court granting said motion.\u201d Doc. 79. This finding is supported by the record. McWhorter made the same arguments in his motion to reopen that he made in his motion to dismiss. Both motions contended that Corporal Kestle\u2019s credibility had been compromised by evidence that his audiovisual equipment was functional on 2 May 2007. Additionally, both motions argued that Corporal Kestle may have committed a <em>Brady </em>violation. The evidence pertaining to these arguments was presented at the July 2008 hearing on the motion to dismiss. Corporal Kestle testified at this hearing and was subject to cross-examination. Thus, McWhorter already had the opportunity to present evidence related to Corporal Kestle\u2019s audiovisual equipment, and the district court already had the opportunity to assess Corporal Kestle\u2019s credibility on this issue and determine if a <em>Brady </em>violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Furthermore, the motion to reopen did not identify any additional evidence which would have made another hearing necessary. For example, the motion to reopen cited video equipment guidelines of the Montgomery City Police Department, which stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that all traffic stops should be recorded. However, Corporal Kestle previously testified at the July 2008 hearing that it is standard procedure for an officer to turn on the audiovisual equipment when the officer gets into his vehicle, and he assumed his camera was working properly on the day in question. The motion to reopen also contended that maintenance logs for Corporal Kes-tle\u2019s patrol vehicle revealed \u201cno records of an electrical system malfunction contemporaneous to the stop of May 2, 2007.\u201d Doc. 66 at 4. Such evidence would have been duplicative of the repair technician\u2019s testimony at the July 2008 hearing that Corporal Kestle\u2019s vehicle had no visible problems with its electrical system. Finally, the motion to reopen referred to an August 2008 interoffice police department memorandum advising that no videotapes had been located for Corporal Kestle\u2019s patrol vehicle during the time frame of the traffic stop on McWhorter\u2019s car. Given that there was no videotape to introduce into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>evidence, this memorandum further supports the district court\u2019s determination that there was no new or additional evidence which warranted reopening the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Contrary to McWhorter\u2019s argument, <em>Simms </em>does not support a conclusion that McWhorter\u2019s motion to reopen should have been granted. In <em>Simms, </em>the district court denied a motion to reopen a suppression hearing because it \u201cfound that the officers had not made any inconsistent statements at the suppression hearing.\u201d 385 F.3d at 1356. A review of the suppression hearing transcript supported the district court\u2019s finding that no inconsistent statements had been made. <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded that the court had not abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen on this basis. <em>Id. </em>In contrast to <em>Simms, </em>the denial of the motion to reopen in McWhorter\u2019s case hinged on the district court\u2019s finding that no new or additional evidence was available which would warrant another hearing, not on the fact that no inconsistent statements had been made. As we have discussed, the district court\u2019s stated basis for denying the motion to reopen is supported by the record. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">B. <em>Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">In his second argument, McWhorter maintains the district court erroneously applied an obstruction of justice enhancement at sentencing. He contends the court\u2019s perjury finding was not supported by Katorie Stinson\u2019s testimony at trial and that his own testimony was plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the application of an obstruction of justice enhancement based on those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bradberry, </em>466 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 permits a two-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s offense level if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\u201d and \u201cthe obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2009). An enhancement is justified if a defendant commits, suborns, or attempts to suborn perjury. <em>Id., </em>comment (n.4(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">A finding of perjury requires the existence of four elements: \u201c(1) the testimony must be under oath or affirmation; (2) the testimony must be false; (3) the testimony must be material; and (4) the testimony must be given with the willful intent to provide false testimony, and not as a result of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 n. 4 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cMaterial\u201d testimony includes statements \u201cthat, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court is in the best position to \u201cassess a defendant\u2019s demeanor, apparent sincerity, intonation, expression, gesticulations, and a wide range of other considerations that are pertinent in determining whether he has perjured himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>340 F.3d 1231, 1240 (11th Cir.2003). Consequently, we give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to a district court\u2019s ruling that a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement is warranted on this basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1241; <em>see also Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763 (\u201c \u2018We ... accord great deference to a district court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court recognized that a defendant should not be punished merely because he chose to testify at trial and the jury disbelieved that testimony. The court nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>found that McWhorter\u2019s trial testimony constituted an obstruction of justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">[I]n this case, the defendant\u2019s testimony was designed to persuade the jury that he had no knowledge of any criminal conduct or activity that he had engaged in, that he was not aware of any drugs in his car, he was not aware of any guns in his car, and he even testified that the smell of marijuana could not be had from his car, when, in fact, law enforcement testified to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">I do find that in this case, Mr. McWhorter\u2019s testimony was designed to persuade jurors that he was not engaged in any criminal conduct, and his testimony, if believed at trial, would have resulted in an acquittal at trial. And it was not given merely for the purpose of explaining how incriminating evidence ended up in his car, but it was intended to deliberately convince the jury quite to the contrary, that Mr. McWhorter had no association whatsoever with the drugs and guns which both were found in his car and which a witness testified before the drugs and guns were found that he actually had them in the trunk of his car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Doc. 141 at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record. Stinson, who was McWhorter\u2019s live-in girlfriend at the time, testified at trial that McWhorter told her in April 2007 that he thought he was going to start selling marijuana. Stinson further testified that, on 2 May 2007, McWhorter had his car the whole day and she saw him put something into the trunk. Shortly thereafter, McWhorter threatened her while armed with an assault rifle. Stinson warned the police that McWhorter was known to carry rifles. Less than an hour after his confrontation with Stinson, McWhorter was seen driving his vehicle. The police found approximately 1.1 pounds of marijuana and three loaded assault rifles in the trunk, in addition to a backpack in the rear seat containing marijuana seeds and stems, two-way radios, and plastic sandwich bags commonly used to package marijuana for sale. Two police officers testified that there was a strong odor of marijuana inside the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">McWhorter specifically contradicted this evidence during his trial testimony. He denied threatening Stinson on 2 May 2007. He denied owning or carrying a gun that day. He denied knowing there was marijuana or firearms in the trunk. He denied owning the backpack found in the rear seat or even being aware of its presence until the police found it. He admitted he was familiar with the smell of marijuana but insisted \u201c[t]here was no smell of marijuana in my car.\u201d Doc. 140 at 97. McWhorter claimed he \u201cknow[s] now\u201d the firearms were placed in his vehicle by a former drug-dealing friend who borrowed the car earlier that day. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 90, 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">McWhorter\u2019s continued denial of any knowledge of the marijuana or firearms in his vehicle reflects a willful intent to give false testimony. He did not suggest that he was confused, unable to remember, or mistaken about what happened. To the contrary, he affirmed that he had \u201ctold the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. The district court found otherwise, however, and we afford great deference to the court\u2019s credibility determination as it had the opportunity to view McWhorter as he testified. <em>See Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763-64. Moreover, McWhorter\u2019s testimony was material because, if believed, it would have negated the required element of knowledge needed to sustain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam) (\u201cIn order to convict ... under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government had to prove three elements: (1) knowledge; (2) posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>sion; and (3) intent to distribute\u201d)- Similarly, McWhorter\u2019s testimony, if believed, would have negated the predicate offense for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) that the defendant was engaged in a drug trafficking crime when he possessed the firearm. <em>See id. </em>at 1392. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in enhancing McWhorter\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for committing perjury during trial. <em>See Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 764 (finding no clear error in \u00a7 3C1.1 application where district court correctly determined that defendant committed perjury during his sentencing hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McWhorter\u2019s motion to reopen the suppression hearing, and it properly applied an enhancement to McWhorter\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice. We therefore AFFIRM McWhorter\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-7\">. The Supreme Court recognized in <em>Teny </em>that \"a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d 392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-5\">. Within this argument section, McWhorter contends in a footnote that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion to suppress based on the existence of probable cause to stop and search McWhorter's vehicle. <em>See </em>Appellant's Initial Brief at 10 n.1. McWhorter also appears to suggest that the magistrate judge erred in finding that McWhorter had consented to a wingspan search of his vehicle. <em>See id. </em>at 9-10. However, he concedes in his reply brief that he is not actually challenging the denial of the motion to suppress. <em>See </em>Appellant's Reply Brief at 1. Accordingly, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that appellant abandoned his Rule 404(b) argument where he made only passing references to the issue under different topical headings).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
