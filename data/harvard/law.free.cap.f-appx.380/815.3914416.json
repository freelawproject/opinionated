She asserts that the BIA did not consider the cumulative effect of the incidents on her and her family, which included more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation. She next contends that the IJ applied an incorrect standard for finding that she did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Karekezi asserts that the BIA erred in finding that she failed to demonstrate that she was unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protections of the South African police and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, we review the BIA\u2019s order. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, we can reverse a finding of fact by the BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The U.S. Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYX\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\u201cTo establish asylum [eligibility] based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">In determining whether the applicant has suffered past persecution, the BIA must consider the cumulative impact of the alleged incidents of persecution. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007). While the INA does not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have indicated that it is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. However, if an alien has not established past persecution, she bears the burden of proving that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that: (1) the applicant fears persecution in her country on account of a protected ground; (2) there is a reasonable possibility that she will suffer such persecution if she were to return to her country; and (3) she is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country because of such fear. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i)). A \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution\u201d must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can establish a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated on account of the statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">We conclude from the record that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Karekezi did not suffer past persecution in South Africa because the telephone calls and letters that she received, along with the two visits to her mother by strange men, an incident where a man aggressively approached her outside of her home, and an incident where two strange men went to her daughter\u2019s school did not rise to the level of persecution. Contrary to Karekezi\u2019s contention, the BIA considered the cumulative effects of the facts of her case. Moreover, because we review only the BIA\u2019s decision in which it applied the proper standard for deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>mining whether Karekezi had a well-founded fear of future persecution, we will not review the Id\u2019s reasons for denying Karek-ezi\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We also conclude from the record that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Karekezi did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution because she has not received any threats, verbal or otherwise, since arriving in the United States, and she failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable possibility that she will be persecuted upon return to South Africa. Because Karekezi has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable possibility that she will be persecuted upon return to South Africa, she has failed to demonstrate that she is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protections of the pertinent authorities in South Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny Karekezi\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-12\">. Although Karekezi's sons and daughter are also named petitioners, their claims are based on derivative status. Accordingly, the petitioners will collectively be referred to as \u2018'Ka-rekezi.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-16\">. Karekezi has abandoned her claim for withholding of removal because she does not challenge the BIA's denial on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v.
