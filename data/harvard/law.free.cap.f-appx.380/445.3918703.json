Villegas pleaded guilty to being unlawfully present in this country after having been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He argues that, in light of his arguments for a sentence below the Guidelines, the district court did not give adequate reasons for imposing its sentence. He also argues that the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Villegas\u2019s sentence is reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). This court first determines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, including, among other things, not adequately explaining the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no procedural error, this court then \u201cconsid-eres] the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Villegas\u2019s arguments about .the procedural reasonableness of his sentence are unavailing. The district court listened to Villegas\u2019s arguments, adopted the PSR, and rejected Villegas\u2019s request for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008). Unlike the district court in <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 403, 412 (5th Cir.2008), on which Villegas relies, the district court in this case expressly referenced \u00a7 3553(a). Further, the district court\u2019s comments specifically addressed Villegas\u2019s argument that his inability to make a life in Mexico was a factor to consider in granting him a sentence below the Guidelines. Thus, this court is satisfied that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision making authority. See <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">Villegas\u2019s argument that the facts and circumstances of his case rebut its presumed substantive reasonableness is also unavailing given that it is essentially a request for this to court re-weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge them import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (2008). That this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Villegas\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the within-guidelines sentence does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to it. <em>See Gomez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cm.
