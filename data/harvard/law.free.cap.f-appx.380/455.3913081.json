Mancha-Perez also argues that this court should not afford his sentence a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-26\">Mancha-Perez\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). We have also rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to increase the offense level and in calculating criminal history is impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-29\">Mancha-Perez has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldanado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"An4\">. Mancha-Perez does not appeal the 36-month term of imprisonment imposed following his guilty plea to making a false claim of United States citizenship. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
