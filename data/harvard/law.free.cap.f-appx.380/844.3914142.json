On appeal, Moses argues that his 25-year statutory mandatory consecutive sentence as to Count 4, which was imposed pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i), is unreasonable and unconstitutional. He argues that Congress did not intend that \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i)\u2019s enhanced-penalty provision should apply where both of the relevant \u00a7 924(c) offenses are charged in a single indictment. In addition, Moses asserts that, because \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i)\u2019s language is ambiguous in this respect, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>rule of lenity requires that this provision should be interpreted in his favor. Moses further contends that the 25-year sentence as to Count 4 violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, although he fails to explain how his sentence offends due process. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">A federal grand jury charged Moses with the following: (1) robbery of a credit union, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (\u201cCount 1\u201d); (2) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of the crime of violence set forth in Count 1, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (\u201cCount 2\u201d); (3) robbery of a bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (\u201cCount 3\u201d); and (4) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of the crime of violence set forth in Count 3, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). The indictment specified that the offenses charged in Counts 1 and 2 occurred on August 13, 2008, and that the offenses charged in Counts 3 and 4 occurred on September 30, 2008. Moses pled guilty to all four counts of the indictment without the benefit of a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">In preparing the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer determined that the total combined offense level for Counts 1 and 3 was 25. Moses\u2019s offense level of 25, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, produced a guideline range of 120 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The probation officer noted that, under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), Moses was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum term of seven years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2. Under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i), Moses was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 4, because this constituted Moses\u2019s second, or subsequent, conviction under \u00a7 924(c). The officer further noted that \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii) required that Moses\u2019s sentences as to Counts 2 and 4 run consecutively to any other terms of imprisonment imposed. This effectively caused Moses\u2019s guideline range to be 494 to 521 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">At sentencing, the parties agreed that the PSI accurately set forth the applicable guideline range and statutory mandatory sentences. In support of his request for a downward variance for Counts 1 and 3, Moses emphasized that law enforcement officers had learned that he committed the credit union robbery only because he confessed to the crime and provided them with his full cooperation. The district court sentenced Moses to a total term of 444 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating that it had arrived at this sentence after considering the advisory guideline range, the statutory mandatory sentences, and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court specified that it sentenced Moses to concurrent terms of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts 1 and 3. The court explained that it had granted this downward variance based on Moses\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement officials and the severity of his statutory mandatory sentences. In addition, the court specified that, pursuant to the applicable statutes, it sentenced Moses to a consecutive term of seven years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2, and another consecutive term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">After pronouncing the sentence, the court asked the parties if there were any objections to its sentence or the manner in which it was imposed, and Moses objected to the 25-year consecutive sentence as to Count 4. He asserted that this sentence was unreasonable and unconstitutional, and further argued that Congress did not intend that a defendant should receive the 25-year mandatory sentence where the relevant \u00a7 924(c) offenses were alleged in a single indictment. Moses acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>that his argument was foreclosed by precedent. The court imposed the sentence as announced, thus overruling Moses\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a constitutional challenge to a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Under \u00a7 924(c), any person who brandishes a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment, which must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and (D)(ii). Under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s enhanced-penalty provision, an individual who sustains \u201ca second or subsequent conviction under this subsection ... shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years,\u201d which also must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) and (D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">We have held that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s enhanced-penalty provision applies where the relevant \u00a7 924(c) offenses are charged in a single indictment. <em>United States v. Rawlings, </em>821 F.2d 1543, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1987). In so holding, we also held that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d language is not ambiguous, and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the enhanced-penalty clause does not apply unless a previous \u00a7 924(c) conviction already has become final. <em>Id. </em>at 1546. Similarly, in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s sentence, which included a five-year consecutive sentence and five 20-year consecutive sentences for the defendant\u2019s six \u00a7 924(c) convictions, all of which were charged in a single indictment. 508 U.S. 129, 130-31, 134-37, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 1996-99, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993). The Supreme Court expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d language signifies that the enhanced-penalty provision applies only where a previous \u00a7 924(c) conviction has become final. <em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 113 S.Ct. at 1997-98. In addition, the Supreme Court also held that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s enhanced-penalty clause is not ambiguous, and thus does not necessitate the operation of the rule of lenity. <em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 113 S.Ct. at 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">We have also rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s mandatory sentencing provisions violate due process. <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 555-56 (11th Cir.1990). Under our prior precedent rule, we are \u201cbound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en bane </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">For the reasons set forth above, <em>Deal </em>and <em>Rawlings </em>foreclose Moses\u2019s argument that the enhanced-penalty clause set forth in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) does not apply if both the initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \u00a7 924(c) offenses were charged in a single indictment. These decisions likewise preclude his argument that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i)\u2019s language is ambiguous, thus requiring the operation of the rule of lenity. We are bound to follow this precedent. Finally, to the extent that Moses can be said to have adequately raised a due process argument, this argument lacks merit in light of our previous holding that \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s mandatory sentencing provisions do not offend due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
