Price alleges that the judges are liable for various decisions they made in his underlying housing suit. <em>See Price v. Hous. Auth. of New Orleans, </em>320 Fed.Appx. 214, 215-16 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (outlining Price\u2019s housing suit claims). The district court dismissed Price\u2019s claims with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), determining that all of his claims should be dismissed on the grounds of judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">\u201cIt is well established that judges enjoy absolute immunity for judicial acts performed in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Mays v. Sudderth, </em>97 F.3d 107, 110 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 553-54, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967)). \u201c A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 (quoting <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). Even liberally construing Price\u2019s briefing, we find no merit in his conclusory arguments that the judges acted outside their jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>The district court properly dismissed Price\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
