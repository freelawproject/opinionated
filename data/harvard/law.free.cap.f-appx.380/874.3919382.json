We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">In 1997, Malgoza moved to reduce his sentence of life imprisonment based on Amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). The district court denied the motion. The district court considered the quantity of cocaine involved in Malgoza\u2019s drug offenses and criminal history, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>and determined that Malgoza\u2019s sentence \u201cwas fair and just.\u201d Malgoza did not appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In 2009, Malgoza filed a \u201crenewed motion for reduction of sentence\u201d and repeated the arguments made in his first motion to reduce. The district court denied Malgoza\u2019s motion based on lack of jurisdiction. In the alternative, the district court ruled that it was bound by the \u201claw of the case\u201d and, if not, \u201cit was exercising its discretion [by] refus[ing] to reduce\u201d Malgoza\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Malgoza\u2019s second motion to reduce was barred by the law of the case. The district court rejected Malgoza\u2019s first request to reduce his sentence, and Malgoza failed to appeal that decision. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1997). Malgoza\u2019s alleged \u201cnew evidence\u201d also was available when he moved to reduce his sentence in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The denial of Malgoza\u2019s successive motion to reduce his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
