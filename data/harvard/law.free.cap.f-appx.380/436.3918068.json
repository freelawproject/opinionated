Banks, Texas prisoner # 1084188, seeks a certificate of appeala-bility (COA) to appeal the dismissal with prejudice of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred. The district court\u2019s timeliness determination was grounded in its conclusion that Banks\u2019s out-of-time petition for discretionary review (PDR) did not toll the period for filing his \u00a7 2254 petition or otherwise affect the limitations period found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">A COA may be issued only if the petitioner \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). When the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2254 relief is based on procedural grounds without analysis of the underlying constitutional claims, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-22\">After the district court issued its judgment in this case, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009). In <em>Womack v. Thaler, </em>591 F.3d 757 (5th Cir.2009), this court extended the rationale of <em>Jimenez </em>to a case where the state court granted a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>time PDR. Consequently, jurists of reason could debate the propriety of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Jurists of reason could likewise debate whether Banks\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition \u201cstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We therefore grant a COA, vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Banks\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely, and remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jimenez </em>and <em>Womack. See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 387-88 (5th Cir.1998). Banks\u2019s motions for leave to file a supplemental brief and for consideration of <em>Jimenez </em>are also granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">MOTIONS GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
