Morton also appeals the court\u2019s denial of his motion to alter or amend judgment and its denial of his motion for recusal. We address each issue in turn, and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">Morton first asserts the district court erred by granting summary judgment against his claim that his constitutional rights to due process were violated duiing his administrative proceedings before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard used by the district court and drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ment is appropriate where \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The Supreme Court has held that, in cases of adverse administrative governmental action, \u201c[t]he essential requirements of due process ... are notice and an opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). More specifically, \u201ca tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Morton\u2019s due process rights were not violated during his proceedings before the MSPB. The proposed suspension provided Morton with notice and an explanation of the charges against him. Morton was also afforded a day-long administrative hearing, at which the entirety of the SSA\u2019s evidence was presented and he was given the opportunity to present evidence and arguments. The decision of the MSPB contained a lengthy analysis of Morton\u2019s arguments, and its conclusions were fully supported by the record. Morton\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Morton next contends the district court erred by granting summary judgment against his discrimination and retaliation claims. Morton asserts he presented sufficient evidence to support his claims that he received a fifteen-day suspension and was denied favorable assignments because he is an aged black male. Morton also contends his alleged inclusion on a list of troublemaker employees constituted unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Title VII prohibits discrimination based on an employee\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). The ADEA mandates an employer may not discriminate against a person on account of age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). We have adapted principles of law applicable to cases arising under Title VII to issues of age discrimination under the ADEA. <em>Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., </em>9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">A defendant may establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on circumstantial evidence by showing that: \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dept. of Educ., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). The methods of presenting a prima facie case, however, \u201care flexible and depend to a large degree upon the employment situation.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The district court did not err by holding that Morton failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. First, the reassignment of Morton\u2019s duties did not constitute an adverse employment action. \u201cIn the vast majority of instances, ... a change in work assignments, without any tangible harm, will be outside the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>tection afforded by Congress in Title VII\u2019s anti-discrimination clause.... \u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1245 (11th Cir.2001). Morton\u2019s reassignment was accompanied by no tangible harm, such as a decrease in pay, and did not otherwise constitute a \u201cserious and material change\u201d in the terms and conditions of his employment as required under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 1239. Second, Morton cannot establish a prima facie case with regard to his fifteen-day suspension because he has been unable to identify any similarly-situated individual outside his protected class who was treated more favorably. <em>See Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Morton has also failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is some causal relation between the two events.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., </em>141 F.3d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir.1998)). In the context of a retaliation claim, adverse actions are those that constitute a \u201cserious and material change\u201d in the terms and conditions of employment, <em>Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1239, or that \u201cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2420, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (quotations omitted). Morton has not shown his alleged inclusion on a list of troublemakers\u2014as identified by fellow employees, rather than his supervisors\u2014 would dissuade a reasonable employee from filing a complaint or otherwise constitute an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Morton also contends the district court erred by denying his motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e). We review the denial of a motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>Shuford v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins., </em>508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). The only grounds for granting a motion to alter or amend judgment are new evidence or manifest error. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007). A motion to alter or amend judgment may not be used to reliti-gate old matters, raise new arguments, or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">In his motion to alter or amend judgment, Morton identified no new evidence or manifest error. Instead, Morton merely attempted to reargue factual issues previously decided by the district court. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Morton further asserts the district court erred by denying his motion for re-cusal because Judge Moye\u2019s judicial rulings call his impartiality into question. We review a district judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007). Judicial recusal is appropriate where, inter alia, a judge\u2019s impartiality may reasonably be questioned. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Judicial rulings, routine trial administration efforts, and ordinary admonishments are not grounds for recusal. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Morton has merely cited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Judge Moye\u2019 judicial rulings and has pointed to no facts that cast doubt on Judge Moye\u2019s impartiality. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying Morton\u2019s motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The district court did not err by granting summary judgment against Morton\u2019s complaint. Morton was afforded due process in his administrative proceedings before the MSPB and has failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation under either Title VII or the ADEA. Morton\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment and his motion for recusal are likewise without merit. The decisions of the district court are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-15\">. Although the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit generally has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the MSPB, a plaintiff may seek review in a district court in certain cases involving discrimination. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b); <em>Kelliher v. Veneman, </em>313 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. Morton's argument that the SSA impermis-sibly delayed the processing of his EEO claim was not raised before the district court and therefore will not be considered for the first time on appeal. <em>See Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1308 (11th Cir.2009). Moreover, the Administrative Judge did not limit Morton's ability to effectively cross-examine SSA's witnesses by limiting Morton's questioning to issues relevant to the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b919-6\">. Even assuming Morton could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, he has not demonstrated that the SSA's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the suspension\u2014his deliberate insubordination\u2014was pretexual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
