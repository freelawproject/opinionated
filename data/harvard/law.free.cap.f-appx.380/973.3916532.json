After thorough consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments and the record, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">We previously denied a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s 2008 order. <em>See Mendez-De Vasquez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>345 Fed.Appx. 441 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (unpublished). Our earlier decision outlined in detail the Petitioners\u2019 claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 443-44. In brief, the Petitioners alleged that a criminal gang called the Mara Salvatrucha (\u201cMaras\u201d) persecuted them in their native country of El Salvador on account of their political opinion and membership in a particular social group. <em>Id. </em>at 443. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The BIA affirmed in December 2008 on the ground that \u201c \u2018the alleged events do not rise to the level of past persecution on account of a protected ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of that decision, the BIA cited, among other cases, <em>Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 579 (BIA 2008) and <em>Matter of E-A-G- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">While their first petition for review was pending before us, the Petitioners filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA. The BIA denied the motion on 21 August 2009. Although the Petitioners \u201cessentially reiterate[d] the arguments previously advanced,\u201d the BIA reviewed its prior decision and again concluded that the record supported the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 2. In particular, the BIA clarified that it accepted the IJ\u2019s finding that one of the Petitioners had been raped. Nevertheless, the BIA concluded that the evidence, including the testimony by the Petitioners and the expert on country conditions, \u201cis insufficient to demonstrate past persecution, or a well founded fear of persecution, <em>on account of political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\u201d Id. </em>Consequently, the BIA concluded that the Petitioners failed to satisfy their burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA. The BIA again determined the Petitioners were ineligible for CAT relief as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">On 8 September 2009, we issued our decision denying a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s December 2008 order denying relief. <em>See Mendez-De Vasquez, </em>345 Fed.Appx. at 441, 443. We concluded that the Maras committed private acts of violence against the Petitioners based on their refusal to join the Maras gang, rather than on account of the Petitioners\u2019 actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 445. Additionally, we agreed with the BIA that the Petitioners\u2019 proposed social group\u2014 \u201cpoor girls who come from fatherless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>homes, with no adult male protective figures ... who resist recruitment or criticize the Maras,\u201d and their family members\u2014 was not cognizable under the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 446. We further rejected the Petitioners\u2019 attempt to distinguish then- case from <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>and <em>Matter of E-A-G-. See id. </em>at 447. Because the Petitioners failed to establish their eligibility for asylum, we concluded that they were also ineligible for withholding of removal under the INA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mat 447-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In their current petition for review, the Petitioners contend the BIA erroneously determined, without citing any case law, that the Maras\u2019 persecution was not on account of the Petitioners\u2019 political opinion or their membership in a particular social group. The Petitioners argue that sufficient evidence in the record established their eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the Petitioners submit that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to address their argument that their case was distinguishable from <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>and <em>Matter of E-A-G-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Our review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is limited to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). A motion to reconsider must do more than regurgitate prior arguments made to the BIA. <em>See id. </em>at 1329. Instead, the motion must identify specific factual or legal errors in the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, an appellate court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions are \u201cgenerally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>Mega Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The exceptions to this rule are when: \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence; (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue; or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">We find no abuse of discretion here. The BIA correctly determined.that the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider essentially presented the same legal arguments that were raised on direct appeal to the BIA \u2014 namely, that the Petitioners had been persecuted on account of their political opinion and membership in a particular social group. In response to the Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA had failed to consider adequately all the evidence, the BIA again reviewed the record and determined that the evidence, including the testimony of the Petitioners and the country expert, did not support a finding of past or future persecution on account of a protected ground. The absence <em>of easelaw </em>in the BIA\u2019s order denying the motion to reconsider does not constitute an abuse of discretion. The BIA specifically referenced its December 2008 order, which contained numerous citations to federal statutes and supporting precedent. To the extent that the Petitioners reassert in their petition to us that the evidence merits a grant of asylum or withholding of removal, we are bound by our prior decision rejecting those claims, as none of the exceptions to the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>of the case doctrine apply. <em>See Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">We also find no merit to the Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA ignored their argument that <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>and <em>Matter of E-A-G- </em>were distinguishable from their case. The BIA stated that it had reviewed its decision \u201cin light of the [Petitioners\u2019] multiple appellate and motion arguments,\u201d but it found those arguments unpersuasive. AR at 2. The BIA then reaffirmed that the Petitioners had not established their claims and cited the portions of its 2008 order which relied upon <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>and <em>Matter of EA-G-. </em>Thus, the BIA considered the Petitioners\u2019 arguments but rejected them. Moreover, the Petitioners raised these same arguments concerning <em>Matter of SE-G- </em>and <em>Matter of E-A-G- </em>in their first petition for review to us, but we found \u201cno meaningful distinction between the BIA\u2019s precedent and the case before us.\u201d <em>Mendez-De Vasquez, </em>345 Fed.Appx. at 447. Accordingly, we are bound by that decision. <em>See Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">As a final matter, the Petitioners suggest for the first time that <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>may no longer be binding precedent because the BIA reopened the case, remanded it to the immigration court, and issued an unpublished decision. We lack</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">jurisdiction to review this claim, however, because the Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. See <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201c[A]bsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation fiiarks and citation omitted). According to the Petitioners, the BIA issued its unpublished decision in <em>Matter of S-E-G- </em>on 28 July 2009, which was several weeks before the BIA denied the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider on 21 August 2009. The Petitioners proffer no excuse or exception as to why they did not raise this claim to the BIA in their pending motion to reconsider. Accordingly, \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to consider it under the clear dictates of circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-11\">.
