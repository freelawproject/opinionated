He challenges the district court\u2019s increase in his term of imprisonment based on its determination that his Texas conviction for possession of cocaine constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">Under <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 54-60, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), the district court committed plain error. <em>See United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 284-85 (5th Cir.2010). The Government concedes as much. Because Sanchez-Valle has shown that there is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence if not for misapplication of the guidelines, the plain error affected his substantial rights and seriously affected the fairness of the proceeding. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Quintanilla, </em>574 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>for resentencing. We express no opinion on what sentence the district court should impose on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
