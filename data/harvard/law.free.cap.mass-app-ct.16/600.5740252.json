Dupree did not contest that 2.8 grams of cocaine were seized from his jacket pocket; rather he argued that this small quantity of drugs and the paraphernalia removed during a subsequent search of his apartment (a kitchen strainer, spoons, some tin foil, and a glossine bag) were equally consistent with personal use of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">At trial the assistant district attorney made a brief opening statement introducing himself and outlining the evidence he expected to present. The judge then dismissed the jury for morning recess and informed them that the Commonwealth would present its case upon their return. Defense counsel immediately stated his intention to make an opening at that time. Without inquiring into the content of the proposed opening, the trial judge stated he would not permit the defendant to open until after the Commonwealth had rested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Nothing in Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(a)(1) grants the judge this discretion. In fact, language designed so to do, included in an earlier version of the rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was specifically deleted in that version of the rule finally promulgated by the Supreme Judicial Court. We presume that such a revision was made deliberately and with the intention of effectuating some change in the proposed rule. See <em>Rein </em>v. <em>Marshfield, ante </em>519, 522 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The function of a defendant\u2019s opening statement is to inform the court and jury what he expects to prove. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>514 F.2d 1184, 1192 (10th Cir. 1975). We have held that the defendant\u2019s right to elect when to make his opening is subject to the limitations of self-restraint imposed by S.J.C. Rule 3:08, DF 12, as appearing in 382 Mass. 807 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mcjunkin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 609, 615-616 (1981). Thus, where the opening would present \u201cno more than [the defendant\u2019s] hope to puncture the Commonwealth\u2019s case somehow through cross-examination,\u201d the right to open may properly be denied. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 913 (1983). Here, however, the defendant not only was reasonably certain of the facts he would elicit on cross-examination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hershenow, </em>680 F.2d 847, 858 (1st Cir. 1982), but he planned to, and did, present direct evidence on his behalf. In these circumstances there is no question but that the defendant was entitled to make an opening statement before the Commonwealth presented its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Whether to open at the beginning of the trial or after the Commonwealth had rested is a tactical decision resting with the defense attorney. As one commentator has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c[T]he jury is apt to attach undue weight to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement which is left uncontra-dicted until the close of the state\u2019s evidence. Since the jury is highly attentive and impressionable at the outset of the trial, it may be unfair to deny counsel the opportunity to present the other side of the case until the middle of the trial when the effect of an opening statement is likely to be abated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Decof, Art of Advocacy, Opening Statements \u00a7 2.02, at 2-5 &amp; 2-6 (1982). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hershenow, supra </em>at 858; <em>State </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>156 Mont. 339, 346 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On the other hand, \u201cdefense counsel may not know what evidence, if any, he will present until he has heard and evaluated the government\u2019s\u201d case. <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>269 A.2d 441, 443 (D.C. 1970). It may, therefore, be prudent to reserve opening until after the government has rested, but the freedom to make the choice, under our rule, is that of defense counsel alone. The trial judge, of course, retains the authority to monitor the statement to prevent its wafting into argument, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Her-shenow, </em>680 F.2d at 858, as part of the court\u2019s responsibility to insure a fair trial for all litigants. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mc-Junkin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 615-616. The authority, discussed in <em>Mcjunkin </em>and <em>Medeiros, </em>to deny an opening upon determination that defense counsel has no evidence to present does not justify the action of the trial judge in this case. To deny the defendant the right to open at the commencement of the trial without inquiry into the context of the proposed statement was error. To attempt to evaluate the extent of the prejudice which ensued would be an exercise in speculation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, therefore, we reverse. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 547 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>376 Mass. 811, 819 (1978). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), </em>384 Mass. 390, 392-393 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mcjunkin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 616-617.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">There exists a rule of the Superior Court, rule 7 (1974), which appears to repose in the trial judge discretion as to the timing of an opening in a criminal case. It provides, in pertinent part, \u201cThe court in its discretion may permit, or in a civil action require, a defendant to make an opening statement of his defense before any evidence is introduced.\u201d This apparent conflict with Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(a)(1) is resolved by the last paragraph of S.J.C. Rule 1:01, as appearing in 382 Mass. 699 (1981), which provides that to the extent the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure conflict with the rules of a court, the rules of criminal procedure shall control.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Since it will arise on a new trial, we have considered the defendant\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32A(a), </em>which defines the crime of which the defendant was convicted, contains a provision for punishment which is unconstitutionally vague. Unlike G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(a) (as in effect prior to 1982), declared unconstitutional in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 574 (1982), the statute applied to Dupree contains no internal inconsistencies. Notably, it does not contain a minimum period of incarceration inconsistent with a lesser penalty, as was the case with \u00a7 32(a), the provision considered in <em>Gagnon. </em>The question raised by this appeal is whether c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a) (as in effect prior to 1982), can be construed consistently with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a question left undecided by <em>Gagnon. </em>387 Mass. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>573. We think that this case does not present a conflict with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The crux of the defendant Dupree\u2019s argument is that the punishment provision in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(o), viz., \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for not less than one, not more than ten years, or by a fine of not less than $1,000\u201d is inconsistent with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, which prescribes that a minimum sentence to State prison shall be for two and one-half years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Only Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Walpole (M.C.I., Walpole), is a State prison. G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 l(o). Dupree was not, however, sentenced to State prison. He was sentenced to ten years at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord (M.C.I., Concord), a sentence the judge had the power to impose under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 31. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 508-510 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 123-125 (1983). In making the crime punishable by a sentence to State prison, the Legislature has placed offenders on notice that transgression of the statute (i.e., G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A[a]) is a felony. G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 1. The reference to State prison \u201cmay well indicate the Legislature\u2019s use of the statutory shorthand for a felony, rather than an intent to preclude a Concord sentence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. at 511, quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. at 124. It did not compel a sentence to State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We are at a loss to understand how a person such as Dupree (if again found guilty) may claim he has not had notice of the punishment alternatives. He knows that: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>crime is a felony; the period of incarceration may be from one to ten years; incarceration may be in M.C.I., Walpole, but, by reason of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 31, it may be at a correctional institution other than Walpole, e.g., at Concord; or there may be a fine and no incarceration at all. There is, upon analysis of this case, no conflict between G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32A(a), </em>and G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24. It is not incumbent upon us to conjure up unlikely abstract inconsistencies, such as might occur were a judge to attempt, in the face of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, to sentence a person convicted under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(o), to less than two and a half years at M.C.I., Walpole. That is, perhaps, one reason why the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 705-706 (1982), said G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(o), was consistent with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24. We are to indulge every rational presumption in favor of a statute\u2019s validity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, 387 </em>Mass. at 569. As there is no need, on the facts before us, to find the punishment provisions of \u00a7 <em>32A(a) </em>void for vagueness, we do not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-15\"> Rule 24(a)(1) provides: <em>\u201cOrder of Presentation. </em>The Commonwealth shall present its opening statement first.
