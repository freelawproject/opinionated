(Olympic), made a contract to purchase a specified 1980 Piper Aztec aircraft for $172,000 from an aircraft dealer, H &amp; H Aircraft Sales, Inc. (H &amp; H), of Monroe, New York. A down payment by check was made. The aircraft was delivered by H &amp; H to Olympic in Massachusetts on October 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>1979. The balance of the price was then paid by Olympic, which since that date has had possession of the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Olympic, through O\u2019Hara (see n.l), asked H &amp; H to change the aircraft\u2019s registration number with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to a new number. H &amp; H undertook to do this and also stated that it would register the transfer of ownership from H &amp; H to Olympic. It did change the registration number to N1946D, but did not record with the FAA the bill of sale concerning the transfer of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On behalf of the South Shore Bank (the bank), Samuel L. Peoples, a second vice president and a loan officer, made loans to H &amp; H, on December 14 and 26, 1979, and March 4, 1980, and received H &amp; H\u2019s notes incorporated in three documents entitled \u201cSecurity Agreement-Aircraft Chattel Mortgage\u201d (security agreements). The loans were in principal amounts of $86,000, $31,000, and $85,000, respectively, and bore annual interest at two percent above the prime rate in effect from time to time. Each security agreement gave to the bank (1) a security interest in the Piper Aztec aircraft, FAA registration no. N1946D (formerly N2137Z), and (2) the rights and, in the event of default, the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), including the right to take possession of the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Before making each loan, Peoples obtained a FAA title search of the FAA registry at Oklahoma City which indicated that H &amp; H was the registered owner of the aircraft. The bank recorded its lien with the FAA on January 18, 1980. H &amp; H committed defaults under the security agreements by February 26, 1981. The bank sought to take possession of the aircraft. Peoples then learned that H &amp; H had sold the aircraft to Olympic before any of the bank\u2019s loans to H &amp; H had been made. Olympic had not recorded its bill of sale with the FAA by January 18,1980 (when the bank recorded its security interest) and, so far as the present record shows, Olympic\u2019s interest never has been recorded with the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The complaint in the present action was filed on March 12, 1981. It sought damages, an injunction against transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of the aircraft, possession of the aircraft, and declaratory relief. Temporary injunctive relief was granted. The bank, on the one hand, and Olympic and O\u2019Hara, on the other hand, respectively, filed motions for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, from which, together with the pleadings and the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, the facts above have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Summary judgment was granted in favor of the bank which was declared to be entitled to immediate possession of the aircraft. Olympic and O\u2019Hara have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">1. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (hereafter \u201cthe Act\u201d), \u00a7 503, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403 (1976), controls important aspects of the present case, as the trial judge recognized. The pertinent provisions of that statute are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They, especially subsection (c), recently have been discussed in <em>Philko Aviation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shacket, </em>462 U.S. 406 (1983), where it was held (at 409-410) that \u00a7 1403(c) \u201cmeans that every aircraft transfer must be evidenced by an instrument, and every such instrument must be recorded, before the rights of innocent third parties can be affected.\u201d It was held also (at 410) that \u201cstate laws permitting undocumented or unrecorded transfers are pre-empted\u201d by the Federal stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ute which was <em>(ibid.) </em>\u201cintended to preempt any state law under which a transfer without a recordable conveyance would be valid against innocent transferees or lienholders who have recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The <em>Philko </em>case dealt (see 406) with two successive sales of the same aircraft. The first was to the Shackets (husband and wife) who \u201cpaid the . . . price in full and took possession of the aircraft.\u201d Their vendor told them \u201cthat he would \u2018take care of the paperwork,\u2019 which the Shackets understood to include . . . recordation . . . with the FAA.\u201d The <em>Philko </em>record revealed no effort by the Shackets (apart from their reliance on their vendor to do so) to record their title (as was the situation with Olympic so far as the present record discloses). Thereafter the same vendor purported to sell the same aircraft to Philko, whose bank subsequently recorded the title documents with the FAA. The Federal District Court (497 F. Supp. 1262, N.D. 111. 1980) granted summary judgment in favor of the Shackets, and the Court of Appeals (681 F.2d 506, 7th Cir. 1982) affirmed judgment for the Shackets. The Supreme Court, however, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. We think that the <em>Philko </em>case governs the situation in the present case, where Olympic\u2019s title interest in the Piper aircraft was never recorded and thus (apart from considerations discussed below) could have no effect against the lien interest of the bank which was recorded with the FAA fairly promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The <em>Philko </em>case and the facts (see note 5, <em>infra) </em>make it unnecessary to decide a much discussed question of priorities under \u00a7 9-307 of the U.C.C. (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-307, and New York Uniform Commercial Code Law \u00a7 9-307 [McKinney Supp. 1982-1983])<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> viz., whether a later purchaser of an aircraft (who does not record with the FAA his bill of sale) from an aircraft dealer takes free of a bank\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>prior recorded security interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Philko case </em>(at 412-413), after a reference to Judge Wisdom\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Gary Aircraft Corp., </em>681 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied sub nom. <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Gary Aircraft Corp., </em>462 U.S. 1131 (1983), proceeds, \u201cAlthough state law determines priorities, all interests must be federally recorded before they can obtain whatever priority to which they are entitled under state law.\u201d As the present record shows no recording with the FAA of H &amp; H\u2019s bill of sale to Olympic at . any time, we need not concern ourselves with this question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">2. The <em>Philko </em>case (at 414) decides that the lower Federal courts, there reversed, \u201cerred by granting the Shackets summary judgment on the basis that if an unrecorded transfer of an aircraft is valid under state law, it has validity as against innocent third parties.\u201d The opinion, in remanding the case for further findings, then points out that, because the Federal District Court had dealt with the <em>Philko </em>situation by summary judgment, it did not consider questions such as whether (a) \u201cPhilko had actual notice of the transfer to the Shackets\u201d or (b) \u201cthe transferee ha[d] used reasonable dili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>gence to file [with the FAA] and cannot be faulted for the failure of the crucial documents to be of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In the present case, Olympic and O\u2019Hara merely left it to H &amp; H to do the recording and thus facilitated the perpetration of the scheme by which H &amp; H obtained loans from the bank on the security of the Piper aircraft. This behavior was like that of the Shackets in the <em>Philko </em>case. On appeal, however, Olympic now argues that the bank had \u201cactual notice\u201d of the sale to Olympic of the Piper aircraft as a consequence of (a) an alleged deposit in H &amp; H\u2019s account at the bank of Olympic\u2019s downpayment check for $34,400, dated August 3, 1979, over four months before the bank took the earliest security agreement (December 14, 1979);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (b) the delivery of the Piper aircraft to Olympic on October 31, 1979; (c) the circumstance that Olympic kept the aircraft at an airport in Westfield, Massachusetts, and not at H &amp; H\u2019s home airport in Monroe, New York, the location of the aircraft mentioned in two of the security agreements; (d) the failure of the bank to check whether H &amp; H had possession of the aircraft when it took the first security agreement; and (e) the circumstance that the total loans'by the bank to H &amp; H had an aggregate principal amount of $202,000, whereas the price paid to H &amp; H by Olympic in October, 1979, was only $172,000. Olympic argues on appeal that these circumstances, taken together, constitute \u201cinquiry-provoking facts\u201d which \u201camount to \u2018actual notice.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Olympic did not assert in its answer that the bank had actual notice of H &amp; H\u2019s sale to it. \u201cActual notice\u201d would appear to be an affirmative defense. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(c), 365 Mass. 750 (1974); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7\u00a7 8.6, 8.7 &amp; 8.22 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1981). Certainly, the burden of showing knowledge of an unrecorded conveyance is on the party claiming under it. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>229 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>467, 469-471 (1918). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>301 Mass. 125, 128-129 (1938). <em>See Atlantic Trans. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexander Shipping Co., </em>261 Mass. 1, 7-9 (1927), where the Supreme Judicial Court discussed the term \u201cactual notice\u201d as used in the Federal Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (1976),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and held by analogy that the term had the same meaning as \u201cactual notice\u201d in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 4. \u201c[K]nowledge of facts which might arouse suspicion [of an unrecorded instrument] would not be sufficient to destroy the bona tides of the subsequent purchaser.\u201d See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Lee Realty Corp., </em>364 Mass. 632, 634-635 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">It may be that the term \u201cactual notice\u201d as used in \u00a7 1403(c) includes knowledge of facts which provoke inquiry. See <em>Marsden </em>v. <em>Southern Flight Serv., Inc., </em>227 F. Supp. 411, 416-417 (M.D. N.C. 1961). That decision (at 416) interpreted \u201cactual notice\u201d as used in \u00a7 1403(c) \u201cin a sense broad enough to include knowledge of inquiry-provoking facts as well as express knowledge of the fact in issue.\u201d It proceeded, nevertheless (at 416-417), to treat \u201cpossession alone . . . [as] not sufficient to give third parties notice of the possessor\u2019s interest, especially in a context in which the property is of a kind usually protected by title papers. To hold otherwise would be to import constructive notice into the statute by the back door.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>South Shore Bank </em>v. <em>Tony Mat, Inc., </em>Civ. No. 82-0330 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 22,1982). Contrast <em>Aircraft Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Fisher Flying Serv., Inc., </em>183 So.2d 441, 445 (La. Ct. App.) aff\u2019d, 249 La. 374 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Nothing in the pleadings in the Superior Court or in the affidavits suggests that there was any general practice of banks physically to inspect aircraft which they were taking as collateral under security agreements. Indeed, the purpose of the Federal recording system in part would be defeated by such a requirement which in effect would tend to remove from \u201cany buyer in possession . . . [all] incentive to record his title with the FAA, . . . thereby preventing] the \u2018central clearing house\u2019 from providing \u2018ready access\u2019 to information about his claim.\u201d <em>Philko </em>case, at 411. The bank in Quincy, Massachusetts, has not been shown, at least on this record, to have been under any obligation of good business practice to do more with respect to an aircraft, likely to be near H &amp; H\u2019s place of business in New York, than to check the title records of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">No persuasive reason has been advanced by Olympic for regarding the size of the bank\u2019s advances on the security agreements as evidence that the bank knew of the sale of the aircraft for a lesser amount. Indeed, had the bank known that H &amp; H would sell an aircraft for as little as $172,000, it might not have made its final advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">What has been said above indicates the highly fragile basis which, on this record, Olympic has for asserting, for the first time on appeal, that the bank had \u201cactual notice\u201d of the unrecorded sale to it of the aircraft. This is wholly apart from the circumstance that no such defense was pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">When both contestants in the Superior Court moved for summary judgment, they each in effect represented that there were no genuine issues of material fact (such as \u201cactual notice\u201d) remaining unsettled. The trial judge dealt with the case on that basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He stated in the summary of his decision that \u201cthe [b]ank took a security interest in the aircraft <em>without actual notice </em>of the prior sale and on the strength of record title\u201d (emphasis supplied). In his discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>sion of the Federal law, he noted that \u201cthe unrecorded prior sale is invalid as to the [b]ank . . . which took <em>without actual notice </em>of the transaction\u201d (emphasis supplied). We regard these statements, and the absence of any discussion of the circumstances asserted as showing notice, as indications that he did not understand any issue of \u201cactual notice\u201d to have been presented to him. If no such issue was raised before the trial judge, it cannot be advanced for the first time on appeal. See <em>John B. Deary, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crane, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 719, 724 (1976); <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Abdallah, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 866-867 (1980). See also <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv.

The bank, in making the loans, changed its position in reliance on the FAA records. Each security agreement relates (as has been stated) to the particular aircraft and has not been shown to have been a part of an inventory loan. As to an inventory loan, a lending bank may contemplate that the aircraft collateral <em>later </em>will be sold in the ordinary course of business and may assume <em>for the future </em>the risk of such a sale. These agreements, however, provided that H&amp;H \u201cwill not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of\u201d the collateral. That this bank did not assume <em>for the past </em>any risk of sale is shown by H &amp; H\u2019s covenant that \u201cexcept for the security interest granted ...
