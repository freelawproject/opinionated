The defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a declaration of mistrial over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the defendant\u2019s objection. On retrial the defendant was convicted of both offenses. The defendant assigns as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">(1) the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the double jeopardy clause barred his retrial;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">(2) the manner of the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction; and (3) certain of the jury instructions on the use of prior inconsistent statements. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We summarize the facts. In the first trial, as in the second, the defendant offered consent as his defense to the aggravated rape charge and denied the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge. The first trial progressed up to the point of the cross-examination of the defendant. After the defendant had answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had used a rope around the complainant\u2019s neck, a woman in the courtroom gallery made the following outburst:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. [The complainant] is nothing but a slut and a whore. I\u2019ve known her twenty-four years. She\u2019s a prostitute and everything else. That\u2019s all she is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">From the witness stand the defendant then said, \u201cGo out with my mother.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The woman was later identified as the defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">At this point there was a bench conference. The Commonwealth moved for a mistrial; the defendant objected. The trial judge took the motion under advisement, gave a lengthy curative instruction to the jury and recessed the trial from that time (Wednesday afternoon) until Friday morning. In the interim, a local newspaper printed an article on the courtroom outburst, reporting that it might result in a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">On Friday morning the trial judge heard both counsel on the motion for mistrial. The Commonwealth argued that the complainant\u2019s credibility had been damaged beyond repair by any instruction and that since credibility was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>critical issue in the case a mistrial was necessary. The defendant disputed the extent of damage to the victim\u2019s credibility and suggested a voir dire. Following a brief recess, the trial judge granted the motion for mistrial stating that he \u201c[did] not do this lightly.\u201d The judge noted that he had \u201creflected and considered, among other things, conducting a voir dire of the jurors\u201d but had concluded that a voir dire would exacerbate the impact of the outburst, if the local newspaper article had not done so already. From his remarks it appears that the trial judge accorded great weight to the defendant\u2019s right to have his trial concluded in a single proceeding, before a particular tribunal. On balance, the trial judge concluded that there was \u201cmaterial prejudice of the jurors\u2019 ability to deliberate impartially\u201d creating \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">At the outset of the second trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that the mistrial had been declared without manifest necessity. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">From evidence adduced at the second trial, the jury could have found the following: The defendant was a friend of the complainant\u2019s sons. On the evening of April 1, 1980, the defendant stayed overnight at the complainant\u2019s home with two of her sons. The complainant stayed overnight at a friend\u2019s home. On the morning of April 2, the defendant left the complainant\u2019s home with one of her sons, returned alone, and then left again with the second son. The second son locked the door upon leaving. When the complainant returned home later that morning, the defendant was there alone. As the complainant was moving about the house doing various household tasks, the defendant grabbed her, brought her to a couch and tied a rope around her neck, choking her. The defendant then raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">1. The defendant contends that there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial declared over his objection at his first trial. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978). There is no mechanical formula for determining whether manifest necessity for a mistrial is present in a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ticular case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reinstein, </em>381 Mass. 555, 560-561 (1980). The trial judge must exercise sound discretion, balancing the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 509, against the \u201cpublic interest in just judgments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 510. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 607, 619-620 (1980). In exercising this discretion, the trial judge must: first, afford counsel a full opportunity to be heard; and second, carefully consider alternatives to the drastic measure of a mistrial. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 515-516; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 618. See <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>661 F.2d 255, 257 (1st Cir. 1981). An exercise of sound discretion by the trial judge, particularly if it involves evaluation of the significance of juror bias, is entitled to appellate deference. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 509-510; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>593 F.2d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 1979). See <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 517, 519 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s first trial, declaration of a mistrial was an exercise of sound discretion. The trial judge afforded both counsel two opportunities to be heard on the motion for mistrial. Contrast <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 618; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 419. As alternatives to a mistrial, the trial judge considered a curative instruction and the defendant\u2019s suggestion of a juror voir dire. Contrast <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 618-619; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 519. The decision to reject the alternatives and declare a mistrial was hardly precipitous, coming after two recesses, one of substantial length. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reinstein, supra </em>at 562. Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We see no reason here to depart from the general rule of appellate deference to a trial judge\u2019s exercise of sound discretion on a motion for mistrial. The emotional outburst by the defendant\u2019s mother disparaging the complainant\u2019s character and reputation for chastity had the potential to compromise the jury\u2019s ability to determine the facts (par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ticularly as to the issue of consent) solely on the basis of the evidence; to prejudice the jury against the complainant; and to divert its attention from the object of the trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222 (1981). The trial judge was in the best position to assess the likelihood and magnitude of these potential dangers. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 513-514. He determined that there was \u201cmaterial prejudice to the jurors\u2019 ability to deliberate impartially\u201d and that the considered alternatives were inadequate to cure that prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 985 (1981) (curative instruction adequate where the victim\u2019s aunt shouted \u201cliar\u201d during defendant\u2019s testimony); <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>415 F.2d 870, 872-873 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1049 (1969) (curative instruction adequate where third person remarked to one venireman, later juror, on a rape case that he knew the complainant and that \u201cshe had another boy in jail on the same count\u201d). \u201cThere can be no doubt that actual bias among jurors renders mistrial manifestly necessary to perserve the ends of public justice.\u201d <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 128, 133 (1982). There was no abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of discretion. There was manifest necessity for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">2. The defendant contends that the manner in which the Commonwealth introduced a prior breaking and entering conviction against him was tantamount to a substantive use of the conviction and denied him a fair trial. The Commonwealth introduced the conviction over the defendant\u2019s objection immediately after the defendant\u2019s testimony that the complainant\u2019s home had been locked when he left it on the morning of April 2,1980, and that, contrary to the complainant\u2019s testimony, he was not inside the complainant\u2019s home when she arrived later that morning. The defendant argues that this juxtaposition was intended to suggest to the jury that the defendant had not been invited in by the complainant as he claimed, but that he had broken in; from this the jury could infer that the complainant had not consented to sexual intercourse, as the defendant claimed, but that she had been raped. The admissibility of the conviction is conceded. The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In some circumstances, the juxtaposition of a conviction with a question concerning a related matter may amount to \u201ca trap . . . designed not to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility but to establish substantively the defendant\u2019s propensity for violence\u201d or for a particular crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 127; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felton, ante </em>63, 66 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 681 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring) . Such use of a conviction violates both the letter and the spirit of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felton, supra </em>at 66. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 127. Although the better practice might be for the trial judge to exercise his discretion to prevent the overly suggestive introduction of an otherwise properly admissible prior conviction, limiting instructions will ordinarily obviate any harm to the defendant occasioned by such an introduction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>There was little danger that the jury would conclude that the defendant had a propensity for violence or a propensity to commit the types of acts involved in the charges against him. The conviction introduced against the defendant was for an offense entirely different in character from the offenses for which the defendant was being tried. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 661 (1980). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felton, supra. </em>The defendant requested and received a limiting instruction immediately after the introduction of the conviction. The judge again instructed the jury on the limited purpose of the prior conviction evidence in his final charge. Any prejudice to the defendant occasioned by the Commonwealth\u2019s manner of introducing the prior conviction was adequately countered by the judge\u2019s instructions. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">3. The defendant contends that the jury instructions on the use of prior inconsistent statements were restrictive to the point of denying him his right to impeach the complaining witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant points to the</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>judge\u2019s instruction to the jurors that if they found a witness\u2019 prior statement to be inconsistent with his testimony, they could use the statement in judging the witness\u2019 credibility if they thought that his trial testimony was \u201can attempt to mislead\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The impeachment value of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement lies in the jury\u2019s ability to infer from it that the witness was in error or lying during his trial testimony and to discount that testimony accordingly. Cf. McCormick, Evidence 97 n.42, 98 (2d ed. 1972). An instruction would diminish this impeachment value if it restricted the jury\u2019s ability to discount a witness\u2019 testimony on the basis of a prior statement to instances in which it believed that any inconsistency between the witness\u2019 trial testimony and the statement reflected falsification rather than error or confusion. \u201cViewing the charge in its entirety, as we must,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1008 (1982), we conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury did not have such an effect. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-12\"> To whom this request was directed is unclear from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-5\"> The outburst also frustrated the complainant\u2019s right and the public\u2019s interest against the introduction of evidence bearing on the complainant\u2019s reputation for chastity. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B (rape shield statute), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 228 (1981) (\u201cRape-shield statutes are \u2018aimed at eliminating a common defense strategy of trying the complaining witness rather than the defendant. The result of this strategy was harassment and further humiliation of the victim as well as discouraging victims of rape from reporting the crimes to law enforcement authorities\u2019\u201d [citation omitted].); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 567-568 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> The only alternative suggested by the defendant was a voir dire of the jurors. Little would have been accomplished by a voir dire. There was no question that all of the jurors had heard the outburst. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 372 (1974); <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. at 519. Although the jurors\u2019 exposure to the local newspaper article and their views on their own prejudice might have been ascertained, we cannot disagree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that, in the circumstances, such an inquiry would only have served to exacerbate any existing prejudice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reinstein, </em>381 Mass. at 558 &amp; n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> The portion of the charge in issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cNow there has been evidence in this case of a witness, or a particular witness, testifying to certain facts, and there has been testimony that the witness made prior statements, outside of this courtroom, which may have been inconsistent with the in-court statement. This, of course, is for you to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cBut whenever there is an introduction against a witness of a prior inconsistent statement made outside of this courtroom, that is done for the single purpose of impeaching the credibility or believability of the witness, if you find that it does impeach the credibility of the witness, if it makes that witness less believable to you. It is entirely up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201cIf you find someone testified here in court before you radically different from something that he or she said or testified to on a prior occasion, it is for you to say whether or not that affects the witness\u2019 credibility or believability. I suppose the important thing in determining the credibility of a witness when faced with prior inconsistent statements made outside of court is whether or not that person\u2019s prior inconsistent statement is inconsistent in fact \u2014 and that is for you to say \u2014 and, if it is, then does it deal with something that was of major import or minor import. If it is something which is minor, then I suppose you would discard it if you did not think it affects the credibility of the witness. If it was of major concern, and you think</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>that the witness\u2019 present testimony is now an attempt to mislead you, then you may use it in judging whether or not the witness is telling the truth. So you must scrutinize those situations of the type that I have mentioned here.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
