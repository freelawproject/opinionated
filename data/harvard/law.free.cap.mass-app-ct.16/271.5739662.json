L. c. 269, \u00a7 <em>10(a), </em>and on a single count of an indictment charging three counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a four to five year State prison term on the firearm charge and a concurrent term of three to five years on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the assault and battery conviction. He asserts that he is entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault and battery, which the Commonwealth alleged was committed by means of wanton and reckless conduct, because there was no proof of physical injury to the victim. He also argues that, because the judge may have been influenced by the assault and battery conviction in his imposition of sentence on the firearm charge, there must be a resentencing on the latter conviction if the former is determined to have been unsound. We reverse the assault and battery conviction but determine that resentencing on the firearm charge is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The jury had before it evidence from which it could have found the following facts. On the evening of December 5, 1981, the defendant drove his car up to the drive-in window of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Rockland and placed an order with a McDonald\u2019s employee. From her vantage point in the window, the employee observed the butt end of a gun protruding from under the defendant\u2019s right leg on the seat of his automobile. From his mannerisms and speech, she concluded that the defendant was intoxicated. She directed him to a parking area, telling him his order would be brought to him. A coworker summoned the police by telephone. Two Rock-land police cruisers arrived, bringing four officers to the scene. They were directed to the defendant\u2019s automobile, which was parked on the McDonald\u2019s lot, its motor running and headlights on. It had been snowing for some time, and the lot\u2019s unplowed surface was very slippery. Officer John DiRenzo approached the driver\u2019s window, which was rolled down. As he asked the defendant \u201cwhat was going on,\u201d he observed the gun (a sawed-off .22 caliber rifle) on the seat next to the defendant\u2019s leg and saw him make a movement with his hand toward it. Officer DiRenzo immediately stepped to the rear of the automobile. By that time all the officers were close to the automobile, and one of them, Oreste DiRenzo (John DiRenzo\u2019s father), opened its door and told the defendant to get out. The elder DiRenzo testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>fled that at that point, as he was holding the door handle, \u201c [t]he car lurched forward and I slipped, my feet came out from under me and I landed on the ground.\u201d DiRenzo was unhurt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of the other officers shot out a rear tire of the automobile as it fishtailed across the slippery parking lot toward an exit. The officers pursued the defendant in their cruisers and apprehended him a short distance away. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">1. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the assault and battery offense, first broached by the prosecutor at the argument on the motion for required findings of not guilty and subsequently presented to the jury in closing argument, was that the defendant sped away from the parking lot in reckless and wanton disregard of the safety of the police officers (who were arrayed along the sides of his automobile), causing the vehicle to come into contact with (but not to injure) three of the officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s charge confined the jury\u2019s consideration of the assault and battery charge to the theory espoused by the Commonwealth by instructing them that the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault and battery would be warranted if they should find that his conduct was reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and wanton and that it had caused \u201csome contact\u201d between the officer and the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The classic definition of assault and battery is \u201cthe intentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another, however slight.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931). Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 322, at 172 (1976). The law recognizes, however, an alternative form of assault and battery in which proof of a wilful, wanton and reckless act which results in personal injury to another substitutes for (or in some cases is said, with some imprecision, to allow the \u201cinference\u201d of) intentional conduct. Nolan, <em>supra </em>at 172-173. As previously noted, there is no question that this was the only theory of assault and battery presented to the jury. The jury were thus permitted to find ' the defendant guilty even if no one was injured, so long as they found an offensive touching \u201chowever slight.\u201d This, we think, incorrectly characterizes the law in a case of assault and battery by means of wilful, wanton and reckless conduct. We are unable to find a single reference in our case law to this mode of proof of assault and battery which does not refer to actual physical injury as a necessary element of the required proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>157 Mass. 551, 553 (1893) (assault and battery may be established by the \u201cintentional doing of an act which by reason of its wanton . . . character, exposes another to personal injury, and causes such an injury\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. at 203 (\u201cthe intentional doing of a wanton . . . act causing personal injury to another\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 401 (1944) (\u201cIf by wanton or reckless conduct bodily injury is caused to another, the person guilty of such conduct is guilty of assault and battery\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sostilio, </em>325 Mass. 143, 145 (1949) (same as Welansky); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 397 (1967) (same as <em>McCan).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus to sustain a conviction of the crime of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>sault and battery committed by means of wilful, wanton and reckless conduct, the Commonwealth must prove (1) that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct involve[d] a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, supra </em>at 399, or that it \u201cconstitute[d] ... a disregard of probable harmful consequences to another,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 747 (1975), <em>and </em>(2) that, as a result of that conduct, the victim suffered some physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the words \u201cactual physical injury\u201d have been used in these cases as shorthand for \u201cunconsented touching, however slight.\u201d The concepts conveyed by the two phrases are far from congruent, and it would have been simple enough for the decisions to express the view urged by the Commonwealth had that been their intent. Instead, words expressing a clearly different meaning were used. Moreover, the manner and context in which the offense is discussed by the Supreme Judicial Court in each of the opinions leaves no doubt that the court sought to formulate the elements of a distinct mode of culpability. We also reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 780 (1975), represents approval of a conviction arising from circumstances like those here. In <em>LeBlanc, </em>after an officer approached the defendant\u2019s automobile \u201cthe door on the driver\u2019s side swung open, knocking the officer down, and the defendant drove off. These circumstances were sufficient to permit the jury to infer that the defendant <em>intentionally </em>struck the officer with the door . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780 (emphasis supplied). The <em>LeBlanc </em>case is not an example of assault and battery by wilful, wanton and reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The rationale for a requirement of demonstrable physical injury in cases of wilful and wanton conduct is not difficult to discern. In such a case, actual intent to commit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>crime is not present, but may, as a legal fiction, be \u201cinferred\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from \u201cthe nature of the act <em>and its actual </em>results.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>114 Mass. 303, 305 (1873) (emphasis supplied). The higher standard of actual bodily injury in wanton and reckless conduct cases (as opposed to the mere \u201coffensive touch\u201d standard in intent cases) could be viewed as an attempt to establish levels of equivalent culpability within essentially dissimilar patterns of activity which have been determined to fall within the same statutory offense. Thus, until the unintended touch of a wilful, wanton and reckless actor causes injury, it is not cloaked with the criminal liability which attends the touch of one who intends the offensive contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Commonwealth also argues that the general intent necessary to support a conviction for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 307 (1980), may be inferred here from the very use of such a weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 197 (1980). Such an inference might reasonably be made where there is a \u201cuse of an inherently dangerous weapon, or . . . use of some other object <em>as a weapon, </em>with the intent to use that object in a dangerous or potentially dangerous fashion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 308 (emphasis supplied). An automobile, however, is not a \u201cdangerous weapon per se,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 303, and the Commonwealth never alleged that the defendant used his automobile as a weapon or purposely to injure the officers, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, supra, </em>choosing instead to rely on the theory that he used the vehicle in a wanton and reckless manner as a means of escape. The inference urged by the Commonwealth is one involving actual intent, a consideration which is not in issue in a prosecution predicated on the wilful, wanton and reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>less conduct variant of the offense. The inference is not available to the Commonwealth in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We conclude that since there was no evidence of physical injury to Officer Oreste DiRenzo, the theory of guilt furnished the jury improperly crossed two wires, and, as a result, the defendant\u2019s conviction for assault and battery on a theory of wanton and reckless conduct cannot stand. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blavackas, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 752-753 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">2. The defendant contends that reversal of the assault and battery conviction requires resentencing on the firearm charge because \u201c[d]ue process . . . require[s] resentencing if the sentencing judge . . . relied on information which was inaccurate or misleading . . . , a prior conviction later revealed to be constitutionally infirm . . . , or allegations of other criminal conduct which were wholly unreliable ...\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>370 Mass. 217, 221 (1976). The defendant argues, in essence, that the conviction which we have held to be invalid may have influenced the judge in his consideration of the sentence for the remaining conviction, and that due process requires that the judge resentence on the firearm charge in an atmosphere untainted by the presence of the assault and battery conviction. In support of the argument, the defendant cites <em>McGee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>462 F.2d 243 (2d Cir. 1972). In <em>McGee, </em>identical concurrent sentences had been imposed on each of four counts which had been tried together. The conviction on the first of the counts was subsequently overturned. The appellate court held that \u201c [t]he trial judge\u2019s original sentencing determination with respect to counts 2 through 4 could have been influenced by [the] conviction under count 1 \u2014 just as evidence of a prior conviction might influence a sentencing judge on a subsequent one. If such were in fact the case, [the] initial sentences under counts 2 through 4 would require reconsideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. The court determined that it could not ascertain from the judge\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tencing remarks whether he had in fact been influenced by the invalid conviction when sentencing on the valid ones, but identified several factors which indicated that such an influence was \u201cquite probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. In such circumstances, resentencing was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The factors which influenced the court in <em>McGee </em>are not present here. In <em>McGee, </em>the conviction which was reversed \u201cwas always regarded as the most serious of the four,\u201d and the other offenses might not have been prosecuted in the absence of the first. <em>Id. </em>at 246. In this case, the judge\u2019s sentencing remarks indicate that the situation was exactly the opposite, the now-voided assault and battery conviction being viewed as the less serious, despite the fact that it carried a substantially greater potential penalty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Concurrent sentences were imposed which corresponded to the judge\u2019s expressed perception of the respective gravity of the two offenses. On these f\u00e1cts, we think it unlikely that the assault and battery conviction influenced the disposition of the firearm charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the judge also noted that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s <em>prior </em>record, which is extensive, fully warrants the recommendation of the Commonwealth on [the firearm] indictment\u201d (emphasis supplied). That recommendation was subsequently adopted. It thus appears affirmatively that the judge\u2019s sentencing decision on the firearm charge was influenced by the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, rather than by the contemporaneous assault and battery conviction. The record is thus devoid of factors of the sort which persuaded the court in <em>McGee </em>to remand that case for resentencing. Finally, it appears that the judge did not rely in passing sentence on the type of inaccurate, misleading or unreliable information described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>370 Mass. at 221. We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The judgment on the second count of indictment no. 76391 is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and judgment is to be entered on that charge for the defendant. The judgment on indictment no. 76390 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-15\"> Convictions of driving to endanger and going away after a property damage accident were filed with the defendant\u2019s consent and are not before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> At the same time, as the automobile moved sideways as well as forward, its left rear tire passed over the younger DiRenzo\u2019s foot, and its rear bumper struck Officer Richard Schwerin\u2019s hand and leg. It appears that no injury resulted to either officer. The jury found the defendant not guilty on two counts of assault and battery premised on those contacts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s decision not to rely on a theory of actual intent is understandable in the circumstances. The uncontradicted evidence showed that the incident occurred as the defendant was attempting to drive the automobile forward, a direction unobstructed by any of the officers. From inside the vehicle, his senses perhaps impaired by alcohol, he might not have observed that Officer Oreste DiRenzo continued to hold the outside door handle after opening the door and ordering him out. The contacts with the other officers, which resulted in verdicts of not guilty, appear to have been occasioned, not by any intent to assault, but by the unintended fishtailing of the automobile on the icy surface as it accelerated away from them. While these circumstances certainly allowed an inference of wilful, wanton and reckless conduct, the prosecutor could have reasoned that they provided scant, if any, evidence of an intent to assault with a dangerous weapon.
