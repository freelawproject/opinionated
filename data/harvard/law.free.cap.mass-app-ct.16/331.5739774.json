He experienced as a police officer various difficult incidents. In 1975, he \u201cbegan having trouble coping with his job . . . [and] sleeping.\u201d He \u201cbecame nervous and upset, and deteriorated physically and emotionally.\u201d His family physician prescribed thirty quaaludes a month and valium. For quaa-ludes he \u201cdeveloped a tolerance\u201d and \u201coften relied on alcohol to help him sleep.\u201d On Christmas Day, 1978, while making an arrest, he was kicked in the back and neck and suffered injury for which demerol was prescribed. In May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1979, a board certified psychiatrist \u201ctreated him for severe agitated depression, phobias, nightmares, [and] dizziness.\u201d He prescribed \u201ctherapeutic, non-addictive drugs,\u201d removed him from valium, quaaludes, and demerol, and advised discontinuance of the use of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In November, 1979, Arria applied for accidental disability retirement (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, as amended through St. 1978, c. 487, \u00a7 6) claiming among other ailments, \u201c[d]epressive neurosis, dorsal and cervical neck syndrome with somatic disfunction,\u201d and \u201c[l]umbo-sacral and sacroiliac somatic d[i]sfunction,\u201d which (with other symptoms) he alleged to have been related to \u201cvarious incidents from 1975 through 1979.\u201d A medical board, noting that Arria was disabled, \u201cdid not find . . . that his disability was permanent or that it was causally related to his employment.\u201d In January, 1980, after accidental disability retirement was denied, he began to improve and to reduce the medication and by May, 1980, he \u201cwas totally off drugs and alcohol\u201d and, in the opinion of two psychiatrists, who had previously found him disabled, was able to return to full duty as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">From 1973 to 1978, Arria had <em>averaged </em>12.6 sick days in excess of the fifteen days allotted each year. He, however, had not been subjected to any police department disciplinary proceedings. The Watertown selectmen, after hearing, discharged Arria on October 20,1980. The reasons stated in the town\u2019s notice to Arria of his discharge were: \u201c1. . . . admitted dependence on alcohol and drugs over a period of more than five years .... 2. . . . admitted inability to cope with the stresses and strains of . . . [the] job as a [pjolice [p]atrolman over the last five years . . . . 3. . . . poor attendance and abuse of sick leave during [the] entire period as a [p]atrolman .... 4. . . . [his] record of psychiatric problems . . . determined by a medical panel to be unrelated to . . . employment as a . . . [p]atrolman.\u201d Arria appealed to the Civil Service Commission. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The facts stated in the first two paragraphs of this opinion are those found by the commission\u2019s hearing officer. He also found that as of February 27, 1981, Arria was \u201cnot dependent on drugs or alcohol\u201d and could \u201cperform all the duties of a police officer.\u201d On the basis of his findings, he concluded \u201cthat it would be inappropriate to discharge . . . [Arria] for a condition that is no longer present.\u201d The hearing officer added that, although Arria \u201ctook . . . sick days in excess of those allotted, it was when he was not rested or when he was nervous and unable to perform his job adequately, and hence was not an abuse of sick leave. As these problems are no longer present, in all likelihood, . . . [Arria\u2019s] sick leave in the future should be substantially reduced.\u201d His final conclusion was that the town \u201cdid not have just cause to discharge\u201d Arria, and recommended that Arria be reinstated \u201cwithout loss of compensation or other rights.\u201d On March 5, 1981, the commission adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and reversed the appointing authority\u2019s action \u201cbecause . . . [Arria] was not dependent on drugs at the time of the discharge\u201d and \u201cthere was not any abuse of sick leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The town on June 5, 1981, commenced in the Superior Court this action in the nature of certiorari to review the commission\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 289; <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 90 (1975). See also G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41 to 44, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11; <em>School Committee of Salem </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>348 Mass. 696, 698-699 (1965), and cases cited. Randall &amp; Franklin, Municipal Law \u00a7 358 (1982). A Superior Court judge heard the case on essentially the record now before us (including the proceedings of, and the evidence before, the commission). On cross motions for summary judgment, he reversed the decision of the commission and ordered that the action of the selectmen be affirmed. From the judgment entered in accordance with the judge\u2019s order Arria appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>At the time of the decision of the commission on March 5, 1981, the applicable statute governing its action was G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11 (see now St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 20, approved with an emergency preamble, on January 4, 1982). The second paragraph of \u00a7 43, as here applicable, then read, \u201cThe commission shall affirm the action of the appointing authority <em>if it finds that such action was justified. </em>Otherwise it shall reverse such action and the person concerned shall be returned to his position without loss of compensation or other rights. The commission may also modify any penalty imposed by the appointing authority\u201d (emphasis supplied). The emphasized language has strong tendency to indicate that the question before the commission was not whether it would have acted as the appointing authority had acted, but whether, on the facts found by the commission, there was reasonable justification for the action taken by the appointing authority in the circumstances found by the commission to have existed when the appointing authority made its decision. See <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>359 Mass. 211, 213-217 (1971); <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 205, 208-212 (1979); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 513 (1983). See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist., </em>322 Mass. 566, 572-573 (1948); <em>Cambridge Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 587-589 (1979); <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Ashland, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 739 (1979); <em>Faria </em>v. <em>Third Bristol Div. of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 985, 986 (1982). The <em>Lawrence </em>case, 379 Mass. at 208, and the <em>Murray </em>case, at 511, make clear that in an \u201caction in the nature of certiorari. . . under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4,\u201d a court will correct only \u201csubstantial errors of law apparent on the record adversely affecting material rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We must accept the findings of the commission\u2019s hearing officer as adopted by the commission, if supported by substantial evidence. The question before us is whether those findings show on their face that the commission committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>error of law in deciding that the appointing authority was not justified in discharging Arria.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, we are called on to decide whether Arria\u2019s past very serious problems (as found by the commission) cause the decision to amount to error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The commission\u2019s findings that Arria \u201cwas not dependent on drugs at the time of the discharge\u201d are warranted by the psychiatric testimony in the record. The commission also could reasonably find on the record that Arria\u2019s excessive use of sick leave, presumably resulting in loss of pay at least for days of excessive absences, was only (or principally) on days when he was (by lack of sleep and other consequences of his addiction) in fact unfit to act as an officer. There was testimony of a psychiatrist that Arria\u2019s \u201ccondition had improved to such a degree\u201d that he \u201ccould return to work, carry a gun, and perform all the duties of a policeman.\u201d Other psychiatrists testified to the same effect. There was, however, no express finding by the hearing officer that Ar-ria would no longer have \u201cproblems coping with his job\u201d beyond the general conclusion that \u201che . . . [could] perform all the duties of a police officer.\u201d Arria commendably by the date of the commission\u2019s decision (February 27, 1981) had abandoned his past addictions and conduct. Nevertheless, the findings about Arria\u2019s former conduct, his past drug dependency and use of alcohol, and his excessive past use of sick leave, show that the appointing authority had substantial and very practical reasons for discharging him. On the commission\u2019s findings and those of its hearing officer, there was ample reason for the town to fear a recurrence of Arria\u2019s serious troubles. There was basis in his past conduct for recognizing the grave risk that he would not be in the future a suitable officer. We conclude that the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>decision on its face revealed error of law in failing to recognize that Arria\u2019s past conduct justified the appointing authority\u2019s action, despite the psychiatric testimony that, at the time of the hearing, Arria was cured. The decision improperly forced the town to assume an unreasonable risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> On the commission\u2019s own findings as to Arria\u2019s former drug use and excessive use of alcohol within five years and two years, respectively, of his discharge, he could have been rejected as an applicant tor original appointment under the standards set out in Personnel Memorandum No. 80-4, Aug. 15, 1980, of the Division of Personnel Administration, incorporating by reference \u00a7 XIV of the standards for public service appointments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
