L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 72 and 72A, to bind the defendant over to the Superior Court after his eighteenth birthday, and on the alternative ground that the Juvenile Court findings in support of the transfer were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The defendant was arrested on October 2, 1979, when he was sixteen years and eleven months old,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the crime<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> later charged in the indictment. After the arrest, the Juvenile Court held a probable cause hearing on November 5, 1979, in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61; probable cause was found, and the case was continued for a transfer hearing under \u00a7 61. After several continuances the defendant defaulted on August 12, 1980, when he was seventeen years and nine months old, and was again apprehended on July 22, 1981, when he was eighteen years and eight months old. On August 12, 1981, a transfer hearing was held in the Juvenile Court, pursuant to \u00a7 61, and the judge concluded that the defendant should be bound over to the Superior Court \u201c[bjecause of his age and number of offenses, and because he is not amenable to the Juvenile Justice System.\u201d On the same day a criminal complaint issued and, on September 21, 1981, a grand jury returned the indictment for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In dismissing the indictment the Superior Court judge ruled that the Juvenile Court had no authority over the defendant after he reached his eighteenth birthday. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>judge concluded that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> determined the outcome of the case, and that \u00a7 72A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">1. Section 72 applies to juveniles who commit offenses prior to their seventeenth birthdays but whose cases are not finally adjudicated until the time between their seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays. The last sentence of the section makes clear that it gives no power or authority to the Juvenile Court over persons who have attained their eighteenth birthdays. <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 466, 470-471 (1963). Section 72A, however, grants power and authority to the Juvenile Court over persons who have attained their eighteenth birthdays if they committed offenses prior to their seventeenth birthdays but were not apprehended until after they became eighteen years old. The Superior Court construed the term \u201capprehended\u201d in \u00a7 72A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>to mean the original arrest on the charge and, therefore, concluded that since the defendant had been apprehended prior to his eighteenth birthday, the Juvenile Court had no jurisdiction over him after he became eighteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">If the Superior Court judge\u2019s construction of \u00a7 72A is correct, a gap exists which would require the dismissal of the indictment and result in the defendant\u2019s being free of any possibility of criminal prosecution, a result which would flow directly from his default. This would follow from G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 74, as inserted by St. 1967, c. 787, which provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]o criminal proceeding shall be begun against any person who prior to his seventeenth birthday commits an offense against the law of the commonwealth or who violates any city ordinance or town bylaw, unless proceedings against him as a delinquent child have,been begun and dismissed[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] as required by section sixty-one or seventy-two A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">2. In construing the relevant statutes, we recognize that we cannot fill a gap if the statutes clearly contain such a gap. \u201cIt is the function of the court to construe . . . statute[s] as written and an event or contingency for which no provision is made does not justify judicial legislation.\u201d <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Center, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 151 (1982), quoting <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 547 (1976). See <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 471-472; <em>County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543 (1982). If, however, the language of the statutes is \u201cfairly susceptible to a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result,\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 489 (1941), we will construe them so \u201cas to make [them] . . . effectual piece[s] of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 492 (1932). <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976). See <em>Curran, petitioner, </em>314 Mass. 91, 95 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"Asu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, the Supreme Judicial Court held, in <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. at 472, that a person who as an adult had been bound over to the Superior Court after an invalid Juvenile Court hearing under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, nevertheless came under the independent criminal jurisdiction of the Superior Court. \u201cThe absence of valid juvenile procedures did not deprive the Superior Court of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>D\u2019Urbano, </em>at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 74, as inserted by St. 1948, c. 310, \u00a7 12, as it read at the time of the events in <em>D\u2019Ur-bano, </em>provided: \u201cCriminal proceedings shall not be begun against any <em>child </em>between fourteen and seventeen years of age, except for offences punishable by death, unless proceedings against him as a delinquent child have been begun and dismissed as required by section sixty-one\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>D\u2019Urbano, </em>the court held that this provision was not applicable to D\u2019Urbano because it was \u201cin terms applicable only if the defendant is a child.\u201d <em>D\u2019Urbano, supra </em>at 472. However, \u00a7 74 was amended by St. 1964, c. 308, \u00a7 6, to provide: \u201cCriminal proceedings shall not be begun against any <em>person </em>who prior to his seventeenth birthday commits an offense against the law of the commonwealth or who violates any city ordinance or town by-law, unless proceedings against him as a delinquent child have been begun and dismissed as required by section sixty-one or seventy-two A\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of significance here is the change of \u201cchild\u201d to \u201cperson\u201d and the reference to \u00a7 72A, which was inserted in an earlier section of the same act, St. 1964, c. 308, \u00a7 4. It seems clear that by the insertion of \u00a7 72A and the amendment of \u00a7 74, the Legislature intended that criminal proceedings, with exceptions not here relevant, not be begun against a person of any age who has committed a crime as a juvenile (between the ages of fourteen and seventeen \u2014 \u00a7 61), unless there has been a determination under \u00a7 61 or \u00a7 72A (as will be seen below, using criteria prescribed by \u00a7 61) by the Juvenile Court that such proceedings would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>3. The effect of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, is to provide more beneficial treatment for persons over eighteen years old who commit crimes while under seventeen years old than would be accorded persons who commit crimes after their seventeenth birthdays. Where it applies, \u00a7 72A provides for a hearing which permits the Juvenile Court, in its discretion, the alternative of ordering that the accused be discharged if it is \u201csatisfied that such discharge is consistent with the protection of the public\u201d instead of binding the accused over to the Superior Court. To construe \u00a7 72A liberally, as we must under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> means to construe it, consistent with its terms and the apparent legislative intent, to provide greater inclusiveness of its benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is not, as the defendant contends, a criminal statute to be narrowly or strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 72A applies only when a person is <em>originally </em>apprehended after his eighteenth birthday is based upon the requirement that a probable cause hearing be held after the person is apprehended. Where, as here, the defendant defaulted after his probable cause hearing, his subsequent apprehension could not, according to this argument, be the \u201capprehension\u201d referred to in the statute. This consideration, however, is inconclusive. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended to treat differently, for example, a person who, on the one hand, is origi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>nolly apprehended at age sixteen, escapes from custody or defaults prior to his probable cause hearing, and is apprehended after his eighteenth birthday, and a person who, on the other hand, is originally apprehended at age sixteen, escapes from custody or defaults after his probable cause hearing, and is again apprehended after his eighteenth birthday. In the latter situation, the fact that a probable cause hearing has already been held, preceding an escape or default and prior to subsequent apprehension, does not change the meaning or applicability of the statute. The Legislature could not have intended to bestow a reward for escape or default. We hold that \u00a7 72A was meant to apply to a person such as the defendant, who was originally apprehended before he was seventeen, later defaulted, and then apprehended again on a default warrant after he was eighteen. We thus construe \u201capprehended\u201d as used in \u00a7 72A to mean that a person is taken into custody and available to the Juvenile Court for disposition of the case against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">4. Section 72A expressly makes applicable to the hearing and determination of a case of any person coming within its provisions the requirements of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Under \u00a7 61, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 840, \u00a7 1, a transfer hearing must be held, and a juvenile cannot be bound over to the Superior Court unless the judge enters two written findings, based upon clear and convincing evidence, (1) that \u201cthe child presents significant danger to the public as demonstrated by the nature of the offense charged and the child\u2019s past record of delinquent behavior, if any,\u201d and (2) that the child \u201cis not amenable to rehabilitation as a juvenile.\u201d The second finding is not relevant in terms to a \u00a7 72A determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">To support these written findings, the judge must also consider at least five factors: <em>\u201c(a) </em>the seriousness of the alleged offense; <em>(b) </em>the child\u2019s family, school and social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>history, including his court and juvenile delinquency record, if any; (c) adequate protection of the public; <em>(d) </em>the nature of any past treatment efforts for the child; and <em>(e) </em>the likelihood of rehabilitation of the child\u201d (G.L. c. 119, \u00a7 61), as supplemented by decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court. <em>Two Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 736, 740-741 &amp; n.4 (1980). The first four of the factors are relevant considerations under \u00a7 72A. The fifth factor would be relevant to the extent that the \u201clikelihood of rehabilitation\u201d has a broader application than \u201camenability] to rehabilitation as a juvenile\u201d and includes whatever rehabilitation may have occurred prior to the time of the hearing. Under \u00a7 61, although the judge need not make written findings concerning each of these five factors, there must be \u201csubsidiary findings indicating the basis for his conclusions concerning the two statutorily required findings.\u201d <em>Two Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 741-742.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Here the Juvenile Court judge made the two statutorily required findings (even though the \u201camenable to rehabilitation\u201d finding technically was not relevant to one over eighteen), but his subsidiary findings indicating the basis for his conclusion are deficient. The judge described the defendant\u2019s delinquency record and the nature of the alleged offense. Then he concluded, \u201cThe background and history of this defendant is plainly indicative of continuous recidivistic behavior, the kind and nature of which makes him a continuing danger to the community at large.\u201d There were no findings pertaining to the defendant\u2019s family, school or social history or to the nature of any past treatment efforts (cf. <em>Two Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 743-744), even though, according to the findings of the Superior Court judge, there was \u201cinformation before the [Juvenile Court] from the juvenile\u2019s guidance advisor which demonstrated that the juvenile returned to school and worked part-time while his case was continued for [transfer] proceedings.\u201d The findings of the Juvenile Court judge fall far short of expressing \u201cthe judge\u2019s reasons in fair detail and with logical cohesion.\u201d <em>A Juvenile v. Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 552, 563 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>5. The proper disposition in the circumstances is not dismissal of the indictment but a remand to the Superior Court. See A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), supra </em>at 562-563. Accordingly, we direct the Superior Court to request the Juvenile Court to revise its findings and order of August 12, 1981, in light of the teachings of A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), supra, </em>and <em>Two Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>and the cases cited therein. These steps should be taken promptly. The order dismissing the indictment is reversed. The indictment remains in place provisionally. A <em>Juvenile, </em>380 Mass. at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), supra </em>at 562-563, the Supreme Judicial Court said, \u201cIf it should appear from revised findings that a case for transfer was not made, the [defendant] will be entitled on motion in the Superior Court to a dismissal of the indictment; if adequate revised findings indicate otherwise, the indictment will stand and the case will proceed to trial.\u201d In that case no question was raised as to the application of \u00a7 72A.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Here, under \u00a7 72A the Juvenile Court retains jurisdiction until it has made a valid discharge or bound the defendant over to the Superior Court. Consequently, when this case is sent back to it, the Juvenile Court may either revise its findings in support of its order of August 12, 1981, or order that the defendant be discharged in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 72A. If revised findings are submitted, they may be challenged in the Superior Court by a motion to dismiss the indictment. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 47A. If adequate revised findings support a transfer, the indictment will stand, and the case will proceed to trial. Because the Juvenile Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 72A, a nunc pro tune hearing (see A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth [No. </em>I], <em>supra </em>at 563) is not dictated. The Juvenile Court may consider evidence previously offered, and may hold such hearings as may be appropriate and admit new evidence on the question whether the defendant should be discharged or bound over to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\">The appeal is authorized by G.
