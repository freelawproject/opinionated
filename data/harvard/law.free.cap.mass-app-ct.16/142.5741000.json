(Mobile). DMI is a Massachusetts business trust. Viking, the guarantor, is a Florida corporation, of which Mobile is a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Mobile owned land in Florida. As part of a loan transaction in December, 1973, Mobile delivered in Massachusetts a note to DMI for $650,000, a loan agreement, a security agreement, and a third mortgage interest in the Florida land. Over $600,000 was advanced by DMI on its loan to Mobile. These advances remain unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">On June 4, 1975, judicial foreclosure proceedings were initiated in a Florida Circuit Court by the holder of the first mortgage of Mobile\u2019s Florida land. In 1975, Mobile defaulted in making interest payments on its note to DMI. As the consequence of Mobile\u2019s defaults, two pieces of litigation thus have been conducted, (a) the first mortgage foreclosure proceeding in Florida and (b) this action in Massachusetts by DMI on Viking\u2019s guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A. <em>The Florida First. Mortgage Foreclosure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In the Florida first mortgage foreclosure proceedings, DMI (as third mortgagee), Mobile (as owner), and Viking, the guarantor (as an \u201cinterest holder\u201d), were joined as parties. Viking filed a cross claim against DMI which alleged failure by DMI to advance funds to Mobile to make payments on the first mortgage which Viking contended were required by the 1973 agreement, a loan commitment, and the mortgage. DMI\u2019s original answer to Viking\u2019s Florida cross claim did not assert any counterclaims against Viking. In the Florida proceedings, indeed, no counterclaim based <em>on the guaranty </em>was ever asserted by DMI against Viking. DMI, however, did amend its answer on February 11,1976, to add a counterclaim against Mobile on the note,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>then the Massachusetts action against Viking on its guaranty (not litigated in Massachusetts until 1980 or 1981 and never litigated in Florida) had been initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">After completion of the Florida proceedings summarized in n.l, a so called final judgment was entered on April 14, 1981, in favor of DMI against Mobile on the note in the sum of $759,558.99 plus interest at six percent (reserving jurisdiction with regard to costs).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Florida judgment makes no mention of either Viking, the guarantor, or its guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">B. <em>The Massachusetts Action on the Guaranty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On January 8, 1976, DMI filed in the Superior Court a complaint against Viking, the guarantor, alleging the execution of the note by Mobile in Boston on December 21, 1973 (together with the other instruments already mentioned as then executed). The complaint then alleged (a) the execution of the guaranty by Viking in Massachusetts (see Appendix 1, <em>infra); </em>(b) the advances made by DMI to Mobile based on the note; and (c) Mobile\u2019s subsequent default. Viking filed its answer on March 2, 1976. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Massachusetts action against Viking on the guaranty was brought after the initiation (on June 4, 1975) of the Florida judicial first mortgage foreclosure proceeding, but (as already stated) before the filing (on February 11, 1976) of DMI\u2019s amended answer in the Florida proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On April 15, 1980, DMI filed in the Massachusetts action a motion for summary judgment as to liability only, based upon the Florida judgment entered on October 23, 1978. On June 18, 1980, Viking moved to amend its answer (of March 2, 1976) in the Massachusetts proceedings to aver (essentially as a defense) that in the Florida foreclosure litigation Viking, the guarantor, had \u201cmade a cross claim against\u201d DMI, alleging that DMI had committed a breach of \u201cits obligation to fund certain future advances under the terms of the transaction which included, as an integral part, the guaranty\u201d and that DMI, in response to the cross claim, \u201cmade a counterclaim but failed to state therein a claim on . . . [Viking\u2019s] guaranty.\u201d After hearing, this motion was denied on July 2, 1980, by one Superior Court judge. On July 10,1980, Viking sought leave, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ. P. 15(d), 365 Mass. 762 (1974), to supplement its answer in much the same form as the amendment sought by it on June 18, 1980. This leave was denied on July 29, 1980, by another Superior Court judge. The denials were each without statement of reasons. Of course, no such statement was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Viking on March 25, 1981, filed in this action a motion for summary judgment, supported by an affidavit concerning the Florida proceedings and later by a copy of a document dated April 14, 1981, entitled \u201cFinal Judgment in Accordance with the Mandate of the Second District Court of Appeal,\u201d which (as already stated) made no mention of Viking or its guaranty. DMI thereupon moved to strike Viking\u2019s motion for summary judgment. That motion was denied by a third Superior Court judge. The cross motions for summary judgment were referred to a master who filed a report and recommendation for the guidance of a fourth Superior Court judge (hereafter the motion judge). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>master recommended that summary judgment be entered for DMI on the guaranty, even though, as he viewed the law of Florida, DMI should have raised in the Florida Circuit Court its claim against Viking on the guaranty as a compulsory counterclaim. Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.170(a), Fla. Stat. Ann. (West 1967). The master felt also that no special language of the guaranty prevented \u201cthe application of the compulsory counterclaim rule of law.\u201d Instead, he took the position that \u201cthe earlier decisions of the two Superior Court [j Justices who independently refused to accept . . . [Viking\u2019s] amendment [and supplement] to its answer . . . [raising] for the first time its claim of compulsory counterclaim\u201d had become the \u201claw of the case.\u201d For this view he referred to <em>Saporita </em>v. <em>Litner, </em>371 Mass. 607, 620 (1976), and Mr. Justice Lummus\u2019s article, The \u201cLaw of the Case\u201d in Massachusetts, 9 B.U.L. Rev. 225, 230-231 (1929). Compare <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601-605 (1940). The master did not regard the filing (on April 28, 1981) of the Florida judgment (dated April 14, 1981) in the Superior Court as a sufficient \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d to require disregard of the prior action of two Superior Court judges (who, in effect, did not accept DMI\u2019s failure to assert the guaranty in the Florida proceeding as precluding relief to DMI in Massachusetts on Viking\u2019s guaranty).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The motion judge ordered summary judgment for DMI and denied Viking\u2019s motion for summary judgment, without comment on the master\u2019s recommendation, and also (after receiving a brief from Viking\u201ds counsel and after hearing) denied reconsideration of his order. He then (see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, and Mass.R.Civ.P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 [1974]) reported to this court the issue whether he correctly had allowed DMI\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Viking\u201ds similar motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Viking now contends that, because DMI failed to assert Viking\u2019s liability on the guaranty as a counterclaim against Viking\u2019s cross claim in the Florida foreclosure proceeding, the Florida judgment wholly bars DMI from enforcing the guaranty in Massachusetts. Viking\u2019s position, if supported, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>is that DMI has a valid Florida judgment against Mobile, the maker of the guaranteed note, for $759,558.99 plus interest, which (so far as is shown by this record) may well be worthless, but has no claim in Massachusetts on Viking\u2019s comprehensive guaranty, on which a Massachusetts action was brought long prior to any enforceable judgment against Mobile in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">1. A principal inducement to DMI to make the loan to Mobile must have been the overriding guaranty in which (among other special agreements) Viking consented to enforcement of the guaranty in Massachusetts and appointed the Secretary of the Commonwealth its agent to receive service of process. The consent to be sued in Massachusetts was, of course, in part a submission in advance by Viking, as a Florida corporation, to the jurisdiction of any Massachusetts court. It also may be viewed reasonably as a forum selection agreement to have the guaranty enforced in Massachusetts (see Appendix 1, at [F], [G], and [H]) as an independent obligation (see Appendix 1, at [C]), rather than in a distant jurisdiction by courts in which DMI could litigate much less conveniently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To sustain Viking\u2019s position (which wholly disregards equitable considerations) inevitably would have the unjust effect of causing DMI to lose a principal assurance'of payment, a result not lightly to be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The preclusive effect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of a judgment has been considered recently in Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 22-26 (1980). This revision gives full consideration to procedural rules similar to Mass.R.Civ.P. 13(a), 365 Mass. 758 (1974) and the cognate Florida rule 1.170(a). The Restatement provisions most pertinent in the present case (set out in Appendix 2), especially \u00a7 26(1) (a), recognize that, in appropriate circumstances, a party may consent effectively to the separate litigation of related claims. As noted already, Viking has consented to treatment of the guaranty as an obligation separate from the note of its wholly owned subsidiary (Mobile) and also to being sued on it in Massachusetts. Viking\u2019s consents (in its guaranty) may be taken to have as broad a meaning as the language warrants. The Massachusetts and the Florida actions were pending at the same time, as those acting for Viking well knew. The Florida judgment established (except for costs) Mobile\u2019s liability on its note. It would be unjust in the circumstances to apply rule 13(a) and its Florida equivalent (as well as principles of res judicata) to give that judgment greater effect, as barring completion of the Massachusetts action on the independent guaranty, simply because the Florida action was the first to be reduced to final judgment. Viking also has failed (at least from January 8, 1976, to June 18, 1980) to object with promptness in the Massachusetts action to DMI\u2019s decision to sue in the Commonwealth. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Andover, </em>378 Mass. 370, 374-375 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>237 F. Supp. 439, 444-445 (S.D. N.Y. 1965). Compare also <em>Genesco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Koufman, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 986, 990 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Viking\u2019s consents and conduct seem to us to justify refusal to recognize here any bar which might otherwise result from the Florida judgment, even if DMI (giving weight only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to the interests of judicial economy rather than also taking into account equitable considerations) should have asserted the guaranty as a compulsory counterclaim in Florida. No decision in Massachusetts (related to rule 13) brought to our attention seems to require any different result.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Because we rely primarily on Viking\u2019s consent to a separate action in Massachusetts on the independent guaranty,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we need not decide whether Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.170(a) required DMI to assert its claim on the guaranty against Viking as a counterclaim to Viking\u2019s Florida cross claim against DMI. In view, however, of the uncertainties about what counterclaims are compulsory, assertion of the guaranty as a counterclaim certainly would have been the cautious and prudent course for DMI to have followed. See Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 79, at 530-531 (4th ed. 1983); 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, par. 13.12[1], at 13-55 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Various Florida cases suggest a broad construction of its compulsory counterclaim rule. See, e.g., <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Mit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>chell, </em>42 So. 2d 53, 54-55 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1949); <em>Pesce </em>v. <em>Linaido, </em>123 So. 2d 747, 749 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1960); <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Little River Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>228 So. 2d 412, 413-415 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1969). Compare <em>Cheezem, Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Maddox Roof Serv., Inc., </em>362 So. 2d 99 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1978). See also <em>Travelers Exp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>397 So. 2d 733, 736-738 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981). Other Florida cases may indicate some unwillingness on the part of the Florida courts to apply the full measure of the compulsory counterclaim principle in cases where the unasserted claim has at least a reasonable basis in an independent obligation of the person against whom the claim is asserted. See <em>Quarngesser </em>v. <em>Appliance Buyers Credit Corp., </em>187 So. 2d 662, 664 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1966), treating a joint and several guaranty by two coguarantors as establishing liabilities independent of each other; <em>First Natl. Bank v. Freedman, </em>244 So. 2d 183, 184-187 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1971), where a judgment, obtained for interest due on a demand note, was held not to preclude a later action for the principal of that note which was due already when the first action was initiated; <em>Fewox </em>v. <em>Tallahassee Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>249 So. 2d 55, 57-58 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1971), which seems to recognize in some degree the independent liability of a guarantor upon a separate guaranty. The authorities just cited leave uncertainty concerning whether a separate action on Viking\u2019s guaranty would be regarded even in Florida as within the purview of Fla.R. Civ. P. 1.170(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Rules like Mass.R.Civ.P. 13(a) and Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.170(a) may operate harshly to deny relief to a party to a proceeding in which judgment has been entered, upon a new claim against another party to that earlier proceeding, if the new claim is regarded as a compulsory counterclaim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>harshness has been perceived by text writers in various applications of Federal rule 13(a) and has led to some recognition that, in the administration of rules like rule 13(a), there must be reasonable flexibility in order to accomplish the fundamental purpose of combining related claims in one action in the interest of judicial economy while at the same time accomplishing a just result.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 6 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1417 &amp; 1418, particularly at 98-108 (1971 &amp; Supp. 1982). See also <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1412; 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, pars. 13.12[1]-13.14-1 (2d ed. 1983); IB <em>id. </em>pars. 0.405[12], 0.410[1], 0.410[2] (2d ed. 1982 &amp; Supp. 1982-1983); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice, \u00a7 13.24 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">2. We turn now to the ground relied on by the master in the Superior Court in his recommendations. The precise limits of the principle of \u201claw of the case\u201d are indefinite. To the extent that the principle is relied on here, it is presumably in the sense that \u201ca court cannot be compelled, at the will of a party, to hear anew an interlocutory matter, once decided, where no material change in the situation has occurred.\u201d See Mr. Justice Lummus\u2019s article, 9 B.U.L.Rev. at 230-231. The author there (at 231-236) comes close to treating \u201claw of the case\u201d as a largely discretionary doctrine, available to prevent repetitive efforts to obtain interlocutory relief on issues once decided. In <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hop-son, </em>306 Mass. at 599-605, also, Mr. Justice Lummus, speaking for the Supreme Judicial Court, gave this aspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the doctrine little more weight than the opportunity to exercise a controlled judicial discretion. See <em>In re Exterior Siding &amp; Aluminum Coil Antitrust Litigation, </em>696 F.2d 613, 614-618 (8th Cir. 1982), \u00e1nd the discussion in IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, pars. 0.404[1]-0.404[4] (2d ed. 1982 &amp; Supp. 1982-1983). See also <em>Coolidge Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>First Ipswich Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1981). We think that, in effect, the motion judge (although not compelled to treat as binding the rulings of the first Superior Court judges) has exercised reasonably whatever discretion he had under \u201claw of the case\u201d principles in favor of permitting DMI to recover in Massachusetts upon Viking\u2019s independent guaranty. See <em>Saporita </em>v. <em>Litner, </em>371 Mass. at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">3. The question reported for decision by the motion judge must be answered that he correctly (a) allowed DMI\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and (b) denied Viking\u2019s similar motion. Any other result would raise serious questions whether the application of rule 13(a) and related principles of bar had not resulted in a serious miscarriage of justice (see note 8, <em>supra). </em>The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Appendix 1</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">GUARANTY [BY VIKING]</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">(All emphasis supplied.

The section also recognizes that what facts will constitute a \u201ctransaction\u201d must be determined pragmatically and in accordance with business usage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The Florida trial court initially on June 4, 1976, found for DMI against Mobile on the note but awarded to Viking, the guarantor, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Mobile a substantially larger sum on the cross claim against DMI. On October 28, 1977, this judgment was reversed on appeal. <em>Diversified Mortgage Investors </em>v. <em>Viking Gen. Corp., </em>351 So. 2d 734 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1977). Mobile did not appeal the judgment for DMI against it on the note, so that the net result of the appeal was to establish a liability of Mobile to DMI on the note and a determination in favor of DMI on Viking\u2019s cross claim. Judgment accordingly was entered on October 23, 1978, in the Florida Circuit Court. After revision (on June 13, 1979) of the judgment of October 23,1978, in the Florida Circuit Court, that 1979 revised judgment itself was vacated by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal by opinion dated July 29, 1980, and the order for judgment of October 23, 1978, was ordered reinstated. After further proceedings in the Florida courts which need not be stated in detail, the Supreme Court of Florida declined on February 12, 1981, further review of the decisions of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> Mobile\u2019s note required the payment by Mobile and its successors in interest of court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The guaranty extends to all sums due by reason of the note and loan documents. See <em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Hoss, </em>356 Mass. 331, 335-336 (1969). The full amount due on the guaranty thus cannot be determined finally until all the litigation, both in Massachusetts and Florida, is completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\"> DMI had a reasonable interest (see 6 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1409, at 38 [1971]) in not being forced \u201cto litigate every one of . . . [its] claims ... in a forum chosen and at a time dictated by\u201d Viking. Here, even if the parties have not selected Massachusetts as the exclusive forum in which to litigate the guaranty, Viking at least has consented to its being litigated here, and DMI may well have regarded it as the agreed forum. See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 80 (1969 &amp; opp. 1980 &amp; Supp. 1982) and the comprehensive citation of authorities in Chief Justice Burger\u2019s opinion in <em>The Bremen </em>v. <em>Zapata OffShore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 3-20 (1972).

See comment g &amp; illustration 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">See <em>Wright Mach. Corp. </em>v. <em>Seaman-Andwall Corp., </em>364 Mass. 683, 685 n. 1 (1974), where guarantors were not involved in Massachusetts proceedings and no questions at issue here were clearly presented, but see <em>id. </em>at 688-695. Compare decisions wholly or partly based on pre-1974 law: <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>367 Mass. 424, 426-431 (1975); <em>Osserman </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>369 Mass. 200, 204-206 (1975); <em>Volpe Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 40-41 (1973). <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 863 (1983), involves questions of claim splitting (without the consent of the defendants) only with respect to injuries and damages arising from a single automobile accident and has no relevance to suits upon a separate guaranty and upon the guaranteed obligation. No question of consent to an independent action on an independent obligation was involved in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Inv. Counsel of Boston, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 444, 448-449 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-12\"> The circumstance that the guaranty was in an independent instrument and not by endorsement on the note (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-416; Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 673.3-416 [West 1966]) may be of significance as emphasizing the independent character of this guaranty. See <em>Fewox </em>v. <em>Tallahassee Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>249 So. 2d 55, 57-58 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1971).

The Massachusetts rule, like the comparable provision of the Federal rule, has been employed on occasion to determine with flexibility the application of the rules to particular facts to avoid a miscarriage of justice.
