The issue before us is the interpretation of a provision in the parties\u2019 separation agreement, reading that document as a whole and in the light of rele-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>vont Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement and all the evidence before the probate judge are before us. We apply our own interpretation of the separation agreement to the subsidiary facts found by the judge (as distinguished from certain conclusions drawn by him, we think erroneously, from his subsidiary findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The parties were married in 1950. They have had two children, one born in 1956 and one born in 1958. Bell was in 1975 a vice president of a substantial company. Mrs. Bell then was unemployed. Differences arose between Mrs. Bell and Bell. By 1976 they had been separated for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On April 26, 1976, the parties entered into a separation agreement. By its terms Bell (subject to arbitration in the event of a substantial decline in his gross income) was to pay (as alimony for tax purposes) significant monthly amounts for the support of Mrs. Bell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These payments were to decrease in amount over fifteen years following the entry of final judgment of divorce and were to \u201cterminate upon the happening of the following contingencies: (1) the [wjife\u2019s death, (2) the [wjife\u2019s remarriage, and ... (3) [the wjife\u2019s living together with a member of the opposite sex, so as to give the outward appearance of marriage at any time prior to May 1, 1981, whichever of the . . . three . . . contingencies happens first.\u201d For convenience the preceding sub-paragragh (3), is hereafter sometimes referred to as \u201cthe disputed language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>A judgment nisi of divorce was entered as of November 28, 1975. This judgment incorporated the separation agreement, specifically stating that the \u201c[ajgreement shall survive this judgment and have independent significance.\u201d Bell has married again since the judgment became absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On April 8, 1981, Mrs. Bell filed this contempt complaint. Bell answered contending that his obligation to support Mrs. Bell had terminated because she was \u201cliving together with a member of the opposite sex so as to give the outward appearance of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Following a trial the probate judge dismissed Mrs. Bell\u2019s contempt complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She has appealed. The judge made subsidiary findings of fact essentially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">(a) Mrs. Bell resided at the Gohasset house (see note 2 <em>supra) </em>until March, 1978. That spring she spent some time at the Gohasset house and some time at the one-bedroom Boston apartment of a man referred to in the record as J.R. From June, 1978, to October, 1979, she lived in J.R.\u2019s apartment except for a total of three weeks spent \u201cwith her daughter on an irregular basis.\u201d From October, 1979, through June, 1980, she stayed in the Gohasset house on a sporadic basis but \u201cfor the most part\u201d stayed at J.R.\u2019s apartment. She sold the Gohasset house on April 1, 1980, and had removed her belongings by June, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">(b) The apartment lease stands solely in J.R.\u2019s name. Mrs. Bell\u2019s name does not appear in the lease or on the mailbox or the door. The monthly rent ($450) and utilities (except for Mrs. Bell\u2019s long distance calls, which she has paid) are paid by J.R. From June, 1978, through May, 1981, she \u201ccohabited with J.R.\u201d at the apartment. She \u201cpurchased all of the food and did most of the cooking and cleaning.\u201d Part of the furniture at the apartment is hers. Part belongs solely to J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>(c) Mrs. Bell and J.R. \u201chave always maintained separate bank accounts, checking accounts, and investments.\u201d They have never commingled assets or held joint bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">(d) Until June, 1980, Mrs. Bell remained a member of a club in Cohasset. During this time she took J.R. there as her guest about once a month for tennis and social functions. He reciprocated by taking her as his guest to clubs to which he belongs. After June, 1980, she reimbursed him for half the bills incurred by him for taking her to his clubs as his guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">(e) Mrs. Bell has never maintained a mail address at J.R.\u2019s apartment. She received mail at Cohasset until she sold the house in 1980. Thereafter she received mail in care of her employer until her employment (apparently obtained after the divorce) was terminated on January 31, 1981. Since then she has received mail at a post office box.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(f) She and J.R., in addition to playing golf and tennis and dining together, have played bridge together about twice a week, occasionally at clubs \u201cprescribed by\u201d a national contract bridge league. They have taken trips together. She has paid one-half of the costs of each trip. They have given cocktail parties together and attended such parties together. At no time has Mrs. Bell represented to any third party that she was married to J.R. nor has she ever used his surname.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The probate judge concluded that, as of February 1, 1981, Mrs. Bell \u201chad established a permanent relationship with J.R.\u201d and \u201cwas habitually residing with . . . [him] in a life style which would lead a reasonable person to believe that they were living in a marital relationship\u201d and that their \u201cconduct . . . gave the outward appearance of marriage.\u201d The judge also concluded that Mrs. Bell as of Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ruary 1, 1981, \u201cwas receiving a measure of support from J.R. by virtue of his paying the rent and utilities and that continued alimony paid by\u201d Bell \u201cwould, to a certain extent, provide\u201d Mrs. Bell \u201cwith overlapping support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The probate judge, in addition to drawing conclusions from his subsidiary findings as just indicated, made rulings of law (1) that the \u201crelationship [of Mrs. Bell and J.R.] is sufficient to create an outward appearance of marriage\u201d; (2) that the language about \u201coutward appearance of marriage\u201d relates to Mrs. Bell\u2019s conduct and the \u201cobjective nature of the relationship and does not depend on whether . . . third persons are led to believe in the existence of a ceremonial marriage\u201d; (3) that the disputed language of the agreement does not require Bell to prove that Mrs. Bell represented to third persons that she and J.R. were married; and (4) that Mrs. Bell has forfeited her right to alimony under the agreement after February 1, 1981, because to rule otherwise would permit an ex-wife to receive support from another man and still compel her ex-husband to pay alimony by simply refraining from any formal marriage ceremony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">1. Massachusetts does not recognize common law marriage. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Misiano, </em>373 Mass. 261, 262-263 (1977), holding that, despite \u201c[cjohabitation [with a man] within the Commonwealth, a woman has no right to receive sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>port\u201d from him, absent a formal solemnization of marriage. See also <em>Heistand </em>v. <em>Heistand, </em>384 Mass. 20, 24-26 (1981). Compare <em>Glazer v. Silverman, </em>354 Mass. 177, 179-181 (1968), and <em>Ruquist </em>v. <em>Ruquist, </em>367 Mass. 662, 664-667 (1975), in each of which, on balance, special equitable considerations (not present here) were deemed sufficient to justify sustaining the trial judge\u2019s termination of support provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Certainly, unless perhaps by some contractual arrangement, Mrs. Bell could not obtain in Massachusetts the right to support from J.R. without assuming the obligations to him involved in a ceremonial marriage. The evidence shows that she was expecting no support from J.R. and asserting no claim to it. Instead she was attempting to pay her reasonable share of their joint expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">2. No Massachusetts case dealing with a provision precisely like the disputed language has been called to our attention. See as to somewhat related problems, <em>Surabian </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>362 Mass. 342, 346 (1972), and cases cited. See also <em>Gerrig </em>v. <em>Sneirson, </em>344 Mass. 518, 520-521 (1962); Lombard, Family Law \u00a7\u00a7 1265, 1351, 2245 (1967 and Supp. 1981). An annotation in 98 A.L.R.Sd 453 (1980) deals (see n.6 at 457) primarily with the effect upon alimony of an ex-wife\u2019s conduct after the divorce judgment where there is either no separation agreement or the agreement is merged in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">When the Bells\u2019 separation agreement is read as a whole, one probable meaning of the disputed language becomes apparent. As the <em>Surabian </em>case indicates, the death or remarriage of Mrs. Bell, by the express terms of the separation agreement, would have terminated her right to alimony. Actual remarriage presumably would have given her a \u201cright to be supported by another man.\u201d See <em>Southworth </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>168 Mass. 511, 512-513 (1897). The disputed language appears in the same sentence of the separation agreement as the provisions concerning death and remarriage (both circumstances in which Mrs. Bell would have no further need for support). This we regard as strong indication that, where there is a continuing need for a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>support, that need should be a primary consideration in interpreting and applying the disputed language.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The disputed language also must be read in connection with other provisions of the separation agreement. It was expressly recited that, although Mrs. Bell (in 1975) had an unstated amount of \u201cassets standing in her own name,\u201d she was \u201cprimarily dependent on the [hjusband for her care, support and maintenance.\u201d There also was an explicit general provision that \u201cneither the [hjusband nor the [wjife will hereafter interfere with the personal liberty of the other, and each may lead his or her life free from any criticism or restraint by the other.\u201d The purpose of the entire agreement was stated in part as \u201cto settle the [hjusband\u2019s obligation arising out of the marital relationship to support and maintain the [wjife\u201d as set forth in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The predominant interest of the wife plainly was in making certain that she would have the support reasonable for her to expect from a business executive of some standing to whom by 1975 she had been married for a quarter of a century and whose children she had raised. Nothing about her expense-sharing arrangement with J.R. indicates any consequent diminution in her need for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The provision that neither Bell nor Mrs. Bell would interfere with the other\u2019s liberty to lead his or her life free of restraint is plainly inconsistent with any effort by Bell to control her life-style. That life-style was for her to determine, free from his coercion. It may well be that her avoidance of further legally binding marital commitments in some degree was and is based on her earlier experience with marriage. In any event, the provision (for noninterference) leads us to interpret the disputed language as calling for a cessation of alimony only upon remarriage or in circumstances so closely like marriage as to result in Mrs. Bell acquiring significant actual support or a new right to support from a man prior to the specified date in 1981. Obviously Bell (who has remarried) was under no economic coercion, based on the separation agreement, not to remarry or even to refrain from less binding arrangements. On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>hand, the threat or fear of loss of alimony could well be coercive of the arrangements made by Mrs. Bell.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">3. In our opinion, the probate judge was clearly in error (both on the evidence and on his own subsidiary findings) in certain of his conclusions and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">(a) We regard as without basis in his subsidiary findings or in the evidence the judge\u2019s conclusions that Mrs. Bell was receiving \u201ca measure of support\u201d from J.R. The judge had found that, although J.R. alone paid the apartment rent of $450 per month and some utility expenses, Mrs. Bell purchased all the food and did most of the cooking and cleaning. With food costs current since the date of the agreement, it appears from the evidence that Mrs. Bell was contributing approximately as much as J.R. toward their joint living costs. If it be relevant, precise or even substantial equality of sharing expenses could not be expected reasonably in such an informal situation even from a woman apparently determined (as the evidence strongly suggests) to pay her own way in a relationship which involved no permanent commitment or ceremonial marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">(b) We think it immaterial whether persons who did not know her may have thought that Mrs. Bell was married to J.R. It was not a matter with which strangers reasonably should have concern.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is an era when, as various decisions indicate (see the cases cited in note 9, <em>infra), </em>we are compelled to recognize that, for a variety of reasons, a significant number of couples will and do live together without the benefits and burdens of ceremonial marriage. The circumstances of Mrs. Bell\u2019s unobtrusive and inconspicuous ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>pense-sharing arrangement in the substantial anonymity of urban apartment life cannot be appraised reasonably by what strangers would or may have thought about it.* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As stated above, there was no evidence whatsoever that Mrs. Bell ever held herself out as J.R.\u2019s wife to any person (whether or not they knew her). See <em>Northrup </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>43 N.Y. 2d 566, 570-573 (1978). Compare <em>O\u2019Connor Bros. Abalone Co. </em>v. <em>Brando, </em>40 Cal. App. 3d 90, 95 (1974). Contrast <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>53 Cal. App. 3d 852, 856-861 (1975), which viewed the statute there discussed as involving \u201cholding out\u201d to the general public and not merely to persons who knew the couple. The <em>Northrup </em>case is based largely upon the provisions of a pertinent New York statute, N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 248 (see now McKinney 1977). Whether, however, there is \u201cholding out\u201d by a woman that she is married, to persons having an interest in inquiring about her status (or at least in fact inquiring), may be, in our opinion, a consideration in determining whether there exists the outward appearance of marriage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In the light of the foregoing discussion and of our interpretation of the disputed language, we perceive on this record no basis for the termination of Mrs. Bell\u2019s alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>4. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We think (essentially as did the probate judge) that this is a case in which costs in the trial court and on appeal should be shared evenly and in which each party should bear the reasonable counsel fees incurred by him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> We refrain from stating any views concerning the conduct of any person involved in this matter. Any such views would be completely immaterial to the issue of interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> The Bells owned in 1976, as tenants by the entirety, a house in Cohasset worth $114,000, subject to a mortgage of about $36,000. They owned jointly certain savings accounts \u00e1nd securities. The agreement made an allotment of property to Mrs. Bell, including a transfer to her of (a) the Cohasset house (subject to the mortgage), (b) its tangible contents, (c) certain other specified tangibles, and (d) their joint accounts and their jointly held security accounts. The husband was to pay to her $100,000 on the entry of final judgment of divorce. It is not contended in this case that Bell failed to carry out these other provisions of the separation agreement which were to take effect upon the completion of the original divorce proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\"> He also dismissed with prejudice a counterclaim filed by Bell seeking to recover amounts of alimony theretofore paid by him, and entered an order that Bell and Mrs. Bell were to pay their own costs and counsel fees. No appeal was claimed by Bell from the dismissal of his counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"><em> </em>The probate judge found, after hearing Mrs. Bell\u2019s testimony (and we, after reading that testimony agree) that Mrs. Bell \u201cdid not, at any time, conceal her cohabitation with J.R. either from the court or from Bell.\u201d Certainly her testimony, as we read it, was marked by candor and showed no attempt to conceal or distort any conduct even if it might turn out to be adverse to her present contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> The judge also ruled, perhaps in too expansive terms, that it was permissible to receive extrinsic testimony concerning the disputed language of the separation agreement, which he regarded as ambiguous, \u201cas an aid to construing the contract and the intent of the parties.\u201d He received testimony from the attorney who represented Bell in negotiating the separation agreement. Mrs. Bell\u2019s former attorney had died before the time of trial. We do not give weight to Bell\u2019s former attorney\u2019s somewhat inconclusive testimony so far as it relates to that attorney\u2019s <em>purpose </em>in requesting the insertion of the disputed language. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 385-392 (5th ed. 1981). See also <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Svenson, </em>373 Mass. 273, 275 (1977). Cf. <em>McKelvy </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>370 Mass. 328, 334-335 (1978). We regard his testimony as helpful only as it discloses some background of the negotiations, by showing that the insertion of the disputed language was requested by Bell\u2019s former attorney, and that the suggestion in some respects was objected to by Mrs. Bell\u2019s then counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> Questions of policy, perhaps strengthened by the Equal Rights Amendment (art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments [1976]) may set limits on the use by a spouse of undue financial or other pressure to impose a given life pattern upon the other spouse after termination of the marital relationship. Such questions do not arise on the interpretation of the disputed language here adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> The probate judge\u2019s conclusion that the disputed language relates to the \u201cobjective nature of the relationship and does not depend on whether . . . third persons are led to believe in the existence of a ceremonial mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>riage\u201d may be internally inconsistent. It, however, tends to recognize that it is irrelevant what strangers to Mrs. Bell and J.R. may think on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> The probate judge interpreted the disputed language \u201cas intended to prevent the elimination of alimony in the event that. . . [Mrs. Bell] subsequent to her divorce, lived with a relative or took in a boarder\u201d or \u201cin the event. . . [she] lived with another man for a short or insubstantial period of time, as opposed to a protracted period of time.\u201d We reject this interpretation. It implies the unlikely intention that, although there would be no cessation of alimony if she engaged in brief, casual, or promiscuous affairs, alimony must cease if she participates in a more stable, more sedate, and longer expense-sharing arrangement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"> See other New York decisions, e.g., <em>Stern </em>v. Stern, 88 Misc. 2d 860, 864 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1976); <em>Citron </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>91 Misc. 2d 785, 788 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1977). See also <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>79 Misc. 2d 149, 151 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1973). Compare <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>53 Cal.

In my view the majority ignore the plain language of the agreement. The plaintiff by living with J.R. in what the judge found to be \u201ca permanent and enduring relationship\u201d and by socializing, eating meals, taking trips, and attending functions with J.R. was \u201cliving together with a member of the opposite sex, so as to give the outward appearance of marriage.\u201d The majority place heavy emphasis on the amount of support received by Mrs. Bell and conclude that the disputed clause would not operate to terminate her right to alimony unless she became entitled to receive support from a man (part 1 of the majority opinion leaves unclear just how that can be accomplished without a marriage) or acquired \u201csignificant actual support\u201d from a man. While arrangements for support might in some cases be a factor to consider in determining whether there was an \u201coutward appearance of marriage,\u201d in the typical case, the arrangement for support or the payment of expenses would be a private matter having little bearing on outward appearances. There is no evidence in the record before us that they were treated otherwise by Mrs. Bell and J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In the instant case, all of the critical factors of a marital relationship were present. While Mrs. Bell may have carefully avoided representing that she was married to J.R., she enjoyed what was essentially a marital type relationship with him. She cannot now avoid the financial consequences of those actions by relying on factors such as the main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tenance of a separate mailing address or the failure to sign the lease, which did not affect the basic character of their relationship. The avoidance of a change of name by Mrs. Bell, the couples non-use of \u201cMr. and Mrs.,\u201d and their use of separate bank accounts are practices followed by many married couples. If such formalities are to be given the effect of precluding, as matter of law, a finding that Mrs. Bell\u2019s living arrangement gave the outward appearance of marriage, the clause in question \u2014 not uncommon in separation agreements \u2014 will as a practical matter be nullified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
