L. c. 265, \u00a7 17, and rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), following a trial in the Superior Court before a judge without a jury and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. He challenges the sufficiency of the colloquy conducted by the judge concerning waiver of his right to trial by jury, claiming that it failed to meet the standards set forth in <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504 (1979). Schofield also asserts that the record fails to show a voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to a trial by jury. A majority (hereafter \u201cwe\u201d) of the panel agrees with the first contention and concludes that a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The evidence of the crimes was uncontradicted. Approximately 1:00 a.m. on December 10, 1980, Schofield entered a Brockton bar which was deserted except for a woman tending bar. After consuming two drinks, he raped the woman at knifepoint and took money from her clothing and from the cash register. Schofield\u2019s wallet, hidden at the scene by the victim after it fell from his coat during the rape, led to his arrest later that same morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Schofield claimed insanity and three psychiatrists presented expert testimony on that question. All three agreed that Schofield believed that he had been possessed by the devil or by evil spirits, that he had heard \u201cvoices\u201d commanding him to do evil things, and that the \u201cvoices\u201d had commanded him during the commission of the crimes. The experts differed on the issue of criminal responsibility. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert concluded that Schofield had a borderline personality disorder, somewhere \u201cbetween neurosis and a psychosis,\u201d but was legally responsible. The two defense experts found him to be mentally ill at the time of the incident and not responsible for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">At the commencement of the trial, the judge conducted a colloquy, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concerning Schofield\u2019s decision to waive trial by jury. The initial question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>whether the colloquy satisfied the requirements of <em>Ciummei </em>v. Commonwealth, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In Ciummei, the Supreme Judicial Court held that, to be adequate to sustain a conviction, a waiver of the right to a trial by jury requires not only compliance with those provisions calling for a written waiver by the defendant, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 19(a), 378 Mass. 888 (1979); G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A(g); G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6, but also a colloquy in which \u201cthe judge will advise the defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial, and will satisfy himself that any waiver by the defendant is made voluntarily and intelligently.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Ciummei, supra </em>at 509. The <em>Ciummei </em>colloquy requirement is premised on the concepts that the right to trial by jury is fundamental to our system of justice and that the right can only be waived by a conscious and deliberate decision of the defendant himself. See <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>281 U.S. 276, 288-290, 312 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">By way of illustration, and with an express disavowal of any \u201cinten[t] to create a rigid pattern,\u201d the court in <em>Cium-mei </em>noted that <em>\u201cwhere a defendant needs a compendious reminder, the judge might state </em>that the jury consists of members of the community, that the defendant may participate in their selection, that the verdict of the jury must be unanimous, that they decide guilt or innocence while the judge makes rulings of law in the course of the trial, instructs the jury on the law, and imposes sentence in case of guilt, and that, where a jury is waived, the judge alone decides guilt or innocence in accordance with the facts and the law.\u201d <em>Cium-mei, supra </em>at 509-510 (emphasis added). It is without question the better practice to cover in the colloquy all of the attributes of the jury trial and the important distinctions between jury and jury-waived trials which are enumerated in <em>Ciummei. </em>We reject, however, the notion that the failure of a colloquy exhaustively to survey the field implies failure of the colloquy itself. It is by now axiomatic that \u201cwhether or not there is an intelligent, competent, self-protecting waiver of jury trial by an accused must depend upon the unique circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 278 (1942). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dietrich, </em>381 Mass. 458, 460 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">This principle, however, implies the corollary, expressly acknowledged in <em>Ciummei, </em>that \u201cthe judge\u2019s responsibility should not be \u2018discharged as a mere matter of rote,\u2019 but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>rather \u2018with sound and advised discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Ciummei, supra </em>at 510 (quoting from <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 312). The hypostasis of the <em>Ciummei </em>decision is the directive that the judge, through the procedure of the colloquy, advise the defendant of the right of jury trial and \u201csatisfy himself that [the] waiver ... is made voluntarily and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. The judge need not rely on any particular formula for the required dialogue, and in determining the detail of the interrogation which is necessary in a particular case he may consider (as we cannot) the defendant\u2019s demeanor, attentiveness and apparent perception in answering questions which are put to him. The judge\u2019s determination is not likely to be disturbed simply because the colloquy involved less than an exhaustive description of the ramifications of the defendant\u2019s decision, <em>provided </em>(and this is the crucial point) that the dialogue is sufficient to furnish the judge with the information necessary to warrant findings that the defendant is (1) aware of the differences between jury and jury-waived trials;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that he has not been coerced or improperly influenced in his decision; and (3) that he is, at the time of the waiver, capable of rational judgment. Not to be disregarded either, is <em>Ciummeis </em>explicit direction that the necessary solemnization of the waiver appear through a \u201cclear record.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The difficulty in this case lies in the first finding. There is absolutely no indication in the colloquy that Schofield was likely aware of the factors, set out in <em>Ciummei, </em>which distinguish the two forms of trial, particularly the critical information that the defendant has a voice in selecting the jurors and that their verdict must be unanimous. This deficiency is not remedied elsewhere in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>colloquy initially fails to elicit responses which indicate the requisite awareness, then the defendant \u201cneeds a compendious reminder,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 510, and must be informed of the relevant factors by the judge. No such reminder was furnished Schofield. We conclude that Schofield cannot be said to have \u201cindicated a comprehension of the nature of the choice\u201d, <em>ibid., </em>by his answers to the questions put by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant waived his right to a more complete <em>Ciummei </em>colloquy when his counsel responded in the negative upon being asked by the judge if he (counsel) desired additional questions to be asked of the defendant. The argument is unsound. The underlying rationale of <em>Ciummei </em>is that without the colloquy the trial judge\u2019s task of determining the validity of the jury waiver may be problematical. To allow waiver of the colloquy would deprive the court of the most effective means of testing the defendant\u2019s comprehension of his decision and safeguarding his interest in the right of jury trial, which is one of constitutional dimension. Submission to the colloquy procedure involves no counterbalancing \u201crisk\u201d to the defendant. We hold that it cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The argument that because waiver of jury trial involves a tactical decision to a defendant may be assumed to have discussed with his lawyer all possible strategic benefits of a jury trial (including the right of participation in jury selection and the unanimity requirement) presents a similar red herring. Of course, waiver of jury trial involves a tactical judgment. But to assume that, in discussing strategy, counsel will always cover all the important factors assumes too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>much. Such an assumption swallows the rule and would, for all practical purposes, render the <em>Ciummei </em>decision nugatory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We have considered the possibility of remanding the case to ascertain whether Schofield\u2019s counsel covered the necessary information, mindful, however, that in cases involving near total abrogation of the colloquy procedure we have on prior occasions simply ordered new trials. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 974 (1983);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abreu, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 1006 (1983). As previously noted, the <em>Ciummei </em>court emphasized (at 509) that there must be a \u201cclear record\u201d of the waiver before the trial commences. In view of this admonition, and considering the difficulties inherent in retrospectively determining the validity of a waiver upon an unrecorded consultation between lawyer and client held some time ago, we think the remand approach unwise. Because the sufficient basis required by <em>Ciummei </em>for determining the waiver\u2019s validity is not present, we conclude that Schofield must be given a new trial on the two indictments before us. We do so unhappily because the effort to have a meaningful colloquy was assiduous and in all other respects the trial was soundly managed and fair. Having so decided, we find it unnecessary to reach the defendant\u2019s remaining argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The judgments on indictment no. 74964 and indictment no. 74967 are reversed and the findings on those indictments are set aside. The defendant is to be retried on both indictments before a jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> The court: \u201cMr. Schofield, my name is Zobel and I\u2019m the Justice of the Superior Court who\u2019s going to be trying this case.

Trial of this case commenced on January 25,1982. We note that <em>Ciummei\u2019s </em>requirements were subsequently extended to jury trials in the District Court, see <em>Costarelli, petitioner, </em>378 Mass. 516 (1979); District Court Supp.R.Crim.P. 2 (1981), to cases in the District Court in which a defendant chooses to forgo his right to a jury trial by admitting to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of not guilty, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834 (1982), and to the withdrawal of appeals in the jury session of the District Court, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 488 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">Because the \u201cnew requirement\u201d announced in <em>Ciummei </em>was expressly \u201cmade completely prospective,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 511, it was not applied in the</p>\n<p id=\"Axp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Ciummei </em>case itself. The jury waiver by <em>Ciummei, </em>a person evidencing \u201csome retardation,\u201d but determined to be \u201caware of his current legal situation and able to cooperate with his attorney in a rational way,\u201d was upheld based on his multiple discussions with counsel on the matter, counsel\u2019s \u201ccareful and conscientious\u201d explanations and Ciummei\u2019s previous court experience. <em>Id. </em>at 513-514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> This information may be imparted to the defendant by his counsel and may be impressed on the record at the time of the waiver by appropriate questions either to counsel or the defendant about the content of counsel\u2019s explanation of the jury right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> We perceive no restraint which prohibits an appellate court from examining the record outside the colloquy for indications that the defendant in fact had the knowledge requisite to an intelligent waiver, thereby per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mitting the application of a \u201charmless error\u201d analysis to any deficiency in the colloquy. Such knowledge might be inferred, for example, from a clear showing in the record that a defendant had been previously tried before a jury. We have conducted an independent review of Schofield\u2019s prior criminal record. That record, although showing his prior sentences for serious offenses, indicates that he has never been tried before a jury or waived a jury before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> Indeed if the assumption were valid the entire colloquy could be limited to two questions addressed to the defendant: (1) Have you discussed waiver of jury with your counsel?, and (2) Are you satisfied with your counsel\u2019s advice? As to the propriety of an approach not unlike this, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 974 (1983), discussed in n.6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> Although the information does not appear in the report of the case, we have reviewed the record on appeal in <em>Thompson </em>and find that the full extent of the questioning concerning the defendant\u2019s understanding of the implication of jury waiver consisted of a single query, directed to counsel, as to whether the significance of the decision had been explained to the defendant. The question did not call for (and the affirmative answer did not contain) any specific information about the content of counsel\u2019s explanations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> We treat the defendant\u2019s appeal as an implicit demand for a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b226-6\">Cutter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWXR\">(dissenting). Schofield was arrested very promptly after the commission of the offenses with which he was charged. The victim of the rape gave clear and concise testimony and was not shaken on cross-examination. The evidence, as the majority opinion states, \u201cwas uncon-tradicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">Schofield was represented by an attorney from the Massachusetts Defenders Committee who appears to have prepared thoroughly his case asserting lack of criminal responsibility, and to have obtained expert psychiatric witnesses of some standing. He advised the trial judge in a brief conference just before trial that he would have \u201cjust two witnesses, two psychiatrists,\u201d and a tape, and that the case was to be jury-waived. There was discussion of problems about scheduling the expert medical witnesses on each side.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">After the disclosure mentioned in n.l, defense counsel indicated that Schofield \u201cwould be prepared to waive his right to a jury trial.\u201d The trial judge indicated that he would like to have Schofield sit in the front row of the jury box during his inquiry so that the judge could \u201csee his face.\u201d Then ensued the colloquy reproduced in n. 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">I perceive nothing in <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 378 </em>Mass. 504, 508-511 (1979), which requires a greater inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>by a trial judge than was made in this case. This was not questioning of Schofield \u201cas a mere matter of rote.\u201d See the <em>Ciummei </em>case at 510. The <em>Ciummei </em>opinion states (at 509-510) that the court did \u201cnot intend to create a rigid pattern.\u201d I view the language (at the top of 510) merely as suggestions of possible lines of inquiry \u201cwhere a defendant needs a compendious reminder\u201d of the extent of his rights. The judge saw Schofield and had opportunity to appraise his capacity to understand. I would suppose that the trial judge\u2019s inquiry was sufficient to satisfy himself that the defendant was aware of his rights, that his decision was voluntary and not coerced, and especially that he had consulted with his attorney about his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Here the attorney (see n.l) had already shown himself to be both perceptive and conscientious. A trial judge should be slow to second guess the trial tactics of a competent attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The majority opinion concedes that \u201cin all other respects the trial was soundly managed and fair\u201d but reverses and causes a new trial solely on the supposed inadequacy of the jury waiver colloquy. Not only does the colloquy seem to me wholly adequate, but the trial judge afforded Schofield\u2019s counsel opportunity to suggest further inquiry. That no suggestions were made by counsel may not amount to a waiver. It certainly indicates, however, that the trial judge, acting conscientiously, was trying to afford full opportunity for any last minute change of position. To paraphrase the much more concise dissent of Judge Dumbauld in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 141 (2d Cir. 1980), I would affirm simpliciter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">defense counsel, before Schofield waived trial by jury in person, brought to the attention of the trial judge that the victim had been called as a witness by another attorney from the Massachusetts Defenders Committee in another unrelated case in the same court. Schofield had been informed of this and did not object on any ground of conflict of interest. The judge correctly ruled that there was no impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Here Schofield, charged with a callous rape, had the opportunity for trial before a perceptive judge with an academic background. He and his counsel knew that the significant decision as to guilt must be made upon expert psychiatric testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544 (1967). They each reasonably may have believed that (a) waiver of a jury might result in a more measured appraisal (than would be given by a jury) of the circumstances of the rape, and (b) a judge might be more receptive than a jury to expert evidence of the type which they expected to offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
