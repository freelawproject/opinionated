Wynn, a North Attleborough policeman. Wynn\u2019s request for a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, was denied as untimely by the board of selectmen (board), North Attleborough\u2019s appointing authority. Wynn appealed to the Civil Service Commission (commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">In those proceedings, the board moved to dismiss both on the ground that the commission lacked jurisdiction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42, to hear claims of a failure by the appointing authority to follow the procedures required by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, and for the reason that Wynn had not requested a hearing within the forty-eight hour period required by \u00a7 62. Denying both motions to dismiss, the commission ruled that the board\u2019s failure to give Wynn a hearing was \u201cprejudice per se\u201d and ordered that Wynn be restored to his position without loss of compensation or other rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The board brought this action in the nature of certiorari (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4) in the Superior Court. On the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court ruled that the commission had no jurisdiction to hear Wynn\u2019s appeal under \u00a7 42, and that Wynn\u2019s request was not timely filed under \u00a7 62. A judgment entered quashing the commission\u2019s decision. The commission, in its appeal to this court, claims error in these rulings of law. We affirm the judgment for the reason that Wynn\u2019s request for a hearing was untimely under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Although it is preferable to consider jurisdictional questions first, see <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Industrial Natl. Bank, </em>380 Mass. 533, 534 (1980); 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1350, at 548 (1969), that procedure is not woodenly followed, and there are instances where only the merits are discussed, e.g., <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 91 (1975). In this case, where the legislative intent regarding jurisdiction is difficult to discern, see the appendix to this opinion, and where we are of opinion that, in any event, the merits should be reached without the requirement of yet another proceeding, compare <em>Chakrabarti </em>v. <em>Marco S. Marinello Associates, Inc., </em>377 Mass. 419, 423 (1979), we decline to rule on the jurisdictional issue. As indicated in the appendix, we think legislative clarification of the question whether appeals under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42, lie from actions of an appointing authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, would be most helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>We turn, therefore, to the merits. The facts are undisputed. Wynn was given written notice of his punishment duty on Friday, July 13, 1979, at 10:32 a.m., and, as required by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, was informed of his right within forty-eight hours to make a written request for a hearing. Although his attorney, on Monday, July 16, 1979, orally requested a hearing and followed that request by a letter mailed on that day, the request was not received by the board until Thursday, July 19, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The relevant portion of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, provides that <em>\u201ca </em>police officer . . . upon whom punishment duty is imposed shall, within twenty-four hours of the imposition of such punishment duty, be given . . . written notice stating the specific reason for the imposition . . . and informing him that he may, within forty-eight hours of receipt of such notice, request in writing a hearing by the appointing authority.\u201d Interpreting the statute as requiring that a written request be filed with the appointing authority within forty-eight hours, the board denied the request for a hearing. We think the board\u2019s construction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>Iannelle </em>v. <em>Fire Commr. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 250, 251 (1954), the Supreme Judicial Court construed a section of c. 31, providing that a hearing be requested within five days after receiving notice, as requiring that the request be received by the appointing authority within five days. See also <em>Daley </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Western Hampden, </em>304 Mass. 86, 93-94 (1939). Where as here, the notice must be \u201cgiven\u201d to the police officer within twenty-four hours, and the time period allowed for requesting a hearing is also a matter of hours, rather than days, the inference is strong that the request must be received by the board within the requisite time period. See <em>Assessors of Marlborough </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>383 Mass. 876 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court quashing the order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">An examination of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 62, and the legislative history of those sections reveals the difficulty in determining whether the Legislature intended to permit appeals to the commission under \u00a7 42 from failures of an appointing authority to follow the requirements of \u00a7 62. Both sections were part of a recodification of the civil service laws effected by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11. The purpose of the codification was to rearrange c. 31 \u201ctopically, as well as sequentially,\u201d or otherwise put, to make \u201ctechnical\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive\u201d amendments to c. 31. 1977 House Doc. No. 6153, at 3 (submission of the Secretary of Administration, dated May 25, 1977, accompanying the legislation which became St. 1978, c. 393).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Prior to the 1978 recodification, an appeal to the commission from failures to follow the requirements of the section imposing punishment duty was clearly authorized. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 46A (as appearing in St. 1975, c. 557, \u00a7 2), permitted a person to file a complaint with the commission alleging that \u201chis employment or compensation has been affected by action of the appointing authority in failing to follow the requirements of section forty-three.\u201d Since punishment duty appeared as \u00a7 43(g), there is no question that an appeal under \u00a7 46A was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In the 1978 revision, however, former \u00a7 43(g), the provision concerning punishment duty of police officers and fire fighters, was separated from \u00a7 43, a section dealing with disciplinary matters, renumbered as \u00a7 62, and placed with other sections relating to police officers and fire fighters. The language of \u00a7 62 was not changed in any respect here material except to include a reference to \u00a7 42, the section replacing prior \u00a7 46A. Compare G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43(g), as appearing in St. 1965, c. 281, with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 62, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, at 464-465.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">When the punishment duty provision was moved from \u00a7 43, there was no corresponding amendment to \u00a7 42. Thus \u00a7 42 (as appearing in St. 1978, c. 398, \u00a7 11) in relevant part reads as follows: \u201cAny person who alleges that an appointing authority has failed to follow the requirements of section forty-one in taking action which has affected his employment or compensation may file a complaint with the commission . ...\u201d The section refers, as did the previous \u00a7 46A, to failures to follow the requirements of former \u00a7 43 (now \u00a7 41) and makes no reference to \u00a7 62. Nor does the statute contain an express denial of commission jurisdiction as in <em>Canney </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 648, 651 (1975), where St. 1971, c. 179, \u00a7 4, inserting \u00a7 <em>43(j), </em>excluded \u201c.unauthorized absence\u201d from the hearing and appellate review sections of c. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The question, therefore, is whether the omission was deliberate. There is some indication that it was not. For example, \u00a7 62, unlike former \u00a7 43(g), requires that a copy of \u00a7 42 be given to the person upon whom punishment duty is imposed. If no appeal to the commission lies under \u00a7 42, giving a police officer a copy of that section would serve no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Nor is there a readily apparent reason for the requirement contained in \u00a7 62 (and in former \u00a7 43[g]) that a copy of the notice imposing the punishment duty be sent to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In addition, the rule of statutory construction applicable to recodification suggests that no change was intended. \u201cIt is the general rule that verbal changes in the revision of a statute do not alter its meaning, and are construed as a continuation of the previous law.\u201d <em>Neiss </em>v. <em>Burwen, </em>287 Mass. 82, 96 (1934). <em>Town Crier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Weston, </em>361 Mass. 682, 686 (1972). See also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>323 Mass. 295, 301 (1948); <em>Scaccia v. Boston Elev. Ry., </em>317 Mass. 245, 251 (1944). A similar rule of construction is followed where there is a mere rearrangement of sections. See Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 28.11 (4th ed. 1972); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mills County, </em>224 Iowa 1375, 1379-1380 (1938). See also <em>Trites </em>v. <em>Melrose, </em>318 Mass. 378, 380 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On the other hand, the language of \u00a7 42 is quite specific. It refers solely to missteps under \u00a7 41. Whether \u00a7 42 should be construed literally despite the reference to \u00a7 42 in \u00a7 62 and despite the legislative history of the recodification is obviously a question of considerable complexity. In these circumstances, we defer treating the question of jurisdiction and suggest that the commission seek a legislative clarification of the scope of \u00a7 42.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"><em> </em>The record before the commission is not before us, and we do not have an extended explanation of its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
