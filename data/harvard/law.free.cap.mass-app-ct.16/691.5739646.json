On appeal, Houghtlin argues that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence that he possessed a shotgun at the time of his arrest, and that the judge exacerbated the error by disallowing explanation about the weapon. Houghtlin also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s final argument to the jury was improper. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The background necessary to understand the claims of error concerning evidence of the shotgun is as follows. David Viner, an experienced narcotics officer with the Pittsfield police department, testified that he maintained surveillance of the defendant\u2019s apartment on the evenings of October 31 and November 1 and 2, 1980. The apartment was on the second floor front of a four-unit building and could be reached by a wooden stairway on the right exterior of the building. The second floor rear apartment appeared vacant during the periods of surveillance. On October 31, within a one-hour period, Officer Viner observed six persons make separate visits to the defendant\u2019s apartment. Each person stayed about seven or eight minutes. On November 1, twelve individuals were seen by Officer Viner coming and going from the defendant\u2019s apartment during an unspecified period of time. On November 2, the officer observed six individuals separately enter the apartment and leave within a short period of time. On that date, one of the individuals leaving the building was seen holding a plastic sandwich bag up to his nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Officer Viner further testified that, based on his surveillance and other information, a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment for illicit drugs was issued to the Pitts-field police. The warrant authorized a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry on representations, among others, that the safety of the officers executing the warrant might be jeopardized if they announced themselves. On November 6, 1980, at approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>mately 11:00 or 11:30 p.m., Officer Viner, accompanied by six or seven other Pittsfield police officers, entered the building to execute the warrant. As the officers approached the defendant\u2019s second floor apartment, two individuals were seen watching them through a window in the apartment. Believing that they had been spotted, the police broke down a hallway door and the door to the apartment. Officer Viner stated, \u201cPolice,\u201d as he went through the door leading to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Officer Viner testified that as he entered the apartment he observed a man to the left of the door. The witness was then asked by the prosecutor, \u201cAnd what was that person doing?\u201d. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel objected. When asked by the judge for the basis of the objection, counsel replied, \u201cRelevance.\u201d No request was made for a bench conference to explain the basis of the relevance objection. The objection was overruled. Officer Viner then testified in response to the question that the person (subsequently identified as the defendant) \u201chad his hand on a shotgun.\u201d No motion to strike the answer was made. Two other Pittsfield police officers subsequently testified, without objection, about their observations of the shotgun near the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claims of error. Testimony concerning the shotgun was also elicited at a pretrial hearing held on October 1, 1982, on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs seized pursuant to the warrant. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel represented him at the hearing on that motion. The judge who presided at the trial (which commenced the following day) was not the same judge who heard and decided the motion to suppress. No motion in limine was filed by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel with respect to the anticipated evidence of the shotgun. The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement to the jury made no reference to this evidence. Due to apparent mistake or inadvertence, the closing arguments of counsel and the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury were not tape recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>1. The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argues that the testimony about the defendant\u2019s possession of a shotgun should have been excluded because it imputed criminality unrelated to the drug offenses being tried. She contends that the testimony created the impression that the defendant unlawfully possessed a shotgun (see G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[h]), and that he intended to shoot, and perhaps kill, the police officers executing the warrant. Apart from these implications, it is also argued that the admission of the testimony about the shotgun violated \u201c[t]he general rule . . . \u2018that weapons found in the possession of a defendant are admissible only if they might have been used in the commission of the crime charged. . . . Otherwise an inference that a defendant has vicious and dangerous propensities might be drawn that would be prejudicial to him.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haney, </em>358 Mass. 304, 306 (1970), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>357 Mass. 245, 248 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We think the defendant\u2019s present arguments fail for lack of a proper objection. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel knew from the hearing on the motion to suppress, held the day before the commencement of trial, what the answer to the prosecutor\u2019s question would be, but framed no motion in limine to test its admissibility. In addition, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no request for a bench conference to explain the nature of the relevancy objection, thereby giving the judge no warning of the officer\u2019s expected testimony. The judge had discretion to determine whether the answer to the question might produce relevant evidence. The well-known test for determining relevance, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 469 (1982), presents \u201ca matter on which the opinion of the trial judge will be accepted on review except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 462-463 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambra, </em>357 Mass. 260, 264 (1970). In light of the testimony of Officer Viner (describing the events of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>warrant\u2019s execution) which immediately preceded the challenged question, the judge might have thought that an answer to the question would furnish objective evidence which would \u201ctend[ ] to prove the circumstances under which the crime was committed and serve[ ] as an aid to the jury in reaching a verdict by giving them a total picture.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 588 (1977), and cases cited. Moreover, when the question was answered, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no motion to strike the testimony. Only by means of a motion in limine, a more focused objection, or a prompt motion to strike, would the judge have been alerted to the substance of the particularized arguments now urged on appeal and the Commonwealth\u2019s present response that the disputed evidence could warrant an inference of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haney, </em>358 Mass. at 306-307.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that juncture, the judge would have been in a position to exercise his discretion to decide whether the evidence was so inflammatory in nature as to outweigh its probative value and thus preclude its admission. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretien, </em>383 Mass. 123, 135-136 (1981). We note that testimony about the shotgun similar to Officer Viner\u2019s testimony came in later without objection through two other Commonwealth witnesses. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel failed to express to the judge the specific basis underlying her objection of relevancy and failed, once the evidence was in, to make known to the judge any discrete ground of error which she perceived in the judge\u2019s ruling. See Mass.R. Crim.P. 22, 378 Mass. 892 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 471 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 696 (1981). In these circumstances, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that once the question was answered, a motion to strike was futile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>because the evidence had already been brought to the jury\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">2. There also was no error in the trial judge\u2019s rulings sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objections to two questions asked of Officer Viner by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel in an effort to explain the presence of the shotgun. The first question, asking whether the defendant\u2019s possession of the shotgun fell \u201cwithin the confines of the law,\u201d called for an improper opinion and may also have sought to obtain immaterial information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>264 Mass. 221, 224-225 (1928). The second question, asking the officer whether \u201cany complaints [had issued] against [the defendant] relative to that firearm,\u201d called for a conclusion on a matter not shown to be within the witness\u2019s knowledge. In the absence of proper questions, or any explanation of what specific information counsel sought to obtain by either question, there is no basis to conclude that the defendant was denied his right to explain seemingly incriminating evidence offered by the prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">3. Two portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument are challenged as exceeding the scope of the evidence and the fair inferences that might be drawn therefrom. As previously noted, the closing arguments of counsel were not tape recorded. See the requirements of Dist.Ct.R.Crim.P. 9(A) (1981). Appellate counsel for the defendant has made no reasonable effort to attempt to reconstruct the missing materials. See Mass.R.A.P. 8(c), as appearing in 378 Mass. 933 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>376 Mass. 74, 79-80 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheffield, ante </em>342, 348-349 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">We need not dwell, however, on the defendant\u2019s extensive argument on why he should be excused from attempting the reconstruction of the prosecutor\u2019s final argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Even if we accept the defendant\u2019s version of the argument as an accurate depiction of what the prosecutor said to the jury, we find nothing to warrant a new trial. The first criticized comment (pertaining to the disposability of the marihuana) was warranted by evidence describing the physical characteristics of the defendant\u2019s apartment. The argument was based upon the evidence and not so attenuated as to be plainly irrelevant. The second comment (allegedly expressing the prosecutor\u2019s opinion that the amount of marihuana exceeded an amount likely held for personal use) argued a fact which the jury could have properly inferred themselves from the quantity of marihuana seized (21.9 ounces), its location in the apartment, the quantity of other materials seized which could have been used to package marihuana for sale, the police observations of visitors to the apartment on October 30 and November 1 and 2,1980, and the testimony of Officer Viner (who was qualified as an expert in the investigation of narcotics cases) that his observations and experience led him to conclude that \u201cdrugs were being dealt from [the] house.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>356 Mass. 574, 578-579 (1970). The defendant was not prejudiced by the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> The defendant\u2019s counsel on appeal is not the same lawyer who defended him in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-5\"> The record reveals that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel is experienced, and that she knew how to challenge evidence by means of the procedural vehicles mentioned above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> The defendant\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined two other police officers who participated in the search and had seen the shotgun, apparently seeking to create the inference that the shotgun might have been in the possession or control of one of the other individuals found in the apartment with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
