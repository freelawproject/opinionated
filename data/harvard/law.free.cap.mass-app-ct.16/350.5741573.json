L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-24. A judge of the Superior Court heard the cases together. The trial of the dismissal case was de nova as required by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Kurlander was a tenured elementary art teacher in the Williamstown public school system. He was advised by letter of March 28, 1978, that the superintendent of schools had proposed to the Williamstown school committee that he be dismissed for inefficiency, unbecoming conduct, insubordination and \u201cother good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter also advised him of certain rights which accrued under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, including the right to written charges of the causes for which dismissal is proposed and to a hearing at which he could be represented by counsel. A list of fourteen charges was subsequently furnished, which included references to specific incidents, dates and school personnel who witnessed or were involved in the events. The charges are set out in the Appendix following the dissenting opinion. The hearing before the committee commenced on August 7, 1978, and continued on various dates in August before concluding on September 1, 1978. Kurlander was represented by counsel who, the transcript discloses, approached his task vigorously, both in cross-examining witnesses and arguing points of law before the committee. Kurlander requested an open hearing, and the committee voted to hold one. All sessions of the hearing up to September 1 were held in public. On that day, at the conclusion of the evidence, counsel for the committee instructed the committee members on the law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and suggested that they deliberate in private \u201cwhere each member . . . may frankly discuss the evidence,\u201d and thereafter return to open session to vote on the question of dismissal. Kurlander objected, and the committee chairwoman announced that the deliberations would be private, as counsel for the committee had suggested. There was no vote on the question of a private session. Kurlander\u2019s counsel subsequently objected to some of the instructions given by counsel for the committee, incorporating his previous objection to the private session. He did not, however, object to the lack of a vote to deliberate in private. Several hours later, the committee reconvened in public session and voted unanimously that the \u201ccharge[sj\u201d of conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination and inefficiency had been substantiated. The committee then voted unanimously to dismiss Kurlander. Kurlander did not request the school committee to specify which of the fourteen charges formed the basis of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">By agreement of the parties, both cases were tried in the Superior Court upon the transcript of the proceedings before the committee, and certain exhibits and stipulations, including a stipulation which the parties and the judge treated as preserving the issues argued here. With an inconsequential exception,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the evidence in the Superior Court was therefore precisely the same as that presented to the committee. The committee had heard thirty-five witnesses over six days of hearings. There was extensive testimony by school administrative personnel concerning Kur-lander\u2019s repeated failure to produce adequate lesson and curriculum plans. The testimony recounted the administration\u2019s continuing efforts to procure compliance in this area and to have Kurlander keep his classroom neat and clean, another area of continued friction. Other witnesses spoke of Kurlander\u2019s failure to perform certain assigned \u201cbus duty.\u201d There was also testimony, much of it com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>plimentary to Kurlander, concerning his effectiveness as a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The testimony of gravest import, however, concerned incidents which occurred on March 20 and 21, 1978. These incidents were the basis for the first four charges brought by the committee. Ronald Gagnon, an administrative assistant, testified that on March 20 he entered Kurlander\u2019s classroom to videotape the class in connection with a planned submission to an arts program in Boston. According to Gagnon, Kurlander approached him immediately and, in a \u201charsh and loud voice,\u201d made comments which could reasonably be interpreted as questioning Gagnon\u2019s competence. When Gagnon attempted to leave, Kurlander insisted he stay and \u201cagain started screaming.\u201d Gagnon reported the incident, which took place in front of Kur-lander\u2019s students, to Helen Renzi, the principal. Renzi also had a confrontation with Kurlander on that day. She testified that on a routine walk through the school she stopped at Kurlander\u2019s room. As she entered, he commenced to \u201cyell\u201d at her, saying, \u201cI knew if I yelled loud enough, you would come in.\u201d (Although the timing of the events is unclear, Renzi may have entered the classroom shortly after the Gag-non incident.) Renzi testified that, in front of the class, Kurlander referred to requests he had made which he asserted had not been filled and \u201cberated\u201d her.. Renzi called Kurlander to her office later that day and, after some discussion with him and Gagnon, suspended Kurlander for three days. Kurlander left, \u201cshouting and arguing\u201d about who would arrange for a good substitute teacher in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On the following day, Kurlander was called to a meeting with Renzi and John Madden, the superintendent of schools. Kurlander was handed a letter which confirmed the three-day suspension and reserved Madden\u2019s right to take further disciplinary action. Kurlander read the letter and in turn handed it to his wife, sitting in an outer office, telling her to \u201ccheck it for grammar.\u201d The meeting was stormy and peppered with more loud outbursts by Kur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>lander. At one point, he referred to Renzi\u2019s early departure from the meeting as creating the opportunity to engage in a fistfight if Madden removed his glasses. Kurlander testified that he did not recall having made some of the remarks testified to by Renzi and Madden and characterized his loudness as \u201ctheatrics,\u201d which were not intended to be unpleasant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The judge made findings of fact which alluded to the continuing conflicts over neatness and lesson plans. He also found that, while Kurlander had a good grasp of his subject, he received \u201clesser marks on his ability to transmit education to the public school students.\u201d The judge further found that the incidents in March were the immediate cause of Kurlander\u2019s suspension and the reservation by the superintendent of the right to take further disciplinary action. He found Kurlander\u2019s actions to have involved \u201ctotally inappropriate language spoken to Gagnon in the presence of pupils . . . and thereafter . . . totally inappropriate language to both Mrs. Renzi and Mr. Madden at subsequent discussions. All of this took place in the presence of pupils and other supervisory personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Based on his findings of fact, which accurately synopsized testimony before the committee, the judge concluded that Kurlander had not been denied any statutory right or due process by the committee\u2019s actions and that the committee was justified in dismissing Kurlander. The judge also ruled that no violation of the open meeting law had occurred. Timely appeals were taken from the ensuing judgment which affirmed the committee\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">1. Kurlander first contends that the school committee is required under \u00a7 43A, or on the ground of procedural due process, to state which charges it has found substantiated because without such a statement (a) the Superior Court has an inadequate basis on which to conduct the de nova hearing required by \u00a7 43A; and (b) the teacher cannot adequately prepare and defend the case against him at the Superior Court hearing. Implicit in these arguments is the notion that any charges which the school committee determines to be unproven cannot be passed upon by the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Court. Were it not so, the argument suggests, the Superior Court could uphold the discharge on grounds rejected by the school committee, thereby impermissibly intruding upon that body\u2019s executive function.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">These arguments may well misconceive the nature of \u201cde nova\u201d review as provided for by \u00a7 43A. That statute requires the Superior Court to determine \u201cwhether the school committee acted on the evidence rather than out of bias, political pressure, or other improper motive,\u201d <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 305-306 (1981), by a process of \u201cde nova review, [in which] the findings of fact of the school committee carry no evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. \u201cThe provision in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A [inserted by St. 1958, c. 462], to \u2018hear the cause \u201cde nova\u201d \u2019 reads as a mandate to determine anew whether the charge or charges are substantiated.\u201d <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 614 (1961). Thus we have stated that in reviewing a \u00a7 42 teacher dismissal under \u00a7 43A, the Superior Court is \u201cnot confined to reviewing a record,\u201d <em>Springgate, supra </em>at 306, as it would be in a case considered under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5). We have also stated that \u00a7 43A creates \u201cmanifestly . . . broader review than is mandated by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and like judicial review statutes,\u201d and we have expressly held that \u201cno findings are required\u201d of a school committee for purposes of Superior Court review under \u00a7 43A. <em>South Middlesex Regional Vocational Technical Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 376 (1980). See also <em>Wishart </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>500 F.2d 1110, 1115 (1st Cir. 1974) (In a de nova hearing under \u00a7 43A, the teacher \u201cwould seek not some restrictive \u2018review\u2019 in state court, but would receive an entirely new hearing at which the school committee has the burden of supporting the discharge\u201d). These cases indicate that when a tenured teacher who has been dismissed by a school committee pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, elects de nova review in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, that process (1) supplants any fact-finding function the school committee may have; (2) transfers the function of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>finding facts to the Superior Court; and (3) requires the Superior Court, solely on its view of the evidence before <em>it, </em>to make a fresh determination \u201cwhether the evidence substantiates the charges made by the school committee,\u201d <em>Springgate, supra </em>at 306, and warrants the teacher\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These cases also suggest that the focal point of Superi- or Court review is whether a cause for discharge is substantiated, and that, if one is, the school committee\u2019s decision to dismiss must stand. As stated in <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, supra </em>at 614-615, the case \u201con appeal ... is not what action is appropriate or wise, the offences being established; it is, has the teacher offended in the way charged?\u201d All of this works to the advantage of the teacher in most instances through procedures which have been carefully crafted to balance the ultimate prerogative of the committee \u2014 to maintain or terminate the employment rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tionship \u2014 with the special safeguards afforded by plenary judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">There is no need, however, to decide in this case whether the Constitution or G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43A, mandate that a school committee designate which charges have been proven. The record shows that Kurlander was not subjected to any special unfairness by reason of the school committee\u2019s failure to provide such specific findings. It is undisputed that Kurlander received all the procedural safeguards required by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, including written notice of the charges, time to prepare his response, and a hearing at which he was represented by counsel, and had the rights to present evidence and call witnesses. As noted earlier, the case before the judge was, by express agreement of Kur-lander and the committee, the same in all respects as the case presented to the committee. No new causes or charges were introduced before the Superior Court. There is no question that the charges related to the incidents of March 20 and 21, 1978, were the most serious before the committee. The testimony of Gagnon, Madden and Renzi as to the incidents of March 20 and 21, was consistent, portraying Kurlander\u2019s behavior on those dates (much of it in front of his students) as insolent, abusive, loud and out of control. No substantial doubt as to the occurrence of these events was raised by Kurlander\u2019s failure to recollect some of the remarks he made, his explanation of his occasional use of \u201ctheatrics,\u201d and his characterization of all his actions as well-intended. In light of the evidence, we think Kur-lander could not reasonably have read the committee\u2019s unanimous vote that the cause of unbecoming conduct had been substantiated as anything other than a determination that the charges arising out of the events of March 20 and 21 had been proven. In this particular respect, the vote resembled a general verdict of a jury. The record therefore furnishes no basis for a claim that Kurlander was prejudiced because he was unaware that the committee had found those allegations substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Similarly, Kurlander cannot claim that the judge based his decision on grounds other than those relied upon by the committee, since the judge, having independently found the same facts, decided that the incidents of March 20, 1978, and the subsequent discussions were sufficient to justify dismissal. This determination was correct; an incident of unbecoming conduct substantively similar was found sufficient to warrant a tenured teacher\u2019s dismissal in the <em>MacKenzie </em>case, 342 Mass. at 616-617. Since Kurlander could not reasonably claim to be unaware that the charges related to the incidents of March 20 and 21 had been found substantiated by the committee and because the judge based his decision on those same incidents, the lack of findings by the committee as to the remaining charges could not (even on Kurlander\u2019s assumptions) rise above the level of harmless error, and certainly not to the level of negating a constitutional right. Having found major charges established, the judge was not obliged to pore over the evidence to make findings concerning the other charges aired before the committee. Notwithstanding the possibility that implications adverse to Kurlander\u2019s reputation might be drawn from the failure to make findings on all charges (see note 3, dissenting opinion, <em>infra), </em>it is not the duty of the school committee or the Superior Court in these cases to operate with an eye to easing the task of resume-writing for a teacher who is properly discharged for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The judge\u2019s rulings of law were also sound. The judge was aware of the court\u2019s function,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and his ultimate ruling that the committee\u2019s action was \u201cjustifiable\u201d reflects a conclusion (necessary to affirmance of a dismissal under \u00a7 43A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that there was a firm foundation in fact for the dismissal of Kurlander for a cause charged under \u00a7 42. The ultimate nondelegable decision of the committee \u2014 to terminate the employment relationship by dismissing Kurlander \u2014 was also respected by the judge, in conformance with the principle that \u201c[i]t is not a judicial function . . . under . . . \u00a7 43A to assess the gravity of a school committee\u2019s charges or the appropriateness or wisdom of its action. The permissible grounds for dismissal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 \u2014 inefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination, and other good cause \u2014 include any ground which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, in bad faith, or irrelevant to the committee\u2019s task of running a sound school system.\u201d <em>Springgate, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 308. We conclude that while a committee might be well-advised to make a simple statement of the charges found proven (and a teacher not receiving such a statement may wish to immediately request one before the committee adjourns and, failing that, make such a request before, or simultaneously with, filing an action under \u00a7 43A), there was no impairment of any constitutional or other right due Kurlander in the committee\u2019s failure to do so here since it must have been clear to Kurlander that the charges to which we have referred were found substantiated by the committee\u2019s vote sustaining the cause of unbecoming conduct,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and those same charges formed the basis for the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">2. The operative provision of the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, as appearing in St. 1976, c. 397, \u00a7 6, provides that, with certain exceptions, \u201c[a]ll meetings of a governmental body shall be open to the public.\u201d This general rule is subject, however, to the express qualification of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 24, that it \u201cshall be in force only so far as [it is] not inconsistent with the express provision of any gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>eral or special law.\u201d The hearing on the present case was conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, which provides that the dismissal hearing of a tenured teacher \u201cmay be either public or private at the discretion of the school committee.\u201d At issue is whether the \u201chearing\u201d which the committee is privileged to hold in private includes the committee\u2019s deliberations, the only portion of these proceedings which were closed to the public. On that issue, the plaintiffs in the open meeting law case appear to acknowledge \u25a0 that the quoted provision of c. 71, \u00a7 42, is, on its face, inconsistent with the open meeting law. They urge, however, that the inconsistency does not extend to the facts of this case because the term \u201chearing\u201d should be interpreted to exclude the deliberative phase of proceedings before a school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 approach. Although the term \u201chearing\u201d is not expressly defined in either c. 71 or c. 39, it appears to constitute a category of \u201cmeeting,\u201d which is defined in G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23A, inserted by St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 3, as \u201cany corporal convening <em>and deliberation </em>of a governmental body\u201d (emphasis supplied). We think this definition encompasses \u201chearings\u201d under \u00a7 42, including the committee\u2019s deliberations. We disagree with the suggestion that this interpretation amounts to judicial legislation. Our interpretation derives from, and comports with, the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous and broadly descriptive definition of a clearly analogous term. We also deem significant the legislative intent expressed in the plain language in which \u00a7 42 is framed: to grant school committees the option to keep private the sensitive matters which may surface in the course of proceedings relating to dismissals of tenured teachers. A court must see that this purpose is enforced, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974); <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 960, 961 (1978), and not frustrated by approval of an anomaly, see <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 355 (1973), such as might result from an interpretation which would permit a committee to hold a closed hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>for the taking of evidence, but would require it under G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, to open its deliberative discussions of that same evidence to the public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that an inconsistency rising to the level of \u201cpositive repugnancy,\u201d see <em>Yaro </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 589 (1980), exists between the open meeting law, which declares in G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, that \u201c[a]ll meetings . . . shall be open,\u201d and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, which confers on school committees the right, in the exercise of discretion, to conduct dismissal hearings in public or private.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The specific terms of the latter override the former, general provision. G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Finally, there is no reason to overturn the judgment on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 two remaining arguments: (1) that a school committee, having once voted, as here, to hold an open meeting, may not subsequently choose to close a discrete part of it, and (2) that the lack of a formal vote to close deliberations to the public is fatal to the validity of the proceedings. As to the first contention, a committee could reasonably conclude that the deliberative portion of a hearing like this might necessitate frank discussion of sensitive material. Having unfettered discretion by statute to close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>all of the hearing or none of it, the committee offends no rule or policy by exercising less than its whole right. As to the second contention, no objection was made by Kur-lander, any committee member or anyone else to the committee\u2019s failure to vote formally to close deliberations to the public. Moreover, that failure appears not to have been made an issue before the Superior Court. (We have no transcript of the Superior Court proceedings, but the judge\u2019s detailed findings and rulings contain no reference to any such argument.) The issue involves a question of formal protocol which could easily have been resolved by the committee (perhaps to the satisfaction of everyone) had a timely objection been made. In the absence of a ground level objection or the matter being raised below, we decline to pass on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\"> General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 43A, as amended by St. 1977, c. 671, reads in part: \u201cThe court . . . shall hear the cause de nova, review such action, and determine whether or not upon all the evidence such action was justifiable.

To the extent that these cases relate to the standard of review, we note that both predate the de nova review procedure of G.

App. Ct. 304, 306 (1981).\u201d His detailed memorandum leaves little doubt that he appreciated the axiom underlying \u00a7\u00a742 and 43A, stated in <em>Springgate </em>(at 305), that \u201c[rjeview is not managerial in nature . . .; review is quintessential^ judicial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\"> For these reasons, we see no merit to Kurlander\u2019s other arguments to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the judge\u2019s conclusion that the school committee\u2019s action was justified. The arguments are premised on the restrictive notion of review with which we have already dealt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> Compare the different circumstances so far as confidentiality is concerned which pertained in <em>Milton Commons Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. Ill, 112-115 (1982), a case not involved with the open meeting law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> We note the judge\u2019s observations that, unlike the provision of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, which controls this case, \u201cthe provision governing dismissal of a non-tenured teacher, who has served for more than ninety days, does not specify that the hearing before the school committee, which is provided therein, may be public or private, at the school committee\u2019s option. Although this court is unable to discern the Legislature\u2019s rationale, it appears to have specified different hearing requirements for tenured and non-tenured teachers. Only the latter would be subject to the Open Meeting Law.\u201d See <em>Puglisi </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Whitman, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 142 (1981). We do not speculate on whether the Legislature intended different standards or whether the discrepancy is the result of oversight. Any patching of the statutes is the Legislature\u2019s prerogative, not ours. See <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>355 Mass. 592, 597 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b382-6\">Warner, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-s\">(dissenting). I disagree with the holding of the majority in Kurlander\u2019s case (part 1 of the opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The majority hold that in light of the evidence presented to the school committee Kurlander could not reasonably have read the committee\u2019s vote on the cause of unbecoming conduct as anything other than a vote that the first four charges had been substantiated, and that he was not, therefore, prejudiced by the failure of the committee formally to state which charges it found substantiated. The majority hold further that the judge based his decision on the same four charges <em>relied </em>on by the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Kurlander was first advised by the committee that the superintendent of schools had proposed his discharge for the <em>causes </em>of inefficiency, unbecoming conduct, insubordination and \u201cother good cause.\u201d As the majority note, these are generic causes for dismissal provided by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. Kurlander then exercised his acknowledged right <em>(ibid.) </em>to request written <em>charges </em>of the <em>causes </em>assigned by the committee. A list of fourteen specific charges was given. See the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Appendix. After extensive hearings the committee deliberated in private (and so we cannot determine from our own examination of the record which of the charges it found substantiated \u2014 nor could the Superior Court judge have done so), and then, in public session, unanimously voted that the \u201ccharges\u201d of conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination and inefficiency had been substantiated, and to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A close reading of the transcript of the evidence presented to the committee makes clear that it was open to the committee to find the first four charges not substantiated. Each of the charges involves allegations of language characterized as \u201cintemperate, insolent and inappropriate,\u201d and conduct as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Most of the testimony against Kur-iander on these charges was in conclusory terms, using the same or similar characterizations as set forth in the charges. Kuriander disputed those characterizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Most, if not all, of the remaining ten charges, if substantiated, would have been sufficient to support dismissal for the cause of conduct unbecoming a teacher, and these and the first four charges, if substantiated, would have been sufficient to support dismissal for the cause of insubordination. Further, the causes assigned for Kurlander\u2019s dismissal included \u201cinefficiency.\u201d The first four charges do not in any way allege conduct which would support this cause, and it may reasonably be assumed, therefore, that some other charge was found substantiated by the committee. The record is devoid of any statement by the committee of which of the fourteen charges, standing alone or in combination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it found substantiated and sufficient to support dismissal for the causes of conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination and inefficiency. While the majority\u2019s conclusion that the committee found the first four charges substantiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>and sufficient to support dismissal may be a good guess, it is nonetheless a guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The majority do not find it necessary to decide the issue, but suggest that while a teacher has a right to a statement of the specific charges alleged to support the causes for which his dismissal is proposed, he may have no right to a statement by the committee of which of those charges it finds substantiated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view, to state the proposition is to demonstrate its fundamental unfairness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a rule would result in a denial of procedural due process. Further, it would be inconsistent with the provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, and a misconception of the nature of the de nova review proceedings in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42 (as in effect in 1978), provided the generic causes for the dismissal of a tenured teacher, and for the furnishing of written charges to support those causes. It also dictated that there could be no dismissal \u201cunless the charge or charges shall have been substantiated.\u201d Here the committee made no such determination on the record, other than that which the majority find implicit in the vote to dismiss for the cause of conduct unbecoming a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The reliance by the majority on <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1981) (hereafter <em>Springgate), </em>is misplaced. A reading of that case reveals that the school committee found ten of eleven <em>charges </em>\u201cproved,\u201d and that the Superior Court and this</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>court, in considering the case under the de nova principles mandated by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, reviewed the committee\u2019s action on the <em>charges </em>found <em>proven </em>by it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> De nova review under \u00a7 43A means review of the <em>decision </em>of the school committee. Inextricable parts of that decision, I suggest, are the conclusions of the committee on the charges brought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cReview is not managerial in nature, however; review is quintessentially judicial and management is executive in quality. The statute [\u00a7 43A] does not invest the court with power to establish criteria for dismissing a teacher and initiating proceedings. Rather the statute confers upon the court the limited function of determining whether the school committee acted on the evidence rather than out of bias, political pressure, or other improper motive.\u201d <em>Spring-gate, supra </em>at 305-306. If the majority\u2019s suggestion were the rule, it would mean that, at least where there are multiple charges, the Superior Court judge, in the exercise of de nova review, could decide that dismissal of a teacher was justifiable on charges which were not found substantiated by the school committee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surely then, the judiciary would be \u201cmade to trespass on executive prerogatives.\u201d <em>Spring-gate, supra </em>at 305. See <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 615-616 (1961). \u201cIf there is ground for dismissal, the decision is for the school committee, and it is not the court\u2019s function to consider whether the committee\u2019s action is appropriate or wise. <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, supra </em>at 614-615, and 618.\u201d <em>Lower </em>v. <em>North Middlesex Regional Sch. Comm., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 540 (1979). See <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Mayor of Somerville, </em>213 Mass. 493 (1913). I think that principle cuts both ways, i.e., if the school committee decides that a charge is not substantiated, the court, on de nova review, ought not to override that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The right to de nova review under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, is the <em>teacher\u2019s. </em>It should not be necessary to point out that an appellant \u2014 which Kurlander was here \u2014 ordinarily seeks review only of those determinations adverse to him. If the school committee determines that a charge brought by <em>it </em>is not substantiated, that should be the end of it as to that charge. Kurlander was entitled to a statement of those determinations. To hold as the majority suggest would be to open the door for substitution of the judgment of the court for that of the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I would vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for remand to the school committee for a statement of which of the fourteen charges it found substantiated and sufficient to support dismissal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and for further de nova review in the Superior Court of Kurlander\u2019s dismissal on the basis of the charges found substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u201c1.

The possibility of future adverse consequences to Kurlander as a result of the committee\u2019s failure to make determinations on ten charges (accepting for this purpose the majority\u2019s view) should be apparent, especially where, as noted, it may be assumed that the committee found at least one, involving the cause of inefficiency, substantiated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em> </em>An examination of the record in this court in <em>Springgate </em>shows that the school committee recorded its findings of \u201cproven\u201d or \u201cnot proven\u201d on each of eleven charges brought against the teacher, and as to the one charge it found \u201cnot proven,\u201d the Superior Court judge ruled that it was not before him.

The majority acknowledge that the judge did not make findings on all of the charges. He found, on review of the transcript of testimony before the committee, that Kurlander\u2019s conduct during and after one incident, involving at most four of the fourteen charges, was sufficient to justify dismissal. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the committee shared the judge\u2019s view that the charges relating to that incident were substantiated and sufficient to support dismissal. In short, the judge could not possibly know what the <em>decision, </em>which he was charged with reviewing, was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> The vote of dismissal was unanimous. If the majority of the school committee now in office participated in the vote, I would permit them to make the statement. Otherwise, I would require that the presently constituted committee hold a new dismissal hearing, affording Kurlander all of the procedural safeguards, including written charges if he so requests, provided by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. In the event of such a hearing, de nova review under \u00a7 43A would be available to Kurlander on the charges expressly found substantiated by the committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
