The fact is that essentially all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the misappropriated monies were actually trust funds. Conversion would be a more appropriate term. The distinction does not affect the result or our view of its propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the trial judge, 162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355 (Law Div. 1978), following a motion for new trial or in the alternative a reduction in the judgment, supplementing an oral opinion delivered at the conclusion of the trial, and in turn supplemented by a letter dated August 18, 1978.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
