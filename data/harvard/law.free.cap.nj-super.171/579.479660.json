We conclude that there can be no contribution from a party not legally liable to the person injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In his complaint plaintiff Frank Nora alleged that on August 13, 1975 he was injured when his motorcycle was upended when it hit a depression in the roadway. The jury returned a verdict of $6,000 against defendants Public Service and County of Essex, apportioning the negligence as follows: Public Service, 48%; plaintiff, 35%; and County of Essex, 17%. The trial judge molded the verdict so that Public Service would pay 48% and the County of Essex, 17% of the judgment. Subsequently plaintiffs moved \u201cto determine the effect of the jury verdict against the respective defendants,\u201d complaining that the County of Essex had refused to pay its share on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s negligence exceeded that of the County of Essex. The trial judge ruled that Public Service should pay the entire judgment of $6,000, minus a deduction of 35% for plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. Public Service then moved for an order compelling the County of Essex to contribute its 17% share of the judgment, the full amount of which Public Service had already paid plaintiffs. The motion was denied, resulting in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 <em>et seq., </em>creates the right of contribution among parties adjudicated liable in tort. The right arises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">Where injury or damage is suffered by any person as a result of the wrongful act, neglect or default of joint tortfeasors, and the person so suffering injury or damage recovers a money judgment or judgments for such injury or damage against one or more of the joint tortfeasors, either in one action or in separate actions, and any one of the joint tortfeasors pays such judgment in whole or in part, he shall be entitled to recover contribution from the other joint tortfeasor or joint tortfeasors for the excess so paid over his pro rata share; but no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this act from any person entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>to be indemnified by him in respect to the liability for which the contribution is sought. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-53A-3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Here Public Service\u2019s \u201cpro rata share\u201d is determinable only after giving effect to the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 <em>et seq. N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-15-5.1 bars a negligent plaintiff from recovering against a defendant whose negligence, as computed by the jury, is less than plaintiff\u2019s. Since plaintiff\u2019s negligence (35%) exceeded that of the County of Essex (17%), plaintiffs herein could recover only against Public Service and in an amount reflecting a deduction for their 35% contributory negligence ($2,100), or a total of $3,900 ($6,000 minus $2,100). That Public Service was not the only negligent defendant does not preclude plaintiffs from recovering the full $3,900 from it. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-15-5.3 provides in part that the \u201cparty so recovering, may recover the full amount of the molded verdict from any party against whom such recovering party is not barred from recovery.\u201d That section further permits any party forced to pay more than its share of the molded verdict to \u201cseek contribution from the other joint tortfeasors.\u201d Where, as here, the alleged joint tortfeasor is a public entity, cognate provisions of the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>apply to the same effect. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-4. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-3(a) requires a public entity-joint tortfeasor \u201cto contribute to a joint tortfeasor only to the extent of the recovery provided for under this act,\u201d referring to the limitations listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2 (not relevant here).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The crucial question, therefore, is whether a negligent defendant from whom plaintiff may not recover by reason of comparative negligence can be deemed a \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d such as to trigger another tortfeasor\u2019s contribution rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">There are two prerequisites to the right of contribution among negligent parties: (1) common liability because of such negligence and (2) the party claiming contribution paid more than its share of the common liability. <em>Neveroski v. Blair, </em>141 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 385-386 (App.Div.1976); <em>Markey v. Skog, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 200 (Law Div.1974). Public Service\u2019s argument is premised upon the equivalence of negligence and liability. But there is a real distinction between them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">The essence of the doctrine of contribution, by the New Jersey and majority view, is a common obligation to the person injured by the common tortious conduct. Fault alone is not enough; there must be a joint liability to respond to the injured person in damages for the consequences of the default [citations omitted], <em>[Zotta v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>64 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 348-349 (App.Div.1960)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Accord, Neveroski </em>v. <em>Blair, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 385; <em>Farren v. N. J. Turnpike Auth., </em>31 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 362 (App.Div.1954); <em>Arcell v. Ashland Chemical Co., Inc., </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471,483-484 (Law Div.1977). In <em>Spitzack v. Schumacher, </em>308 <em>Minn. </em>143, 241 N.W.2d 641 (Sup.Ct.1976), a jury in a prior action had found plaintiffs\u2019 decedent 95% negligent and another driver, 5% negligent and thus not liable. Plaintiffs then sued a tavern owner for the negligent sale of liquor to their decedent, and the owner sought contribution from the driver previously found to have been 5% negligent. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for contribution, citing the rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">. a valid judicial determination on the merits that a defendant never was liable to a plaintiff negates the element of common liability and thereby immunizes that defendant from any subsequent action for contribution arising out of the same facts. [241 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 644]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The court rejected the underlying premise of Public Service\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">Appellant also argues that it is entitled to contribution since respondents have been found to be \u201c5 percent liable.\u201d However, respondents were not found to be \u201c5 percent liable,\u201d but were found to be 5 percent negligent and not liable at all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>It is well established that it is joint <em>liability, </em>rather than joint or concurring <em>negligence, </em>which determines the right of contribution. [Id. 241 N.W.2d at 645 n.2]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The application of the foregoing principles to adjudications under comparative-negligence laws although not confirmed in any case to which our attention has been directed has been assumed by two commentators. <em>See Iavicoli, No Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey, </em>178 (1973), and <em>Heft and Heft, Comparative Negligence Manual, </em>\u00a7 1.350 at 57 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On the question of common liability we note that Essex County does not meet the definition of \u201cjoint tortfeasor\" under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">For the purpose of this act the term \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them. . . . <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-53A-1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The county was found not liable to plaintiffs for the same injury for which Public Service was found liable. Thus there was no \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d from which Public Service could claim contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
