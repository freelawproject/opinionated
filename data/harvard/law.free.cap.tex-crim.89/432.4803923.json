G. Tayloe, Judge of the 45th District Court, of Bexar County, Texas. The applications were in proper form and will not be set out in full. The applications were granted, and in response John W. Tobin, Sheriff of Bexar County, responded that 'he was holding the relators by virtue of an extradition warrant issued by the Governor of Texas, directing delivery of the parties to Robert B. Stubbs, agent of the State of Louisiana, to convey the relators back to that State for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Prior to the issuance of the extradition warrant an affidavit had been filed before a Justice of the Peace of Bexar County to the effect that the relators were fugitives from justice from the State of Louisiana, and they were held temporarily under this affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The record seems to show that the hearing upon the application was begun on April 8, but was continued or postponed until a later date. At the time of the first hearing it is made to appear from the record that the requisition issued by the Governor of Louisiana recited that the relators were charged by \u201cinformation\u201d in the State of Louisiana, and that a certified copy of the information accompanied the requisition. The warrant of extradition issued by the Governor of the State of Texas upon that requisition followed the recital in the requisition, and recited that a copy of the information accompanies the requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">We may infer that between the original hearing, which was begun on April 8, and the final hearing, that the Texas authorities holding the relators ascertained that a requisition could not be honored by the Governor of this State unless it was accompanied by a certified copy of an \u201cindictment\u201d or \u201caffidavit\u201d charging an offense against relators in the demanding State; and that the authorities sought from the Governor of Louisiana a new requisition on the Governor of Texas, accompanied by a certified copy of an affidavit, upon which new requisition the Governor of Texas issued a new extradition warrant, and the Sheriff of Bexar County, by an amended answer, set up the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that he was holding the relators under the last extradition warrant which had been placed in his hands. Upon the final hearing of the matter on April 30 the relators were remanded to the custody of John W. Tobin, Sheriff of Bexar County, from which judgment they appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">There appears in the statement of facts upon the final hearing the following requisition from the Governor of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">EXHIBIT 'G\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">STATE OF LOUISIANA</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Executive Department</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The Governor of the State of Louisiana to the Governor of State of Texas: WHEREAS, Ora Jackson, alias Ora Jefferson and Laura Gradington (colored) stand charged in the Parish of Orleans in this State, with the crime of larceny from the person\u2014by affidavit and it has been represented to me that they have fled from justice and have taken refuge in the State of Texas</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u201cAnd, WHEREAS, agreeably to the Constitution of the United States, and an Act of Congress passed February 12, 1793, I have made application to his Excellency the Governor of the State of Texas for the surrender of the said parties fugitive from justice, and have also, in pursuance of the powers vested in me by law appointed</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u201cROBERT B.

That has long been the settled law, both by the decisions of this State and the United States. See Ex Parte Lewis, <em>75 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 320, 170 S. W. Rep., 1098; Roberts v. Reilley, 116 U. S., page 80, 6th Sup. Ct\u201e 291; 29 (L. Ed.), 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">While it is necessary that an authenticated copy of an affidavit or indictment accompany the requisition-, it does not follow by any means that relator should be discharged because the record in this case fails to show such certified affidavit. In the very case to which we are cited by relators\u2014Roberts v. Reilley, <em>supra, </em>Justice Matthews, delivering the opinion for the Supreme Court of the United States, uses the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u201cIt must appear, therefore, to the Governor of the State to whom such a demand is presented, before he can lawfully comply with it; first, that the person demanded is substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the State from whose justice he is alleged to have fled, by an indictment or an affidavit, certified as authentic by the Governor of the State- making the demand; and second, that the person demanded is a fugitive from the justice of the State the executive authority of which makes the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201cThe first of these prerequisites is a question of law and is always open upon the face of the papers to judicial inquiry, on an application for a discharge under a writ of <em>habeas corpus,. </em>The second is a question of fact, which the Governor of the State upon whom the demand is made must decide, upon such evidence as he may deem satisfactory. How far his decision may be reviewed judicially in proceedings in <em>habeas corpus, </em>or whether it is not conclusive, are questions not settled by harmonious judicial decisions, nor by any authoritative judgment of this court. It is conceded that the determination of the fact by the executive of the State in issuing his warrant of arrest, upon a demand made on that ground, whether the writ contains a recital of an express finding to that effect or not, must be regarded as sufficient to justify the removal until the presumption in its favor is overthrown by contrary proof. Ex parte Reggel, 114 U. S., 642 (ante, 250). Further than that it is not necessary to go in the present case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the instant case, an examination of the extradition warrant issued by the Governor of the State of Texas will disclose the following recital. \u201cAnd, Whereas, said demand is accompanied by a copy of said affidavit, duly certified as authentic, by the Governor of said State.\u201d What effect should be given by this court to the recital in the extradition warrant? Shall it be presumed that the recital of the Governor of the State of Texas that he had before him, accompanying the requisition, a certified copy of the affidavit charging relators with an offense in Louisiana speaks the.truth? or does such recital mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>nothing? We are not without authority in our State to answer such question. In Ex Parte Stanley, 25 Texas Crim. App., page 377, this court, speaking through Judge Wilson, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u201cIn the case we are considering, the warrant recites, but does not set forth in full, the affidavit upon which it is issued. We have found no decision or authority which requires that the warrant should set forth the evidence in full, except the intimation referred to in Thornton\u2019s case. The correct rule is, we think, laid down in Donohue\u2019s case, 84 New York, 438, in a syllabus as follows: \u2018Where the papers upon which a warrant of extradition is issued are witheld by the executive, the warrant itself can only be looked to for the evidence that the essential conditions of its issuance have been complied with, and it is sufficient if it recites what the law requires.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Later on, we read the following in the same case:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the warrant is in substantial compliance with the statute. No form for such a warrant is prescribed by law, and when it shows upon its face, with reasonable certainty, as does the warrant in question, that the essential prerequisites to its issuance have been complied with, it must be held <em>prima facie </em>valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In Ex Parte White, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 497, Judge Hurt, speaking for the court, after setting out the facts, used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u201cThe case should have been permitted to rest here, because the presumption obtained that the Governor of this State issued his warrant upon proper authority; that the requisition and the papers accompanying the same were in proper form, etc.,\u2014in fact, that a case was presented to him requiring the warrant, arrest, and extradition of relator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The presumption arising in favor of the legality of the extradition warrant issued by the Governor of the fugitive State is not a conclusive one, and a relator always has the right to go behind such presumption and prove, if he can, that the Governor was not in possession of the proper papers authorizing the issuance of the warrant, but in this case this was not done. The relator stands upon the proposition that in the absence of an affidavit this court should presume that no affidavit was in the hands of the Governor of the State, when the authorities just cited are directly to the contrary. The burden is upon the relator to show that the recitals in the extradition warrant were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The judgment of the trial court remanding the relators to the custody of the Sheriff of Bexar County, to be by him delivered to the agent of the State of Louisiana, is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
