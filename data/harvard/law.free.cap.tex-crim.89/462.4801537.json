Mar. 5, 1881, p. 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">In Article 559, Penal Code, it is made a felony for one knowingly to permit his premises to be used \u201cas a place for the purpose of being used as a place to bet\u201d or to permit gambling on his premises nor used as a place where people resort for the purpose of using it as a place to gamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">The indictment in the instant case is drawn under Article 572, <em>supra. </em>An indictment so drawn will not support a conviction of felony. The contrary was held in Robertson v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 310, in which case, by a divided court, the decision to the contrary rendered in Simons v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 339, was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>We have reached the conclusion that in holding that Article 572 was not repealed by the enactment of Article 559, the conclusion reached by the unanimous court and expressed in the opinion written by Judge Ramsey in the Simons case, <em>supra, </em>was correct. Our reasons for this view are fully expressed in the case of Francis v. State, No. 5775; this day decided. We deem it unnecessary to repeat them, but order that the judgment of the trial court be reversed and the prosecution upon the count quoted be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
