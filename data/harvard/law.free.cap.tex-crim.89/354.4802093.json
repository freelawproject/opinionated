A few days later there was filed in that case a statement of facts. From this we infer that the court \"stenographer complied with the request of appellant for the preparation of the statement of facts, and that even if he was entitled to a mandamus it would now be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">This proceeding is not in a condition authorizing its consideration. The Assistant Attorney General has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for the reason that the transcript is incomplete. The law requires the binding of the transcript under the seal and certificate of the clerk. Revised Statutes, Art. 2114; Paris &amp; G. N. R. Co. v. Armstrong, 83 S. W. Rep., 28; Code of Crim. Procedure, Art. 929; Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim.
