The sheriff\u2019s return is as follows: \u201cCame to hand on 23rd day of Jan. 1920, and executed on the 2 day of February, <em>1912, </em>by delivering to the within names.\u201d Then follows the names of all the sureties, and the return is signed by the sheriff. It is not necessary to quote authorities for the purpose of showing that this character of return is insufficient to support a judgment by default, and it will be necessary to reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for a new trial in order that such matter may be corrected if the State so desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
