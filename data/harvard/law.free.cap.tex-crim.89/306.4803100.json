The place on appellant\u2019s farm where the still was operated was described by said witness as being at the end of certain cotton rows just across a branch near a slough. It was testified by an officer that in October, 1920, he went to the farm of appellant, and at the end of the cotton rows -near a slough he found a-place where there had been a fire, and where some mash had been poured out into said slough, and about thirty yards from that place he found a bucket of whisky. Following a wagon track which led from this place over to an adjoining farm, witness found there the barrels, piping, coils and a mill for grinding corn, which was identified by Neal as being the apparatus used on appellant\u2019s place. It was also shown by Mr. Jones that appellant approached him with a proposition to make some whisky, and also shown by the witness Woodward that appellant made to him a proposition that if he would get Bill Jenkins and they would furnish the barrels, that he, appellant, would make the whisky and divide up with them. We think the trial court correctly refused appellant\u2019s request for an instructed verdict of not guilty, and that the judgment was not without evidence to support same.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Finding no error in the record the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
