He also had two buckets of whiskey, or what looked like whisksy and smelled like whiskey, but the size of the buckets is not stated. The articles, according to the testimony, could have been used in making corn whiskey but not without the addition of other utensils such as coil, pipe, and things of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>If the evidence is sufficient to show that the possession of the equipment, within the meaning of the statute, upon which we express no opinion, the record does not contain evidence which would meet the obligation upon the State to show by evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that the equipment possessed was for the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for unlawful purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">The court erred in failing to give a special charge requested to this effect.
