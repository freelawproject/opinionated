The refusal of the court, to give such instructions was error. Franklin v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 342, 227 S. W. Rep., 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We .think the evidence touching the identity of the liquor analyzed with that purchased from the appellant was sufficient to go to the jury upon the issue of the intoxicating qualities of the fluid.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A special charge was requested to the effect that if the jury found that the liquor was not intoxicating when sold but that its subsequently becoming so would not authorize a conviction was upon an issue which, so far as we are able to discern, is not raised by the evidence. In view of another trial, however, we express the opinion that, if requested to do so, the <em>court </em>should instruct the jury that if the liquor sold was at the time not an intoxicant, that is, it did not contain the prohibited percentage of alcohol, an acquittal should result.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Because of the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
