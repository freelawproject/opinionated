G. Wharton. He testified that his plumbing establishment was burglarized on the morning of the tenth of January; that he found in the possession of Officer Kilday certain property including a kitchen sink ,and a shower attachment which he identified as part of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Kilday testified that he arrested the appellant and found in his possession the kitchen sink and some other articles; that at the time of the arrest appellant \u201cconfessed that he had gone into Kirkwood &amp; Wharton\u2019s place and took a kitchen sink out of there, a patented shower head for a bath, and he told me where his bicycle was. I went to a point back of Kirkwood <em>&amp; </em>Wharton\u2019s and found his bicycle, and there was tied to it a box containing the patented shower head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Another officer, Staines, testified that he was a night watchman in the locality where Kirkwood &amp; Wharton\u2019s place of business was situated; that he went around the corner of the yard and saw the appellant standing with a large package; that he said to the appellant : \u201cCome on out to the side walk,\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to go there, and he wanted to get his bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">A witness by the name of Ives testified that he was vice-president of Kirkwood &amp; Wharton\u2019s; that in his opinion he was the first one on the premises after the burglary; that he opened the place each morning and upon the occasion in question he found the back door open about 6:30 in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The conviction is attacked upon two grounds: First, that there was a variance between the allegation and proof of ownership; second, that the admission of the testimony of Officer Kilday was in violation of the statute regulating the introduction of evidence of confession of one under arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">On the matter of ownership, we regard the appellant\u2019s position as unsound. The evidence, substantially all of which we have quoted, is not inconsistent with the averment naming Wharton as the owner. The suggestion that it belonged to a partnership would not sustain the claim of variance because in such case the allegation and proof of ownership of either partner was sufficient. Code of Crim. Proc., Art. 457; Coats v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 257; Davis v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 454; Branch\u2019s Ann. Penal Code, Sec. 2434. The testimony of Ives that he was vice-president does not show that the property was owned by a corporation, but if the contrary were true, Wharton, being in possession of the property, the allegation of ownership in .him was appropriate. If the real ownership of property be in a corporation but the property in the possession of an individual, that is, under his care, control and management, it will satisfy the law to name him as the owner. Bailey v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 426; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Branch\u2019s Ann. Penal Code, page 1325 and cases listed; Guyon v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 230 S. W. Rep., 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Concerning the confession, the bill of exceptions discloses that in the absence of the jury inquiry was made of the witness Kilday, and that he gave testimony to the effect that while under arrest, appellant said he entered the house, took out the articles and \u201cwas hauling it off on the bicycle when arrested.\u2019\u2019 Upon the return of the jury the witness gave before them this testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cMcGoldrick, after being questioned a while, confessed he had gone into Kirkwood &amp; Wharton\u2019s place and took a kitchen sink out of there, a patented shower head for a bath, and he told me where his bicycle was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">\u201c1 went over on Crockett St. back of the fence of Kirkwood &amp; Wharton\u2019s, and there I found his bicycle, and tied to this was a box which contained the patent shower head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Whether this was <em>res gestae </em>is not disclosed by the bill. If <em>res gestae, </em>it was admissible. Moore v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 58; Koller v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 498; Branch\u2019s Ann. Penal Code, Sec. 83. To show error, it was appellant\u2019s burden, by his bill, to show that it was not admissible. Manning v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 214. From Kilday\u2019s testimony it appears that he saw the appellant immediately after his arrest and while he was in possession of a part of the stolen property; that he learned from him the location of the bicycle and found the bicycle to which was tied the box containing other articles stolen from the premises described in the indictment. Whether the appellant was with him at the time does not definitely appear, but from the expression in the bill that he was \u201chauling off the property on his bicycle when arrested\u201d the inference might be drawn that the evidence adduced was <em>res gestae. </em>We do not wish to intimate that even if it were not <em>res gestae </em>it would be inadmissible. As to that it is unnecessary to express an opinion, suffice it to say that the bill of exceptions fails to show error in its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Finding no error warranting a reversal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A61\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
