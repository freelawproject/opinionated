This court, in the recent case of Russell v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 512, 228 S. W. Rep., 566, decided at the present term, held the provisions of subdivision (a) of Sec. 16, supra, to be so indefinite as not to measure up to the requirements of a law specifically making any act an offense, we reserved and ordered dismissed a prosecution thereunder. We are unable to differentiate the present case from the principle announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in the said Russell case. If appellant herein operated and backed his car at a greater rate of speed than that allowed by the provisions of the highway law, or failed to sound the signals made requisite by the terms of said law, or if his act was such as to make him guilty thereunder of an aggravated assault, he should be proceeded against in a proper manner for the offense so committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Following the Russell case, the allegations of the complaint herein charge no offense, and the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
