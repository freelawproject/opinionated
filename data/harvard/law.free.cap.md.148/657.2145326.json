Isberg and Eleanor L. Isberg, his wife, were the owners of the property on which both houses were under construction and erected; that subsequently thereto and on the 22nd day of Hovember, 1922, Ernest A.

That no cause is shown for equitable relief. 2. That it does not appear whether the alleged contract for the erection of the two dwelling houses mentioned in the bill was a joint contract or a several contract. 3. That plaintiff has not shown how much is due on each dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill of complaint. The case comes up on an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In the opinion filed by the learned chancellor the following reasons are assigned for his conclusion: 1. Insufficiency of description of the property. 2. Failure to1 apportion the sum. claimed. 3. Joint demand against both owners without any statement as to whether the houses wore erected under a joint contract for both, or under separate contracts for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The first reason is not in our opinion valid. The claim as filed describes several lots by numbers designated upon a plat duly recorded among the land records of Harford County, the lib\u00e9r and folio being given, and also refers to tbe deeds by which they were conveyed. It was not necessary to state specifically that they were contiguous lots, and the fact that they may have contained more land than was necessary does not affect the validity of the lien. Provision is made by sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of article 63 of tbe Code for having* proper boundaries fixed on proper application by the owner both before and pending proceedings for the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien and, if he fails to avail himself of these provisions, he cannot avoid the lien merely because too much land is claimed. <em>Fulton v. Parlett, </em>104 Md. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Tbe second reason is also invalid, assuming that the right to claim a lien attached while the lots on. which both of the houses were built belonged to the same persons. <em>Miller v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Barroll, </em>14 Md. 183. A failure to apportion a claim does not defeat the claim, as section 21 provides as the only penalty for failure to make such apportionment that \u201cotherwise such claim shall be postponed to other lien creditors.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Parlett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">And the bill expressly alleges that \u201cat the time of the delivery of the first material * * * and for some time thereafter, Ernest A. Isberg and Eleanor L. Isberg, his wife, werte the owners of the property on which both houses were under \u25a0construction and erected,\u201d and that the conveyance to Catherine May Isberg of the lot on which one of the houses was being erected was not until November 22nd, 1922, nearly two months after the buildings were begun; and it appears from the bill of particulars filed with the claim that prior to that conveyance the bulk of the materials had been actuaily delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In this connection it is appropriate to- notice an additional objection urged in his brief by counsel for appellee, that the lien claim does not set forth that appellant\u2019s contract with the contractor was entire and indivisible, or that there was an intention from the beginning to furnish all the material that would be required by the contractor. A similar objection was disposed of in <em>Trustees etc. v. Heise &amp; Co., </em>44 Md. at p. 469. There it was said by this Court through Judge Alvey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cThe account, as stated and filed with the claim for lien,- * * * shows that the materials were continuously furnished within the period stated (between April 3rd, 1812, and February 14th, 1873), during the progress of the building. The items are very numerous, and deliveries were made at short intervals of a few days, as the materials were wanted at the building; and this course of dealing continued during the entire period covered by the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cThe lien law * * * speaks o-f the <em>contract </em>for furnishing work or materials to- the builder, or other person than the owner; but we do not understand from this that it is incumbent upon the claimant to establish\u2019 the fact that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>an <em>express </em>antecedent contract made with respect to the exact quantity of work or materials to he done or furnished by him. In the absence of evidence of such express contract, the character of the account, the time within which the work was done or the materials were furnished, and the object of the work or materials, may afford proper grounds for the presumption that the work was, done or the materials were furnished with reference to' an understanding from the commencement that such work or materials should he done or furnished, if required by the builder; and in such case, it is from the last items in the account that the notice, and the time within which to take the lien, should date. If this were not so, in every ease where there is no express contract,, the mechanics or material man would he under the necessity of taking several liens during the progress of a single building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The above quotation applies to. the facts of the present case as they appear from, the bill and exhibits. Here the materials were furnished continuously at intervals of a few days from October 4th, 1922, to July 2nd, 1923; the period covered being about nine months. See also <em>Maryland Brick Co. v. Dunkerly, </em>85 Md. at p. 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Much that has been said in discussing the chancellor\u2019s second objection applies to the third. As the lots on which both the buildings were erected were owned by the same persons at the time the contract for the delivery of the goods was made and the bulk of the materials were delivered; and as we have held that the contract was continuous and the lien attached as to the entire bill as of the time of this single ownership (see <em>Miller v. Barroll, supra; Fulton v. Parlett, supra; Maryland Brick Co. v. Dunkerly, supra; Same v. Spellings, </em>76 Md. 341) it was immaterial whether there was as between, builder and owners a joint contract for both houses, or a separate contract for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Mor do we find any insurmountable difficulty in the use of the words \u201cAce. Miss Catherine Isberg,\u201d after the words \u201csold to Herman Zeigler,\u201d and before the words \u201cmaterials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for two houses at Otter Point, McL,\u201d in the bill of particulars attached to the lien claim.\u201d If necessary to make the bill of particulars consistent with the lien claim to which it is attached, and which expressly refers to it, as containing^ an itemized statement of the materials furnished, the words \u201cAcc. Miss 'Catherine Isberg\u201d -should be treated as surplusag-e. With a very much less liberal provision for amendment than is contained in section 41 of article 63 of the Code (which is probably the most liberal to be found anywhere in our statutes), any court would permit those words to be stricken out. Indeed nothing in the bill of particulars except the items of materials-, dates, and prices are necessary to make the claim complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The reason for inserting those words is made perfectly plain by the bill of complaint, and even without that explanation, no one examining the record, and reading the entire lien claim as filed, oo-uld suppose that <em>all </em>the materials mentioned in the bill of particulars, said to' have been furnished \u201cfor two- houses at Otter Point, Md.,\u201d were for the account of Miss Catherine Isberg; or have failed to- understand (a) just what was furnished; (b) that the claim was for a lien on both houses; (c) who. were the owners or reputed owners-; (d) who was1 the contractor to- whom the materials were furnished; (e) the lots on which the lien was claimed; (f) the character of the buildings. In other words it contained'all that the statute required to- make it a valid lien. And the bill alleges and the demurrer admits that notice of an intention to claim a lien was given in proper time to the owners of both lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Mor does the explanation in the bill of complaint constitute a waiver of the lien against the property of the defendants other than Catherine May Isberg, as -contended by -appellee. It says merely that, as between the builder and the several -owners^ Catherine is the debtor, because her mother and father have paid the builder for their house. But it does not say that plaintiff for that reason had released his lien against the property of Mr. -and Mrs. Isberg.. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>contrary both the claim as filed, and the bill of complaint, distinctly claim a lien against both properties, and the bill alleges that plaintiff is unable to apportion bis. claim because he does not know what part of the materials went into each house. That apparently is the reason the claim was filed against both properties rather than against the property which was conveyed by Mr. and Mrs. Isberg to Catherine. See <em>Fulton v. Parlett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">It remains to consider the objection urged in appellees\u2019' brief that the contractor was not made a party defendant. It seems rather late to make that point. It evidently was not considered by the chancellor, and, so far as the record shows, was not made below. Bnt, apart from that consideration, the point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Under our statute (section 25 of article 63 of Code-: \u201cIf the proceeding is by bill in equity, the same proceedings shall be had as used by the courts, of equity to enforce other liens and the court shall decree a sale and appoint a trustee to make sale thereof and shall apportion the proceeds of such sale among the persons entitled to liens according to their respective rights.\u201d It has been repeatedly held that the proceedings are <em>in rem. Shryock v. Hensel, </em>95 Md. 626; <em>Kelly v. Gilbert, </em>78 Md. 438; <em>Long Contracting Co. v. Albert, </em>116 Md. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The-proceeding is analogous to a common law foreclosure proceeding, the contractor, who. owes for labor or materials, being somewhat in the same situation, relatively, as the mortgagor who. has assigned his entire interest in the- mortgaged property; that is, he has no- interest in the proceeding <em>m rem^ </em>but owes the debt for which a lien has attached to another\u2019s property. Mr. Miller, in Ms excellent book on <em>Equity Procedure, </em>says at page 76: \u201cIn case -of assignment by the mortgagor of bis entire interest the assignee- only should be made a party, the mortgagor in such cases being neither a necessary or proper party, unless, be has warranted the title to his assignee, or unless a personal judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>sought against him.\u201d However, in <em>Worthington v. Lee, </em>2 Bland, 678, it is said that a mortgagor who has not been legally divested of his whole interest is a <em>necessary </em>party, while one who- has an interest in stating the .account, or against whom a judgment may be obtained for balance, is a <em>proper </em>party. See also- <em>Holmes v. Humphreys, </em>187 Mass. 513; <em>Hilton Bridge Construction Co. v. N. Y. Central etc. R. Co., </em>145 N. Y. 390. Hndoubtedly the contractor could have been made a party defendant at the request of the owners, and is frequently joined as a defendent voluntarily by the plaintiff; but he is not a <em>necessary </em>party.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In considering the matters presented by this appeal it is important to keep in' mind the provision of section 41 of article 63, that \u201cthis article shall be construed and have the same effect as laws which give general jurisdiction or are remedial in their nature; \u00e1nd such amendments shall, from time to time and at any time, be made in the proceedings, commencing with the claim or lien to be filed and extending to all subsequent proceedings^ as may be necessary and proper; provided that the amount of the claim or lien filed shall not in any case be enlarged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Real Estate Co. v. Phillips, </em>90 Md. 515, and <em>Fulton v. Parlett, supra, </em>are illustrations of the- length this \u2018Court has felt constrained to go in obedience to the spirit of that section. In the former case Judge Fowler quotes from <em>Blake v. Pitcher Wilson, </em>46 Md. 464, \u201cthe spirit in which the mechanic\u2019s lien law is to be interpreted, has been prescribed by, the Legislature and impressed in such strong terms upon its face that no court can mistake its meaning\u201d; and adds: \u201cIt is to be construed in the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and material men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In our opinion there was error in the order sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill of complaint, and the case must be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">If the evidence supports the allegation that Mr. and Mrs. Isberg have paid for their house, that Catherine May Is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>berg\u2019s house has not been paid for, and that there is a balance due plaintiff, the decree should direct Catherine\u2019s property to be first sold to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s claim, if the amount found to be due him is not paid by a given date.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings, with costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Parke and Walsh, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
