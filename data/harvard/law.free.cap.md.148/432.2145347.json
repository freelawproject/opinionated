Judgment on the demurrer was entered in favor of the defendant for costs, and the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The question raised by the demurrer is whether the declaration alleges any provable damage to the plaintiffs, from the highway obstruction mentioned, for which the present suit may be maintained. In regard to the principle of law applicable to the case there is no dispute.\" It is thus stated in <em>Houck v. Wachter, </em>34 Md. 269: \u201cThe obstruction of a highway is a common nuisance, and, being a wrong of a-public nature, the remedy is by indictment; it is not in itself a ground of civil action by an individual, unless he has suffered from it some special and particular damage, different not merely in degree, but different in kind from that experienced in common with other citizens. In such case the actual damage constitutes the gist of the action, and must be averred and proved.\u201d This general principle has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>slated and applied in numerous decisions in other jurisdictions, and in the following Maryland cases subsequent to the one already cited: <em>Schall v. Nusbaum, </em>56 Md. 512; <em>Crook v. Pitcher, </em>61 Md. 510; <em>Lake Roland Co. v. Webster, </em>81 Md. 529; <em>Bembe v. Anne Arundel County, </em>94 Md. 327; <em>Walters v. Balto. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>120 Md. 644; <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. R. Co. v. Gilmor, </em>125 Md. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The real problem in such cases is to determine whether the injury sued for is sufficiently distinctive to support the 'action. In this case the closing of the bridge on Oak Street, between the plaintiffs\u2019 property and the nearest intersecting street to the west, is alleged to have converted into1 a <em>cul de sac </em>the street on which their place of business is located, and to have deprived them of the trade incident <em>to- </em>the use of the street by motorists as the most direct course of travel through the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>German Lutheran Church v. Baltimore, </em>123 Md. 152, Chief Judge Boyd said: \u201cWhere the vacation of the street is in front of the plaintiff\u2019s property or in the same block, so that his access, is cut off entirely, the. decisions hold either that it is a taking of the property, or at least that the owner is entitled to damages, and if under those circumstances his access is-cut off in one direction, so as to put his property in a <em>cul de sac, </em>perhaps most authorities hold that he is entitled tc damages.\u201d It appeared in the ease just cited that the appellant\u2019s property did not abut on the portion of the street which was closed, and the decision disallowing damages to the appellant was based largely upon that fact. The opinion referred to decisions holding that the owner of property which does abut on the part of the street closed is entitled to compensation if he is able to prove special damage, and said: \u201cBut it will be seen by an examination of them, that the vacation left the property in a <em>cul de sac </em>and in some instances there were special statutes.\u201d The ease of <em>Henderson v. Lexington, </em>132 Ky. 390, was then cited in the opinion as \u201can instructive one\u201d and as deciding that \u201cthe equitable and practicable rule is to limit the persons entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>compensation and to be made parties, to the property owners abutting on the street, -alley or highway proposed to be closed between the nearest streets intersected by the street, alley, or highway to be closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The reasoning of the opinion in <em>German Lutheran Church v. Baltimore </em>logically leads to- the conclusion that the owner of property is entitled to recover damages resulting from the closing of the street between his property and one of the two nearest intersecting thoroughfares. There is strong-authority for this view in the decisions of other courts. <em>Chicago v. Burcky, </em>158 Ill. 103; <em>In re Melon Street, </em>182 Pa. 397; <em>Highbarger v. Milford, </em>71 Kan. 331; <em>Chicago v. Baker, </em>86 Fed. 753; <em>Newark v. Halt, </em>78 N. J. L. 548; <em>Schimmelman v. Lake Shore etc. R. Co., 83 </em>Ohio St. 356; <em>Vandenburgh v. Minneapolis, 98 </em>Minn. 329; <em>Meighan v. Birmingham Terminal Co., </em>165 Ala. 591; <em>Re Attorney Street, </em>162 App. Div. 469, 147 N. Y. Sup. 599; <em>O'Brien v. Central Iron &amp; Steel Co., </em>158 Ind. 218. In 11 <em>Amer. &amp; Eng. Ann. Cas. </em>291, it is said: \u201cWith respect to obstructions requiring the taking of a more circuitous route, a distinction has been drawn between cases in which there is an intersecting highway between the plaintiff\u2019s property and the obstruction, and eases in which the obstruction places the plaintiff\u2019s property in a <em>cul de sac. </em>The latter kind of obstruction is regarded as a special injury even by courts that do -not regard the former as constituting special injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As the owners of property situated on Oak Street in such close proximity to the obstruction formed by the closing of the bridge as to be separated by it from the nearest intersecting street in that direction, the plaintiffs suffer a consequent injury which i's not shared by the general public. It is alleged in the declaration, and assumed by the demurrer, that the closing of the bridge has diverted the motor traffic upon which the garage business of the plaintiff's was dependent, with the result that the value of the enterprise has been virtually destroyed. This effect upon their property and! business interests is not a common but a special injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In <em>Garitee v. Baltimore, </em>53 Md. 439, and <em>Crook v. Pitcher, </em>61 Md. 310, <em>supra, </em>reference is made in the opinions to- the case of <em>Wilkes v. Hungerford Market Co., </em>2 Bing. N. C. 281: \u201cWhere a book seller, having a shop' by the side of a public thoroughfare, suffered loss, in his business in consequence of passengers having been diverted from the thoroughfare by the defendants\u2019 continuing an unauthorized obstruction across, it for an .unreasonable time,\u201d and this was held to be \u201ca damage sufficiently of a, private nature to form the subject of a civil action by the plaintiff.\u201d The distinction between the public and private injury caused by the obstruction was thus stated by Chief Justice Tindall: \u201cThe injury to the subjects in general is that they cannot walk in the same track as before; and for that cause alone .an action on the case would not lie; but the injury to- the plaintiff is the loss of a trade, which but for this obstruction to the general right of way he Would have enjoyed; and the law has said, from the Year Books downwards, that if a party has sustained any particular injury, beyond that which affects the public at large, au action will lie for redress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">It is said in 13 <em>R. C. L. </em>234: \u201cInterference with an established business is generally regarded as being a special injury, as whore an obstruction entirely prevents one from carrying on a business previously established or materially interferes with the access of customers to his store, or interferes with or interrupts travel in front of his place of business or diverts it to- the other side of the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In view of the conditions described in the declaration we are unable to hold that it is- demurrable. It avers a specific and substantial injury to the plaintiff\u00ae\u2019 business conducted on their property abutting upon a much used street, which is alleged to have been closed for want of repairs, through the negligence of the defendant corporation, during a period of more than four years. In our opinion these allegations present an issue as to. which a defense on the facts is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The contention that the damages claimed on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the alleged destruction of the plaintiffs\u2019 business are not susceptible of competent proof is ntot sustainable. The method of proving such a loss is discussed in <em>Evans v. Murphy, </em>87 Md. 498; <em>Shafer v. Wilson, </em>44 Md. 268; <em>Sterling v. Marine Bank, </em>120 Md. 396; <em>Rawlings v. Nash, </em>117 Md. 400; <em>Window Elevator Co. v. Hoffman, </em>107 Md. 637; <em>Mullen v. Belbin, </em>130 Md. 313; <em>Svea v. Packham, </em>92 Md. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed with costs, and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
