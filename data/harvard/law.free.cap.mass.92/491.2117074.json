He had kept a stock of furniture for sale at retail in Huntington, and the defendants, who were traders there, had usually a large account for goods sold to him and to persons in his employment, which he had been accustomed to settle at stated periods by giving his notes on time for the balances found due to them. On the 22d of September 1862 three such notes were outstanding, and not due, amounting together to $1185, which bad been discounted upon the indorsement of the payees. In consideration of the sale of the furniture, the defendants agreed to pay these notes, and gave also other notes to him amounting to $670, and also some smaller matters were ad\"usted at the same time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-10\">In order to prove Little\u2019s insolvency at the time of this translation, the plaintiffs, after putting in evidence various notes which had been allowed against bis estate, offered a note dated May 31st 1862, payable to Myer &amp; Wondra, the signature to which was admitted to be in Little\u2019s handwriting; and one of the plaintiffs testified on cross-examination that it was offered for proof against Little\u2019s estate, but upon Little\u2019s objection that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>its date had been fraudulently altered it was disallowed in the court of insolvency. The defendants objected to the admission of this note in evidence, but the objection was overruled. The plaintiffs were also allowed, under objection, to introduce in evidence the entry, on the 19th of September 1862, of an attachment of Little\u2019s real estate purporting to have been made on the day before, in the clerk\u2019s book of records of attachments, for the purpose of proving that his real estate had been attached before the 22d of September.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-4\">The defendants offered to prove that Little was reputed in Huntington and its vicinity to be a man of large property, and to be the owner of valuable real and personal estate; but the judge excluded the evidence. Witnesses subsequently called were however allowed to testify that his credit and solvency were unquestioned until his failure in December, or shortly before that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\">The plaintiffs contended that the sale was out of Little\u2019s usual course of business, and therefore <em>prima facie </em>evidence, under Gen. Sts. c. 118, \u00a7 91, that the defendants had reasonable cause to believe him insolvent. The defendants contended that even if it was out of the usual course of his business, yet inasmuch as it was a sale to preexisting creditors and indorsers it was governed by \u00a7 89, and not by \u00a7 91, and that the provision referred to in \u00a7 91 had no application to this case. The judge however ruled that the provision applied as well to cases under \u00a7 89 as to those under \u00a7 91.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-7\"><em>II.

The judge erred in ruling that the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>of Gen.

The sale of property by Little to the defendants was made on the 22d of September 1862. In order to impeach it, the plaintiffs were obliged to prove, among other things, the insolvency of Little at that time. The existence of a note against him in favor of Myer &amp; Wondra, dated May 31st 1862, would be pertinent evidence on that point. The fact that a note of that date, the signature of which was not denied, was in the hands of a person who claimed it as a creditor and attempted to prove it in the court of insolvency some months after-wards was proper to be submitted to the jury, notwithstanding the evidence that was drawn out on cross-examination tending to destroy its validity; for the jury must decide the matter upon all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">2. The entry in the book of records of attachments was competent evidence to prove the existence of an attachment of Little\u2019s real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">3. The evidence of the reputation of Little as to property ought to have been admitted. On the question of what the defendants had reasonable cause to believe concerning the solvency of Little at the time of the sale to them, such evidence is pertinent, and is often entitled to great weight. It is of the same character with the evidence which was held to be admissible in the cases cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">4. The construction which was given by the presiding judge to Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>118, \u00a7\u00a7 89,91, is the same which they received in <em>Nary </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>8 Allen, 451. The court found some difficulty in construing these two sections, but are of opinion upon reconsideration that t'ne construction given in that case was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
