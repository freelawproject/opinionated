Sts. c. 88, \u00a7 58. The defendant was a constable of that town, and had been ordered by the selectmen to kill all dogs going at large which were not so licensed and collared. The defendant with a pistol walked in the road past the plaintiff\u2019s house, stopping at a point fifty feet distant therefrom, and saw the dog within a few feet of the house, near the plaintiff\u2019s son, who had just been playing with him on the plaintiff\u2019s premises and near where he then was, and called the dog by his voice and a motion of his hand. The dog upon being so called left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>boy and went towards the defendant, to a point within ten feet of the fence, and the defendant then fired at him, putting a ball through his ear. The dog then ran, and the defendant got over the fence into the plaintiff\u2019s premises and pursued him, attempting to shoot him again, until he ran into the front door of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">Upon these facts judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>G.

The defendant entered the plaintiff\u2019s close without his consent. The dog was in his owner\u2019s door-yard, and near his boy, who had just been playing with him. But for the defendant\u2019s interference, there is nothing to show that he would not have remained there quietly. The defendant first enticed him away, from the boy, and then entered the close for the purpose of killing him. We do not think the dog was \u201c at large,\u201d in the sense of the statute, when the defendant first called him' away from the boy. If he went at large afterward, he was set at large by the defendant, who could acquire no right by that act to enter the close of his owner for the purpose of killing him. The damages not being agreed by the parties, the plaintiff will have judgment for nominal damages only</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
