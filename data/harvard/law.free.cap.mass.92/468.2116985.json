Subsequently Brown was put into insolvency, on petition of creditors; the assignee in insolvency demanded this broom brush of the plaintiff; and thereafter the defendant sued out a writ against Brown in Vermont, and attached the broom brush, which remained there in the plaintiff\u2019s possession, and sold the same upon the execution which he obtained in his suit. The defend ant offered to prove that the conveyance by Brown to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>was in fraud of creditors; but the evidence was excluded, Both parties were and are citizens of Massachusetts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, under instructions authorizing them to do so; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\"><em>D. </em>Aiken, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhlF\">The attachment in Vermont was lawful. <em>Dehon </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>4 Allen, 552.

At the time of the defendant\u2019s attachment on his writ against Brown in Vermont, the plaintiff was in possession of the property under a claim of title, and all Brown\u2019s interest in the property had passed to his assignee in insolvency under proceedings in this commonwealth by a title which the defendant, a citizen of Massachusetts, could not controvert. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>8 Allen, 520. <em>Dehon </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>4 Allen, 552, 553; <em>S.
