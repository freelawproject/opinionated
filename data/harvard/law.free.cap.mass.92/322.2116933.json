Mather.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">At the trial in this court, before <em>Hoar, </em>J., the plaintiffs offered to prove that this agreement was made and delivered on the 21st of April 1857, and that it was intended by the parties to apply to a lease from the owner of the fee of a building on State Street, Boston, which lease belonged to the defendant, and that of the term created by the said lease there remained eight years unexpired, and that the lease was subject to a ground rent, reserved by it to the owners of the fee; that in the building so leased there were a printing press, boiler, engine, types, fixtures and furniture, and that a newspaper called the \u201c Times \u201d was printed and published in said building; that John C. Pratt, before making said agreement declared on, had agreed and bargained with the defendant for a release and conveyance of a small portion of the land included in said lease, for which Pratt agreed to pay the sum of $1215; that at the time this agreement was made, it was contemplated by the plaintiffs and the defendant that the plaintiffs were to sell the good will of the \u201c Times \u201d newspaper and the press on which it was printed; that there was no other building anywhere, held or owned by the defendant by virtue of a lease, or in which he had any interest, which contained a press of any description, a boiler or engine, or types, or in which a newspaper called the \u201c Times \u201d was printed and published, or for any interest in which John C. Pratt was bound or had agreed to pay the defendant, or any one, $1215 ; and this evidence was offered for the purpose of showing to what property said agreement applied and referred. The plaintiffs also offered to prove that immediately after the execution of the agreement declared on they and the defendant went to an attorney, and directed him to make the proper conveyances to carry out said agreement, and that said conveyances were made and agreed to by both the defendant and the plaintiff's, in which said lease the \u201c Times \u201d newspaper press, boiler and engine, fixtures and furniture are fully described, but that said conveyances were not signed, merely because it was necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to obtain the date of some paper referred to therein; and that, before the date was obtained, the defendant refused to perform his said agreement and sign and deliver said conveyances ; and the plaintiffs produced said conveyances and offered them as evidence, for the purpose of pointing out and showing to what the said agreement in suit applied and had reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">The defendant objected to all this testimony, and contended that the agreement declared on was insufficient in law to bind him ; that it could not be ascertained from the agreement itself what property was to be sold and conveyed ; that it was void for uncertainty; that it did not comply with the requisitions of the statute of frauds ; and that paroi evidence could not be received for any of the purposes for which it was offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">The judge reserved the questions arising on the agreement, and on the evidence offered by the plaintiffs, for the consideration of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>J. G. Abbott, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATt\">The memorandum of the agreement is sufficient of itself, and could not be mistaken by one standing in the situation in which the parties stood at the time, or knowing what building, owned or held in any way by the defendant, answered to the description and requirements of the memorandum. Although this agreement may in some respects appear uncertain, it points out the evidence which will make it certain. Browne on St. of Frauds, \u00a7\u00a7 383, 385, 409 <em>a. Howe </em>v. <em>Dewing, </em>2 Gray, 476. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>16 Pick. 229. The paroi evidence was competent and sufficient for the purposes for which it was offered. See authorities before cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-8\"><em>G. A. Somerby, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b332-9\">Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYM\">The memorandum\u00bb required by the statute of frauds to maintain an action on a contract for the sale of any interest in land must clearly show, either by itself, or taken in connection with some other writing contemporaneous with or referred to in the memorandum, what that interest is. The court may indeed, for the purpose of interpreting the memorandum, put itself in the position of the parties, and ascertain by oral evidence their relations to any property which would satisfy the terms of the memorandum ; but, seen in the light of these circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>writing, whether consisting of one paper or several, must de scribe or identify the subject of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The memorandum on which the plaintiffs rely describes thy. thing to be bought and sold as 11 the whole property, from cellar to top, including lease, press, boiler and engine, type, fixtures, furniture,\u201d &amp;c. If it is allowable (of which there is some doubt) for the court to refer, when the memorandum does not, to the instrument of lease to the defendant, in order to supply the duration of the lease mentioned in the memorandum, the difficulty still remains that the memorandum is not limited to property owned or held by the defendant, and the words used are certainly not less applicable to the whole estate than to a leasehold interest in it. It is \u201c the whole property, from cellar to top,\u201d not \u201c your property \u201d or \u201c your interest in the property,\u201d which is to be bought and sold. It is not described as \u201c consisting of,\u201d but as <em>\u201c </em>including,\u201d the lease, printing press, fixtures and furniture. The agreement of Pratt with the defendant, as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of evidence, was \u201c for a release and conveyance of a small portion of the land included in said lease; \u201d but even if Pratt\u2019s agreement was confined to a leasehold interest, it does not follow that the property which the defendant agreed to sell to the plaintiff was no greater estate. The stipulations as to payment of \u201c ground rent\u201d are not expressed with such definiteness as to clear up the ambiguity of the principal words of description. To hold such a memorandum, which does not show whether it relates to an estate in fee, for life or for years, sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds, would be to practically do away with the statute, and to disregard precedents of the highest authority. <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>9 H.
