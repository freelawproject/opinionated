JAMES T. DIAMOND</parties>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b28-13\"><em>Present: </em>Nash, P.J., Cox and Sgarzi, JJ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b28-14\">Case tried to <em>Lee, J., </em>in the Fourth District Court of Bristol.</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b28-15\">No. 16659.</docketnumber>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b28-16\">\n<em>Cox, J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">This is an action of contract in which there was a. finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $308.69 for millinery. <em>The princi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>pal question is whether the defendant as an individual or a corporation formed by the defendant is liable for the price of the millinery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Under an agreement dated March 3, 1951 the plaintiff had been delivering millinery on consignment to one Bernice Schuster doing business as Ann Marie Fashion Center, 64 Washington St., North Attleboro, the terms being that upon sale or failure to account for the millinery consigned, the plaintiff was to be paid at the rate of 75% of the price branded on the millinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Subsequently the plaintiff continued on the same terms to do business with one Snyder who appears to have taken over the business and to have conducted it under the same name and style of Ann Marie Fashion Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The defendant appeared on the scene in 1956. On January 4, 1956, his wife wrote the plaintiff that Mr. Snyder had sold the Ann Marie Fashion Center and \u201cAs new owner <em>l </em>would like to continue to carry your hats on the same basis as Mr. Snyder did\u201d. On January 10, 1956 the defendant\u2019s wife again wrote the plaintiff thanking it for a letter of January 6 and stating <em>\"We </em>will try to live up to the terms of your company\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">During the month of January the defendant formed a corporation under the name of Ann Marie, Inc. to carry on the business of Ann Marie Fashion Center. In March, April, and May, 1957, eight checks with the name Ann Marie, Inc. printed on them, drawn on a bank in North Attleboro, payable to the plaintiff and signed by the defendant James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>T. Diamond were received by the plaintiff and deposited in its account. These checks totalled $240.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">On or about July 1, 1957, one of the plaintiff\u2019s officers visited the store to straighten out the account. There was an accounting on a business statement of the plaintiff\u2019s upon which was noted \u201creceived on account $100. balance due $308.69\u201d. Below the notation was something written in the defendant\u2019s hand and the defendant\u2019s signature. On the same day, July 1, 1957, the defendant gave his personal check to the plaintiff on which was noted \u201con acct. Ann Marie Inc.\u201d. This check was deposited by the plaintiff in its account.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On August 14, 1957, the plaintiff wrote Ann Marie, Inc. protesting the ignoring of a letter a week for the preceding month and demanding the return of merchandise and a check.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s vice president testified that the plaintiff never received any notice of Ann Marie\u2019s incorporation or to change billing. He also testified that after 1956 the plaintiff extended credit to Mr. and Mrs. Diamond. There was further testimony that the plaintiff did not file a claim with the assignee of Ann Marie, Inc. Other communications from the plaintiff to \u201cAnn Marie\u201d were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The judge in his special findings appeared to be in doubt as to the existence of the corporation, but, even if we assume that the allegation in the defendant\u2019s answer, that the plaintiff did business with a corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ration, referred to a corporation known as \u201cAnn Marie, Inc.\u201d and that the existence of such a corporation was admitted because the plaintiff did not demand proof of it in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a730, see also <em>Liddell v. Middlesex Motor Co., </em>275 Mass. 346, 352, nevertheless the point is not decisive because the evidence did not as matter of law require the finding urged by the defendant that the corporation is the debtor. The question was one of fact and the judge was warranted in concluding on the evidence that the defendant was individually liable, even though he might have reached the opposite conclusion, a circumstance which he recognized by allowing the defendant\u2019s request No. 7 that a finding for the defendant was warranted. <em>Bresnick v. Heath, </em>292 Mass. 293, 298-299; <em>Perry v. Hanover, </em>314 Mass. 167, 173-176; <em>Hoffman v. Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54; <em>Brodeur v. Seymour, </em>315 Mass. 527; <em>Liberatore v. Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538; <em>Ricciardone v. Carvelli, </em>334 Mass. 228, 231; <em>Quality Finance Co. v. Hurley, </em>337 Mass. 150, 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">That the question whether an individual or corporation is liable for an obligation is ordinarily one of fact, finds support in the decided cases. There was evidence to support the finding. Mrs. Diamond\u2019s letter of January 4, 1956 stating that \u201cAs new owner <em>I </em>would like to continue to carry your hats on the same basis as Mr. Snyder did\u201d and her letter of January 10, 1956 to the plaintiff stating that <em>\u201cWe </em>will try to live up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>terms of your company\u201d, these letters were by Mrs. Diamond, but they indicate that she was not speaking for a corporation and it is not contended that she rather than her husband should be held liable. The accounting on July 1, 1957 showing a balance due of $308.69 over the defendant\u2019s signature, the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s vice president that no notice of the incorporation was received by the plaintiff, that no request was made to change the billing, and that credit was extended to Mr. and Mrs. Diamond, support the judge\u2019s finding. The eight checks of Ann Marie, Inc., the plaintiff\u2019s letter of August 14, 1957 addressed to Ann Marie, Inc., the other communications by the plaintiff to Ann Marie, the defendant\u2019s personal check, which he gave on July i, 1957 at the time of the accounting, with the endorsement \u201con account Ann Marie In.c.\u201d, were at most admissions or evidence in support of the defendant\u2019s contention but all together fall short of requiring a finding for the defendant. <em>Powers v. Macris, </em>314 Mass. 260; <em>Aluminum Smelters, Inc. v. Twombly, </em>330 Mass. 577; <em>Georgetown Sand </em>&amp; <em>Gravel Co., Inc. v. Burr, </em>338 Mass. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Count I of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges $329.57 as a balance due for goods sold and delivered on accounting. Count II is on an account annexed alleging \u201cBalance due as of July 1, 1957 $329.57\u201d. It was under Count II that the judge found for the plaintiff. The defendant contends that the judge erred in finding for the plaintiff under the count on the account annexed as the item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>therein is not \u201c. . . correctly described by any one of the common counts according to the natural import of its terms.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a77 Ninth. We see no merit to the contention. The case was fully tried on its merits. It is a settled rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201c. . . a party who desires to rely upon a variance or similar defect must call the attention of the trial judge clearly and plainly to the defect relied upon, so that amendments can be made, or further proof supplied, or proper rulings made at the trial,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\"><em>Berwin v. Levenson, </em>311 Mass. 239, 246, and cc. See also <em>Dumas v. Meyer, </em>296 Mass. 57, 59; <em>Krinsky v. Stevens Coal Sales Co. Inc., </em>309 Mass. 528, 533; <em>John T. D. Blackburn, Inc. v. Livermore, </em>317 Mass. 20. Nowhere in the report does it appear that the defect was \u201cclearly and plainly\u201d .called to the judge\u2019s attention so that the formal defect in pleading could have been corrected by appropriate amendment in order to accomplish substantial justice. The defendant was not harmed by a finding for less than the amount alleged to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">It should be noted that the finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $308.69 finds clear, if not conclusive, support in the accounting of July 1, 1957 signed by the defendant. Count I is based on that accounting and is a count on an account stated even though the amount was incorrectly pleaded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201cAn \u2018account stated\u2019 is an acknowledgement of the existing condition of liability between the parties. From it the law implies a promise to pay whatever balance is thus acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>to be due. It thereby becomes a new and independent cause of action, so far as that a recovery may be had upon it without setting forth or proving the separate items of liability from which the balance results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b34-7\">Lewis &amp; Lewis of Taunton, for the Plaintiif.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay\">Howard C. Abbott for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>Chace v. Trafford, </em>116 Mass. 529, 532; <em>Rizkalla v. Abusamra, </em>284 Mass. 303, 306-307; <em>Berwin v. Levenson, </em>311 Mass. 239, 245. A finding for the plaintiff for the correct amount could have been sustained under Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">As we see no error prejudicial to the defendant, an order should be entered dismissing the report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
