There was no evidence indicating that the plaintiff or any of its agents were ever aware of any such changes. There was evidence that the defendant had paid all of the rent and water charges due from him up until the time of the assign-men of the lease to Delmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The court found that there were no material alterations made in the premises and that such as were made, were done without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The case is before the Appellate Division upon the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for ruling No. 3, which reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cThe assent by the lessor to the assignment, accepting rent from the assignee and permitting material alterations on the demised premises \u2014 discharges the lessee from any subsequent breaches in the lease, one of which is the payment of rent.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s third request. The judge found as a fact that no material alterations were made and that such alterations as were made were done without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">It is elementary that findings of fact will not be reversed unless plainly wrong. <em>Monast v. Brodeur, </em>329 Mass. 767; <em>Zeleski v. Zeleski, </em>330 Mass. 132; <em>Trade Mutual v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Peters, </em>291 Mass. 79, 83-84; <em>Berry v. Kyes, </em>304 Mass. 56, 57-58. Since the specific finding of the court in the denial of the defendant\u2019s third request was amply supported by the evidence and since such finding must be sustained, if it can be supported upon any reasonable view of the evidence, including such rational inferences as the evidence warrants, we conclude, therefore, that the judge\u2019s ruling was correct. <em>Di Noto v. Gilchrist Co., </em>332 Mass. 391; <em>Hosmer v. C., </em>302 Mass. 495; <em>Moss v. Old Colony Tr. Co., </em>246 Mass. 139; <em>State St. Tr. Co. v. Lawrence Mfg.
