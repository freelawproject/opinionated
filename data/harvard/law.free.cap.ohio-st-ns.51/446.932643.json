Johnson, the said Mary Ann A. Johnson, duly elected to take under the said will of her late husband, and accepted the trusts created thereby, paid the debts of the estate, and in that behalf filed her settlement in the probate court, which settlement was duly approved. The said William C. Johnson, left an estate wholly unencumbered and free from, all claims except the expenses of his last sickness and burial, as near as plaintiffs can ascertain and describe as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>follows: A house and lot on Wood street in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, worth $10,000; two lots on Wilson avenue in said city, purchased from R. Arnold and known as lots 128 and 129, worth $3,250; a farm in Indiana; cash on deposit in The People\u2019s Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, Ohio, $660; cash on hand and on deposit, stocks, bonds, credits and chattel property, in all, in real and personal property, in amount and value not less than $50,000.

Johnson received, took possession of and had.and held, under and by virtue of the said will of her said husband and not otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">\u201cThat the said Mary Ann A. Johnson was of humble origin, of simple and plain habits, and moved in society of moderate demands,'was frugal and economical, and her manner of living, her personal tastes, wants and desires were fully gratified by the expenditure of a moderate sum of money; her expenditures in that behalf not exceeding the sum expended by her husband for the support of his family, to wit: The sum of fifty to seventy-five dollars per month for all proper purposes of her living and comfort for the period subsequent to her husband\u2019s death up to the time of her decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">\u201cThat early in the year 1885 defendant, Henry H. Johnson, then known and giving his name as Henry H. Harbazal, was a stranger to William C. and Mary Ann A. Johnson, he had been in Cleveland but a short time, having come from a distant state, was engaged as a clerk in a store at a salary barely sufficient to afford him a support, and possessed of no means. Desiring a room and board he applied to Mrs. Johnson, and a few weeks be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>fore the death of William C. Johnson began boarding with the family. For a short time immediately succeeding the death of her husband, Mary Ann A. Johnson managed her own affairs, or was aided therein by neighbors and friends with whom she had been acquainted many years; but very soon after his first knowledge of the family, defendant began working himself into an intimate friendship with Mary Ann A. Johnson, and evincing an interest in her welfare, assiduously cultivated her confidence and trust, and having succeeded in thus gaining her confidence, in order to further gain and hold her confidence, for the purpose hereinafter set forth, he dropped the name of Harbazal, and assumed the name of Johnson, and having obtained full knowledge of the terms and provisions of the will of William C. Johnson, and the nature, extent and value of the estate left by him as aforesaid, and well knowing the frugal habits and limited requirements and desires of the said Mary Ann A. Johnson, he was fully possessed of the knowledge that at her death (which was liable to occur at any time, she being somewhat aged, infirm and sick) a large estate would be left unconsumed by her, he exerted his influence over her and induced her to transfer to him the full control and management of said estate, and with the intent and purpose of gaining possession of said estate and of keeping and holding\u2019 the same as his own, and depriving plaintiffs thereof, fraudulently, unduly and designedly exerted his influence over the said Mary Ann A. Johnson, and by said means and for said purpose and without any consideration therefor, induced her to convey to him the said Wilson avenue lots, to transfer to him the balances of cash. on deposit in banks, to sell said Wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>street property, which she did for the sum of $10,000, paid to her, in cash, and turn the entire proceeds over to him, and to assign, transfer and convey to him all other property and assets of the estate of the said William C. Johnson. That with funds thus obtained or with funds which were the proceeds of property sold by him, defendant erected a house on the Wilson avenue lots at an expense of not less than $7,000, to which house when it was completed he took th\u00e9 said Mary Ann A, Johnson, then, and ever since the death of her husband, an aged, infirm and sick woman, and there kept her with him and fully under his control and influence until her death, which occurred on or about the - day of October, 1889. And by the same and like undue influences and in furtherance of his purpose aforesaid, he fraudulently and unduly influenced and induced the said Mary Ann A. Johnson to enter into agreements and contracts, the precise, nature of which is unknown to plaintiffs, and to make her will, bequeathing and devising to him every interest in property possessed by her or to which she was in any manner entitled, and to make him her executor, without bond or requirement to inventory or in any manner account for any of the estate received by him: All to the end and for the fraudulent purpose of placing all of the estate of William C. Johnson beyond the reach of plaintiffs, and making it appear as if the whole of said estate of William C. Johnson had been consumed and used by. the said Mary Ann A. Johnson, when in fact there had not been any diminution thereof, but on the contrary far less than the income, interests and profits thereof had been used or consumed by her, the said Mary Ann A. Johnson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u201cPlaintiffs further say that all liabilities of every kind and nature incurred by the said Mary Ann A. Johnson and the expenses of her last sickness and burial have been fully paid, and there are no debts against the estate of William C. Johnson or against the estate of Mary Ann A. Johnson, and there is nothing unsettled or undetermined but the payment or delivery to plaintiffs, who own and are entitled to the residue of the estate of William C. Johnson. That since defendant thus, as aforesaid, obtained title to and possession of the said estate of William C. Johnson, he has been engaged in numerous and extensive dealings in real estate and other financial transactions (the said estate composing and affording his sole capital); has traded and disposed of the Wilson avenue property, has used and speculated with, converted and invested, sold, transferred and reinvested all of said estate, and now has and holds title to the following property, as near as plaintiffs can ascertain or describe, as follows, to wit:\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">(Here follows a long .list of property, which for the sake of brevity is omitted.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">\u201cThe plaintiffs aver and charge that all of the said described and designated properties, and all other property, money, credits, stocks, bonds and chattels now owned and held by said defendant are the property, the proceeds of property, interest, profits, accumulations, g-rowth and increase and results of the property of the said William C. Johnson, so as aforesaid received and held in trust by the said Mary Ann A. Johnson, and so as aforesaid fraudulently obtained and converted by the said Henry H.

Johnson, took only a life estate in his property, with full power to use the same for her support as she might see fit, with remainder over of so much thereof as should not be consumed by her, to plaintiffs in error. The defendant in error claims, that by this will, Mrs. Johnson took an absolute estate in fee-simple of all the testator\u2019s property, and that the remaifider over to plaintiffs in error, is a limitation engrafted upon a fee, and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">If the claim of plaintiffs in error is right, the judgment of the courts below is wrong. But if the defendant in error-is right in his claim, then the demurrer to the petition was properly sustained, and the judgment of the courts below is .right.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">After providing for the payment of his debts,' the testator uses this language: \u201cI give and devise unto my beloved wife, Mary Ann A. Johnson, and her assigns, all of the remainder of my property, both real and personal, however the same may be known, or wheresoever the same may be situate, with full power to bargain, sell, convey, exchange or dispose of the same as she may think proper.\u201d That this part of the will standing-alone, would give to the widow a fee simple, can not be doubted; and if , what follows could be fairly construed as merely superadded words at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tempting to impose a limitation upon the fee thus devised, such limitation would, of course, be void, and the fee would remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The fact that after using\u2019 words which in themselves would give a fee, full power to bargain, sell, convey, exchange or dispose of the estate as she may think proper is expressly given to her by the testator, at once creates a slight inference that something less than a fee was intended; because a fee of its own force carries with it, and confers upon her the power, without express words from him to that effect, to bargain, sell, exchange, or dispose of the property as she may think proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">While the express addition of these powers to words giving a fee, would not have the effect in themselves to detroy the fee, yet when these express powers are taken in connection with what follows the part of the will above quoted, the intention of the testator to give to his wife only a life estate in his property becomes clear and manifest. After the quotation above given, the will proceeds as follows: \u201cBut, if, at the time of her decease, any of my said property shall remain unconsumed, my will is that the same be equally divided between my brothers and sisters and their children,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The plain intention of the testator as shown by the whole will, is, that the property is given to the widow to be by her used and consumed, and that while so using and consuming the same she is empowered to bargain, sell, convey, exchange, or dispose of the same as she may think proper, limited, however, in the exercise of such power, to the purpose for which the property is given to her, that is for her consumption. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The devise over to his brothers and sisters and their children, is of itself enough to show that the testator intended that his widow should use and consume the property only during her lifetime, and that he did not intend to empower her to dispose of the fee by gift during her life, nor by will at her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">This is clearly the intention of the testator, when effect is given to the whole will, and the intention should always govern. Unless the will conflicts with some provision of law, all other rules of construction must yield to the rule that the intention of the testator, as gathered from the whole will, must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The ease of <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Bowyer, </em>19 Ohio St., 490, is almost exactly like the case at bar. In that case the will gave all the testator \u2019 s proper ty to his widow, and gave her expressly unlimited power to sell on such terms as she might think best, or use in any manner as she might deem proper, and deeds to purchasers to execute, acknowledge and deliver in fee simple. In a subsequent item of the will, he devised at her death the property then remaining, to the Presbytery of Cincinnati. This court. held, that under that will, the widow took only a life estate, and life support, with power of sale for the benefit of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The second syllabus in that case is as follows: \u201cWhere, by one clause in a will, property is devised or bequeathed, by words <em>prima facie </em>importing an absolute estate, and by a subsequent clause is given in remainder to another person, the first devisee or legatee takes only a life estate, and the limitation over is valid.\u201d This syllabus correctly states the law, and the present case can not be distinguished therefrom, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>regard it as conclusive of the question here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">It is, therefore, clear that the widow took only a life estate, with remainder over to the brothers and sisters of the testator and their children, in ease of the decease of any of the brothers or sisters. The case of <em>Posegate </em>v. South, 46 O. S., 391, and the following cases, among many others cited by counsel for plaintiff in error, throw more or less light upon the question here involved. <em>Huston </em>v. Craighead, 23 Ohio St., 198; <em>Pruden </em>v. Pruden, 14 Ohio St., 251; <em>Giles </em>v. Little, 104 U. S., 291; <em>Howe </em>v.

S., 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Having construed this will as giving to the widow only an estate for life, it follows that the brothers and sisters of the testator had a vested remainder in so much of the estate as should remain unconsumed by her at her death. The amount of this vested remainder was uncertain so long as the widow continued to live, and the whole of it was liable to be divested in case she should consume the whole of the estate for her support during her lifetime. <em>Jeffers </em>v. <em>Lampson, </em>10 Ohio St., 101; <em>Linton </em>v. Laycock, 33 Ohio St., 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Perry on Trusts, in section 540, says that those in possession of a life estate under a legal title are implied or <em>quasi </em>trustees for the remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We regard this rule as applicable here, and that while the widow was given the. legel title with full possession, and power to use, dispose of and consume the estate, for her life support, the duty rested upon her, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the nature of a trust, to have clue regard for the rights of those in remainder, as to the part of the estate not consumed by her for her support. That while she could use and enjoy the estate to its fullest extent for her support, and consume the whole of it if necessary, she could not go beyond what would be regarded as good faith toward the remaindermen. The testator having so amply provided for the support of his wife, evidently contemplated good faith on her part towards his brothers and sisters. He therefore gave her the right to consume, but not to recklessly squander or give away, the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The widow holding this estate under this will, only for life, and as to the uneonsumed part thereof in trust for the remaindermen, such trust would be enforced as against one coming into possession of the estate with knowledge of the trust. <em>Shibla </em>v. Ely, 2 Halstead N. J. Ch., 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">If the facts stated in the petition are true, and upon demurrer they are regarded as true, the defendant received and holds the property in the petition described, as trustee for plaintiffs in error, and as such trustee he is liable to account to them as prayed for in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Defendant in error relies upon that clause of the will, in which the widow is empowered to dispose of the property as she may think proper; and he says that she did dispose of it as she thought proper when she gave it to him; and that giving the property to him was consuming it by her. We do not so construe the will. She had but a life estate, with power of disposition for the benefit of herself and the estate, and with a view of fairly preserving so much of the estate as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>not necessary for her support, for the use of those who were to succeed her in the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Again, it is arg\u2019ued, that it, does not <em>olecwly cvppem\" </em>by the will, that the testator intended to give the widow an estate less than a fee, and section 5970, of the Revised Statutes,'is cited. The answer to this is, that the intention of the testator is sufficiently clear, to induce us to be clearly of opinion, that the testator did not intend that his widow should bestow all his property upon the defendant, or any one else, and thereby cut out his own brothers and sisters and their children, and that if that had been his intention, he would at least have given his property to his widow absolutely in fee, and said nothing about a remainder over.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The court of common pleas erred in sustaining the demurrer and rendering judgment in favor of the defendant; and the circuit court erred in affirming the judgment of the common pleas. Both judgments are therefore reversed, and cause remanded to the court of common pleas, with instructions to overrule the demurrer, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
