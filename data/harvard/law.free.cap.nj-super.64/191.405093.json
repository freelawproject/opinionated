A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ADk\">Defendant was charged in three separate indictments with the crime of atrocious assault and battery, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:90-l, allegedly committed upon Nicholas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Scarano, Michael Scarano and Mary Scarano. He appeals a jury determination o\u00ed guilty in the Essex County Court on indictment No. 1658, involving the alleged assault upon Nicholas Scarano.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The incident upon which the indictments were based occurred on July 15, 195\u2019?'. Defendant Abbott resided at 19 Claremont Avenue, in Montclair. His next-door neighbors, with whom he shared a common driveway, were the Scaranos \u2014 Michael and Mary. On the day in question, Philip Pignatello, a relative of the Scaranos, was engaged in paving the Scaranos\u2019 half of the joint driveway. In the early afternoon Abbott approached Pignatello and asked if he could have some left-over asphalt. He explained to Michael Scarano that he wanted to construct a stopper between the two garages in order to prevent his door from swinging onto the Scarano property. Defendant was given the asphalt and commenced the erection of a stopper, in the form of a curb, about four inches high and eight to ten feet long.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">While Abbott was in the process of laying out the asphalt, Nicholas Scarano, 36-year-old son of Michael and Mary, arrived on the scene. Nicholas objected to the erection of the doorstop, and an argument ensued between him and defendant. The testimony is conflicting as to who hit the other first, but the heated words soon developed into blows and Nicholas was knocked to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The ensuing scuffle took place either in the joint driveway or on Abbott\u2019s property; it is clear that the scene of battle gradually progressed in the direction of defendant\u2019s garage. While Nicholas was still on the ground, his father approached Abbott, holding an ax which had been used by Pignatello earlier in the day and which the elder Scarano was returning to his basement when the fight began. Michael Scarano apparently was either attempting to strike defendant with the handle of the ax or trying to protect his son from the defendant. The State\u2019s witnesses testified that at this point Abbott pulled the ax from Michael\u2019s hand and chopped at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Nicholas, who had risen to his feet, hitting him on the head and knocking him down again. Having disposed of the son, he proceeded to flail the father, striking the latter\u2019s head four times with the ax.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Mary Scarano had previously rushed out of the house and she joined in the effort to wrest the ax from defendant. She was hit on the head and the side of the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Defendant testified that Nicholas had started, the brawl, and denied that he, Abbott, had intentionally struck any of the Scaranos with the ax. He also said that he fought with Mrs. Scarano only because she attacked him with a kitchen knife. He said that at one point he and the Scaranos were all scuffling for possession of the ax. His primary contention was that he acted entirely in self-defense; the implication was that the injuries of the Scaranos were accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The major error assigned on this appeal is in the trial court\u2019s instruction on defendant\u2019s duty to retreat. With respect to the elements of self-defense, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cIf you find the charges involved or either of them happened on the joint or common driveway and that the defendant had an available opportunity to retreat and you also find that he was or appeared to be threatened by assault and battery with imminent danger of life or serious bodily harm, again there is no duty to retreat. <em>On the other hand, under the latter circumstances, if you find that he did, not appear to he threatened by assault and battery with imminent danger of life or great bodily harm, he had a duty to retreat and if he failed to retreat the defense of self-defense would not avail him and would not constitute a defense to these charges </em>* * (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Preliminarily, we take note of defendant\u2019s failure to raise timely objection to the alleged erroneous portion of the trial judge\u2019s charge. Defendant merely objected to the refusal of the judge to charge certain of his requests, one of which included language from <em>State v. </em>Goldberg, 12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>293 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951) \u2014 but not language submitted in another request to charge, now alleged to constitute a correct charge on the subject of duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Our rules unequivocally provide that in a criminal proceeding error may not be urged as to any portion of the court\u2019s charge unless objection thereto is made before the jury retires to consider its verdict. <em>B. B. </em>3:7 \u2014 7(b) ; <em>B. B. </em>1 :5 \u2014 1(a), made applicable by <em>B. R. 2 </em>:5. We may, of course, notice \u201cplain errors affecting substantial rights of the defendant,\u201d even though they were not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention. <em>B. B. </em>1:5-1 (a); <em>R. B. 2:5. </em>However, since we do not find error in the instruction in question, we need not consider the repercussions of defendant\u2019s failure to contest the charge. See <em>State v. Perrella, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>550, 554 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952) ; <em>State v. Baechlor, </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>378, 394 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Defendant objects to the italicized portion of the charge as an incorrect statement of our law, as expounded in <em>State v. Goldberg, supra. </em>In <em>Goldberg </em>a son was indicted for simple assault and battery upon his father. In reversing the conviction, the court deemed it error to conclude, as the trial judge had done, that defendant \u2014 upon being approached by his father with a light wooden reel \u2014 -had an unqualified duty to retreat. Judge Jayne there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201c* # \u00bb we proceed no further than to state that in our opinion where one is not, or does not reasonably appear to be, assailed or threatened with imminent danger to life or great bodily injury, his acceptance, of an available opportunity to retreat is not in the law of this State <em>a positive duty. </em>The opportunity to retreat is, however, in such cases a factual element to be considered together with all the other accompanying and surrounding circumstances in determining whether the person thus assailed used only such resistance as in all the relevant circumstances was necessary, or reasonably appeared to be necessary, for self-protection.\u201d (12 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>307)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The, broad language in <em>Goldberg </em>was subsequently qualified by an opinion upholding, in a prosecution for assault with intent to kill, a jury charge which read: \u201cIf the injury apprehended could he otherwise avoided, the accused was bound to avoid the danger without resorting to violence.\u201d <em>State v. Centalonza, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>154, 159 <em>(App. Div. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>1952). In <em>Centalonza, </em>at <em>p. </em>161, the court rejected defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Goldberg </em>as support for his argument that he was not under a positive duty to retreat, pointing out that <em>Goldberg </em>\u201cdeals only with a simple assault and battery, where no weapon was employed by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Defendant characterizes the instant situation as falling between <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Gentalonm, </em>but closer to <em>Goldberg. </em>He urges that if he was not under a duty to retreat when he was first engaged in fisticuffs with Fich\u00f3las, he should not, in the heat of the battle, be saddled with the burden of receding just because an ax was introduced into the fight. Defendant argues that the duty to retreat is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the privilege of self-defense in cases of simple assault and that the fracas here began as a simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The error in defendant\u2019s reasoning lies in his lack of reference to the nature of the crime for which he was indicted and convicted \u2014 atrocious assault and battery. <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:90-l. In its 1951 revision of <em>Title </em>2 of our <em>Revised Statutes, </em>the Legislature clearly classified the various degrees of assault and battery, providing gradations unknown at the common law. See <em>State v. Maier, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>235 (1953). Atrocious assault and battery, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:90-l, was labeled a high misdemeanor, carrying a penalty up to $2,000 fine or imprisonment for not more than seven years, or both. <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:85-6. Simple assault and battery, while preserved in its common law form, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:85 \u2014 1, was downgraded to the level of disorderly conduct offenses, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-26, triable solely in the municipal courts and punishable by fine of not more than $1,000, or imprisonment up to a year, or both. <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:169-4. See <em>State v. Cybulski, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>164 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In regard to the issue at hand, the distinction between simple and aggravated assault and battery is more than one of degree. As may be inferred from the holding in <em>Goldberg, </em>the question of duty to retreat is inextricably bound up with the issue of reasonable <em>retaliation </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>self-defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Bather than a condition precedent to the invoking of the defense of self-defense, exercise of a reasonable opportunity to withdraw is itself an element of the defense; it is a factor to be considered in determining whether the defendant\u2019s act was truly \u201cdefensive\u201d in nature. In <em>Goldberg </em>the court stated that one might under certain circumstances defend without taking advantage of an opportunity to retreat, provided the defense involved no more than a simple assault upon the assailant. In <em>Centalonm, </em>it was noted that an attack of such force and with such vicious intent as to constitute a violation of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:90-2 could not conceivably be justified as \u201cdefensive\u201d if an available opportunity to back away and avoid commission of the crime was ignored bv defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We perceive little pertinent distinction between assault with intent to kill, <em>N. J. 8. 2A :90 </em>\u2014 2, and atrocious assault, <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:90-l. True, the penalty for the former may bo greater, consisting of up to 12 years of imprisonment, $3,000 in fines, or both. But aside from the element of felonious intent, the viciousness and the savagery of the offenses \u2014 especially where a weapon or other dangerous instrument is used \u2014 are sufficiently similar, and sufficiently serious, to warrant application of a positive duty to retreat, as an indispensable element of a defendant\u2019s contention that his aggravated assault was perpetrated in self-defense. The essential consideration is that one assailed by another may not inflict death or serious injury upon the assailant if he can, with reasonable safety to himself, avoid that course by retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Our discussion is focused, of course, on those situations in which the defendant does not reasonably appear to be threatened with injury to life or great bodily harm, compare <em>State v. Mark Len, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>439 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932) ; the trial judge eoncededly placed this qualification on the charge which defendant now contests. In the absence of such dire threats to the defendant\u2019s life or health, it is soundly established that the opportunity to withdraw must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>be availed of, at least if a defensive attack more serious than a simple battery is sought to be justified on the grounds of self-defense. <em>State v. Brackey, </em>175 <em>Iowa </em>599, 157 <em>N. </em>W. 198 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1916) (assault with intent to commit great bodily injury); <em>cf. Thompson v. Gilliland, </em>208 <em>Ala. </em>294, 94 <em>So. </em>53 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1922) (assault with intent to kill). 6 <em>G. J. S. Assault and Battery </em>\u00a7 92, <em>p. </em>945; 4 <em>Am. Jur., Assault and Battery, </em>\u00a7 47, <em>p. </em>151. Also see <em>Prosser, Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 19, <em>p. 90; 1 Harper &amp; James, Torls, </em>\u00a7 3.11, <em>pp. </em>242-43 (1956). <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 65(3) (a), and especially <em>comment (g). </em>However, the application of a duty to retreat is always relative to the extremity of the defensive measures employed. Eor example, before a homicide in self-defense is justified, the defendant must be shown to have first exhausted all reasonably safe means to avoid it, including retreat if possible with reasonable safety. <em>State v. di Maria, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>416 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1916), affirmed 90 <em>N. J. L. </em>341 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917); <em>cf. State v. Hipplewith, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>300, 316 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We find totally unpersuasive defendant\u2019s contention that the duty to retreat should never be interposed mid-way through an altercation, and that \u201conce it is established that defendant has the right to stand his ground,\u201d he should not thereafter be required to withdraw as soon as he acquires his opponent\u2019s weapon. Defendant overlooks what he did with the Scaranos\u2019 ax, once having acquired it. His contention is inimical to the very purpose behind imposition of the duty to retreat \u2014 to avoid contact which may result in serious bodily harm or the taking of life. This purpose is especially evident in the steadfast requirement of \u201cretreat to the wall\u201d in homicide cases. See <em>State v. di Maria, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The logical weakness in attempting to justify failure to retreat by reference to an earlier scene in the development of the fracas is manifest. The doctrine of retreat is designed to prevent the expansion of ordinary horseplay, simple jousting, or momentary loss of temper into a deadly physical struggle. That the line has been drawn at simple assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>is a concession to our ethical abhorrence of cowardice, <em>State v. Goldberg, supra, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>299, and it should not be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Defendant next asserts prejudicial error in the trial judge\u2019s ruling on a question concerning his physical condition at the time of the alleged attack. Defendant testified on direct examination that he currently weighed 200 pounds, and had weighed about 135 to 140 pounds at the time of the incident, July 15, 1957. He was then asked, \u201cWhy was your weight so low at that time?\u201d Objection was made, sustained, defendant\u2019s attorney announced, \u201cCross-examine,\u201d and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> Evidence of a defendant\u2019s physical condition is admittedly relevant to his claim of self-defense. See 4 <em>Am. Jur., supra, </em>\u00a7 103, <em>p. </em>181. But, as with his initial substantive contention, defendant is here faced with a failure to assert his rights at trial. We are directed by <em>B. B. </em>1:5-l(a), made applicable by <em>B. B. </em>2:5, to reverse for error in the exclusion of evidence only if: (1) specific objection thereto was made; and (2) in the light of the entire record, the exclusion caused defendant \u201cmanifest wrong or injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We are of the opinion that neither of these conditions was met in the instant case. Specific objection was not made by defendant\u2019s counsel; upon the court\u2019s approval of the State\u2019s objection, he proceeded to sit down. He did not attempt to state to the trial judge the purpose behind his question, which he was under a duty to do where, as here, the purpose may have been unclear from the question itself. <em>Manhattan Overseas Co. v. Camden County Beverage Co., </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>239, 245 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>421 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941). In any event, we do not find \u201cmanifest wrong or injury\u201d requiring reversal. The jurors were made aware of defendant\u2019s weight at the time of the incident, and were free to assess his ability to defend himself in the light of this knowledge and their observation of him. It is just not so, as defendant asserts, that \u201cthe jury viewed the sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion of the person using the privilege of self-defense from the point of view of a healthy 200-pound man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Objection is here made, for the first time, to the following comment by the trial judge, on the ground that it is unsupported by the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cWith reference to this defense [self-defense], I will define it to you shortly. He [Abbott] also contends that this act of his, which he doesn\u2019t seem to deny, at least any express denial of it, was accidental and not intentional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The act referred to was the alleged swinging of the ax by Abbott. The trial judge\u2019s comment appears to be consistent with the evidence produced. Defendant did not expressly deny striking the Scaranos, but clearly implied in his testimony, as the judge stated, that any blows were accidental, resulting from the scramble for possession of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Moreover, failure to call the court\u2019s attention to the alleged error in the charge is, unless \u201cplain error,\u201d inexcusable, <em>State v. </em>Lovell, 88 <em>N. J. L. </em>353 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915), especially where the jurors have been repeatedly told that the court\u2019s view of the evidence is not binding on them. See <em>State v. Linarducci, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>137, 143 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); Annotation, 95 <em>A. L. R. </em>785 (1935). We could not conceivably deduce \u201cplain error\u201d from the trial judge\u2019s comment. The two sentences immediately following the questioned charge were: \u201cYou have heard the testimony on that. You are the sole judges of these facts.\u201d Later in his instruction, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u201cIf either counsel during the trial of the ease or in their summation have referred to any statement of facts, or even the Court has so referred, which do not coincide with your recollection of the facts, you are to disregard them and rely solely and exclusively upon your recollection of the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Defendant also urges that the State is equitably estopped to prosecute him. He points out that prior to the instant prosecution, Michael Scarano was indicted for assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>with intent to kill, <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:90-2, arising out of this same incident. At the Scarano trial the State took the position, bolstered by Abbott\u2019s testimony, that the Scaranos had started the fight, that they had struck Abbott with the hatchet, and that Abbott had not struck the Scaranos. The trial resulted in an acquittal. Defendant now claims that the State cannot reverse its field and move against him, using the Scaranos as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The evidence, however, indicates that the State never changed its direction, as alleged. <em>Compare State v. Baird, </em>288 Mo. 62, 231 <em>S. W. </em>625, 15 <em>A. L. R. </em>1035 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1921). In the exercise of his public duty to \u201cuse all reasonable and lawful diligence for the detection, arrest, indictment and conviction of offenders against the law,\u201d <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:158-5. the prosecutor sought and obtained indictments against both Abbott and Scarano, believing quite logically that both had committed violations. The State then moved for the trial of both indictments together, but a severance was granted on the motion of Scarano. Thus, defendant cannot claim surprise or prejudice, nor can he seriously maintain that he was duped into forfeiting his privilege against self-incrimination by his open and free testimony at the Scarano trial. Moreover, the application of estoppel against the State is particularly inappropriate in areas such as criminal prosecution, where the welfare and safety of the community are the paramount considerations. <em>Cf. Thornton v. Village of Ridgewood, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>499, 511 (1955); <em>Universal Holding Co. v. North Bergen Twp., </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>103, 111 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).
