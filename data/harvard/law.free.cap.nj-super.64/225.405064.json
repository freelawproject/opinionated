A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb\">This appeal is from the judgment of the trial court construing certain provisions of the will of William A. Sibson (hereinafter referred to as decedent) who died on August 17, 1955, a resident of Gloucester County. Plaintiff is his widow. Defendants-appellants are the remaindermen under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Plaintiff married the decedent on February 3, 1931. No children were born of this marriage which was decedent\u2019s first and plaintiff\u2019s second. Plaintiff had no children by her previous marriage. During her marriage to decedent, plaintiff appears to have had no separate estate or income of her own and was entirely dependent on her husband for her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The will of decedent had been executed on May 14, 1951. Briefly, it provided in paragraph Fifth that if plaintiff survived decedent for 30 days, a trust was to be established of the residue of the estate, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201c(A) To pay in quarter-annual installments the net income arising from the said residuary estate, hereinafter designated \u2018principal\u2019, to my said wife for as long as she shall live, such payments to commence as soon after my decease as may be reasonably convenient for my Trustee, and further to pay to my said wife, freed and discharged from all trusts and uses, as much of the principal as my Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine necessary for her support, health and maintenance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Upon the death of plaintiff, \u201cthe remaining principal, if any,\u201d was to be distributed to decedent\u2019s brother and sister or their issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Pursuant to the will the trust was set up by defendant-respondent trustee, and the income thereof, approximating $3,750 annually, has been paid to plaintiff. In addition, the trustee has advanced to plaintiff, out of trust principal, the sum of $1,075 for painting and repairs to the house in which plaintiff lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">In April 1959 plaintiff filed this suit seeking construction of decedent\u2019s will and directing the trustee to make payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>to her out of the <em>corpus </em>of the trust. The case was submitted to the trial court on the pleadings, pretrial order and the depositions of plaintiff and her brother-in-law, who handled all of plaintiff\u2019s business affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The record indicates the following. At the present time plaintiff is the sole owner of the home in which she lives in Woodbury, Hew Jersey. The property, which is unencumbered, originally belonged to plaintiff and decedent as tenants by the entirety. Plaintiff also has a life estate in a summer home in Canada. Shortly before decedent\u2019s death he gave plaintiff $2,000, and on his death she collected $2,500 on a life insurance policy and also received $21,600 over a period of three years from a group life insurance policy which covered decedent. Plaintiff is the beneficiary of a nontaxable annuity of $1,200 paid by decedent\u2019s former employer, and since 1957 has been receiving Social Security payments at a current rate of $83.30 per month. Since decedent\u2019s death she has invested $34,242.19 in securities which produce an annual income of $1,200. She also has bank accounts totaling $4,000- and a 1959 automobile purchased for $2,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It thus appears that plaintiff is in receipt of independent income of her own approximating $3,400 annually which, together with her income from the trust, gives her a total income of approximately $7,150. Her federal income tax is about $600. Plaintiff\u2019s average expenses for the past four years were shown to be $3,300 per year and, while plaintiff asserted that they represented a thriftier manner of living than that to which she was accustomed while her husband was living, the trial court found that her total income from all sources was quite adequate to maintain her according to her former standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u25a0 At the trial plaintiff took the position that paragraph Eifth (A) of the will meant that (1) plaintiff was to receive all of the income from the trust, .and (2) all of the expenses necessary for plaintiff\u2019s support,' health and maintenance were.to be paid out of the principal of the trust. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>trial court rejected the latter contention and held that the provision \u201cnecessary for her support, health and maintenance\u201d referred to the possible inadequacy of trust income for these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The court, in effect, construed paragraph Fifth (A) to mean that to the extent that the income of the trust was inadequate to provide for plaintiff\u2019s support, health and maintenance, recourse was to be had to trust <em>corpus. </em>The court therefore directed the trustee not to take plaintiff\u2019s separate income into consideration in determining what payments should be made out of <em>corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The trial court attached particular significance to the gift over of \u201cthe remaining principal, if any,\u201d after plaintiff\u2019s death. This indicated to the trial court that decedent contemplated the very real possibility that there might be no <em>corpus </em>left over for the remaindermen. The court held that such provision indicated that plaintiff was to be the primary object of decedent\u2019s bounty in the use of the <em>corpus, </em>which was \u201cto be liberal and not just a stopgap against the vicissitudes of life.\u201d The trial court\u2019s opinion is reported in 61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>88 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In construing a will the function of the court is to ascertain and give effect to the purpose of the testator as set forth in his will. <em>Busch v. Flews, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>352 (1953). The court is not limited by form or terminology in its quest of what the testator meant by his testamentary language. The entire will must be considered rather than an isolated portion thereof, and where there is an ambiguity, surrounding facts and circumstances are proper objects of consideration. <em>Morristown Trust Co. v. McCann, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>568 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The provisions of the will at hand indicate that decedent wanted his wife amply provided for during her lifetime but, save for a bequest of his \u201cstrictly personal effects\u201d to plaintiff, he did not want her to receive any part of the principal of his estate unless necessary for her support. To that end his estate is preserved during plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tiff\u2019s lifetime, but upon her death it goes to decedent\u2019s blood relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The record shows that decedent had received substantial legacies from his family. He had no children of his own and was friendly with his brother and sister and their children. It was therefore perfectly natural for decedent to provide that his entire estate should go to his blood relatives after his wife had been amply taken care of during her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We do not agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that decedent intended that plaintiff was to be supported wholly out of trust income and <em>corpus </em>without regard to plaintiff\u2019s separate income. We do not interpret paragraph Pifth to have that meaning. Normal understanding of the language used by decedent would indicate that plaintiff\u2019s separate income was to be considered. How else would the trustee determine what was necessary for her support? In addition, the greater part of plaintiff\u2019s separate income comes from sources provided or arranged for by decedent during his lifetime. The provisions in the will are all part of the same pattern and must be interpreted in the light of these surrounding facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Plaintiff argues that there is nothing in the record to show that in April 1951, the date decedent\u2019s will was executed, any of these circumstances were in existence or had been arranged for by decedent, and cites <em>Zwoyer v. Hackensack Trust Co., </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>9 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), for the proposition that only those circumstances which were known to decedent when he made his will may be considered in determining his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The rule cited is correct but its application to the facts of this case is invalid. Decedent\u2019s will speaks as of the date of his death, and it is only reasonable to assume that decedent, in expressing his testamentary plan for his wife, intended that such plan would fit in with whatever other arrangements he either had made or would make in the future for her. So, too, with plaintiff\u2019s Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>payments which commenced about 1957. Certainly decedent, in planning for his wife\u2019s security, would have been aware that plaintiff would eventually come into these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">There are cases where a testator establishes a trust \"for support,\u201d and specifies that if the income from such trust is insufficient for that purpose then so much of <em>corpus </em>as may be necessary for that purpose shall be used. In such instance the courts have held that the testator has clearly indicated that the trust is to provide the entire support without considering the beneficiary\u2019s separate income. <em>Pearce v. Marcellus, </em>137 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>599 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>Hicks v. Jones, </em>138 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>280 <em>(Ch. </em>1946); <em>Orange First National Bank v. Preiss, </em>2 <em>N. J. Super. </em>486 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">However, where the life tenant is given the income of the trust, with a further provision authorizing the trustee to invade <em>corpus </em>if necessary for the life tenant\u2019s support, the separate income of the life tenant must be considered in determining whether it is necessary to invade <em>corpus. Stetson v. Community Chest, </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>243 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1952) ; <em>In re Willey's Estate, </em>139 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>118 <em>(Prerog. </em>1946). <em>Cf. Renner v. Castellano, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>331 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In 2 <em>A. L. R. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>1431, in discussing this question, it is stated that no general rule is available other than that the intention of the testator must govern in each particular case. The Annotation adds, at <em>p. </em>1432, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cBy the weight of authority, unless the language of the trust instrument affirmatively reveals an intention to make a gift of the stated benefaction regardless of the beneficiary\u2019s other means, the trustee should consider such other means in exercising his discretion to disburse the principal for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The construction given the will by the trial court could result in plaintiff\u2019s amassing a large estate for her own testamentary purposes, more or less at the expense of decedent\u2019s estate and the remaindermen named in decedent\u2019s will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Clearly this is contrary to the testamentary plan expressed by decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">We hold that under a proper construction of decedent\u2019s will the separate income of plaintiff is to be considered by the trustee. It has been suggested by appellants that not only plaintiff\u2019s separate income but also her separate estate would have to be exhausted before recourse could be had to trust <em>corpus. </em>We do not read the will to mean that the use of trust <em>corpus </em>is so limited. If the trust income, together with plaintiff\u2019s separate income, is insufficient to provide for plaintiff\u2019s support, health and maintenance, trust <em>corpus </em>is to be used, and the trustee is to administer the trust accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The judgment of the trial court is modified to the extent indicated herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
