J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AbH\">In consolidated actions arising out of an automobile accident, Vincent Sawicki appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict against him in favor of plaintiffs Bialoblocki in the Superior Court, Law Division, and from a judgment of no cause for action in favor of defendant Lehigh Valley Railroad Company (herein Le-high) in his affirmative suit against it. In both actions plaintiffs sought damages for personal injuries sustained. The accident, out of which the present litigation arose, occurred at about 9:30 p. m. on November 12, 1957, on Washington Street, Perth Amboy, when an automobile operated by Sawicki, in which plaintiffs Bialoblocki and others were passengers, struck the northeastern girder of a bridge span. No other vehicle was involved. Recovery had been sought against Lehigh on the basis of its alleged negligent placement of an improperly lighted barricade on the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In seeking reversal of the Bialoblocki judgment against him, as well as the judgment of no cause for action on his affirmative claim against Lehigh, Sawicki contends that (a) that the verdict rests upon the erroneous admission of incompetent evidence, to which Lehigh\u2019s counsel was wrongfully permitted to refer in summation; and (b) he was prejudicially affected by remarks made by Lehigh\u2019s counsel relating to the voluntary dismissal, at the inception of the trial, of actions originally instituted by Bialoblocki and Sawicki against The Middlesex Excavating Co. (The Middlesex Concrete Products &amp; Excavating Co., herein designated \u201cMiddlesex\u201d); and that the general conduct of Lehigh\u2019s counsel during the trial so improperly influenced the jury as to render its verdicts \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Hereafter we make specific reference to the aforesaid evidence and to the allegedly harmful remarks and actions of counsel, on the basis of which appellant seeks to reverse the judgments against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The record reveals that at the time of the aforesaid accident Sawicki was operating his automobile in an easterly direction on Washington Street aforesaid. That street is a two-lane road and at one point passes over railroad tracks by means of a bridge 144 feet in length owned and maintained by Lehigh. The bridge itself is situated high above railroad tracks and both the eastern and western approaches to it are steeply inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">For a number of days prior to the aforesaid date Middlesex had been engaged in resurfacing Washington Street in the area near the eastern end of the bridge. The resurfacing had resulted in a two-inch elevation of the roadway at that end of the bridge span. Pending the adjustment of the bridge span plate to meet the new level of the street, a \u201csaw-horse type\u201d barricade had ben placed by Lehigh at the eastern end of the bridge in the eastbound, southern lane. Two kerosene lanterns with red globes were attached to the barricade. At about 7 p. m. on the night of the accident two police officers inspected the barricade and found one of the lanterns lit, but burning dimly. The other was unlighted. The latter was lighted by one of the officers and both lanterns were adjusted so that they might function at their maximum capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">According to Sawicki\u2019s testimony, it was about 9 :30 p. m. when his automobile approached the western end of the bridge. He testified that he was then traveling at approximately 15 miles per hour and had increased his speed to \u201cno more than twenty-five miles\u201d per hour as he reached the center of the bridge. A photograph of this approach, taken on November 13, 1957, shows a large sign reading \u201cSlow Bump,\u201d attached to the southwestern girder of the bridge span. Sawicki testified that he saw a sign in that location, which, as he recalled, read: \u201cSlow Down.\u201d He stated that he did not notice the barricade until he was within six to eight feet of it, and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d any lights on it. He testified that he became \u201cseared, afraid,\u201d but did not apply his brakes. Instead, as there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>one in the westbound lane of the road, he turned sharply to the left, intending to go around the barricade. However, he failed to complete the maneuver and crashed into the northeastern girder of the bridge span. As a result, he and two of his passengers, Sygmunt and Wanda Bialoblocki, were seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Bialoblocki, individually and as guardian <em>ad litem </em>of Wanda, instituted the initial action against Sawicki and Middlesex on January 16, 1958. Sawicki filed a complaint on June 11, 1958 against Lehigh and Middlesex. The Bialoblocki complaint was amended July 2, 1958 to include Lehigh as a defendant. On August 21, 1958 the actions were consolidated for trial. Just prior to the empaneling of the jury Bialoblocki and Sawicki voluntarily dismissed their actions against Middlesex.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Eollowing the aforesaid verdicts Sawicki moved for a new trial on several grounds. The motion was denied. On this appeal he has abandoned all of the grounds save those above mentioned. It is noted that the Bialoblockis have taken no part in this appeal. Sawicki asserts in his brief that he has \u201cno objection to the quantum of the verdicts recovered by the Bialoblockis,\u201d and states that he concedes that \u201cit would be unfair to them to compel a retrial on the issue of damages\u201d but that \u201csubstantial justice does require a new trial on the issue of liability as to all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Initially, we shall consider appellant\u2019s contention that the judgments against him should be set aside as resting on incompetent evidence and the wrongful use thereof by Lehigh\u2019s counsel in cross-examination and summation. The situation, which forms the basis of criticism by Sawicki\u2019s counsel, arose during Lehigh\u2019s cross-examination of a police officer called as a witness by Bialoblocki. Prior thereto, during cross-examination by Sawicki\u2019s counsel, the officer, in refutation of a statement made by Lehigh\u2019s counsel in opening, denied that he had found \u201cseventy-five feet of skid marks\u201d at the \u201cscene\u201d of the accident. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>after, while under cross-examination by Lehigh\u2019s counsel, the officer, over initial objection by Sawicki\u2019s counsel, was interrogated with reference to certain photographs of the accident scene, then marked for identification only.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The aforesaid photographs had been taken the day after the accident and one of them showed a long mark on the road surface, curving from the southern to the northern side of the street, and terminating near the northeastern corner of the bridge where Sawicki\u2019s car had struck the girder. The litigants were in dispute as to whether the aforesaid mark, described as a skid or tire mark, wras caused by Sawicki\u2019s automobile. To most of the questions addressed to the officer by Lehigh\u2019s counsel with reference to the details shown on the photographs no objection was made by Sawicki\u2019s counsel, nor did he make any motion to strike any part of such testimony. After the officer had testified, under further cross-examination by Sawicki\u2019s counsel, that he had not seen any skid marks on the night of November 1.2 following the happening of the accident, the latter announced that he was going to oiler the photographs as \u201cmy exhibit on behalf of Mr. Sawicki.\u201d Following the court\u2019s observation that he could not then offer them, because he was not then presenting his client\u2019s case, Sawicki\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI will reserve offering it, with the understanding that it is my exhibit.\u201d Later, two of the aforesaid photographs (Exhibits D-5 and D-6 for Identification) were marked in evidence at the request of Sawicki\u2019s counsel and became Exhibits P-l(S) and P-2(S). The photographs are views of the Washington Street bridge, the first taken with the camera placed at the western end of the bridge \u201clooking east,\u201d the second with the camera placed \u201cin the center\u201d of the bridge \u201c75 ft. West of barrier looking East.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Appellant contends that reversible error resulted not only from the use of the photographs by Lehigh\u2019s counsel at the time the exhibits were marked for identification only, but also by that counsel\u2019s reference during his opening and summation to the \u201ctire\u201d or \u201cskid mark\u201d shown in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>photographs. In urging that a reversal of the judgment, which freed Lehigh from liability, should be entered, Sawicki\u2019s counsel contends that were it not for the references to \u201cskid marks,\u201d there would be nothing in the evidence to justify the finding of any negligence on the part of Sawicki. This conclusion is sharply challenged by Lehigh, which contends that there was ample evidence, aside from the factor of skid or tire marks, to demonstrate that Sawicki was negligent in so operating his ear that it failed to go around the barricade, which he testified he intended to do, but instead crashed into a girder on the northern side of the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the aforesaid references by Lehigh\u2019s counsel (during the trial and in summation) to \u201cskid marks\u201d and committed further error in refusing to set aside the judgment based on the jury verdict which had determined that Sawicki was at fault. Despite appellant\u2019s present criticism of the conduct of Lehigh\u2019s counsel and of the trial court\u2019s failure to bar or at least curb that counsel\u2019s interrogation and summation with reference to \u201cskid marks\u201d and use of the aforesaid pictures, no objection, with the single exception above noted, was voiced by his attorney at trial. Appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s action in overruling his objection constituted reversible error as defined by <em>B. B. </em>1:5-3(5), 2:5. The complete answer thereto is that, by his own deliberate act, appellant\u2019s counsel placed in evidence the very photographs, the use of which by Lehigh\u2019s counsel he now asserts constituted reversible error. As noted by the trial judge when Sawicki\u2019s counsel voiced his objection to Lehigh\u2019s interrogation with reference to the photographs, at which time the exhibits simply bore identification marks, there was then \u201cno documentation\u201d thereof. It was Sawicki\u2019s counsel\u2019s act which furnished the \u201cdocumentation.\u201d Under such circumstances we refuse to reverse the trial court\u2019s action on appellant\u2019s initially advanced theory that, under the aforesaid rule, a failure to sustain his contention would be \u201cinconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>with substantial justice.\u201d We reject the thesis advanced by appellant that he may, under <em>B. B. </em>l:5-3(5), 2:5, or under <em>B. B. </em>l:5-3(c), 2:5, which he also invokes, claim reversible error in Lehigh\u2019s aforesaid use of the photographs when it was he who gave the jurors the opportunity to observe and assess the nature and significance, if any, of the mark plainly visible on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We turn to a consideration of the second point advanced by appellant for reversal. As above noted, this was centered on references by Lehigh\u2019s counsel to the voluntary dismissal by Bialoblocki and Sawicki of their actions against Middlesex. The criticized references were those made by Lehigh\u2019s counsel in his opening, during the course of the trial, and in his summation. In seeking a reversal of the judgment, appellant characterizes the references to Middlesex as \u201c* * * designed to prejudice the jury into believing that his client was the victim of some collusive undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The criticized opening remarks, to which appellant specifically alludes, are those in which Lehigh\u2019s counsel, after referring to the suits by Bialoblocki and Sawicki against Middlesex, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201c* * * And i0 an(j behold, yesterday, for a reason I don\u2019t know, they suddenly take a dismissal of that case. Why? You can draw inferences. I can too, but I can\u2019t tell you what I draw. But yesterday, when the case was called in the list, and before we selected you as jurors, both plaintiffs decided that they would give up as to the Middlesex Concrete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The single criticism, expressed at trial by Sawieki\u2019s attorney with reference to the opening statement of Lehigh\u2019s counsel, was as to its form, which he characterized as \u201ca summation and argument.\u201d No objection, however, was made to that portion of the opening which described the paving work done by Middlesex and the institution and subsequent voluntary dismissals of the suits against it by Sawicki and Bialoblocki. Appellant now labels the opening as an \u201cimproper offensive\u201d and as an element warranting reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>On the ground of immateriality, Sawicki\u2019s counsel objected during the trial to attempts by Lehigh\u2019s counsel to show, in cross-examination of a police officer and of Sawicki, the extent of the paving work which had been done on the bridge by Middlesex as well as the condition in which it had left the road bed on the day in question prior to the erection of the barricade by Lehigh. The trial attorney for Sawicki became a voluntary witness for his own client and was interrogated by his then co-counsel, who now appears by substitution as sole counsel for Sawicki on appeal. In explanation of his appearance as a witness, the attorney testified that he did so because of the opening remarks by Lehigh\u2019s counsel. He stated that he desired to clarify his reason for instituting suit against Middlesex and later dismissing it. His sole explanation for suing Middlesex was that it had been named originally in the Bialoblocki action; that his voluntary dismissal of the suit was based on the fact that his investigation convinced him that Middlesex \u201cwas not liable.\u201d He stated that his client had neither received nor been promised any money for such dismissal. Lehigh\u2019s counsel then called the Bialobloekis\u2019 trial attorney as a witness. He testified that his clients\u2019 initial action was against Middlesex and Sawicki only; that thereafter he ascertained that the barrier had been placed on the bridge by Lehigh and not by Middlesex, so he filed an amended complaint including Lehigh as a defendant; that still later he concluded that Middlesex \u201chad nothing to do with the accident,\u201d so he joined with Sawicki\u2019s counsel at the opening of the trial in voluntarily dismissing the action against Middlesex; that his client received no money as consideration therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Although critical, as aforesaid, of the references voiced by Lehigh during the trial to the dismissal of the actions by Sawicld and Bialoblocki against Middlesex, Sawicki levels his chief attack on the summation by Lehigh\u2019s counsel. Appellant particularly criticizes the following statement by Lehigh\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201c* -&gt; * x want to know why they let them [Middlesex] out. It is perfectly apparent; they were let out. I want to know why they sued them in the first place. Because there is something a little funny about that. With the complete investigation, there is something behind the scenes that frankly, I don\u2019t like.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Appellant contends that he suffered \u201cirreparable harm\u201d as the result of the aforesaid conduct of Lehigh\u2019s counsel; that the assertions \u201cfall within the strictures of <em>B. B. </em>1:5-3(6)\u201d; and that \u201c[additionally * * * it was plain error to permit the * * * conduct of a trial by highly improper insinuations and barely-concealed innuendo.\u201d Based on this latter contention, he asks us to apply <em>B. B. </em>l:5-3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">In resolving the issue raised by appellant, it is significant that, despite the present contention that the comments by Lehigh\u2019s counsel relating to Middlesex were \u201coffensively prejudicial\u201d and that they \u201cworked to distort and mislead\u201d the jury, no such concern was expressed by appellant\u2019s counsel or co-counsel at trial. They asked only that the following request be charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">\u201cDuring the course of the trial there lias been reference to the dismissal of a suit against a defendant, Middlesex Concrete Products and Excavating Company. I charge you that there has been no proof of any facts whatsoever which in any way connected said company with the accident in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The court honored their request. Compare <em>State v. Hipple</em>with, 33 <em>N. J. </em>300, 318 (1960). Not only did they abstain at trial from voicing the harsh criticism now uttered, but at no time did they seek a mistrial or even move to strike any of the remarks made by Lehigh\u2019s counsel. Whether they then believed that the remarks made by Lehigh\u2019s counsel would not seriously affect their client, or tactical reasons dictated that they abstain from moving for a mistrial or even registering an objection, is immaterial. What is important is that at no time did they protest to the trial court or contend that their client was being prejudiced. Compare <em>State v. </em>Hipplewith, 33 <em>N. J. </em>300, 314 (1960). They now assert that the trial court \u201csuccumbed along with the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to the pervasive influence of counsel\u2019s tactics and thus fell into error within the meaning of <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3 <em>(b) </em>and 1:5-3 (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The proper disposition of this appeal requires that certain basic principles be restated and applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>First: </em>\"The primary office of an objection or a motion directed to the competency or relevance of evidence is the avoidance of error and the purging of the proofs of extraneous and harmful or prejudicial elements.\u201d <em>Priest v. Poleshuck, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>557, 564 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Second: </em>The importance of strict adherence to <em>R. R. </em>4:52-1 is to be recognized. It is there stated that: \u201c* * * No party may urge as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of the objection. * * *\u201d See <em>Lippman v. Ostrum, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>14, 26 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em>Third: </em>\u201c[T]hat ordinarily failure to object to the charge of the court will preclude criticism thereof on appeal.\u201d <em>Schult v. H. &amp; C. Realty Corp., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>128, 136 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), certification denied 29 <em>N. J. </em>279 (1959); <em>Grammas v. Colasurdo, </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>543, 548 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958); <em>Lertch v. McLean, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>68, 74 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\"><em>Fourth: </em>\u201c[E]ven trial errors to which objection is taken will not result in a new trial unless \u2018a denial of the relief sought\u2019 would be \u2018inconsistent with substantial justice.\u2019 <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3(6) <em>* </em>* <em>Buccafusco v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>385, 392-393 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), certification denied 27 <em>N. J. </em>74 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\"><em>Fifth: </em>\"Oversight and inadvertencies of the court deemed to be harmless and unimportant by the attorney at the trial cannot without diligent objection be normally exaggerated on appeal. In such exigencies a degree of passive indifference, if not acquiescence, is inferred.\u201d <em>Valls v. Paramus Bathing Beach Inc., </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>353, 357 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Sixth: </em>The special relief afforded by <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3(c) is to be invoked only where \u201c \u2018substantial justice\u2019 has not been done.\u201d <em>In re Stern, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>584, 590 (1958). It is to be utilized \u201cwhen from the whole record\u201d the appellate tribunal \u201cis convinced substantial justice was not done below and that such error or errors brought about the unjust result.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Berger, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>500, 505 (1953). The rule is \u201csparingly employed.\u201d <em>Ford v. Reichert, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>429, 435 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Here, appellant, who failed at trial to make any objection to the summation by Lehigh\u2019s counsel or to object to the court\u2019s charge, now insists that the court committed plain error \u201cin failing to restrain counsel and in failing to keep such prejudicial material from the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In assessing the merit of appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice we examine the evidence bearing on the basic issue of negligence which the jury was called upon to resolve. The trial court rejected Sawicki\u2019s motion for a new trial based, among other grounds, on the contention that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Although, in seeking a reversal, appellant does not make this ruling by the trial court a specific ground for appeal, he asserts that the evidence was so \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in favor of Sawicki that it is apparent that the verdict could be explained only on the basis of the prejudicial action of Lehigh\u2019s counsel. The trial court disagreed. So do we. The jury was fully justified in disbelieving Sawicki\u2019s testimony that, as he entered upon the western approach of the bridge, he was proceeding at a speed of only 15 miles per hour and that, as he traveled on the surface of the bridge a distance of .120 feet towards the barricade, his maximum speed was 25 miles per hour. By his own testimony he attempted to maneuver his car around the barricade, but instead crashed into a girder on the northern side of the bridge with such force as to wreck his car and severely injure occupants thereof. The jury had the benefit of photographs which showed the extensive damage done to the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Appellant testified that he did not see the barricade until he was six or eight feet from it, but the jury would have been fully justified in finding that had he been making proper observation he would have noted its presence sooner, or that operating his car at a greater speed than he testified, he did not have the vehicle under proper control. It is clear that the verdict had ample support in the evidence and that the appellant is on unsound ground in asserting that it is the product of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Our rejection of appellant\u2019s contentions is not to be deemed as indicating approval of the methods which Le-high\u2019s counsel elected to pursue. We are declaring only that in the instant ease they did not result in a denial of \u201csubstantial justice.\u201d The judgments of the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
