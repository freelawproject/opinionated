In affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order holding Motors Acceptance in contempt for failure to return to the debtor an automobile repossessed prior to the filing of the Chapter 13 petition, the district court construed Georgia law as providing that both legal title and right of redemption of a vehicle remain with a debtor after a creditor\u2019s repossession of that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">There appears to be no issues of fact. The parties agree that the case turns on state law. Having found no case law addressing this exact issue of Georgia law, we certify the following question of law to the Supreme Court of Georgia and postpone any further consideration of this appeal until we receive an answer from that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Rozier purchased an automobile in the State of Georgia, with financing which was assigned to Motors Acceptance. On August 8, 2002, Motors Acceptance repossessed the vehicle due to Rozier\u2019s failure to make installment payments as set forth in the sales contract. A few days later, on August 12, Rozier filed a petition under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Georgia. Soon after filing his petition, Rozier requested that Motors Acceptance return possession of the vehicle back to him, which Motors Acceptance declined to do. He then filed a motion for contempt against Motors Acceptance for its refusal to return the vehicle. Although possession was relinquished under a Temporary Turnover Order, the parties reserved them right to pursue the issue. The bankruptcy court ultimately granted Rozier\u2019s motion for contempt, holding Motors Acceptance in willful contempt of the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 by refusing to return the automobile. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt order, holding that because, under its interpretation of Georgia law, both the right of redemption and legal title of a vehicle remain with a debtor even after a creditor\u2019s repossession of that vehicle, Rozier\u2019s automobile should have been relinquished by Motors Acceptance to him as part of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy estate during the pendency of his bankruptcy petition. <em>See Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Rozier, </em>290 B.R. 910, 913 (M.D.Ga.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Under the Bankruptcy Code, a court may order a third party to turn over to the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate property in its possession if, among other things, such property is considered \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541, 542. \u201cProperty of the estate\u201d includes \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541(a)(1); <em>see also Bell-Tel Fed. Credit Union v. Kalter, </em>292 F.3d 1350, 1351 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">The dispositive question on this appeal is whether a vehicle repossessed prior to the filing of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition is in fact the property of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The answer to this question turns on whether, under Georgia law, legal ownership passes to a creditor at the time of repossession. <em>See Bell-Tel Fed. Credit Union, </em>292 F.3d at 1353 (not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>ing that \u201cthe nature and existence of the [debtor\u2019s] right to property is determined by looking at state law\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">This Court has held that under Florida and Alabama law a defaulted vehicle debt- or has no ownership rights, other than a right of redemption, which is an insufficient ownership interest for that vehicle to be considered part of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate. <em>See Bell-Tel Fed. Credit Union, </em>292 F.3d at 1360 (interpreting Florida law); <em>Lewis v. Charles R. Hall Motors, Inc., </em>137 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.1998) (interpreting Alabama law). The district court held, and appellee Rozier argues, that Georgia law is different from Florida and Alabama law, and that in addition to a right of redemption, the debtor had ownership rights entitling him to possession of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">If, as the district court held, both legal title and the right of redemption of a vehicle remain with a defaulted debtor even after his creditor\u2019s repossession of the vehicle, then the vehicle remains part of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the district court properly affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order holding Motors Acceptance in contempt for failure to relinquish the vehicle back to Rozier after he had filed his bankruptcy petition. If, as Motors Acceptance contends on appeal, Georgia law affords a debtor no right in a repossessed vehicle <em>other than a right of redemption, </em>then the district court erred by concluding that the repossessed vehicle was part of the bankruptcy estate and thus abused its discretion by finding Motors Acceptance in contempt for failure to relinquish the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">To answer these questions, this Court now certifies the following question of Georgia law to the Supreme Court of Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\">DOES LEGAL TITLE, OR ANY OTHER OWNERSHIP INTEREST THAT WOULD GIVE A RIGHT OF POSSESSION, PASS TO THAT CREDITOR UNDER GEORGIA LAW UPON REPOSSESSION OF AN AUTOMOBILE SUBSEQUENT TO A DEBTOR\u2019S DEFAULT ON AN AUTOMOBILE INSTALLMENT LOAN CONTRACT, OR DOES SUCH LEGAL TITLE OR OTHER OWNERSHIP INTEREST REMAIN IN THE DEBTOR?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">We certify the above-styled question to the Supreme Court of Georgia. The phrasing used in this certified question should not restrict that court\u2019s consideration of the problems of state law posed by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">QUESTION CERTIFIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
