The Government presented reliable and specific testimony showing Edmonds\u2019 unlawful use of marijuana was regular, ongoing, and contemporaneous with the commission of the offense of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">On July 2, 2002, Agent Billy Cunningham, of the Bureau of Acohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Task Force, observed Ed-monds sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked car in the parking lot of a convenience store. Edmonds appeared to be rolling a marijuana cigar. Agent Cunningham opened the driver\u2019s-side door, saw a small bag of marijuana in Edmonds\u2019 hand and cigar paper in his lap, and informed Edmonds he was under arrest. Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Cunningham did not wait to see Edmonds light the marijuana cigar before arresting him. After informing Edmonds that he was under arrest, Agent Cunningham searched the car and discovered another, larger bag of marijuana, three tablets of ecstasy, a loaded Beretta 9mm semiautomatic pistol, and a loaded Bersa .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol with its serial number obliterated. During the arrest, Edmonds\u2019 cellular phone rang. Agent Cunningham answered it, and the caller, apparently believing Agent Cunningham to be Edmonds, asked whether Edmonds still planned to bring him some \u201cdope\u201d at an area motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The probation officer investigated Ed-monds\u2019 past use of illegal drugs and prior criminal history. His history of drug use is extensive. Edmonds admitted he began using marijuana when he was 13 years old, his heaviest use occurred when he was 15 years old, and he last used the substance in mid-September 2002. He stated that he had restricted his use of marijuana during recent years because he had been on probation for a misdemeanor state offense. In fact, Edmonds was convicted in state court for possession of marijuana in November 1999 and September 2001, and twice participated in drug abuse treatment programs. Edmonds admitted using marijuana while in treatment in November 2001. He tested positive for marijuana use on February 26, 2002, and for marijuana and cocaine use on May 21, 2002. In May 2002, Edmonds was terminated from a drug treatment program for excessive absences. Furthermore, after his arrest for the instant offense and while supervised on bond by the United States Parole Office, he tested positive for marijuana and cocaine on September 20 and 23, 2002. Finally, Edmonds also admitted using ecstasy once or twice per month from 2001 to late June 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In the presentence investigation report (PSI), the probation officer assigned Ed-monds an enhanced base offense level of 14 for his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k) based on her determination that Edmonds was an unlawful user of a controlled substance at the time he committed the instant offense. Edmonds objected to this enhanced base offense level, arguing the Government could not prove he was under the influence of or using a controlled substance at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">At sentencing, the Government presented testimony from the probation officer and Agent Cunningham. The probation officer informed the court of Edmonds\u2019 criminal history and history of drug abuse, and stated she thought Edmonds was using drugs when he was arrested, although she did not know this for a fact. Agent Cunningham testified as to his observations during Edmonds\u2019 arrest, and stated he thought Edmonds not only was \u201csmoking but he was also selling.\u201d Agent Cunningham testified, however, that he had no way of knowing whether Edmonds was getting ready to smoke the marijuana cigar or whether he was going to sell it. Although Edmonds did not dispute he was in possession of the marijuana, ecstasy, and firearms, he disputed Agent Cunningham\u2019s statement that he was rolling a marijuana cigar.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The district court found Agent Cunningham\u2019s testimony \u201chighly credible,\u201d adopted the PSI in its entirety, and overruled Ed-monds\u2019 objections. The district court sentenced Edmonds to a 22-month prison term for possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">We review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bernardine, </em>73 F.3d 1078, 1079 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen ... a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence as set forth in the PSI, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1080 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Section 2K2.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines sets the base offense level for prohibited transactions involving firearms. Section 2K2.1(a)(6) provides for an enhanced offense level of 14 if the defendant \u201cwas a prohibited person at the time the defendant committed the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 defines a \u201cprohibited person\u201d by reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and \u00a7 922(n), and therefore includes a person \u201cwho is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 6; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Edmonds argues he was not an \u201cunlawful user of\u2019 marijuana because he was not going to \u201cuse\u201d the marijuana found in his car; rather he was going to sell the marijuana. Edmonds further argues that because Agent Cunningham arrested him before he lit the marijuana cigar, there was no evidence that he \u201cused\u201d marijuana on the date of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Both Edmonds and the Government assume possessing, transporting, or attempting to sell a controlled substance does not make a defendant an \u201cunlawful user of\u2019 a controlled substance. Rather, both parties assume an \u201cunlawful user of\u2019 a controlled substance must ingest or consume, or at least intend to ingest or consume, the controlled substance. Although we do not address the issue, for the purposes of this appeal, we assume that \u201cunlawful user of\u2019 a controlled substance refers to the ingestion and consumption of drugs, and not the selling of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">In <em>Bernardine, </em>we held that to be an \u201cunlawful user of\u2019 marijuana a defendant\u2019s use must be <em>\u201congoing </em>and contemporaneous with the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>Bernardine, </em>73 F.3d at 1082. The Tenth Circuit has similarly interpreted \u201cunlawful user\u201d of a controlled substance to mean regular and ongoing use of a controlled substance during the same time period as the firearm possession. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>329 F.3d 769, 778 (10th Cir.2003). The Tenth Circuit further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-9\">Although a defendant\u2019s drug use must be contemporaneous with firearm possession, there is no need for a defendant\u2019s drug use to be \u201csimultaneousD\u201d with firearm possession. The government does not need to show the defendant was under the influence of an illegal drug at the exact same time he possessed a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 777 n. 4 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We agree. To support an offense enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), the government does not have to prove the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance at the time of his arrest. Instead, the government must show the defendant was an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of a controlled substance during the same time period as the firearm possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">In this case, the Government presented reliable and specific evidence that Edmonds was an unlawful user of a controlled substance. Edmonds admitted to a history of drug use. Agent Cunningham arrested Edmonds for possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number after discovering Edmonds with marijuana in his hand and cigar paper in his lap. Edmonds tested positive for marijuana use even <em>after </em>the instant offense, while he was on bond. These facts support the conclusion Edmonds\u2019 unlawful use of marijuana was regular, ongoing, and contemporane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ous with his firearm possession. Agent Cunningham did not have to wait until Edmonds lit the marijuana cigar to arrest him. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The district court did not err in concluding Edmonds was an unlawful user of a controlled substance, and therefore a prohibited person under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-13\">. Edmonds does not appeal his sentence of 60 months' imprisonment for carrying a firearm during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
