He alleges the district court improperly calculated the sentencing guidelines, which resulted in \u201cduplicative counting\u201d and an improper two-level enhancement. The Government argues the district court lacked jurisdiction over Appellant\u2019s motion because \u00a7 3582(b)(3) does not authorize district courts to modify sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">We review whether a court has jurisdiction as a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Maduno, </em>40 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.1994). When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we only review the statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>United States v. Ballinger, </em>312 F.3d 1264, 1274 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(3) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can subsequently be ... appealed and modified, if outside the guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of section 3742[,] a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.\u201d We have never addressed whether a district court has jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b) to consider a motion to modify a sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Eighth Circuit, however, has examined this issue. <em>United States v. Auman, </em>8 F.3d 1268, 1271 (8th Cir.1993). In <em>Auman, </em>the Eighth Circuit held \u00a7 3582(b) was \u201cunambiguous on its face\u201d and merely \u201cdefined \u2018final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In dicta, the court also noted the legislative history of \u00a7 3582(b) bolstered the Court\u2019s reading that \u00a7 3582(b) merely defined finality and was not a vehicle for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>sentence modification. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit held \u00a7 3582(b) \u201cdoes not grant jurisdiction to a district court to do anything, let alone correct an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">We agree with the Eighth Circuit and hold the district court lacked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(3) to consider Appellant\u2019s motion to modify his sentence. Section 3582(b)(3) is not a vehicle for obtaining a sentence modification, but merely defines finality. Consequently, the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the merits of his motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">. We have referenced \u00a7 3582(b)(2) in a footnote. <em>United. States v. Brown </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1344 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). The footnote provided that a particular sentencing guidelines amendment was retroactive, and, if applicable, could warrant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(b)(2). It appears, however, we were actually referring to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because only \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides for a sentence reduction pursuant to a retroactive sentencing guidelines amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">. Federal courts are obligated to look beyond the label of a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u2019s motion to determine if it is cognizable under a different statutory framework. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Here, Appellant's motion could be construed as an appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion, or a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. None of these constructions, however, aid Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">First, to appeal under \u00a7 3742(a), Appellant needed to file an appeal within 10 days of sentencing. <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 816 n. 18 (11th Cir.2003); Fed. R.App.P. 4(b)(1). Here, however, Appellant waited 9 years before filing his instant motion, thus making it untimely and \u00a7 3742 inapplicable. Second, Appellant's motion could fit under \u00a7 3582(c) only if he was arguing his sentence should be modified based on a subsequent sentencing guideline amendment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Appellant, however, clearly states he is appealing the <em>application </em>of the guidelines at sentencing and does not reference any guideline amendment, making \u00a7 3582(c)(2) inapplicable. Third, Rule 35 only allows sentence modification for: (1) correcting \"arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\" within 7 days after sentencing, or (2) reducing a sentence for substantial assistance to the government. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), (b). Appellant is not entitled to relief under either option because he filed his motion well after the 7-day limitation period and his claim did not involve substantial assistance. Finally, Appellant is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 because he did not claim (1) the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence, (2) the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized law, (3) the sentence was otherwise subject to collateral attack by a claim of a constitutional violation, or (4) the proceeding was \"infected with any error of fact or law of the \u2018fundamental\u2019 character that renders the entire proceeding irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240-41, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979). Accordingly, the district court had no jurisdiction over Appellant\u2019s motion whether considered under its actual label of \u00a7 3582(b)(3) or construed under any different statutory framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1312-17\">. Appellant also filed a motion to proceed without transcripts. We deny the motion as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
