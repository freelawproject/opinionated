J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afk\">The City of Alameda (City) appeals from a judgment (1) awarding Premier Communications Network, Inc., (Premier) a judgment on the pleadings, and (2) declaring City\u2019s ordinance No. 1991, which imposed a tax upon \u201ctelevision subscription service\u201d businesses, unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 2, of the California Constitution, and enjoining enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Ordinance No. 1991,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enacted on December 4, 1979, amended the portion of the City\u2019s municipal code dealing with business licenses, by imposing a business license tax of 3 percent of annual gross receipts upon \u201c[e]very person conducting a television subscription service business\u201d and upon businesses providing emergency communications systems or alarms.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">City alleged in an amended complaint that Premier was engaged in the television subscription service business in the City, under the name \u201cHome Box Office,\u201d and had failed to pay the business license fee required by ordinance No. 1991. It sought to recover 3 percent of Premier\u2019s gross receipts derived from its business in the City for the fiscal year 1979-1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and each fiscal year thereafter. In responsive pleadings, Premier admitted nonpayment and denied liability on the ground that the tax violated the constitutional guaranties of free speech and press, and cross-complained to enjoin enforcement of ordinance No. 1991 on the theory that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void as applied to Premier. City\u2019s answer generally denied the cross-complaint\u2019s charging allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">At the commencement of trial, on April 21, 1983, the court granted Premier\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that ordinance No. 1991 violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and entered a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Premier is a multipoint distribution service, headquartered in Burlingame, California, which operates under the name \u201cHome Box Office.\u201d It receives signals transmitted from outside the state by satellite at a location in the City of Berkeley and retransmits those signals by microwave to its subscription customers in Bay Area cities, including the City of Alameda. Premier\u2019s customers receive the microwave signals through an antenna leased from Premier for viewing via conventional television receivers. Premier provides programming, not otherwise available to television viewers, which includes recently released motion pictures, specially produced programs, sports events, and other entertainment and news programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The First Amendment prohibits the enactment of any law \u201cabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . .,\u201d and is applicable to state and municipal action pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>Jeannette </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 157, 162 [87 L.Ed. 1324, 1328, 63 S.Ct. 877].) It is well settled that municipal ordinances are within the prohibition of the amendment. <em>(Lovell </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1938) 303 U.S. 444, 450 [82 L.Ed. 949, 952, 58 S.Ct. 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">There is no doubt that Premier, as a disseminator of motion pictures, news, and other information and entertainment programming, engages in conduct protected by the First Amendment guaranties of freedom of speech and press. In <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 235 [49 Cal.Rptr. 537, 411 P.2d 289], cert. den., 385 U.S. 844 [17 L.Ed.2d 75, 87 S.Ct. 49], our Supreme Court invalidated an initiative measure banning the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>home subscription television in California as an abridgement of free speech guaranties. The court there observed that \u201c[c]ommunication by motion picture, by radio and by television falls within the constitutional protection\u201d and that \u201camusement and entertainment as well as the exposition of ideas\u201d are encompassed within such protection. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 242.) These principles are firmly embedded in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. (See, e.g., <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Borough of Mount Ephraim </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 61, 65 [68 L.Ed.2d 671, 678, 101 S.Ct. 2176] [\u20181 Entertainment, as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live entertainment, such as musical and dramatic works, fall within the First Amendment guarantee. (Citations.)\u201d]; <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 495, 501-502 [96 L.Ed. 1098, 72 S.Ct. 777] [motion pictures, like books, magazines, and newspapers, are included within free speech and free press guaranties even though sold for a profit]; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 507, 510 [92 L.Ed. 840, 847, 68 S.Ct. 665] [\u201cThe line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right (of free speech). Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man\u2019s amusement, teaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In its most recent pronouncement dealing with economic regulation of the press, our highest court reemphasized that \u201cA tax that burdens rights protected by the First Amendment cannot stand unless the burden is necessary to achieve an overriding governmental interest.\u201d <em>(Minneapolis Star </em>v. <em>Minnesota Comm. of Rev. </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 575, 582 [75 L.Ed.2d 295, 303; 103 S.Ct. 1365], citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 252 [71 L.Ed.2d 127, 102 S.Ct. 1051].) While acknowledging decisions upholding economic regulations generally applicable to all businesses, the court concluded that \u201c[differential taxation of the press . . . places such a burden on the interests protected by the First Amendment that we cannot countenance such treatment unless the State asserts a counterbalancing interest of compelling importance that it cannot achieve without differential taxation.\u201d (460 U.S. at p. 585 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The challenged tax in <em>Minneapolis Star </em>was a \u201cuse tax\u201d imposed upon paper and ink products consumed in the production of a publication. Such paper and ink became the only items subject to the state\u2019s use tax which were components of goods to be sold at retail. The court found that this treatment of publishers differed from that of other enterprises in at least two ways: the use tax did not protect the sales tax (which exempted periodic publications, resulting in no \u201ccomplementary function\u201d to serve), and was levied on intermediate transactions rather than ultimate retail sales. (460 U.S. at p. 582 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 302].) The Supreme Court concluded that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>special use tax, unparalleled under Minnesota\u2019s tax scheme, singled out the press for special treatment. In examining whether such differential treatment was constitutionally permissible, the court stated: \u201cThe main interest asserted by Minnesota in this case is the raising of revenue. Of course that interest is critical to any government. Standing alone, however, it cannot justify the special treatment of the press, for an alternative means of achieving the same interest without raising concerns under the First Amendment is clearly available: the State could raise the revenue by taxing businesses generally, avoiding the censorial threat implicit in a tax that singles out the press.\u201d (460 U.S. at p. 586 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 305], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Responding to Minnesota\u2019s contention that the use tax was merely a less onerous, substitute tax which could be generally and permissibly applied to the press, the court held that the state had offered no adequate justification for the differential tax, which was impermissible even if it did not currently impose a greater effective burden since \u201cthe very selection of the press for special treatment threatens the press not only with the current <em>differential </em>treatment, but with the possibility of subsequent differentially <em>more burdensome </em>treatment.\u201d (460 U.S. at p. 588 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 307], original italics.) The court reasoned that the state\u2019s interest in requiring the press to bear its share of the tax burden could be achieved by taxing the press equally with others, thus avoiding differential tax treatment in accomplishing its revenue generating objectives. (460 U.S. at pp. 589-590 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 307-308].) Accordingly, such differential tax violated First Amendment guaranties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Under the teachings of <em>Minneapolis Star, </em>we find that the City\u2019s business license tax on television subscription service businesses fails to pass constitutional muster as applied to Premier. The record before the trial court and us, consisting of the pleadings and pertinent portions of the City\u2019s municipal code, unmistakably establishes that the challenged tax is differentially burdensome to television subscription service businesses, thus triggering an inquiry whether that burden is impermissible under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Under the relevant provisions of the City\u2019s code, judicially noticed below, (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 452; <em>Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 978, 986-987 [128 Cal.Rptr. 691]), an annual business license tax is imposed upon 87 types of businesses under a variety of methods. These methods include flat fees, \u201cper unit\u201d fees, flat fees plus sums based upon the number of employees, and fees tied to gross receipts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only four businesses pay fees tied to gross receipts. Outdoor advertisers pay a maximum of $900 plus $150 for each $30,000 gross receipts or fraction thereof in excess of $75,000. (Alameda Municipal Code, \u00a7 13-195.) Drive-in theaters pay $45 for $20,000 or less of gross receipts, plus $2.25 for each $1,000 gross receipts or fraction thereof in excess of $20,000 <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 13-1938.) Only the remaining two, television subscription service businesses and businesses providing emergency communications systems or alarms, are subject to ordinance No. 1991. Those businesses are required to pay 3 percent of their gross receipts from Alameda subscription sales or fees. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-1951, 13-1952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Additionally, most businesses are permitted to pay \u201cin lieu\u201d license fees based upon gross receipts rather than the other fees set forth in the code. The \u201cin lieu\u201d tax schedule ranges from $0.30 per $1,000 to $2.25 per $1,000 <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13-1105.) Ten types of businesses are <em>excluded </em>from electing to pay \u201cin lieu\u201d fees: the four (including television subscription service businesses) whose license fees are tied to gross receipts and six others. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13-1102.) Of those six, five pay fees subject to a ceiling, the highest being $600. The sixth category, persons leasing hotels or office buildings, pays $4 per room.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">It is thus apparent that the two types of businesses subject to ordinance No. 1991 are taxed differently from any other business in the City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Not only is Premier taxed differently from the great majority of businesses, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>also taxed in a differentially more burdensome manner. For example, assuming annual gross receipts of approximately $210,000 as indicated by Premier, its business license tax for one year would be $6,300. Unlike Premier, most businesses are permitted to pay under the \u201cin lieu\u201d tax schedule. The maximum tax on $210,000 under that schedule would be $472.50 ($2.25 per $1,000 or less than one thirteenth of a 3 percent rate). Moreover, the businesses subject to ordinance No. 1991 also receive differentially burdensome treatment in comparison to the other businesses which are precluded from paying the \u201cin lieu\u201d tax.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lastly, while it is difficult to meaningfully compare rates imposed upon persons leasing hotel or office space with the treatment accorded Premier, it would require a hotel or office building of exceptional capacity (over 1,500 rooms) to generate the same level of tax revenue sought to be exacted from Premier.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Under the principles set forth in <em>Minneapolis Star, </em>the tax burden imposed upon Premier, a disseminator of protected speech, cannot stand unless that burden is necessary to achieve an overriding governmental interest. The only interest asserted to justify the differential tax burden is the generation of revenue. (See Section 3 of ordinance No. 1991, <em>ante, </em>fn. 1.) While that purpose is an interest critical to any government, it cannot, standing alone, justify special treatment of a segment of the media which disseminates protected speech when alternative means of achieving the same interest without implicating First Amendment concerns are available. <em>(Minneapolis Star </em>v. <em>Minnesota Comm. of Rev., supra, </em>460 U.S. 575, 586 [75 L.Ed.2d 295, 305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In an attempt to justify such differential treatment, City argues that a legitimate distinction can be drawn between businesses which may elect to be taxed under the optional \u201cin lieu\u201d schedule and those\u2014such as Premier\u2014 which may not. It contends that the former pay taxes and provide employment in the City of Alameda, while the latter do not. We remain unconvinced. Many of the business activities precluded from \u201cin lieu\u201d tax schedule treatment (e.g., outdoor advertisers, amusement parks and exhibitions, drive-in theaters, dance halls, handbill distributors and rental services) undoubtedly pay city property taxes and employ local residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The City has shown no adequate justification for the special treatment of television subscription service businesses. In <em>Minneapolis Star, </em>the Supreme Court observed that the State of Minnesota could have achieved its goal of raising revenue by simply taxing businesses generally (460 U.S. at p. 586 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>[75 L.Ed.2d at p. 305; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, supra, </em>455 U.S. 252 [generally applicable tax enforceable notwithstanding religious objections]). Here, although the City could have likewise achieved a similar objective by imposing a generally applicable tax on businesses,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Since the tax imposed by ordinance No. 1991 places a differential burden upon television subscription service businesses unjustified by any compelling interest of the City, that ordinance, as applied to Premier, violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In view of our determination, it is unnecessary to reach Premier\u2019s argument based upon state constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We modify the judgment to declare that ordinance No. 1991 is unconstitutional as applied to Premier and to enjoin its enforcement with respect to Premier only. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Elkington, J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 21, 1984, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 15, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> The full text of ordinance No. 1991 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>\u201cSection 1. </em>The Alameda Municipal Code is hereby amended by adding Section 13-111(s) to Article 1 and Sections 13-1951 and 13-1952 to Article 9 of Chapter 1, Title XIII, thereof, to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>\u201cSec. 13-111(s).

(460 U.S. at pp. 591-592 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 308-309].) Noting that no similar exemption existed for other small enterprises, the court held that \u201cto tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press presents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by Minnesota can justify the scheme.\u201d (460 U.S. at p. 592 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 309].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> Eight types of businesses pay a flat fee, the maximum being $600 per year.

Twenty-three types pay \u201cper unit\u201d fees (e.g., a certain amount per a certain number of employees, rooms, seats or mechanical devices). <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-191 to 13-193, 13-196 to 13-198, 13-1911, 13-1912, 13-1914, 13-1916, 13-1922, 13-1923, 13-1925, 13-1927, 13-1929, 13-1931, 13-1934, 13-1935, 13-1939, 13-1941 to 13-1943, 13-1950.) Illustrative of such fees are those based upon $45 for the first person employed; $9 for each of the next 9 employees; and $4.50 for each additional employee. Three types pay the greater of $75 or the amount derived from the $45/$9/$4.50 per employee formula. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-1915, 13-1917, 13-1930.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Forty-nine types of businesses pay a flat fee plus sums based upon the number of employees. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-194, 13-1924, 13-1933.) Forty-seven of these are professional or semiprofessional businesses. They pay a fee of $45,- $75, or $105, plus $15 per employee. Four additional types of businesses, including television subscription service businesses, pay a fee tied to gross receipts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Since the validity of ordinance No. 1991 as applied to businesses providing emergency communications systems or alarms is not before us, we express no views with respect to such issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> An outdoor advertiser with gross receipts of $210,000 would pay a license fee of $1,650 (a rate of less than 0.8 percent, approximately one-fourth of the rate imposed under ordinance No. 1991); a drive-in theater with such revenue would pay $472.50, substantially less than the advertiser.

The City of Corona\u2019s tax was nondiscriminatory and applied to all businesses conducted in the city. And to the extent that the City suggests that a tax cannot be struck down unless the enacting legislative body intended to censor speech, that contention has been squarely rejected in <em>Minneapolis Star. </em>(460 U.S. 575, 592-593 [75 L.Ed.2d 295, 309].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b157-16\"> While the rationale of our opinion would apply to any television subscription service business engaged in dissemination of speech protected by the First Amendment, the case before us involves only the specific business activities of Premier.

While it is true that the trial court concluded that ordinance No. 1991 violated the First Amendment due to differential treatment between television subscription service businesses which do not have a cable television franchise and those which do have such a franchise, we find it unnecessary to address those issues, having concluded for other reasons that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to Premier. It is the action of the lower court, not the reasons for its action, which we review. If right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, a judgment will be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion. <em>(D'Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal. 3d 1, 19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Additionally, we note that the propriety of franchise fees which the City requires of cable television businesses is in no way involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
